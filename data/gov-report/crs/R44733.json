The CFTC's mission is to prevent excessive speculation, manipulation of commodity prices, and fraud. The agency administers the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which was passed in 1936. Prior to the CFTC's creation, trading in agricultural commodities regulated by the CEA was overseen by the Commodity Exchange Administration, an office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture that also formed in 1936.", "The CFTC oversees industry self-regulatory organizations (SROs)\u2014such as the futures exchanges and the National Futures Association\u2014and requires the registration of a range of industry firms and personnel, including futures commission merchants (or brokers), floor traders, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) significantly expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction to include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, also called swaps. As a result of Dodd-Frank, major participants in the swaps markets must register with the CFTC, and certain swaps must be cleared by clearinghouses and traded on electronic trading platforms similar to exchanges. Newly regulated swap market participants include swap dealers, major swap participants, swap clearing organizations, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories. These entities are subject to new business conduct standards contained in the statute or promulgated as CFTC rules. Similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the CFTC generally does not regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for which it was instructed to set up capital standards pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Although most derivatives trading in today's market relates to financial variables (e.g., interest rates, currency prices, and stock indexes), congressional oversight remains vested in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in part because of the market's historical origins in agricultural commerce.

This view was reiterated in the former President's FY2017 budget request, which stated that \"rules are meaningless without the resources available to implement and enforce them.

In economics, an externality refers to a consequence of an economic activity that is experienced by unrelated third parties; it can be either positive or negative. Pollution is often used as an example of a negative externality, in which the effects may be widely dissipated and hard to quantify. Risks to the financial system could be another example of a negative externality. ", "Quantifications of such externalities may involve judgments or estimates as to the value of intangible or speculative benefits that might be experienced differently by individuals, such as the value of financial stability, or, in the case of pollution, the value of avoiding certain diseases. In the realm of financial regulation, benefits are often widely dissipated (e.g., prospective investors broadly benefit from fuller and more accurate corporate disclosures and investor-related protections), and are sometimes speculative (e.g., trying to measure the benefit of avoiding potential financial fraud). This, according to critics, can make benefits harder to reliably quantify. Costs of compliance, meanwhile, may be more easily measurable (e.g., through payment-hours for accountants, lawyers, and staff)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Valuable Is Cost-Benefit Analysis?", "paragraphs": ["Proponents of cost-benefit analysis argue that it can force agencies to focus on and clarify the benefits of their proposed rulemakings and better weigh the costs they will impose against those benefits.

", "By contrast, some administrative law scholars have argued that the increased use of cost-benefit analysis has \"ossified\" the rulemaking process, slowing down the process or causing agencies to issue guidance documents rather than regulations, thereby avoiding rulemaking requirements altogether. Ossified rulemaking could lead to beneficial regulation being blocked or delayed. Some financial reform advocates argue that, particularly for financial rulemakings, costs can be easier to quantify than widely dispersed potential benefits (such as \"a safer financial system\" or \"better investor disclosure\"), and that this may lead to an overstatement of costs over benefits. Finally, critics argue that the practice opens the agency's rules to court challenges by industry groups on the grounds of inadequate cost-benefit analysis, tying up agency resources and at times leading to the invalidation of potentially beneficial regulations.

This change could potentially enable more types of trades to be permitted under this bona fide hedging definition, in which case more trades would not count toward restrictions on position size for futures, options, and swaps or toward the registration requirements for swap dealers. The CFTC considered somewhat similar industry proposals for a broadening of the definition of economically appropriate risks in their December 30, 2016, position limits rule reproposal, which requested the agency", "consider as economically appropriate any derivative position that a business can reasonably demonstrate reduces or mitigates one or more specific, identifiable risks related to individual or aggregated positions or transactions, based on its own business judgment and risk management policies, whether risk is managed enterprise-wide or by legal entity, line of business, or profit center.", "However, in their 2016 position limits rule reproposal, the CFTC opted against such changes, explaining, among other things, that it \"would permit an enterprise to cherry pick cash market exposures to justify exceeding position limits, with either a long or short derivative position, even though such derivative position increases the enterprise's risk.\" The comment period closed February 28, 2017, for the reproposed rule, and a number of industry associations complained in comment letters that the reproposed rule was too restrictive in its view of bona fide hedging. Since then, the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight on August 10, 2017, issued a no-action letter providing time-limited relief from certain aspects of the aggregation requirements for position limits. Aggregation requirements involve the degree to which an individual or entity is required to aggregate together all of their trading positions for the purposes of meeting position limits.

For another, the total notional value of swaps traded in a jurisdiction fluctuates over time, so how the 12-month period was drawn likely would impact the results. Further, regulators would have to determine \"where\" a swap is traded\u2014that is, in whose jurisdiction it would fall\u2014when a large portion of the market is considered \"cross-border\" in nature. This is essentially the same problem U.S. regulators face in deciding when a swap qualifies as a \"U.S. transaction.\" ", "Under H.R. 238 , if the CFTC were not to make such a determination (of noncomparability), then \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons shall be exempt from United States swaps requirements\" as long as it is in compliance with any of the eight permitted foreign jurisdictions. Effectively, the bill appears to substitute as a default, for trades that involved a non-U.S. person, the swaps requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets (which would encompass most of the world of swaps trading, particularly if countries in the European Union were treated as one swaps jurisdiction) for U.S. requirements\u2014unless the CFTC found a foreign jurisdiction to be lacking. ", "One question that would presumably be left to the CFTC to determine in a rulemaking would be how widely to apply this provision to \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons,\" were the provision enacted. For instance, would any swap in which a non-U.S. person was at least one counterparty potentially be encompassed? If so, that would potentially encompass a large majority of swaps, the bulk of which appear to be transacted in some way between a U.S. and a non-U.S. person. H.R. 238 would presumably leave it to the regulator to interpret and clarify the application of this provision. ", "Section 312 also includes a definition of a U.S. person, which, among other factors, includes \"any other person as the Commission may further define to more effectively carry out the purposes of this section\"\u2014thereby apparently giving the CFTC some leeway. However, Section 312 would also specify that, in developing its cross-border rules, the CFTC \"shall not take into account, for the purposes of determining the applicability of United States swaps requirements, the location of personnel that arrange, negotiate, or execute swaps.\" This requirement drew some criticism in the 114 th Congress congressional debate over H.R. 2289 .", "The provision would appear to overturn CFTC Advisory 13-69, which drew much industry opposition. The advisory was aimed at resolving questions regarding the precise conditions in which swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. persons would be subject to Dodd-Frank requirements. The advisory, which technically represented the opinion of only one division of the CFTC, held that the Dodd-Frank requirements would apply to a swap between a non-U.S. swap dealer\u2014even if it were an affiliate of a U.S. swap dealer\u2014and a non-U.S. person, as long as the foreign swap dealer used \"personnel or agents located in the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute such swap.\" The CFTC has delayed the advisory's actual implementation several times.

H.R. 238 would essentially codify the deadline for FCMs to deposit any capital to cover residual interest as no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the following business day. This move is broadly in line with the CFTC's March 17, 2015, final rule on residual interest.", "The CFTC's Regulation 1.22 sets the deadline for posting residual interest. That deadline then affects when customers are required to post their collateral to cover insufficient margin amounts. Regulation 1.22 provided that the deadline, set for 6:00 p.m. on the following day, would automatically become earlier in several years, barring further CFTC action. The CFTC's final rule on March 17, 2015, amended Regulation 1.22 so that the FCM's deadline to post residual interest would not become earlier than 6:00 p.m. the following day without an affirmative CFTC action or rulemaking that included an opportunity for public comment. ", "Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad noted in a statement on the CFTC rule that an earlier deadline could help to ensure that FCMs always held sufficient margin and did not use one customer's margin to support another customer's. But such a practice also could impose costs on customers who must deliver margin sooner. The March 17, 2015, final rule included a plan for the CFTC to conduct a study of how well the current rule and deadline function, the practicability of changing the deadline, and the costs and benefits of any change. In May 2016, the CFTC published its study, recommending that no change to the residual interest deadline be made. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
