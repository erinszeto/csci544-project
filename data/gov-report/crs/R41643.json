Although TB is curable, more than 1 million TB-related deaths occur each year. Due in part to a growing global response to TB, progress has been made in combating the disease. Globally, new TB infection rates have begun to slowly decline and TB mortality rates have decreased significantly since 1990. At the same time, absolute numbers of people infected with TB, particularly in Asia and Africa, continue to rise. Congress has recognized TB as an important humanitarian issue and increasingly as a potential threat to global security. In its second session, the 112th Congress will likely debate the appropriate funding levels and optimum strategy for addressing the continued challenge of global TB.", "Congress has enacted several key pieces of legislation related to the prevention, treatment, and care of people with TB around the world. These include the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-264); the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-25); and the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-293). These acts have authorized funds to be used in the fight against global TB and have recommended priority areas for the use of these funds.", "From FY2004 to FY2007, U.S. spending for global TB remained at around $90 million per fiscal year. TB received new attention as a critical issue in May 2007, when a man known to be carrying a drug-resistant form of the disease was able to cross several international borders, putting dozens of others at risk of infection. In response to this event and to growing recognition of the global threat posed by TB, congressional funding for global TB began to increase significantly in FY2008, when Congress provided $163.1 million to USAID for its TB programs and directed the State Department to spend at least $150 million of funds for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) on joint HIV/TB programs. Funding for global TB saw steady increases from FY2008 to FY2010 and has seen small fluctuations since.", "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. agency in global TB control and oversees bilateral programs in over 40 countries. The United States works closely with a range of multilateral partners in responding to global TB, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund), the largest external donor for TB. National governments play a critical role in responding to TB, and domestic government expenditures account for the majority of global TB funding.", "Several key issues threaten global control of TB. First, HIV/TB co-infection, particularly in Africa, is a growing challenge. TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, and TB control is significantly impeded in areas with high HIV prevalence. Second, drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), are more difficult and expensive to treat, leading to greater TB-related mortality. Finally, the methods currently used for both TB diagnosis and treatment are antiquated and have varying degrees of success, particularly in the face of HIV/TB co-infection and drug-resistant TB. This report outlines basic facts related to global TB, including characteristics of the epidemic and U.S. legislation, programs, funding, and partnerships related to the global response to TB.

TB most often affects the lungs, but it can also affect the brain, kidneys, or spine. The disease is passed when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or spits and another person inhales the infected air. Individuals infected with TB can have latent TB infection or active TB disease. Those with latent TB infection do not exhibit symptoms and cannot spread the infection to others, whereas those with active TB disease exhibit a range of symptoms and are contagious. Without treatment, individuals with active TB will infect an average of 10-15 people each year and can ultimately die from the disease.

It is estimated that each year an average of 9 million people are infected with active TB disease. In 2010, there were an estimated 8.8 million new cases of TB worldwide, including roughly 1.1 million new TB patients who were also infected with HIV.

Global TB mortality has fallen by more than one-third since 1990 levels.", "Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to the two most powerful first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB significantly challenges TB control efforts, as it is more difficult to cure and may lead to high TB-related death rates. TB drug resistance is due to poor treatment adherence or incorrect drug usage. In 2010, there were an estimated 650,000 cases of MDR-TB among the world's 12 million prevalent cases of TB. Twenty-seven countries, known as high MDR-TB burden countries, account for the vast majority of all MDR-TB cases.

XDR-TB is more difficult to diagnosis and treat than either drug-susceptible TB or MDR-TB. In low-resource settings, XDR-TB is often fatal. As of July 2010, 58 countries and territories had reported at least one case of XDR-TB. XDR strains of TB are likely under-diagnosed due to weak laboratory capacity to test for second-line drug resistance.

Twenty-two high-burden countries (HBCs) are home to the highest absolute number of TB cases and account for 81% of all TB around the world. In 2010, the five countries with the largest number of new TB cases were India, China, South Africa, Indonesia, and Pakistan.

The central component of the Stop TB Strategy is the use of DOTS to diagnose and treat TB. The Stop TB Strategy has six focus areas:", "pursue high-quality DOTS expansion and enhancement; address TB/HIV, MDR-TB, and the needs of poor and vulnerable populations; contribute to health system strengthening based on primary health care; engage all care providers; empower people with TB, and communities through partnerships; and enable and promote research.", "WHO's strategy has been widely adopted by national TB control programs and their partners.

The act recommended that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary U.S. agency responsible for global TB programs, coordinate with WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) toward the goal of controlling TB, and put forth the following targets for countries with USAID TB programs, to be met by December 31, 2010: detect at least 70% of infectious TB cases, and cure at least 85% of detected cases. On May 27, 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act, P.L. 108-25 ). The act authorized $15 billion to be spent on global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs over five years, though it did not authorize a specific funding amount for bilateral TB programs. The act outlined congressional priorities for tackling TB from FY2004 through FY2008 and put forth the following goals: detect at least 70% of infectious TB cases in high-burden countries (HBCs) by December 31, 2005, and in all countries with USAID TB programs by December 31, 2010; and cure at least 85% of detected cases in HBCs by December 31, 2005, and in all countries with USAID TB programs by December 31, 2010. The act mandated that U.S. global TB assistance prioritize DOTS coverage and spend at least 75% of global TB funding on TB medicines, supplies, direct patient services, and training in diagnosis and treatment for DOTS coverage and treatment of MDR-TB using DOTS-Plus, including funding for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility (see \" Key Partners in the Response to Global\u00a0Tuberculosis \").

It is responsible for shaping the global health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring global health trends. Examples of WHO activities related to TB include the following: The Stop TB Partnership: The Stop TB Partnership (originally the Stop TB Initiative) was established in 1998 and comprises a network of international organizations, donor governments, and private sector and non-governmental organizations working to eliminate TB. The Stop TB Partnership is responsible for developing the \"Global Plan to Stop TB.\" The United States is a member of the Stop TB Partnership. Global Drug Facility (GDF ) : GDF, housed in WHO and managed by a small team in the Stop TB Partnership Secretariat, is a financing mechanism that provides technical assistance in the management and surveillance of TB drug use, as well as procurement of high-quality anti-TB drugs at a relatively low price. Countries can purchase TB treatments directly from GDF at prices below market value or apply for grants to purchase first-line treatments. GDF also works with grantees to estimate drug needs for the next year of GDF support. Green Light Committee (GLC): GLC was set up by WHO in 2000 to support countries in the fight against MDR-TB. GLC is composed of the CDC, International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Medical Research Council of South Africa, National Tuberculosis Programs of Estonia and Latvia, Partners in Health, and WHO. The committee reviews requests for second-line TB treatments through DOTS-Plus projects and determines whether it can provide the medication in compliance with international standards of care. Programs that receive GLC approval are eligible to purchase these drugs through a GLC-pooled procurement mechanism at discounted prices. The Global Fund: The Global Fund was established in 2002 as a public-private partnership to provide significant financial support for global responses to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The United States contributes more to the Global Fund than any other donor. The Global Fund has committed over $22.6 billion in grants in 150 countries since it was established.

TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, and TB control is significantly impeded in areas with high HIV prevalence. Nonetheless, rates of TB testing among HIV patients and provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to co-infected individuals remain low. Some advocates call for increased U.S. support for TB/HIV services through PEPFAR and for the establishment of specific targets related to TB/HIV co-infection. Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) and Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB): Drug resistant forms of TB are threatening progress in TB control. Limited laboratory and trained health personnel, along with an insufficient supply of second-line anti-TB drugs, make it difficult to properly diagnose and treat MDR/XDR-TB patients. Treatment for drug resistant-TB is more time intensive, toxic, and expensive, and is less easily available and effective than treatment for non-resistant TB, especially for those with HIV. Global health experts have debated how to best address the issue of drug resistant TB, including whether more funds should be used to specifically address MDR-TB, particularly in countries with limited resources. Research and Development: Many of the tools used for TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are antiquated and have limited success rates. While there is a vaccine for TB, it provides unreliable protection for adults and has had little impact on the epidemic. The tool used to diagnose TB is over a century old and is often ineffective, especially for people with HIV. TB treatments for drug-resistant TB are costly, time intensive, and can be toxic.
