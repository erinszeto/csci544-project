With the exception of Cuba and Haiti, regular elections in the region are the norm, and for the most part have been free and fair. Nevertheless, while many Caribbean nations have long democratic traditions, they are not immune to threats to their political stability, including terrorism. Many nations in the region experienced economic decline in 2001-2002 due to downturns in the tourism and agriculture sectors. Most Caribbean economies have rebounded since 2003, although the extensive damage resulting from several storms in 2004 caused economic difficulties for several countries.", "U.S. interests in the Caribbean are diverse, and include economic, political, and security concerns.

U.S. aid supports a variety of projects to strengthen democracy, promote economic growth and development, alleviate poverty, and combat the AIDS epidemic in the region. In the aftermath of several devastating storms in 2004, Congress approved $100 million in emergency supplemental funding (P.L. 108-324) to support humanitarian efforts and reconstruction in Haiti, Grenada, and Jamaica. Despite close U.S. relations with most Caribbean nations, there has been tension at times in the relationship. For example, relations with Caribbean nations became strained in the aftermath of the departure of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide from power in February 2004.

Many countries in the region share a common African ethnic and British colonial heritage, while Cuba and the Dominican Republic were Spanish colonies, Haiti was French, and Suriname was Dutch. The dates of independence of these countries range from Haiti in 1804 to St. Kitts and Nevis in 1983. The largest nations in terms of land area are Guyana and Suriname, while those with the largest populations are Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. The island nations of the Eastern Caribbean are among the smallest countries in the world.

CARICOM was formed in 1973 to spur regional economic integration. Some critics argue that it has been slow to promote integration, compared to other regional economic groupings, but progress has been made in moving toward a single economic market and in establishing a Caribbean Court of Justice. In addition to CARICOM, six Eastern Caribbean nations are members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), the subregional organization designed to stimulate economic integration and foreign policy harmonization. The six OECS nations also share a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, with monetary policy managed by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.

Guyana was scheduled to have presidential elections before the constitutional deadline of August 4, 2006, but the Guyana Elections Commission decided in April to postpone the elections in order to provide more time to improve the accuracy of the electoral register. Successful elections ultimately were held on August 28, 2006, without the political violence that some observers had anticipated.

In 1993, stability on St. Kitts was threatened following violent protests after disputed elections; order was restored with the assistance of security forces from neighboring states. In 1990, the government of Trinidad and Tobago was endangered by a coup attempt by a radical Muslim sect. Earlier in the 1980s, the government of Eugenia Charles in Dominica was threatened by a bizarre coup plot involving foreign mercenaries. And of course, Grenada, under the socialist-oriented government of Maurice Bishop, experienced a break from the democratic norm after it assumed power in a nearly bloodless coup in 1979 and installed a people's revolutionary government. After the violent overthrow and murder of Bishop in 1983, the United States intervened to restore order and end the Cuban presence on the island.", "Many Caribbean nations experienced an economic slump in 2001-2002 due to downturns in the tourism and agriculture sectors, although most Caribbean economies have rebounded since 2003. Countries that depend on tourism were hurt by the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and the subsequent U.S. economic recession and sluggish recovery. The banana and sugar sectors in the Eastern Caribbean were damaged by a tropical storm in 2002 and a drought in 2003. Both sectors face uncertain futures in light of the European Union's plan to phase out preferred market access from former Caribbean colonies for bananas by 2006 and for sugar by 2009. The Haitian economy experienced decline beginning in 2001, with political instability exacerbating already difficult economic conditions in the hemisphere's poorest nation. The strongest performing economies in recent years have been those of the Dominican Republic, fueled by the apparel sector, and Trinidad and Tobago, with substantial energy resources. In 2003, however, the Dominican economy experienced a decline in economic growth due to the financial strains caused by the collapse of one of the largest domestic banks.", "In 2004 and 2005, the region's strongest economic performers averaging growth rates over 5% for those two years, were Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Those countries not faring well in 2004 because of devastating hurricanes and tropical storms included Haiti, with a 3.5%% decline in gross domestic product (GDP), and Grenada, with a GDP decline of 3%. For 2005, however, Grenada's economy rebounded with growth over 5%, while Haiti's growth was 1.8%. In Guyana, economic growth has been stagnant or minimal over the past several years. In 2005, the economy declined 3% because of high oil prices and floods, which early in the year severely affected agriculture and mining activities.", "Overall, concern that rising oil prices could cause an economic setback for some countries has been alleviated to some extent by Venezuela's new subsidized oil program for Caribbean countries known as PetroCaribe.

U.S. policy priorities shifted from one emphasizing security concerns to a new focus on strengthened economic relations through trade and investment. Today, in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, security concerns have re-emerged as a major U.S. interest in the Caribbean.

Americans do not presently need a passport to travel to several Caribbean islands. For example, in 2005, some 50% of Americans traveling to Jamaica did not have a passport. Caribbean governments also argue that a majority of tourism revenues are derived from tourists arriving by air and maintain that the recent changes in U.S. law providing for a different deadline for sea travel was done to appease cruise ship carriers.", "A controversial issue in U.S. relations with the Caribbean has been a World Trade Organization (WTO) complaint filed by Antigua and Barbuda challenging U.S. restrictions on cross-border Internet gambling. Antigua, which has invested in Internet gambling as a means of diversifying its economy, maintains that it has lost millions of dollars because of the U.S. restrictions. In July 2006, the WTO established a dispute resolution panel to determine whether the United States had complied with a 2005 WTO ruling that backed Antigua's claim that the U.S. restrictions violate the United States' market access commitments under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Antigua maintains that the United States has taken no action to comply with the previous ruling. In September 2006, Congress approved legislation to crack down on unlawful Internet gambling ( P.L. 109-347 , Title VIII, H.R. 4954 ).

The Administration is hoping that an elected government will support the development of functioning institutions and infrastructure and a reduction in violence that will help realize such as goals as improving the human rights situation, reducing poverty, and decreasing narcotics trafficking.

The Bush Administration has essentially continued this policy, although it has further tightened economic sanctions, especially on travel. Another component of U.S. policy consists of support measures for the Cuban people, including private humanitarian donations, U.S.-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba, and U.S. funding to support democracy and human rights. U.S. immigration policy toward Cuban migrants has been described as a \"wet foot/dry foot policy,\" with the U.S. Coast Guard interdicting Cuban migrants at sea and returning them to Cuba, while those Cubans who reach shore are generally allowed to apply for permanent resident status.

U.S. assistance to the region in the 1980s amounted to about $3.2 billion, with most concentrated in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. An aid program for the Eastern Caribbean also provided considerable assistance, especially in the aftermath of the 1983 U.S.-led military intervention in Grenada. In the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Caribbean nations declined to about $2 billion, or an annual average of $205 million. Haiti was the largest recipient of assistance during this period, receiving about $1.1 billion in assistance or 54% of the total. Jamaica was the second largest U.S. aid recipient in the 1990s, receiving about $507 million, almost 25% of the total, while the Dominican Republic received about $352 million, about 17% of the total. Eastern Caribbean nations received about $178 million in assistance, almost 9% of the total. The bulk of U.S. assistance was economic assistance, including Development Assistance, Economic Support Funds, and P.L. 480 food aid. Military assistance to the region amounted to less than $60 million during the 1990s.", "Since FY2000, U.S. aid to the Caribbean region (including FY2006 aid estimates) has amounted to almost $1.6 billion, because of increased HIV/AIDS assistance to the region (especially to Guyana and Haiti), disaster and reconstruction assistance in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms in 2004, and increased support for the interim government in Haiti following the departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power. Haiti accounted for some 51% of assistance to the Caribbean region during this period. As in the 1990s, the bulk of assistance to the region consisted of economic assistance. With regard to hurricane disaster assistance, Congress appropriated $100 million in October 2004 in emergency assistance for Caribbean nations ( P.L. 108-324 ), with $42 million for Grenada, $38 million for Haiti, $18 million for Jamaica, and $2 million for other countries affected by the storms. Overall assistance to the Caribbean amounted to $393 million in FY2005 and an estimated $306 million in FY2006 (see Table 5 ).", "For FY2007, the Administration has requested about $322 million in assistance for the Caribbean, with about $198 million or almost 62% of the total for Haiti, $35 million for the Dominican Republic, $31 million for Guyana, and almost $17 million for Jamaica. Assistance to the small nations of the Eastern Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) is provided through USAID's Caribbean Regional program, which also funds some region-wide projects; for FY2007, the Administration requested $11.6 million for the program. The Eastern Caribbean would also receive about $1.5 million in military assistance and $3.2 million to support a Peace Corps presence. The request of $3 million for the \"Third Border Initiative\" (TBI) would fund regional projects for the 14-nation Caribbean Community (CARICOM) plus the Dominican Republic that focus on improving travel and border security in the region, disaster preparedness, and greater business competitiveness. A request of $4 million for Operation Enduring Friendship, a military assistance program, would support efforts to increase maritime security in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. (See Tables 5 and 6 ).", "Looking ahead to future years, several Caribbean nations are potential recipients for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) assistance, an initiative to target foreign assistance to countries with strong records of performance in the areas of governance, economic policy, and investment in people. Although Haiti and Guyana have been candidate countries potentially eligible for MCA funds since FY2004 (because of low per capita income levels), neither country has been approved to participate in the program because they have not met MCA performance criteria. Guyana, however, was designated an MCA threshold country for FY2005 and FY2006 and could be approved in future years for MCA funding. In FY2006, the per capita income level for MCA-eligibility increased to $3,255 or below, and as a result, three additional Caribbean countries\u2014the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname\u2014became potentially eligible for MCA funding but ultimately were not approved for participation. For FY2007, the same five Caribbean countries\u2014Haiti, Guyana, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname\u2014are listed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) as potential candidates for MCA funding. (For additional information see CRS Report RL32427, Millennium Challenge Account , by [author name scrubbed].)", "One obstacle in the provision of U.S. military assistance to the Caribbean has been that several Caribbean nations that are parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) have not signed agreements to exempt Americans from ICC prosecution, so-called \"Article 98 agreements.\" Pursuant to the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA, P.L. 107-206 , title II), U.S. military assistance is prohibited to countries that are parties to the ICC and do not have Article 98 agreements. In July 2003, the Administration announced the termination of military assistance to six Caribbean nations: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Subsequently, Antigua and Barbuda signed an Article 98 agreement in September 2003; Belize signed one in December 2003; and Dominica signed one in May 2004. This leaves Barbados, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago as the three Caribbean countries forgoing U.S. military assistance because of the ASPA sanction. Trinidad and Tobago, which played a leading role in the establishment of the ICC, has strongly resisted signing an agreement, as has Barbados.

In addition, two Caribbean nations\u2014Jamaica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines\u2014are large producers and exporters of marijuana. Of the 16 countries in the Caribbean region, President Bush in September 2006 designated four of them as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries pursuant to annual legislative drug certification requirements: the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The President urged the new government in Haiti to strengthen law enforcement and the judiciary to bring drug trafficking and crime under control.", "All four designated Caribbean countries are major transit countries for illicit drugs to the U.S. market, and Jamaica is the largest marijuana producer and exporter in the Caribbean. The Bahamas cooperates extensively with the United States on counternarcotics measures, including interdiction efforts through Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a multinational interdiction effort, and efforts that target Bahamian drug trafficking organizations. The Dominican Republic, a major transit country for both cocaine and heroin, cooperates closely with the United States, although the State Department's March 2006 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report notes that \"corruption and weak governmental institutions remained an impediment to controlling the flow of illegal narcotics\" through the country. Jamaican cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies on counternarcotics efforts is described by the State Department report as excellent in most cases, although it maintains that the government needs to further intensify its law enforcement efforts and enhance international cooperation. In Haiti, anti-drug efforts have been hampered over the years by weak institutions, poor economic conditions, and political instability. Under the interim government, the country's continued economic and political crises resulted in little attention to counternarcotics efforts, according to the State Department, but a new Director General of the Haitian National Police reportedly has worked to combat drug-related crime and police corruption.", "Many other Caribbean nations, while not designated major transit countries, are still vulnerable to drug trafficking and associated crimes because of their geographic location. In particular, the State Department's March 2006 report maintains that such crimes have the potential to threaten the stability of the small states of the Eastern Caribbean, and to varying degrees, have damaged civil society in some of these countries. Given the poor outlook for the banana industry in the Caribbean, some observers believe that it will be difficult to contain marijuana production unless there is adequate support to diversify these economies away from banana production. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the largest marijuana producer in the Eastern Caribbean.", "Efforts to crack down on money laundering also constitute a major component of U.S. anti-drug strategy, and became increasingly important as a counter-terrorist strategy in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. The State Department's list of major money laundering countries (also categorized as \"jurisdictions of primary concern\") includes six Caribbean countries\u2014Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis\u2014and one British Caribbean dependency, the Cayman Islands. The Department of State maintains that although Antigua and Barbuda has comprehensive legislation to regulate its financial sector, the country remains vulnerable to money laundering because the sector is loosely regulated and because of its Internet gaming industry. The Bahamas has enacted strong anti-money laundering laws that has made it difficult for drug traffickers to deposit large amounts of cash; as a result, traffickers have begun storing large quantities of cash in safe houses, purchasing real estate, vehicles, and jewelry, and processing money through legitimate businesses and shell companies. In Belize, money laundering is believed to occur primarily in the country's growing offshore financial center. Money laundering in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti stem from their roles as major drug transhipment points. In the Dominican Republic, financial institutions engage in transactions with money derived from illegal drug sales in the United States, with courier and wire transfers the primary methods for moving the funds. St. Kitts and Nevis, according to the State Department, is at major risk for corruption and money laundering because of the high volume of narcotics being trafficked through the country and because of the presence of known traffickers on the islands.", "The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an inter-governmental body with the objective of combating money laundering and terrorist financing, has published a list of non-cooperative countries and territories in the fight against money laundering since 2000. The FATF evaluative process has been a major factor in Caribbean countries improving their anti-money laundering regimes. Four Caribbean nations and one dependent territory were on the first FATF non-cooperative list issued in 2000: the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Grenada was added to the list in September 2001. Subsequent actions by all these nations to improve their anti-money laundering regimes resulted in all of them being removed from the list by June 2003. The Bahamas and the Cayman Islands were removed from the list in June 2001; St. Kitts and Nevis in June 2002; Dominica in October 2002; Grenada in February 2003; and St. Vincent in June 2003. Once a nation is removed from the list, the FATF continues to monitor developments in the country to ensure compliance.", "Some Caribbean officials and others have complained that pressure to strengthen and enforce anti-money laundering regimes in the region will have a detrimental effect on its offshore financial sectors. They maintain that the anti-money laundering measures required have been indiscriminate and constitute an attack on legitimate business conducted in the small financial sectors of the region. In particular, after the U.S. congressional passage of new anti-money laundering provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 , Title III), approved in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, some feared that the stricter scrutiny of transactions between U.S. and Caribbean financial institutions would threaten the offshore financial industry in the Caribbean. The act's anti-money laundering provisions include a prohibition on U.S. correspondent accounts with shell banks (banks that have no physical presence in the chartering country) and tighter bank record keeping requirements.", "Some observers maintain that the strengthening of anti-money laundering regimes in the Caribbean will have the end result of increasing the attractiveness of the region's offshore financial sectors for legitimate business transactions. According to this view, such efforts as the FATF evaluative process and the newer anti-money laundering measures under the PATRIOT Act will help change the reputation of the Caribbean as being a haven for money launderers and tax evaders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade Issues", "paragraphs": ["The United States has offered a one way duty-free preferential trade arrangement for a wide range of products from Caribbean Basin nations since the early 1980s as an incentive for increased investment and export production in the region.

The CBERA allowed duty-free importation of many categories of products with certain exceptions. Most apparel and textile goods were ineligible under the CBERA, but in the late 1980s imports of apparel from CBERA countries that were assembled from U.S. components were eligible for reduced duties. These production-sharing arrangements boosted the apparel sectors of several Caribbean Basin countries, including most significantly the Dominican Republic. In 1990, Congress enacted so-called CBI II legislation, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-382 , Title II), that enhanced the benefits of CBERA and made its provisions permanent.", "Congress approved the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) ( P.L. 106-200 , Title II) in 2000, which expanded preferential tariff treatment for Caribbean Basin nations, providing them with NAFTA-like tariff treatment.

Overall U.S. imports from the Caribbean (not including Central America) amounted to about $4.8 billion in 1984 and to about $14.5 billion in 2005, an increase of about $9.7 billion. The Dominican Republic accounted for $3.6 billion of the increase. Trinidad and Tobago, an oil and gas exporter, increased its exports destined for the United States from $1.4 billion in 1984 to about $7.9 billion in 2005. For other Caribbean nations, however, such as Haiti and the Bahamas, overall exports to the United States have declined or been stagnant since the early 1980s. Bahamian exports to the United States fell when the country's oil refinery closed in 1985; the country's economy remains based on tourism and financial services.", "U.S. exports to the Caribbean region (including agricultural exports to Cuba, which have been allowed since late 2001 ) rose from $8.9 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2005 (see Table 4 ).
