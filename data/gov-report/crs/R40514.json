Another common type of instructional assessment is progress monitoring.

In reality, the line between a formative assessment and a summative assessment is less clear. Depending on how the results of an assessment are used, it is possible that one assessment could be designed to serve both formative and summative functions. The distinction, therefore, between formative and summative assessments often is the manner in which the results are used. If an assessment has been designed so that results can inform future decision making processes in curriculum, instruction, or policy, the assessment is being used in a formative manner (i.e., for instructional, predictive, and diagnostic purposes).

That said, it is reasonably clear that there is not universal agreement over what constitutes a \"formative assessment\" in the field of education. It seems that teachers, administrators, policymakers, and test publishers use the term \"formative assessment\" to cover a broad range of assessments, from small-scale classroom assessments that track the learning of individual students to large-scale benchmark assessments that track the progress of a whole school or district to determine if they will meet certain policy goals. The confusion over exactly \"What is formative assessment?\" has led some in the testing industry to avoid the term altogether and others to offer alternative names for certain types of formative assessment. In this section, various types of assessments that have been described as formative assessments will be discussed, including classroom, interim, and benchmark assessments.", "Formative assessments are often used in the classroom. They can be as informal as teacher questioning strategies or as formal as written examinations. Teachers use formative assessments for both instructional and predictive purposes. The results of formative assessment can be used to determine deficits in a student's knowledge and to adjust instruction accordingly. Teachers may adjust their instruction by changing the pace of instruction, changing the method of delivery, or repeating previously taught content. After these adjustments, teachers may administer another assessment to determine if students are learning as expected. The process of administering assessments, providing feedback to the student, adjusting instruction, and re-administering assessments is what makes the assessment \"formative.\"", "Perhaps in response to the apparent success of formative assessment at the classroom level, test publishers began promoting commercial formative assessment products in the form of interim assessments and benchmark assessments. Some testing experts believe that referring to interim and benchmark assessments as \"formative\" is inaccurate, but others believe that these assessments can be used in a formative way to determine how school or district practices need to change in order to meet policy goals. The latter position considers the use of interim or benchmark assessments as formative assessments at the school or district level as opposed to the classroom level. Instead of adjusting teaching practices to increase student learning, this type of formative assessment would require adjusting school or district practices to increase student achievement across the board. Interim and benchmark assessments can track the progress of students, schools, and districts toward meeting predetermined policy goals. For example, schools and districts have used benchmark assessments to determine if they are on-track to meet AYP goals as defined by NCLB.", "The term \"interim assessment\" has been suggested to characterize assessments that fall between those which are purely formative and summative assessments. Under this characterization, interim assessments are assessments used to track student achievement and to inform decisions at the classroom, school, or district level. Interim assessments can report on student achievement at the individual level or in the aggregate. The content and timing of the assessment is usually determined by the school or district, not the teacher, making it a less flexible classroom tool than a teacher-controlled, classroom-level formative assessment. Interim assessments can be used to inform classroom practice, but because teachers have less control over timing and content, the true value of interim assessment may lie at the school or district level. These assessments are usually used for predictive purposes\u2014to determine whether a student, school, or district is likely to succeed on a later summative assessment and to identify those students who may need more intensive instruction. Another use of interim assessment may be to evaluate a short-term instructional program or a small aspect of the overall curriculum.", "A benchmark assessment is a type of interim assessment that is widely used in schools and districts. Like other types of interim assessment, benchmark assessments are primarily used to predict the likelihood of success on a later summative assessment and to identify those students who may need more intensive instruction.

Some forms of summative assessment are considered \"high-stakes\" assessments because they have rewards and consequences attached to performance. For example, some states require students to pass high-stakes high school exit exams or end of course exams in order to graduate. Furthermore, under NCLB, all states used high-stakes assessments used to determine AYP. Although in this instance, the assessments have high stakes for schools and school districts, not for individual students.", "Not all summative assessments have high-stakes school or district consequences attached to the results.

In order for teachers and school administrators to use formative assessment to increase student achievement and predict outcomes on summative assessments, the two types of assessment must be closely aligned in terms of the test content and goals. One way to measure whether the assessments are in alignment is to determine the ability of a formative assessment to predict achievement on a summative assessment (i.e., determine predictive validity).", "The REL Mid-Atlantic conducted an analysis of the predictive validity of benchmark assessments. This analysis looked at the extent to which common, commercially developed benchmark assessments predicted performance on state assessments in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. A review of four common assessments found that only one of these benchmark assessments showed strong evidence of predictive validity with state assessments. Moreover, none of the benchmark assessments demonstrated evidence of predictive validity for state assessments in Maryland and New Jersey. The ability of benchmark assessments to predict later performance on state assessments, therefore, seems to depend heavily on the benchmark assessment used and the state in which the assessment takes place. If this pattern is indicative of national use of benchmark assessments, there is evidence to suggest that these benchmarks are not serving a formative function within a comprehensive assessment system. Without having a strong predictive relationship between benchmark assessments and state assessments, school and district personnel may be unable to use the information from the benchmark assessment to predict future achievement on summative assessments, such as state assessments used in accountability systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scores: How are Assessment Results Reported?", "paragraphs": ["Test scores are reported in a variety of ways.

Comparisons are made using two statistical properties of the normative sample: the mean and the standard deviation.", "NRTs produce raw scores that are transformed into standard scores using calculations involving the mean and standard deviation. The standard score is used to report how a student performed relative to peers. Standard scores are often reported as percentiles because they are relatively easy for parents and educators to interpret, but there are many other types of standard scores that may be reported (e.g., z-scores, scale scores, or T-scores).", "Commercially available cognitive and achievement tests are often norm-referenced. For example, the Stanford Achievement Test Series (SAT10) is an NRT and was used in a national evaluation of the Reading First program. Language proficiency tests used to identify students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), such as the IPT Family of Tests, are NRTs. Tests to measure cognitive ability of students with disabilities, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), are also NRTs.", "NRTs are particularly useful due to their ease of administration and scoring. Commercially available NRTs usually require no further development or validation procedures, so they are relatively cost-effective and time-efficient. NRTs can be easily administered to large groups of students at the same time and are useful for making comparisons across schools, districts, or states.", "On the other hand, NRTs have been criticized for several reasons. Some criticize NRTs for measuring only superficial learning through multiple choice and short-answer formats instead of measuring higher-level skills such as problem solving, reasoning, critical thinking, and comprehension. Others have criticized NRTs for lacking instructional utility because they sample a wide range of general skills within a content area, but NRTs are rarely linked to the curriculum.

Like NRTs, CRTs are often standardized. They do not, however, report scores of \"relative standing\" against a normative sample. CRTs report scores of \"absolute standing\" against a predetermined criterion. CRTs are designed to determine the extent to which a student has mastered specific curriculum and content skills. \"Mastery\" of curriculum and content skills is usually determined through a collaborative process of professional judgment. Mastery can be defined in many ways. It may be defined as answering 80% of the items on an assessment correctly. Alternatively, it may be defined as meeting some level of proficiency within a content area based on an observation of the student performing the skills.", "Unlike NRTs, CRTs are not designed to differentiate between students or compare an individual student to a normative group. Because comparisons are not being made, CRTs report either scale scores or raw scores, depending on how the assessment was designed. CRT results may be reported as grades, pass/fail, number correct, percentage correct, or performance standards.

They can be directly linked to the curriculum, and the results from CRTs can be used for planning, modifying, and adapting instruction. Additionally, like commercially available NRTs, commercially available CRTs are relatively cost-effective and time-efficient. The disadvantage of CRTs is that they do not typically facilitate good comparisons across schools, districts, and states.

Performance standards are a type of score reporting that evolved from CRTs and standards-based reform. A CRT can often report results as either a scale score or a performance standard. A performance standard is a generally agreed upon definition of a certain level of performance in a content area that is expressed in terms of a cut score. The predetermined cut score denotes a level of mastery or level of proficiency within a content area. An assessment system that uses performance standards typically establishes several cut scores that denote varying levels of proficiency. For example, NAEP uses a system of performance standards with three achievement levels: basic, proficient, and advanced. Additionally, state assessments have used performance standards to determine AYP under the NCLB accountability system. Definitions are provided for each performance standard, describing the competencies and abilities associated with the label.", "Performance standards have the same advantages of CRTs. Performance standards can be directly linked to the curriculum and results can be used for planning, modifying, and adapting instruction. The main difference between reporting a score as a CRT or a performance standard is the \"proficiency label,\" which can attach meaning to a score and provide an appropriate context. A CRT may report that a student scored 242 on a scale of 500, but the score of 242 may be meaningless to most educators and parents unless there is some context surrounding the score. Performance standards provide the context. If the proficiency cut score was predetermined to be 240, a score of 242 would be above the cut score, and therefore the student would be considered proficient in the content area.", "Although they provide a meaningful context for assessment results, performance standards are criticized for their somewhat arbitrary cut scores. Cut scores are usually determined through a process of consensus and professional judgment, but there is rarely any meaningful difference between the abilities of a student who scores just below the cut score and a student who scores just above the cut score. Consider the example above in which a score of 240 denotes \"proficiency\". One student may score 238 and not be considered proficient, while another student may score 242 and be considered proficient. In reality, the cut score of the performance standard may be making an inappropriate distinction between two students who have similar abilities. Another criticism of performance standards is that they are insensitive to student growth. Suppose the cut score for the \"advanced\" level is 300. A student in the previous example could move from a score of 242 to 299 within one year, making considerable progress; however, a score of 242 and a score of 299 are both considered to be within the same performance standard of \"proficient.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Professional Judgment", "paragraphs": ["Occasionally, assessment calls for professional judgment. On a daily basis within classrooms, teachers ask questions and make judgments about students' knowledge based on students' responses. In some cases, teachers may use their professional judgment to refer a child for a special education evaluation or a language assessment. Another application of professional judgment may be the use of a rubric to evaluate a student's performance against a predetermined standard. Although scoring rubrics can be quite prescriptive, there are occasionally value-laden decisions that require teachers to make judgments about the degree to which a student met the standard. Professional judgment has the advantage of being directly tied to the curriculum and sensitive to individual student performance, however, it is subjective and susceptible to personal biases.", "Another type of professional judgment that is used in educational assessment is a process of professional consensus used to set performance standards.

When making instructional or policy decisions on the basis of an assessment, the question is often asked, \"Is the test valid?\" Validity, however, is not a property of the test itself. Validity is the degree to which a certain inference from a test is appropriate and meaningful. The question to be asked, therefore, is \"Is the inference being drawn from the test result valid?\" The distinction between these questions may seem unimportant, but consider the following example. Often times, teachers, administrators, or policymakers would like to support multiple conclusions from the same assessment. Some of these conclusions, or inferences, may be valid and others may not. Consider the SAT Reasoning Test, which is taken by many high school students. The SAT is a college entrance examination, and its purpose is to measure critical thinking skills that are needed for success in college. Suppose a group of high school seniors in School A scored well on the SAT and a group of high school seniors in School B scored poorly. One possible valid inference from this result is that seniors from School A are more likely to succeed in college. There are, however, many possible inferences that may be less valid. For example, one could infer that School A had a better academic curriculum than School B. Or, one could infer that School A had better teachers than School B. Neither of these inferences may be valid because the SAT was designed for the purpose of predicting the likelihood of success in college and not for the purposes of evaluating teachers or curriculum. The validity of an inference, therefore, is tied inextricably to the purpose for which the test was created.", "When an assessment is created or when a new use is proposed for an existing assessment, a process of validation should occur. Validation involves collecting evidence to support the use and interpretation of test scores based on the test construct. In testing, a construct is the concept or characteristic that a test is designed to measure. The process of validation includes, at a minimum, investigating the construct underrepresentation and construct irrelevance of the assessment instrument. Construct underrepresentation refers to the degree to which an assessment fails to capture important aspects of the construct. For example, if the assessment is designed to measure addition and subtraction skills, the entire construct would include addition, addition with carrying, subtraction, subtraction with borrowing, two-digit addition, two-digit addition with carrying, and so forth. If the assessment does not measure all the skills within a defined construct, it may be susceptible to construct underrepresentation, and the inference based on an assessment score may not reflect the student's actual knowledge of the construct. Similarly, construct irrelevance can threaten the validity of an inference. Construct irrelevance refers to the degree to which test scores are affected by the content of an assessment that is not part of the intended construct. Again, if an assessment was designed to measure addition and subtraction skills, any test items that contain multiplication or division would create construct irrelevance, and the inference based on the assessment score may not reflect the student's actual knowledge of the construct.", "Construct underrepresentation is investigated by answering the question, \"Does the assessment adequately cover the full range of skills in the construct?\" Construct irrelevance is investigated by answering the question, \"Are any skills within the assessment outside of the realm of the construct?\" These two questions are investigated using statistical procedures that examine properties of the assessment itself and how the properties of the assessment interact with characteristics of individuals taking the test. One important consideration is to determine if the degree of construct underrepresentation or construct irrelevance differentially affects the performance of various subgroups of the population. If, for example, there was a moderate degree of construct irrelevance (e.g., multiplication questions on an assessment designed to measure addition and subtraction skills), students from advantaged subgroups may be more likely to score well on a test than students from disadvantaged subgroups, even if both subgroups have equal knowledge of the construct itself. The construct irrelevance, therefore, may lead to an invalid inference that advantaged students outperform disadvantaged students in a given construct (in this example, addition and subtraction skills).", "There are many other types of evidence that may be collected during validation. For example, test developers might compare student scores on the assessment in question with existing measures of the same construct. Or, test developers might investigate how well the assessment in question predicts a later outcome of interest, such as pass rates on a high-stakes exam, high school graduation rates, or job attainment.

It describes the precision with which assessment results are reported and is a measure of certainty that the results are accurate.

The true score is the hypothetical average score resulting from multiple administrations of an assessment; it is the true representation of what the student knows and can do. For any given assessment, however, the score that is reported is not a student's true score, it is a student's observed score. The hypothetical difference between the true score and the observed score is measurement error. Reliability and measurement error are inversely related. The lower the measurement error, the higher the reliability.

There is no rule of thumb for deciding how high a reliability coefficient should be; however, most commercially available assessments report reliability coefficients above 0.8, and many have reliability coefficients above 0.9.", "The most common types of reliability coefficients used in educational assessment are alternate-form coefficients, test-retest coefficients, inter-scorer agreement coefficients, and internal consistency coefficients. Alternate-form coefficients measure the degree to which the scores derived from alternate forms of the same assessment are consistent. For example, the SAT, which is used as a college entrance examination, has multiple forms that are administered each year. A high alternate-form reliability coefficient provides some certainty that a student's score on one form of the SAT would be reasonably equivalent to the student's score on another form of the SAT. Test-retest coefficients measure the stability of an individual student's score over time. If the NAEP reading subtest was administered to a student today and re-administered in two weeks, one would expect that the student would have comparable scores across the two administrations. A high test-retest reliability coefficient provides a measure of certainty that a student's score today is similar to the student's score in the near future. Inter-scorer agreement coefficients measure the degree to which two independent scorers agree when assessing a student's performance. A high inter-scorer agreement coefficient provides a measure of certainty that a student's score would not be greatly affected by the individual scoring the assessment.", "Internal consistency coefficients are slightly more complicated. Internal consistency coefficients are a measure of the correlation of items within the same assessment. If items within an assessment are related, a student should perform consistently well or consistently poorly on the related items. For example, a mathematics assessment may test multiplication and division skills. Suppose a student is proficient with multiplication but has not yet mastered division. Within the mathematics assessment, the student should score consistently well on the multiplication items and consistently poorly on the division items. A high internal consistency coefficient provides a measure of certainty that related items within the assessment are in fact measuring the same construct.", "The decisions regarding the type of reliability coefficients to investigate and report depend on the purpose and format of the assessment. For example, many assessments do not use alternate forms, and there would be no need to report an alternate-form coefficient. As another example, consider a test that was designed to measure student growth over a short period of time. In this case, it may not make sense to report a test-retest reliability coefficient because one does not expect any stability or consistency in the student's score over time. Test developers also consider the format of the test. In tests with multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank formats, inter-scorer agreement may not be of great concern because the scoring is relatively objective; however, in tests with constructed responses, such as essay tests or performance assessments, it may be important to investigate inter-scorer agreement because the scoring has an element of subjectivity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Range of Uncertainty\u2014Confidence Intervals", "paragraphs": ["As stated above, reliability describes the precision with which assessment results are reported and is a measure of certainty that the results are accurate.

Consider, for example, the international assessments described above, PISA and TIMSS. Both assessments measure mathematics achievement, but they measure different mathematical constructs. PISA was designed to measure basic \"mathematical literacy\" whereas TIMSS is curriculum-based and was designed to measure what students have learned in school. Results from the 2006 PISA administration reported that the average U.S. score in mathematics was lower than international average. Results from the 2007 administration of the TIMSS reported that the average U.S. score in mathematics was higher than the international average. Based on these results, a novice test user may be tempted to conclude that within one year, students in the U.S. improved in mathematics achievement compared to other countries. There are several reasons why this conclusion is inappropriate, one of which is that PISA and TIMSS measure very different constructs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "paragraphs": ["Questions about the purpose: What was the intended purpose of the assessment when it was designed (e.g., instructional, predictive, diagnostic, evaluative)? How will teachers, administrators, and policymakers use the results (e.g., formative assessment vs. summative assessment)?", "Understanding the original purpose of the assessment will help test users determine how the results may be interpreted and how the scores may be used. For example, a state assessment that was designed for evaluative purposes may not lend itself to using scores to modify and adapt instruction for individual students. Most state assessments are strictly summative assessments, and it is difficult to use them in a formative manner because the results may not be reported in a timely fashion to the teachers and the items may not be sensitive to classroom instruction. Alternatively, a benchmark assessment that was designed for predictive purposes may report results in a more timely manner and allow teachers to target their instruction to students who scored poorly. Benchmark assessments are often aligned with state assessments, however, scores on benchmark assessments should not be considered definitive indicators of what state assessment scores will be."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scores", "paragraphs": ["Questions about scores: Does the score reported compare a student's performance to the performance of others (e.g., NRT)? Does the score reported compare a student's performance to a criterion or standard (e.g., CRT, performance standard)? Does the score determine whether a student is proficient within a certain content area (e.g., performance standards)? Does the score show growth or progress that a student made within a content area?", "Misinterpreting scores is perhaps the most common way to make an inappropriate inference. To avoid an inappropriate inference, a test user should fully investigate the scale of the assessment and the way in which scores are reported. If scores are reported from NRTs, a student's score can be interpreted relative to the normative sample, which is a group of the student's peers. NRTs cannot, however, determine whether a student met a predetermined criterion or whether a student is proficient within a particular content area. If scores are reported from CRTs, either in the form of criterion-referenced scores or performance standards, a student's score can be interpreted relative to a predetermined standard or criterion. CRTs and performance standards, however, were not designed to make particularly meaningful comparisons between students who participated in the same assessment.", "Because of the use of performance standards in state assessments, it is particularly important for test users to understand what they do and do not report. Performance standards are used primarily because they can be easily aligned with the state content standards and provide both a score and some meaningful description of what students know. Performance standards, however, can be particularly difficult to interpret. Students are classified into categories, such as basic, proficient, or advanced, based on their performance on an assessment. All students within the \"proficient\" category, however, did not score equally well. Furthermore, scores from performance standards do not lend themselves to interpret a student's growth. A student can score at the lower end of the proficient category, make considerable progress over the next year, and still be in the proficient category at the end of the year. Alternatively, a student could score at the high end of the basic category, make minimal progress over the next year, and move up into the proficient category. Because of these qualities of performance standards, test users should be very cautious equating the performance of students within the same category and making assumptions about growth based on movement through the categories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Quality", "paragraphs": ["Questions about technical quality: Did the test developers provide statistical information on the validity and reliability of the instrument? Was the issue of fairness and bias addressed, either through thoughtful reasoning or statistical procedures? What kind of validity and reliability evidence was collected? Does that evidence seem to match the purpose of the assessment? Have the test developers reported reliability evidence separately for all the subgroups of interest?", "Commercially available assessments are accompanied by a user's manual that reports validity and reliability evidence. Smaller, locally developed assessments do not always have an accompanying manual, but test developers should have validity and reliability evidence available upon request. It is a fairly simple process to determine whether evidence has been provided but a much more difficult task to evaluate the quality of the evidence. A thorough discussion of how to evaluate the technical quality of an assessment is beyond the scope of this report. In light of the current uses of assessments in schools, however, some issues are noteworthy. ", "First, because schools are required to report state assessment results for various subgroups (i.e., students with disabilities and LEP students), it is important that validity and reliability be investigated for each subgroup for which data will be disaggregated. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of bias in the assessment against a particular subgroup.", "Second, the type of reliability evidence provided should be specific to the assessment. For example, an assessment with constructed responses, such as essay tests or performance assessments, will have a degree of subjectivity in scoring. In this case, it is important to have strong evidence of inter-scorer reliability. In other cases when the assessment format consists of multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank items, inter-scorer reliability may be of lesser importance.", "A test like the SAT Reasoning Test which relies on several alternate forms should report alternate-form reliability. Without a high degree of alternate-form reliability, some students will take an easier version of an assessment and others will take a more difficult version. Unequal forms of the same assessment will introduce bias in the testing process. Students taking the easier version may have scores that are positively biased and students taking the harder version may have scores that are negatively biased.", "Third, no assessment is technically perfect. All inferences based on an observed score will be susceptible to measurement error, and some may be susceptible to bias."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Context of the Assessment", "paragraphs": ["Questions about the context: Is this a high-stakes or a low-stakes assessment? Who will be held accountable (e.g., students, teachers, schools, states)? Is the validity and reliability evidence strong enough to make high-stakes decisions? Are there confounding factors that may have influenced performance on the assessment? What other information could be collected to make a better inference?", "The context in which an assessment takes place may have implications for how critical a test user must be about making an inference from a test score. In a low-stakes assessment, such as a classroom-level formative assessment that will be used for instructional purposes, conducting an exhaustive review of the reliability and validity evidence may not be a worthwhile endeavor. These assessments are usually short, conducted to help teachers adapt their instruction, and have no consequences if the inference is not completely accurate. On the other hand, for a high-stakes assessment, like a state exit exam for graduation, it is important to examine the validity and reliability evidence of the assessment to ensure that the inference is defensible. Consider the consequences of a state exit exam with poor evidence of validity due to a high degree of construct irrelevance. Students would be tested on content outside of the construct and may perform poorly, which may prevent them from earning a high school diploma. Or, consider a state exit exam with poor evidence of reliability due to a high degree of measurement error. Students who are likely to score near the cut score of the assessment may pass or fail largely due to measurement error.", "Sometimes when making an inference for a high-stakes decision, certain protections are placed on the testing process or the test result. For example, in terms of a state exit exam for high school graduation, some states allow students to take the assessment multiple times to lessen the probability that measurement error is preventing them from passing. Or, in some cases, a state will consider collecting additional data (such as a portfolio of student work) to determine whether a student has met the requirements for receiving a high school diploma. In other high-stakes assessments, such as state assessments for AYP, some states use confidence intervals in addition to observed scores to report student achievement. Several states have chosen to use 95% or even 99% confidence intervals to increase the certainty of inferences based on test scores."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Use of Assessments in Accountability Systems: Implications for Curriculum, Students, and Testing", "paragraphs": ["NCLB greatly increased the emphasis on student assessment. Under NCLB, student scores on state assessments are used as key indicators in an accountability system that determines whether schools are making progress with respect to student achievement. Some have viewed this shift towards test-based accountability as a positive move because it places more emphasis on developing rigorous content standards in reading, mathematics, and science and teaching to the standards. Test-based accountability as implemented by NCLB also leads to increased attention on traditionally underperforming subgroups of students, including disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and LEP students. On the other hand, test-based accountability has been criticized for narrowing the curriculum and focusing all instruction on the tested subjects of reading and mathematics at the expense of other subjects. The current practice of test-based accountability may also create incentives to set low expectations for proficiency and to focus on a subset of children who are near the proficiency level instead of focusing on children at all achievement levels. Another criticism is that the increased emphasis on test-based accountability can lead to score inflation, which may inhibit policymakers from measuring the actual impact of accountability.", "In the sections below, the potential positive and negative implications of test-based accountability are discussed, including implications for curriculum, students, and testing.

Under NCLB, states have been required to develop rigorous content standards for reading and mathematics, which many see as core subjects that will lead to improved learning in other content areas. There is some evidence that using content standards and assessments can help teachers focus their instruction and obtain feedback on the effectiveness of their instruction. There are also some data to suggest that high-performing schools have a stronger alignment between state content standards and school curriculum. Furthermore, schools that include teachers in the development of these standards tended to have a higher degree of teacher \"buy-in\" to the standards.", "On the other hand, test-based accountability may be affecting the curriculum in less desirable ways. One criticism of test-based accountability systems is that they lead to a narrowing of the curriculum. There are several ways in which these systems might narrow the curriculum. First, the time spent administering the actual assessments, sometimes called the \"testing burden,\" could detract from classroom instruction. Second, test-based accountability systems may lead to increases in test preparation, leaving less time for instruction. There is some evidence to suggest that teachers feel pressure to \"teach to the test\" and engage in test preparation activities at the expense of instruction. Test-preparation activities take several forms, including altering typical classroom assignments to conform to the format of an expected response on the state assessment (e.g., if the state assessment requires a five paragraph constructed response, teachers may assign a disproportionate number of five-paragraph essays). Third, in test-based accountability systems, teachers report reallocating instructional time towards tested subjects and away from non-tested subjects. Surveys of teachers have consistently reported that their instruction emphasizes reading and mathematics over other subjects like history, foreign language, and arts. Although there is consistency in the survey results, it is difficult to understand the extent to which instructional time is reallocated towards tested subjects. Most of these reports do not collect data through experimental observation, but rather they rely on self-reported data from teachers and administrators, which is often less reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for Students", "paragraphs": ["NCLB has required states to disaggregate student assessment data for major subgroups, including racial/ethnic groups, economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and LEP students. Under NCLB, schools are held accountable for the performance of each of these subgroups, and each subgroup shares a common goal of reaching 100% proficiency in reading and mathematics by 2014. Designing an accountability system in this way has increased the attention given to the achievement of certain subgroups that may have been previously masked by overall student performance. In general, disaggregating data by subgroups has been seen as a positive step in terms of equity in education because the performance of all subgroups \"counts\" towards AYP. Supporters of disaggregation believe that it leads to increased access to rigorous academic curriculum for students who otherwise may not have had access to such curriculum due to low expectations of performance.", "Along with the increased attention to subgroups of students, there has been increased attention to the achievement gaps between white students and minority students and between economically advantaged students and disadvantaged students. Over the last several decades, a general goal of public education has been to \"close the achievement gap,\" and thus, improve equity in education. By disaggregating assessment results, NCLB has led to consistent measurement of the achievement gap and allows researchers to examine the size of the achievement gap over time.", "One of the unintended consequences of NCLB accountability is the way instruction may be focused on students just below the \"proficient\" level, possibly at the expense of other students. Under NCLB's test-based accountability system, the goal is for 100% of students to reach proficiency by 2014. In an effort to raise the percentage of proficient students, schools and teachers may target instructional time and resources towards those students who are near proficiency. Since time and resources are a zero-sum game, fewer instructional resources may be available for students who are far below proficiency or even those who achieve at advanced levels. This disincentive to focus instructional resources on all children has led to possible alternative methods of measuring achievement, including growth models. Within certain accountability systems, the use of growth models may give teachers and schools credit for student growth, even if the growth occurs far below the proficiency level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for Testing", "paragraphs": ["Test-based accountability systems use high-stakes assessments to make decisions about students, teachers, and schools. Under NCLB, individual schools are held accountable for student achievement, and if schools fail to meet their AYP goals, there are consequences. In an effort to avoid these consequences, schools often make conscious efforts to prepare students for high-stakes assessments. Although these efforts are often undertaken with good intentions, they can lead to score inflation. Score inflation is a phenomenon in which scores on high-stakes assessments tend to increase at a faster rate than scores on low-stakes assessments. The validity of an inference is greatly reduced when score inflation is present.", "Test preparation can take many forms, and it is difficult to distinguish appropriate test preparation from inappropriate test preparation. Many schools provide test preparation to young students who have little experience with standardized testing, and this form of test preparation can actually increase the validity of a test score because it is less likely that students will do poorly due to unfamiliarity with the testing process. Other test preparation strategies, such as working more effectively or working harder, are also usually desirable. Test preparation begins to affect validity in a negative way, however, when there are excessive amounts of alignment between test items and curriculum, excessive coaching of a particular type of item that will appear on the test, or even outright cheating.", "Studying the prevalence of score inflation is difficult because school districts may be reluctant to give researchers access to test scores for the purpose of investigating possible inflation. Nevertheless, several studies have documented the problem of score inflation by comparing gains on state assessments (high-stakes) to those made on NAEP (low-stakes). Studies have consistently reported discrepancies in the overall level of student achievement, the size of student achievement gains, and the size of the achievement gap. The discrepancies indicate that student scores on state assessments may be inflated and that these inflated scores may not represent true achievement gains as measured by another test of a similar construct. In this case, the validity of the inference made from state assessments may be questioned.", "One possible way to reduce the problem of score inflation is to consistently use a low-stakes \"audit\" assessment, such as NAEP, to corroborate gains on state assessments. If gains on state assessments generalize to another \"audit\" assessment, it increases the likelihood that gains are due to true achievement gains. This type of corroboration may help policymakers separate the policies that lead to true student achievement from those that lead to score inflation.", "Appendix A. Glossary", "Appendix B.
