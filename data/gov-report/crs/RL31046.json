The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2002 and FY2003( H.R. 1646 ), passed in the House on May16, 2001, contained provisions on arms sales to Taiwan. First, H.R. 1646 included authority (in Section 851)for the President to sell the fourKidd-class destroyers to Taiwan, not as Foreign Military Sales, but Excess Defense Articles (EDA), under Section21 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). Second, in the House International Relations Committee, Representative Brad Sherman proposed an amendment(Section 813) to require that Taiwan be treated asthe \"equivalent of a major non-NATO ally\" for defense transfers under the AECA or the Foreign Assistance Act,while the language stopped short of designatingTaiwan as a major non-NATO ally. According to the Member's office, the provision would show tangible supportfor Taiwan's defense, provide it with statussimilar to that given to Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, offer it the \"right of first refusal\" for EDA, and treatit with enhanced status for anti-terrorismassistance, cooperative research and development projects in the defense area, and expedited review in satellitelicensing. Some observers said that authority hasexisted under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to provide defense assistance to Taiwan.

", "Subtitles B and C, which cover the Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation and Nonproliferation Assistance Coordination, were Senateinitiatives that did not appear in the House version of H.R. 1646 . Subtitle D, Iran Nuclear ProliferationPrevention Act of 2002, was a Houseinitiative.", "Russian Debt-Swap for Nonproliferation. Known as the Russian Federation Debt for Nonproliferation Act of2002 , this \"debt swap\" program seeks to use a portion of the Russian Federation's foreign debt to fundnonproliferation programs and ensure that the resourcesmade available to the Russian Federation are targeted to achieving nonproliferation objectives. The program isintended to provide a new stream of funding forthese purposes. The bill authorizes the President to enter into a \"Russian Federation Nonproliferation InvestmentAgreement.\" Such an agreement shall ensurethat a) the value of the debt reduced will be made available for agreed nonproliferation programs and projects; b)each program or project will be approved by thePresident; c) administration and oversight will incorporate best practices from established threat reduction andnonproliferation assistance programs; d) audits areconducted; e) unobligated funds are not diverted; e) funds for projects are not taxed by the Russian Federation; f)intellectual property rights issues are addressedbefore funds are expended; and g) not less than 75 percent of the funds are spent in the Russian Federation itself. The bill has provisions for spending funds on a\"Center for Independent Press and the Rule of Law\" and for an annual certification by the President to Congress thatRussia has made \"material progress\" inreducing proliferation. First introduced by Senator Biden in S. 1803 in late 2001, a similar measure with thesame objectives, H.R. 3836 , was introduced in the House by Rep. Ellen Tauscher on March 4, 2002 and referred to the House InternationalRelations Committee. (See CRS Report RL30617(pdf) , Russia's Paris Club Debt and U.S. Interests , by [author name scrubbed].)", "Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2002. (23) The Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2002isvirtually identical to a bill introduced in the 106th Congress, H.R. 1477 , which passed the House by a voteof 383-1 but did not receive Senate flooraction. A similar bill, H.R. 3743 , passed the House in the 105th Congress, by a vote of 405-13, and did notreceive any Senate action. Thelegislation seeks to prohibit the use of U.S. voluntary contributions to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund foruse in Iran. The vehicle for this is anamendment to Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act. Although Iran and several other state sponsors ofterrorism cannot receive U.S. funds throughinternational organizations under Section 307 (c), the IAEA and UNICEF are exempt from those restrictions. Theamendment would allow the restriction to applyif the Secretary of State determines that IAEA programs in Iran are inconsistent with U.S. nuclear nonproliferationor safety goals or provide Iran withproliferation-relevant training or are used as a cover for proliferation activities. The bill requires the Secretary ofState to assess IAEA projects for theirconsistency with U.S. nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals and conduct an annual review of all IAEA programs. Section 1344 requires the Secretary of Stateto submit a detailed report to Congress each year for 5 years on Iran's Bushehr reactor project and IAEA technicalassistance to Iran. In a separate provision(Section 1306), the Security Assistance Act amends the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 by specifying in greaterdetail the content of the reports to the Congressthat are required under that act. It also makes clear a person is not exempt from sanctions if he/she only transfersconventional weapons (rather than weapons ofmass destruction). ", "Between 1995 and 1999, the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund provided over $1.5 million in technical assistance to Iran's civilian nuclear power program,including a reactor being built by Russia near the Iranian port city of Bushehr. Most of that assistance is nuclearsafety training. IAEA assistance programs on theBushehr reactor date as far back as 1985. U.S. voluntary contributions (approximately $18 million in 2002) providealmost 27% of the Technical CooperationFund. U.S. assessed contributions to the IAEA, which would not be affected by the legislation, provide about 25%of the total annual IAEA budget. There is aprecedent of the U.S. withholding its share of funding for projects in Cuba for the past several years.", "Members and outside experts who support the legislation maintain that a cut in U.S. voluntary contributions would not prevent the IAEA from continuing work inIran, but that U.S. funds should not be devoted to a nuclear project the United States fundamentally opposes. Analternate view is that reducing U.S.contributions would limit U.S. influence over IAEA assistance to the Bushehr project, an Iranian civilian nuclearpower project at the city of Bushehr, Iran.According to critics, this could hinder the U.S. ability to monitor the Bushehr project to ensure it is not serving anynuclear weapons program. Others believe thatthe United States should support IAEA assistance to the Bushehr project because the IAEA will contribute to itssafe operation and because Iran, according to theIAEA, is abiding by its commitments as a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and therefore qualifies forassistance. Supporters of the legislation notethat it provides for a waiver of the contribution reduction if the conditions sought by both advocates and opponentsare met.

Although South Asia is now a military theater of operations inthe war on terrorism and the United States is building new, cooperative relations with both India and Pakistan, therisk that this region will contribute to theproliferation, or even the use, of nuclear weapons has not declined. In their joint explanatory statement, conferencemanagers ( H.Rept. 107-671 ) noted their intentthat the executive branch maintain a high priority for these concerns while ensuring that U.S. policy and actions onnuclear issues in South Asia are consistentwith U.S. obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and with past U.S. policy. Section 1601 of Title XVI of P.L. 107-228 outlinesnonproliferation objectives to be achieved with respect to nuclear testing, nuclear weapons and ballistic missiledeployments and developments, export controlsand confidence-building measures. In addition, the section states that it shall be the policy of the United Statesconsistent with its NPT obligations, to encourage,and where appropriate, work with the governments of India and Pakistan to achieve not later than September 30,2003, the establishment of \"modern, effectivesystems to protect and secure nuclear devices and materiel from unauthorized use, accidental employment, or theft.\" The conferees noted that \"any such dialoguewith India or Pakistan would not be represented or considered, nor would it be intended, as granting any recognitionto India or Pakistan, as appropriate, as anuclear weapon state. The section requires the President to submit a report to Congress no later than March 1, 2003,on U.S. efforts to achieve the objectives andlikelihood of success by September 2003. These provisions appeared in S. 1803 and are describedadditionally in S.Rept. 107-122 ; H.R. 1646 as passed by the House contained no provisions related to nuclear and missile proliferation in South Asia.
