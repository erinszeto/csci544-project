Eleven states had implemented or planned to implement other personnel actions, such as limitations on overtime or reductions in pay, that would apply to DDS agencies and employees.", "These furloughs, hiring freezes, and other personnel actions will reduce the capacity of the DDS to process initial SSDI and SSI applications as well as continuing disability reviews (CDRs).

The statutory language specifies that \"the determination of whether or not ... [an individual] is under a disability ... and of the day such disability began, and the determination of the day on which such disability ceases, shall be made by a State agency, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any State that notifies the Commissioner of Social Security in writing that it wishes to make such disability determinations.\" Currently, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico administer their own DDS.", "The statute requires the Commissioner of Social Security to promulgate regulations that specify \"performance standards and administrative requirements and procedures to be followed in performing the disability determination function in order to assure effective and uniform administration of the disability insurance program throughout the United States.\" Regulations issued pursuant to this authority set forth the state's administrative responsibilities and requirements, but the regulations emphasize that the \"State will provide the organizational structure, qualified personnel, medical consultant services, and a quality assurance function sufficient to ensure that disability determinations are made accurately and promptly.\" As a result, each state's DDS is a state agency that is required to comply with all provisions in the Social Security Act, applicable federal regulations, and guidance from the SSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of DDS Employees", "paragraphs": ["Because each DDS is a state agency, all DDS employees are state, rather than federal, employees.

For example, the federal regulations provide some guidance for equal employment opportunity requirements, hiring and compensation issues, allowable travel, and restrictions on state personnel actions. The Social Security Act and the regulations contain no provisions that specifically prohibit states from implementing such personnel actions as furloughs, hiring freezes, or limitations on overtime with regard to DDS employees. However, the regulations do state that, \"[subject] to appropriate Federal funding, the State will, to the best of its ability, facilitate the processing of disability claims by avoiding personnel freezes, restrictions against overtime work, or curtailment of facilities or activities.\" Although this regulation clearly addresses some types of personnel actions, the language does not create a mandatory requirement for the states with regard to furloughs or other personnel actions. Therefore, as long as a state is acting within the scope of the applicable federal statutes, regulations, and SSA guidance, each state may administer its DDS as it wishes.

States may also subject their agencies to hiring freezes or other personnel actions such as pay and overtime reductions.", "States generally claim that it would be unfair to exempt one specific group of workers, such as DDS employees, from statewide furloughs or personnel actions. In addition, because some state positions are funded partially through external sources, identifying which employees should or should not be furloughed could present administrative difficulties and costs. States may also feel that they must include all employees in furloughs or personnel actions because they may be responsible, at least initially and until reimbursed by the federal government, for these employees' benefits and pension contributions.

Any furloughs or other personnel actions that would limit the total number of cases that could be processed by the DDS would likely have a negative impact on the SSDI and SSI programs. This potential reduced capacity of the DDS to process initial disability applications comes at a time of significant growth in the number of SSDI and SSI applications.

Although benefits would ultimately be paid on a retroactive basis to the established date of program eligibility, SSI recipients could be forced to wait up to a year beyond the date of their eligibility decisions to receive all of their retroactive benefits.", "The SSA OIG estimates that a two-day furlough in California would result in 2,375 initial disability determinations and reconsiderations not being performed in the month of the furlough.

Under the SSA's Compassionate Allowance program, SSDI and SSI applications are pre-screened and the applications of claimants with the most severe illnesses and disabilities are processed in an expedited manner to ensure that these claimants receive benefits as soon as possible. A reduced capacity to process initial determinations resulting from a furlough or other personnel action would delay the processing of these expedited cases and the payment of benefits to this population.", "The processing of CDRs by DDS employees would also be affected by a furlough or other personnel action. Increased processing times for CDRs would result in some SSDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients waiting longer for decisions on their active CDRs and others seeing delays in the commencement of their CDRs.

In addition, SSDI and SSI applicants waiting for benefit payments may rely on other social programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or Unemployment Insurance (UI) that are partially funded or administered by the states. Benefit delays could also result in an increased reliance on Medicaid by program applicants.
