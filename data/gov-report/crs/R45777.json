This information was collected on a voluntary basis until 2001, when most of it became mandatory. As the livestock industry became increasingly concentrated in the 1990s, fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash or \"spot\") purchases and with increasing frequency were sold under alternative marketing arrangements that were not publicly disclosed under voluntary reporting. Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult to impossible for them to assess \"fair\" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for livestock mandatory reporting (LMR) for packers who purchase livestock, process them, and market the meat.", "In response, Congress passed the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-78 ) that mandated price reporting for cattle, boxed beef, and swine and allowed USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb purchases. USDA issued a final rule that included lamb reporting in December 2000 and took effect in April 2001. Since then, the law has been amended to include more detail on swine reporting and has added wholesale pork as a covered product. The act has been reauthorized four times, and most recently the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-54 ) reauthorized LMR through September 30, 2020. In addition to extending LMR, the enacted legislation established the \"negotiated formula purchase\" category for swine and added additional swine reporting requirements (e.g., net prices and head counts by type of swine). The act also amended reporting volume thresholds for lamb importers and lamb packers.", "The reauthorization required USDA to conduct a study that analyzed current marketing practices, identified livestock industry stakeholder concerns, and solicited stakeholder legislative and regulatory recommendations for LMR. AMS submitted this report to Congress in April 2018.", "The LMR study found that the meatpacking industry has become more concentrated and vertically integrated since LMR was established. It also found that the industry is responding to domestic and global consumer meat demand with product differentiation and a mix of new products that did not exist when LMR began.

Stakeholders represented at the meetings included industry associations, farm groups, meat processors, and food companies. Since then, AMS has implemented reporting changes that address several concerns raised by stakeholders.", "A common concern among stakeholders is the low volume of negotiated purchases and a parallel trend toward increased formula purchases or other marketing arrangements. Other concerns are about confidentiality and a lack of clarity on how transactions are categorized in reports, with some stakeholders advocating for the inclusion of more details about transactions, such as premium levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially as the market changes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and reporting on the number of livestock committed to packers.", "Swine and lamb stakeholders have provided specific legislative recommendations to be considered during possible reauthorization of the act in the 116 th Congress. Swine stakeholders have recommended eliminating the \"negotiated formula purchase\" transaction and the reporting of wholesale pork prices based on shipment to Omaha, Nebraska, because these reporting requirements are rarely used in the swine industry today. They also recommended expanding definitions and reporting on certain swine attributes.

The information was disseminated through hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual written and electronic USDA reports on sales of live cattle, hogs, and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals. The goal was to provide all buyers and sellers with accurate and objective market information.", "By the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone many changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, production specialization, and vertical integration (firms controlling more than one aspect of production). Fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash or \"spot\") sales, while an increasing number of purchases were made under alternative marketing arrangements (e.g., formula purchases based on a negotiated price established in the future). These formula purchases were based on prices not publicly disclosed or reported. Some livestock producers, believing that such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to assess \"fair\" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat. USDA had estimated in 2000 that the former voluntary system was not reporting transactions of the order of 35%-40% of cattle, 75% of hogs, and 40% of lambs.", "During initial debate in Congress on LMR, opponents, including some meat packers and other farmers and ranchers, argued that a mandate would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information. Nonetheless, some of these early opponents ultimately supported an LMR law. Livestock producers had experienced low prices in the late 1990s and were looking for ways to strengthen market prices.

LMR was authorized for five years, until September 30, 2004.", "USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000.

Authority for LMR lapsed again on September 30, 2005. At that time, USDA requested that all packers who were required to report under the 1999 act continue to submit required information voluntarily. About 90% of packers voluntarily reported, which allowed USDA to continue to publish most reports. In October 2006, Congress passed legislation to reauthorize LMR through September 30, 2010. This act also amended swine reporting requirements from the original 1999 law by separating the reporting requirements for sows and boars from barrows and gilts, among other changes.", "Because statutory authority for the program had lapsed for a year, USDA determined that it had to reestablish regulatory authority through rulemaking in order to continue LMR operations. On May 16, 2008, USDA issued the final rule to reestablish and revise the mandatory reporting program. This rule incorporated the swine reporting changes and was intended to enhance the program's overall effectiveness and efficiency based on AMS's experience in the administration of the program. The rule became effective on July 15, 2008.", "Mandatory wholesale pork price reporting was not included in the original LMR act because the swine industry could not agree on reporting for pork.

Swine packers are required to report the amount paid in premiums that are based on noncarcass characteristics (e.g., volume, delivery timing, hog breed). Also, packers must provide producers a list of such premiums. In addition to livestock purchase prices, packers are required to report sales data for boxed beef, wholesale pork, and carcass and boxed lamb.
