However, some research results could also be used for malicious purposes. Congress, the Administration, and other stakeholders are considering whether current policies concerning publishing such research results sufficiently balances the potential benefits with the potential harms. The current issues under debate cut across traditional policy areas, involving simultaneous consideration of security, science, health, export, and international policy. Because of the complexity of these issues, analysis according to one set of policy priorities may adversely affect other policy priorities. For example, maximizing security may lead to detriments in public health and scientific advancement, while maximizing scientific advancement may lead to security risks. Accounting for such trade-offs may allow policymakers to establish regulatory frameworks that more effectively maximize the benefits from such \"dual-use,\" i.e., potentially beneficial and also potentially harmful, research while mitigating its potential risks.", "The issue of balancing scientific publication with security concerns has a long historical context, but the current consideration began in late 2011, when two groups of U.S. government-funded scientists submitted papers to academic journals detailing genetic modifications that increase the transmissibility of a deadly influenza strain. Although these research results may improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response, they may also increase the probability that a highly contagious and deadly influenza strain will be introduced, either accidently or deliberately, into the human population. Stakeholders, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization, journal publishers, and scientists, debated whether the possible benefits of publication outweighed the potential harms. The editors of the scientific journals decided to publish modified versions of both papers.", "The controversy surrounding the publication of these influenza experiments revealed weaknesses in the existing federal mechanisms to identify and balance potential benefits of life science research and security trade-offs. Responding to these cases, the Administration released new government-wide policies to address some of these flaws. These new policies establish roles for federal funding agencies, institutions, and scientists to regularly review life science research portfolios and develop methods to mitigate security risks.", "It is not clear whether the 113th Congress will agree with the Administration that the new policies sufficiently address all of the dual-use issues brought to light by this recent controversy. Congress could decide to allow the new policies to be fully implemented before evaluating them. Alternatively, Congress could require agencies to implement new, different processes to identify potential research of concern prior to funding; require federal prepublication review of all potential research of concern to establish appropriate limits on the distribution of the research results; require federal licensing of researchers permitted to conduct such experiments and access results; and limit such research to the most safe and secure laboratories. All of these options might, however, reduce the number and quality of research studies undertaken.", "This report describes the underlying controversy, the potential benefits and harms of publishing these manuscripts, the actions taken by domestic and international stakeholders, and options that may improve the way research is handled to minimize security concerns."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government generally supports the open publication of unclassified, federally funded research results.

Only in cases where security concerns rise to the level of classification does the federal government bar publication of fundamental research. This current federal policy, established in National Security Decision Directive 189, is that fundamental research results should be widely available, and that in the rare case where it is necessary to restrict access, classification is the appropriate mechanism. Advances in technology that have lowered technical barriers in modern biological sciences, making it easier for people, including potential adversaries, to reproduce biological experiments raise questions whether the use of classification as the standard for determining the tradeoff between dissemination and security.", "Recent events regarding influenza research serve as a case study of the challenges the federal government faces in balancing funding scientific discovery with limiting security concerns. In late 2011, two groups of researchers receiving federal funding separately sought to publish manuscripts in scientific journals describing their successful attempts to increase the transmissibility of a highly pathogenic strain of influenza. This strain of influenza, H5N1, is sometimes referred to as avian or bird flu in the popular press. It causes severe disease in humans, but is not highly contagious between humans. The federal government moved first to restrict publication of the manuscripts. Following additional discussions and deliberations, the federal government recommended publishing modified versions of the manuscripts. Some stakeholders believe the research results should not have been published. They assert that broad dissemination of such research results increases the likelihood that a highly contagious form of the virus will be introduced, either accidently or deliberately, into the human population. Others state that the public health benefits from such research outweigh concerns regarding malicious use. ", "The H5N1 influenza research case study highlights the general tensions among stakeholders and the ramifications of various federal actions and policies. The controversy surrounding the decisions to publish these manuscripts highlights deficiencies in the federal decision-making processes related to dual-use life science research. In addition, the debate about the publication of scientific research with potential security implications cuts across multiple policy issues. These include federal support of research, maintenance of homeland security, and the flow of research information, and may require simultaneous consideration of security, science, health, export, and international policy. Because of the complexity of these issues, analysis according to one set of policy priorities may adversely affect other policy priorities. In addition, the controversy surrounding the decision to publish these experiments has demonstrated flaws in the existing mechanisms to identify and balance the potential public benefits and security trade-offs. ", "Congress has acted in the past to restrict access to pathogens where it deemed the potential risk of their misuse posed a greater threat than the benefits arising from unrestricted access. Congressional policymakers may decide that research results in some areas pose similar risks and may move to impose similar limits through a variety of mechanisms.

The form of the influenza virus changes frequently. These changes produce various strains with differing properties, including host species, levels of contagiousness, and severity of disease. Strains harmless in one host may be deadly in another. Scientists and public health officials often refer to different influenza virus strains through abbreviation. Influenza viruses have two specific disease-related proteins (H for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase), each of which have several varieties denoted by different numbers. For example, the H1N1 influenza virus caused the 2007 \"swine flu\" human pandemic.

However, because viruses constantly change, future versions of H5N1 influenza virus might be more contagious among humans.

For instance, if these changes are likely to occur, then policymakers might increase H5N1 influenza-related countermeasure development efforts. Conversely, if such changes are unlikely or impossible, then policymakers might decrease such efforts or divert federal efforts into more pressing threats.", "The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) funded multiple researchers to determine the genetic changes that would cause H5N1 strains to become more transmissible among humans. Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Dr. Ron Fouchier, based at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, each led research groups that successfully determined such changes. Both groups used ferret-to-ferret transmission to model human-to-human transmission. Independently, and using different methods, each group found specific genetic changes to the H5N1 influenza virus that make it transmissible through the air between ferrets in separate cages. ", "Dr. Kawaoka's group used standard molecular biological techniques to create a ferret-to-ferret transmissible H5N1 virus. The scientists took the H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 human pandemic and replaced the H1 portion with a genetically modified version of the H5 portion from an H5N1 strain. This hybrid version passed between ferrets housed in separate cages. However, this new virus, unlike the naturally occurring H5N1 virus, did not kill the ferrets. Additionally, his group found that current vaccines and antiviral medications are effective against this new hybrid strain.

After multiple iterations, the H5N1 virus had changed sufficiently to become transmissible between ferrets in separate cages. The scientists determined five specific genetic changes were sufficient to convey airborne transmissibility among ferrets. They found that this new strain of H5N1 virus was less transmissible and caused a less severe disease than naturally occurring seasonal influenza. Additionally, ferrets previously exposed to seasonal flu were immune to infection with the new H5N1 virus. ", "The two groups submitted manuscripts to different scholarly journals. In both cases, the submission was to a publisher not based in the country where the experiments were performed.

Research on the influenza virus may provide ways to mitigate the effects of such a pandemic. However, most experts also agree that such research also increases the risk that an influenza pandemic could occur through accidental or deliberate release of a modified virus.

Future experiments may build upon these results to further scientific understanding of how influenza virus causes disease in different animals. Such experiments could create new approaches to treating and preventing the disease. Prior to this work, scientists did not know whether H5N1 virus could ever become easily transmissible between humans, and if so, how likely it would be to occur. As discussed above, both groups found that some H5N1 viruses are transmitted through the air between ferrets. ", "Additionally, the five genetic changes that Dr. Fouchier's group found sufficient to cause mammalian transmissibility have each been identified in naturally occurring H5N1 viruses. This suggests the possibility that all five could appear in the same strain through natural processes. This observation has led some experts to suggest that looking for these five genetic changes together in nature may provide advanced warning of a coming pandemic. Other experts suggest that current surveillance efforts are inadequate for this task. Additionally, focusing specifically on these genetic changes may cause researchers to miss other genetic changes that would also cause the virus to become transmissible between humans. Dr. Kawaoka suggested a slightly different strategy, \"rather than watching for specific genetic changes, it is more important to scan for the traits they bestow.\" That type of surveillance might identify strains with human pandemic potential without relying on a list of known genetic changes associated with human transmission.

Some observers worry that modified H5N1 virus might escape from laboratories causing a human pandemic. Some of these experts assert that research that increases contagiousness or disease severity should not be done because of the danger posed by possible release. Although it is not possible to accurately predict how a modified virus would affect humans, some analysts warn that the 1918 influenza pandemic, which had devastating social effects, was caused by a virus with a lower fatality rate than unmodified H5N1. They assert that the potential harm from a pandemic outweighs any possible benefits from the research. Other observers assert that this work can be safely conducted using appropriate precautions. For example, Dr. Fouchier and Dr. Kawaoka performed these experiments following widely accepted guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for working with potentially dangerous pathogens. However, even laboratories licensed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for work with \"select agents,\" dangerous regulated pathogens, have known accidental releases.", "Other potential harms could come from adversaries. Experts on a federal biosecurity advisory board highlight the possibility that published research could provide adversaries a \"roadmap\" to create a bioweapon. In general, scientific publication provides enough information so that the experiments can be replicated. Such independent verification is a cornerstone of modern science. However, experiments could be replicated for malicious purposes by those lacking sufficient skill or experience to perform the original research. It is difficult to assess the risks posed by publishing dual-use research results in general. In the present case of the H5N1 influenza manuscripts, modifying the virus independently would require additional technical knowledge and skill even with publication of experimental methods. In addition, the transmissibility and severity of the disease from the modified H5N1 virus is unknown. On the other hand, if the modified virus were highly transmissible between people and caused severe disease, it could cause a pandemic with devastating societal effects. Given the potential effects, it is conceivable that some adversary might attempt to use these research results for malicious purposes.

Deemed exports are treated the same as other exports. Thus, foreign nationals may require export licenses or be completely prohibited from performing some research if the contract or grant contains prepublication review provisions, since these would disqualify it for the fundamental research exemption.

The need for an effective, practical, and feasible mechanism for selectively sharing sensitive scientific information has never been more apparent. In order to manage the risks posed by communicating future cases of dual-use research of concern, the Board strongly urges the U.S. Government to develop in an expeditious manner a practical and secure mechanism for sharing sensitive scientific information in order to support public health, safety, and security efforts.", "The Department of Health and Human Services initially endorsed this approach and began exploring how to establish such a mechanism, but HHS ultimately rejected this option as infeasible for the two H5N1 influenza manuscripts.", "Limiting general access to research results has several challenges. These challenges include formalizing the criteria for identifying this information; the need to identify what entity would establish the infrastructure to store and retain control of the restricted information; how access to the restricted information can be assessed for current and future researchers; what penalties or other mechanism would be invoked to limit secondary dissemination of the information (either through subsequent publication of research building on the restricted information or through more informal information exchange); and how to facilitate restricted information exchange across international borders in order to meet treaty and other obligations.", "Experts have questioned whether such controls would be effective. Scientists and other professionals regularly exchange preliminary information through seminars, conferences, and other informal gatherings. If, at a later date, federal government deems such information should be restricted, it may be difficult or impossible for the government to prevent its spread. Similarly, publishers of scientific research generally distribute information, not restrict information, and may lack the infrastructure or inclination to compartmentalize information with respect to their subscribers. For example, the editors of Nature have stated that they will not consider limiting distribution of any data that have been submitted to them. The editors of Science support the development of an international system to provide access to information deemed not openly publishable to those with a \"need to know.\" ", "International ramifications of a limited access approach may be significant. The WHO determined that controlling the distribution of influenza research results would likely damage worldwide pandemic influenza preparedness by reducing the willingness of countries to share samples of influenza virus. In addition, other countries' export regulations might or might not limit dissemination of information restricted by another country, requiring further harmonization with treaty obligations and mechanisms to determine scientific credentials.", "These challenges may be surmountable with sufficient federal investment. The federal government maintains information with access restrictions, has cataloged publications and best practices, and oversees a credentialing system for researchers who wish physical access to certain pathogens known as select agents.

This new policy raises several challenges, including the completeness of such a review, the mechanism and criteria for identifying research projects, and the mechanism and criteria for assessing risk and its mitigation. While this policy initially may identify some dual-use research of concern, it also may not identify all dual-use research of concern. In some cases, the research results that might qualify as dual-use research of concern arise unexpectedly out of the research activities. Periodic review of ongoing research projects could identify these unforeseen results, but may create its own set of challenges.

Federal agencies often fund dual-use research, only some of which reaches the higher threshold of being \"of concern.\" Thus, those program managers or other officials reviewing research projects could spend most of their reviews identifying activities that are not dual-use research of concern. This may affect the accuracy of review if program managers develop expectations regarding their research portfolio based on past reviews.", "In addition, some experts have argued that the dual-use implications of a research activity vary depending on an analyst's perspective. Some analysts, for example, question whether the risks of performing federal biodefense research activities outweigh the potential benefits.

While the NIH intentionally established a narrow scope to its policy deliberation, it has not achieved stakeholder consensus on the details of its policy. Efforts to broaden the approach taken by NIH regarding the specific H5N1 influenza transmissibility research policy may be even more difficult because of the expanded stakeholder base and diversity of research activity. On the other hand, the NIH process may serve as a template and provide lessons learned for future efforts to develop similar policies in other life-science areas, research fields, or funding agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope", "paragraphs": ["Concomitant with the other policy considerations is the issue of how broadly to apply new federal dual-use policies.

The list of covered organisms and toxins does not include all those that have been deemed by the federal government to pose a significant potential threat to national security or public health in other contexts, such as under the select agent regulations or included as NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. Thus, research on such pathogens that increases their harmful effects or decreases their response to countermeasures would not be identified by this policy. ", "Additionally, research on unlisted pathogens that could also apply to related covered pathogens may not be identified by this policy. In 2001, researchers serendipitously discovered modifications to mousepox virus that rendered mousepox vaccination in mice ineffective.

The OSTP acknowledges that its scope is limited, but states that it may be broadened in the future to cover additional pathogens or types of experiments. It grants research institutions discretion to consider other types of life sciences research under it proposed DURC framework.", "Stakeholders may also note that this proposed policy applies only to federal-government-sponsored research. The government only funds about 53% of basic research and 39% of applied research conducted domestically. Research not sponsored by the government is not covered by this new dual-use research of concern policy. However, research institutions that do not receive federal life science funding are \"strongly encouraged to implement similar oversight procedures consistent with the culture of shared responsibility underpinning this Policy.\"", "Broadening the scope of the OSTP policies on federal oversight of dual-use research of concern may address many of these potential shortcomings.

Assessment of all research activities might require significant investment by executive branch agencies, due to the large number of research grants and contracts awarded by the federal government annually.

Some scientists have asserted that licensing researchers, facilities, or experiments would have a strong, negative impact on scientific productivity in those areas. However, the registration of life scientists wishing to work with select agents has shown that many scientists are willing to engage in such licensed research.
