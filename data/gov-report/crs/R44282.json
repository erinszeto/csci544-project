The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program reports that in 2014 it served 512,214 low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the United States, 25.4% of whom were uninsured and 64.2% of whom were living at or below 100% of the federal poverty level.", "The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its statutory authority is Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, originally enacted in 1990 and composed of four major parts and several other components. Part A provides grants to urban areas and mid-sized cities. Part B provides grants to states and territories; it also provides funds for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). Part C provides early intervention grants to public and private nonprofit entities. Part D provides grants to public and private nonprofit entities for family-centered care for women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS. The other components under Part F include the AIDS Dental Reimbursement (ADR) Program, the Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs), the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program, and the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI). In October 2009, the 111th Congress passed and President Obama signed the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-87), which reauthorized the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program through September 30, 2013. The program's authority is currently expired, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for the program.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance; therefore, the ACA has the potential to increase coverage for people living with HIV/AIDS. For example, ACA includes prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition, elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage, and eligibility for tax subsidies to help low- and middle-income individuals purchase coverage from a health insurance exchange. ACA phases out the Medicare Part D \"doughnut hole\" (i.e., payment gap) for HIV/AIDS individuals who are Medicare eligible, which should increase coverage of HIV/AIDS drugs. Finally, the ACA permits states to broaden Medicaid eligibility to include non-elderly adults. There could be a significant impact on Ryan White ADAP clients in states that expand their Medicaid program; specifically, about half of ADAP clients would be Medicaid-eligible in expansion states, and the remainder would likely be eligible for premium subsidies to purchase health coverage on the exchange.", "The long-range impact of ACA on the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program\u2014in which HIV care and treatment services provided under Ryan White are replaced by access to such services through health insurance coverage via ACA\u2014remains to be determined. Prior to the ACA's implementation, many Ryan White patients were insured and used Ryan White funds to pay premiums and cost sharing, and this need for funds is likely to remain as some Ryan White patients transition to private insurance. In states that decide not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, the need for the full range of Ryan White services would remain. However, even if all states decide to cover the new Medicaid-eligible group, there will be gaps that the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program could continue to fill, such as coverage of those individuals with HIV/AIDS who are undocumented immigrants, and training of health providers in HIV-related care. In addition, Ryan White provides dental care and support services, such as medical transportation, that may not be provided under Medicaid or private health insurance. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program serves a public health role by keeping people in treatment and thereby decreasing the risk of transmitting HIV to others.", "Funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program in FY2016, provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029, P.L. 114-113), is $2.323 billion. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requests $2.298 billion in budget authority and $34 million via a PHS transfer for the SPNS program, resulting in an FY2017 total of $2.332 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The $9 million increase over FY2016 is for a new SPNS initiative to expand screening for and treatment of hepatitis C in people living with HIV.

The remaining individuals were either uninsured and obtained services through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (24%), or their insurance coverage information was missing or unknown (8%). In 2012, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program served more than a half million low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS in the United States, of whom 28% were uninsured and 59% were underinsured. The CDC estimates that more than 1.2 million people have HIV/AIDS, but does not indicate the percentage of this population that is low income. Among those who were underinsured, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds were used to supplement insurance gaps.", "The ACA expanded insurance coverage through a number of different provisions. Specifically, it expanded public coverage for low-income individuals through the Medicaid program. It also made a number of changes to the private insurance market, created a standardized marketplace for individuals to purchase insurance coverage and premium subsidies for individuals whose incomes were too high for Medicaid, but were otherwise unable to afford private insurance coverage.", "The ACA may affect the need for, and use of, certain services provided by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.

This expansion, where implemented, is a significant change for the Medicaid program, which generally requires individuals to belong to a categorically eligible group: children, pregnant women, parents of dependent children, the elderly, or the disabled. Some states elected to implement the Medicaid expansion prior to January 2014; these states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington State. As of November 2015, more than half of all states (including the District of Columbia) have adopted the Medicaid expansion.

HRSA is examining the effects of Medicaid expansion on the ADAP program. So far, HRSA has found that Medicaid expansion states reduced their number of ADAP clients; in contrast, non-expansion states saw an increase in ADAP clients. In expansion states ADAP funds may still be used to supplement Medicaid coverage. For example, ADAP funds can be used to assist people with Medicaid cost sharing and to pay for monthly prescriptions because some states limit the number of monthly prescriptions its Medicaid program will pay for.", "HRSA predicts that the Medicaid expansion will have minimal effects on the non-ADAP parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, primarily because data show that, prior to the ACA, Medicaid beneficiaries accessed Ryan White primary medical care services. HRSA predicts that the use of these services by Medicaid beneficiaries will continue. HRSA also found that most non-ADAP clients are insured (either publicly or privately). In addition, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides certain services, such as dental care, that not all state Medicaid programs provide to adults.

The ACA generally made changes to non-group coverage in ways that may increase access to health insurance for the U.S. population as well as coverage for people living with HIV/AIDS. Specifically, the ACA prohibits the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition, and eliminates the lifetime caps on insurance benefits. Individuals with HIV/AIDs may have been at risk for either policy cancellation or of reaching lifetime caps. It is expected that these ACA changes will benefit the HIV/AIDS population.

HRSA and others note that Ryan White funds are increasingly being used for insurance premiums and cost sharing.", "A 2014 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at ACA implementation in five states, examining the use of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds and challenges that individuals faced. This study suggests that Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds were being increasingly used to help people enroll in exchange plans and then to educate people about how to use insurance coverage. This was particularly a challenge, as some Ryan White clients had little experience with the use of health insurance. In some cases, this lack of experience resulted in individuals enrolling in a high-deductible plan, which would pay only after the deductible had been met. As such, some could not afford to meet this deductible and continued to rely on the ADAP program for their medication. The Kaiser study found that the ACA changes to insurance coverage has enabled some Ryan White clients to better manage their non-HIV related medical conditions. ", "HRSA notes that there have been challenges with coverage of HIV medication under exchange plans. Other studies have also found that some individuals who transitioned from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to an exchange plan have experienced difficulty obtaining their HIV medication. Specifically, there was large variation in cost of HIV drugs depending on the plan design; certain insurance plans placed all HIV drugs in the most expensive tier, resulting in greater out of pocket spending (an estimated $3,000 annually), or causing individuals to rely on Ryan White funds to pay their drug costs.

However, even if all states decide to cover the new Medicaid-eligible group provided under ACA, there will be gaps that the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program could continue to fill, such as coverage of those individuals with HIV/AIDS who are undocumented immigrants or legal immigrants within the five-year Medicaid ban. Ryan White also provides dental care and support services, such as medical transportation, that may not be provided under Medicaid or private health insurance. Some analysts expect that the need for Ryan White funds to pay premiums and out of pocket expenses for individuals who are able to obtain private health insurance coverage on an exchange should continue and may grow. Such expenses may be significant if individuals enroll in high-deductible plans or for those who are on long-term medication.", "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds are also used to train health care providers. The ACA, by expanding coverage, could increase the need for such training. Although this issue is debated, some analysts have voiced concerns about whether enough physicians will be available to care for individuals who were previously uninsured.

This public health role differs from the role of payers, who generally do not focus on public health initiatives.
