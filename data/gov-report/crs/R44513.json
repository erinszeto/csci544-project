As of December 2016, Turkish-supported forces appear focused on obtaining control of Al Bab, a key transport hub that has been controlled since 2014 by the Islamic State and is coveted by all parties involved in the ongoing conflict in northern Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that subsequent Turkish-supported action in Manbij is possible. In August 2016, Vice President Biden called for all Kurdish fighters in Manbij to retreat east of the Euphrates River, and the OIR spokesperson said that this retreat had either occurred or was ongoing as of mid-November.

The embedding of U.S. forces on both sides could be a way to keep communications open between the two and try to reduce the possibility of armed conflict. However, the OIR spokesperson stated in mid-November 2016 that U.S. forces were not providing airstrikes in support of Turkish operations focused on Al Bab, and that embedded U.S. forces had been decoupled from Turkish-supported forces when it began advancing on Al Bab. He said that Turkey was pursuing these operations \"independently and what we'd like to do is continue to work with them to develop a plan where everyone remains focused on Daesh.\" Some media sources have speculated that the Syrian government (with Russian support) was behind a November 24 airstrike that killed four Turkish special forces personnel near Al Bab, indicating that a number of actors may be concerned about Turkish designs on that strategically important place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Syrian Kurdish Political Aspirations", "paragraphs": ["As the PYD has extended its de facto political control throughout areas controlled or seized by the YPG, it has sought greater public and international legitimacy.

The PYD has sought to participate in international talks regarding Syria's political future, but has been excluded to date based in part on objections from Turkey, which has insisted that other Syrian Kurds should participate. Turkey had hosted PYD leader Salih Muslim on multiple occasions prior to the resumption of Turkey-PKK violence in 2015. The PYD still faces some opposition from other Syrian Kurdish groups, and some human rights organizations (as discussed below) have questioned YPG compliance with international laws and norms in areas it controls.

Along those lines, in September 2016 Syrian Kurdish authorities conducted a census among the population in areas under their control in preparation for eventual elections. In June 2016, one analyst wrote, \"While some Syrian opposition groups have attacked the PYD for not doing enough to integrate Arabs, it has also been criticized by other Kurdish parties for doing too much.\" Although Syrian Kurds have instituted a measure of self-rule with regard to education, other basic services, and even their own representational offices in some foreign countries, they reportedly remain dependent on the Syrian government \"to pay the majority of civil-servant salaries, issue high-school and college diplomas, and run the region's airport.\" Turkey and the KRG have generally closed their borders to goods from PYD-controlled areas of Syria.", "Beyond Turkey's clear objections to the influence that greater Syrian Kurdish autonomy might have on the aspirations of Turkey's Kurds, a Syrian Kurdish-led federal region would have implications for a number of other stakeholders in Syria's conflict. It could affect the military posture and political aspirations of Syria's government, the Islamic State, various other Sunni groups, and minorities. It could also influence the calculations of outside actors. In a March 17, 2016, daily press briefing, the State Department spokesperson stated U.S. opposition to \"self-rule, self-autonomous zones,\" while expressing openness to a federal system if chosen by the Syrian people.

The Syrian government and the PYD/YPG have been relatively non-belligerent throughout Syria's civil conflict, and some sources have reported that the two have made occasional common cause. But the PYD/YPG has a historically grounded wariness of the Asad regime, and clashes between the two broke out in the city of Al Hasakeh in August 2016. Some reports indicate that the YPG had even received occasional military assistance from the regime, and that Russian forces in Syria had enabled some YPG military actions west of the Euphrates, particularly before Russia and Turkey improved their previously degraded relations (in relation to the Turkish downing of a Russian aircraft in November 2015) in June 2016.

Brett McGurk, the Special Presidential Envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, stated that U.S. Special Forces would assist as advisors in the operation (dubbed \"Euphrates Rage\"). In a November 10 Defense Department briefing, the OIR spokesperson indicated that U.S. forces in the region were providing air support to the SDF\u2014including both YPG and Arab fighters (the Arabs within the SDF are sometimes known as the \"Syrian Arab Coalition\")\u2014as part of the operations to isolate Raqqah.

By U.S. officials' accounts, Kurdish YPG elements of the SDF remain the most numerous and capable, and will feature prominently in the operation. However, General Dunford explicitly stated in his September 22 congressional testimony that Kurdish forces are \"not intended to hold Raqqa.\" In the OIR spokesperson's November 3 briefing, he acknowledged that building up the Arab contingent of the SDF was of particular importance \"because we do understand that Raqqah is primarily an Arab city. And \u2026 just like the Iraqis have done in Mosul, we do understand that there is a political dimension and a local acceptance dimension to this fight.\"", "U.S. military officials have indicated that they view the SDF's previous use of local forces as a model for future operations in and around Raqqah. According to Lt. Gen. Townsend, in various other areas of northern Syria\u2014including the strategically positioned town of Manbij\u2014the coalition and its partners had \"recruited forces from the local area that were part of the assault force to liberate that area. And they form the core of the whole force that will stay.\" It is unclear to what extent local forces are able to secure these smaller areas in northern Syria without a residual YPG presence, and to what extent similar operations might be successful on a larger scale in Raqqah. ", "U.S. officials acknowledge that recruitment, training, and actual operations involving newer local forces will be challenging and potentially time-consuming. Townsend has anticipated that most of the recruiting and basic combat training will be done by existing SDF forces, with the training likely taking place in areas of northern Syria somewhat removed from Raqqah. U.S. advisors would assist with \"specialty courses, weapons, leadership courses.\" The OIR spokesperson, in his November 3 briefing, said that the time period for training is generally not very long, partly because many recruits will have had previous fighting experience.

Turkish President Erdogan and other Turkish officials insist that the coalition abandon its support for the YPG, and propose that Turkish-supported forces could participate with the United States in operations in and around Raqqah. Although Turkish-supported forces in Operation Euphrates Shield have achieved some successes, questions exist about Turkey's willingness and capability to shape political outcomes in Syria via military action and support.

It is also unclear to what extent Raqqah and its immediate vicinity is an area of priority for the YPG or Turkey, particularly in light of the ongoing rivalry between the two for Al Bab and Manbij.
