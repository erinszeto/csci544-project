ASFA is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law in nearly 20 years.", "Most provisions in the 1997 law amended Titles IV-B or IV-E of the Social Security Act, which authorize grants to states for child welfare activities, including foster care and adoption assistance. In FY2004, Titles IV-B and IV-E received appropriations totaling $7.6 billion. As enacted in 1980 (P.L. 96-272), the underlying law requires states to make \"reasonable efforts\" on behalf of abused and neglected children or children at risk of abuse and neglect, to ensure that services are provided to their families so they can remain safely at home or return home if they have been placed in foster care. States also must conduct administrative and court hearings on every child's case according to a prescribed timetable and establish a permanent placement plan for each child.", "Periodically since P.L. 96-272 was enacted, concern arose that some states and judges interpreted the federal child welfare laws as requiring family preservation and reunification at all costs, including in cases where the child's health or safety was in jeopardy. ASFA was intended to clarify federal policy to ensure safety for children who come into contact with the child welfare system. Moreover, ASFA was intended to expedite permanency for foster children and to promote adoption for those children who cannot safely return home.", "Since 1997, all states have enacted their own laws to implement parts of ASFA, and the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued regulations to implement certain provisions of the 1997 law.

HHS also issued several reports as mandated by ASFA.", "Finally, ASFA authorized annual incentive payments to states that exceeded their highest previous number of foster child adoptions in a given year, with larger payments for adoptions of children with special needs. Congress reauthorized and revised this program in 2003 (P.L. 108-145), to create separate incentives for adoptions of older children. For adoptions in FY1998-FY2003, states \"earned\" a total of $178 million (of which $17.9 million were earned by 31 states and Puerto Rico for adoptions finalized in 2003).

Moreover, P.L. 105 - 89 states that it does not preclude individual judges from using their discretion to protect a child's health and safety in any case, regardless of whether the specific circumstances are cited in federal law. At the same time, the federal law does not prohibit states from making efforts to preserve or reunify a family in any case.", "According to NCSL, the aggravated circumstances most typically included in state definitions are those listed in the federal law.

(HHS specified in the January 2000 regulations that states must obtain a judicial determination that such reasonable efforts were made within 12 months of the date the child entered foster care and at least once every subsequent 12 months that the child remains in care.) The law further provides that states must document specific efforts made to place the child for adoption. In enacting these provisions, Congress intended to shorten the length of time that children spend in foster care, once a court has determined that family reunification is not feasible or likely.", "ASFA also specifies that efforts to preserve or reunify a family can be made at the same time as efforts are being made to place the child for adoption or guardianship. This practice is referred to as \"concurrent planning\" and allows states to develop a back-up plan in order to save time in the event that efforts to restore the original family are unsuccessful.", "The Adoption and Safe Families Act also contains provisions intended to eliminate interjurisdictional issues as a potential barrier to a child's adoption. First, the law requires states to assure in their Title IV-B plans that they will develop plans to make effective use of cross-jurisdictional resources to facilitate timely adoptions for waiting children. As originally enacted, the law also denied federal foster care and adoption assistance funding, under Title IV-E, to any state that is found to have denied or delayed a child's adoptive placement if an approved family is available outside the child's jurisdiction, or has denied a fair hearing to anyone who alleges a violation of this provision. The law was subsequently amended ( P.L. 105 - 200 ) to establish a graduated series of financial penalties, rather than a complete denial of funding, in cases of such violations. HHS released a program instruction in October 2002 to further clarify the regulations on interjurisdictional adoptions, including how penalties would be assessed. In addition, ASFA directed the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study of interjurisdictional adoption issues, including the implementation of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; GAO's report was published in November 1999.

In its January 2000 regulations, HHS specified that states must document a compelling reason for selecting \"another planned, permanent living arrangement\" and gave the following examples of such compelling reasons:", "an older teen specifically requests a permanency plan of emancipation from foster care; a parent and child are strongly bonded but the parent cannot care for the child because of an emotional or physical disability and the child's foster parents have agreed to raise the child to maturity and to enable visits with the natural parent; a tribe has identified another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.", "HHS also specified in its regulations that the written case plan for a child be developed within a reasonable period established by the state, but no later than 60 days after the child's removal from home.

This provision responded to concerns about the number of children who were remaining in foster care for long periods of time and who were not likely to return home. Prior to 1997, there was no comparable provision in federal law. Specifically, P.L. 105 - 89 requires states to initiate TPR proceedings in any case where the court has found that a parent has lost parental rights to that child's sibling; killed another of his or her children or committed felony assault against the child or a sibling, or subjected the child to aggravated circumstances (known as the fast track provision); or for infants determined under state law to be abandoned. In addition, the law requires states to initiate TPR proceedings for children who have been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months (known as the 15 of 22 provision). States can opt not to initiate such proceedings if the child is in a relative's care, or if the state agency has documented in the child's case plan a compelling reason to determine that TPR would not be in the child's best interest, or if the state has not provided necessary services to the family.", "Regulations issued by HHS on January 25, 2000 require that states must file the TPR petition by the end of the child's 15 th month in care and provide a methodology for calculating when this date occurs. For example, trial home visits or runaway episodes are not counted toward the 15 months. The regulation also specifies that if the state decides not to initiate TPR proceedings at the 15-month point with regard to a particular child, because an exception exists in that child's case as allowed under the law, then the state does not need to apply the 15-month TPR requirement to that child's case again.", "In the case of an abandoned child, the regulations require the state to initiate TPR proceedings within 60 days of a court determination that the child is abandoned (as defined by the individual state). Likewise, in the case of a child whose parent has been convicted of a felony specified in the law, the regulations require the state to initiate TPR proceedings within 60 days of a court determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the child with that parent are not required.", "As stated above, the law allows\u2014but does not require\u2014certain exceptions to the TPR requirement, including that there is a compelling reason for determining that such proceedings are not in the child's best interests.

For children who already were in care on the date of enactment, states could phase in compliance with the TPR requirement but had to be in compliance for all children by no later than 18 months after the end of the legislative session.

Some child welfare agency staff stated that the timeframes helped them work more effectively with parents by being able to inform them of the steps and timelines in the reunification process. Some states and agencies expressed concern, though, that the timeframes may rush the adoption or reunification process and lead to higher re-entry rates into foster care.", "The GAO study also found that few states were using the fast track provision due to a variety of court-related issues, such as judges or legal officials who are at times reluctant to approve a fast track request and difficulty in scheduling TPR hearings. Other reported difficulties in utilizing the fast track option included father's rights issues; the desire to give a parent another opportunity to demonstrate the ability to care for a subsequent child; and the length of time from a child's removal from the home to a parent's conviction of an applicable crime. Some states reported using the fast track provision in cases of infant abandonment or cases involving serious abuse. States are not required to collect data on their use of the fast track provision, and most states are not collecting this data.", "Similarly to the fast track provision, states are not required to collect data on the 15 of 22 provision, and few states collect it. In its report, GAO recommended to HHS that it review the feasibility of collecting\u2014in a cost-efficient manner\u2014data on state usage of the fast track and 15 of 22 provisions, including the number of children exempted and reasons for those exemptions. Of the nine states that did provide GAO with information on the 15 of 22 provision, most indicated there were more cases which were exempted than actually utilized it. For example, in Oklahoma, just over 1,000 TPRs were filed because the child was in care for 15 of 22 months; however, nearly 3,000 children who had been in care for 15 of 22 months were exempted from the requirement to file a TPR. States provided a number of reasons as to why they might not request a TPR for a child who has been in care for 15 of 22 months. These reasons included adoption is not a realistic option; a TPR would not be in the best interest of the child; the child's parents need more than 15 months to address their problems; and court delays for hearings and appeals.", "Information on state use of the ASFA TPR provisions is collected during the on-site portion of federal compliance reviews and beginning with the reviews conducted in FY2002, HHS standardized the way this information is provided in each state's final report. Of the 35 states reviewed in FY2002, findings from 12 states indicated that agencies are not filing for TPR in a timely manner and their reasons for not filing are not provided in the case files.

The law authorized $20 million annually for these incentive payments for FY1999 through FY2003. In addition, the law provided for an automatic adjustment to discretionary budget caps, to help ensure that these funds would actually be appropriated.

However, the special needs payment is now limited only to adoptions of special needs children who are under age nine at the time the adoption is finalized. The Adoption Promotion Act created a third incentive payment, equal to $4,000, for increased adoptions of children who are age nine or older at the time of adoption. Like the original two incentive payments, states have to exceed their baseline number of such \"older child\" adoptions to earn this payment. For all three incentive payments, the baseline that states must exceed is revised each year to the highest annual total of such adoptions since FY2002. P.L. 108 - 145 also reauthorized for FY2004 through FY2006 the provisions concerning technical assistance to states and localities (including the language reserving 50% of appropriations for assistance to courts) to help increase adoptions or other permanent placements for children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["The history of appropriations for adoption incentive payments is somewhat complicated because states\u2014as a group\u2014exceeded lawmakers' expectations and finalized more adoptions in the early years of the program than Congress had anticipated.

In addition, the law provided for an automatic increase in discretionary budget caps (up to $20 million) to help ensure that these funds were actually appropriated for each year. However, in some years, the amount of incentive payments that states actually \"earned\" exceeded the $20 million level. As a result, Congress, when necessary, provided additional amounts (above the $20 million), usually in subsequent years' appropriations bills, to enable HHS to pay states the full amount of incentive payments earned.

Additionally, states reported that, because the awards were relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets, they were able to use their funds in innovative and flexible manners. No state reported that the adoption incentive bonus was the primary motivator for improving its adoption system. The primary concerns of states regarding the incentives were that they may give the impression that adoption is the best plan in all cases, that states with increased adoptions before ASFA may have trouble exceeding their baselines (this concern was expressed before the 2003 reauthorization updated the baselines), and that the law did not make further changes in the structure of federal funding for child welfare."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional ASFA Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Additional provisions in P.L. 105 - 89 : gave child welfare agencies access to the Federal Parent Locator Service; clarified eligibility for the independent living program; established a sense of Congress in favor of standby guardianship laws; and made a statement of intent about \"reasonable\" parenting.

This has made it difficult to determine how much of the shift in child welfare outcomes and data was due to ASFA or other state and federal laws and programs.", "The lack of comparable and reliable pre- and post-ASFA data also limits the analysis of ASFA's effects. For example, GAO (2002) noted that the University of Chicago collected pre-ASFA child welfare data for several states, but this data cannot be matched with data from HHS because of differences in the measurement techniques. Additionally, children often remain in foster care for several years before being adopted, and, therefore, evidence of the effects of the 1997 enactment of ASFA were not necessarily immediately apparent. Nonetheless, current data can provide useful information on the characteristics and experiences of the child welfare population after the enactment of the 1997 law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Demographics of Child Welfare System", "paragraphs": ["The number of public child welfare agency adoptions began to rise before enactment of ASFA but rose more sharply after the law's passage, from approximately 31,000 children in 1997 to more than 52,500 in 2002. (See Figure 1 .) HHS analysis of data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) has revealed various characteristics of children in the public child welfare system. Children in care are increasingly being adopted by relatives (from 15% of adoptions in FY1998 to 24% in FY2001). Black non-Hispanic children comprised 43% of adoptions in FY1998 and 35% of adoptions in FY2001; Hispanic children were 12% of adoptions in FY1998 and 16% in FY2001; and white non-Hispanic children were 37% of adoptions in FY1998 and 38% in FY2001. Among children waiting for adoption (defined as children with a goal of adoption and/or a TPR issued), their average age at the time of removal from home increased during the FY1998-FY2001 period, from 4.1 years to 4.7 years. The average age of waiting children at a given point in time also rose, from 7.7 years at the end of FY1998 to 8.4 years at the end of FY2001.", "One of the primary goals of ASFA was to expedite legal proceedings so that children who cannot safely return to their families can more quickly move to adoption or another permanent placement. Several ASFA provisions were intended to expedite the process for obtaining termination of parental rights in the hopes that this would, in turn, shorten the length of time a child who could not be returned home would remain in foster care. For children who were waiting for adoption, the average time from removal to obtaining a TPR decreased from 37 months in FY1998 to 30 months in FY2001. However, for those waiting children whose parental rights had been terminated, their average time spent in foster care since TPR was achieved increased slightly, from 22 months in FY1998 to 24 months in FY2001. The total continuous time spent in foster care for waiting children stayed steady at an average of 44 months.", "In its annual child welfare outcomes report, HHS presented information on state performance in finalizing adoptions within 24 months of the child's entry into foster care. For purposes of federal compliance reviews (Child and Family Services Reviews), HHS has established a national standard of 32% for this outcome; in other words, to achieve this national standard, at least 32% of adoptions must be finalized within 24 months.

Data from the phone poll also indicate that states which have already undergone a Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) have a better understanding of the requirements of ASFA and how to implement ASFA than states which have yet to undergo a CFSR.", "In order to meet the requirements set forth by ASFA, states have made adjustments to their service delivery systems and administrative practices. In response to ASFA, states have improved their data systems, worked more closely with the courts, passed legislation, and hired additional staff, such as attorneys and caseworkers. Interviews with state and local agency directors in 2000, conducted as a part of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), found that states were focusing on \"developing new casework strategies to promote child safety at the front end of service delivery.\" Some state administrators also noted that ASFA had an impact on permanency through reduction in time frames, the institution of concurrent planning at the front end of child welfare, reduction of time in foster care, and an increase in adoptions. State administrators also reported that they had experienced several unanticipated problems in implementing the ASFA requirements. These problems included providing substance abuse treatment to parents while maintaining the ASFA time frames; the lack of adoptive placements, especially for hard-to-place groups such as adolescents; backlogs in the juvenile courts; and child welfare staff being held accountable for time frames that were dependent on other agencies, such as the courts and mental health providers.", "The NSCAW study also provided information on ASFA's effect on local agencies. For approximately 60% of local agencies, ASFA led to a greater emphasis on child's safety when compared to family preservation programs, and 93% reported that ASFA shortened time frames for decision making to less than 12 months. Almost three-quarters of respondents noted an increased emphasis on adoption for children living in kinship care, and 54% indicated an increased emphasis on the adoption of older children. Most agencies indicated that they experienced no change in caseload numbers, but did report an increase in the average number of hours spent on each case. Thirty-three percent of local agencies reported that access to drug treatment for clients had been expedited."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
