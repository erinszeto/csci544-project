Some congressional prerogatives date back to the 18th century: Congress established the Department of State and began prescribing salaries for personnel in 1789, while Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides the Senate the authority to provide advice and consent for presidential appointments of ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls. The role of Congress expanded more gradually elsewhere. The executive branch maintained almost exclusive authority in developing the administrative policies governing the U.S. diplomatic and consular services and their personnel until the mid-19th century, when Congress codified compensation levels for individuals appointed to certain diplomatic and consular positions. Congressional purview over this area has subsequently expanded considerably, as Congress merged the diplomatic and consular services into a Foreign Service with the passage of the Rogers Act of 1924 (P.L. 68-135) and later modernized and refined the Foreign Service's policies and procedures through the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465).", "The Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual describes several categories of Foreign Service personnel at the Department of State. Many of these categories, or the authorities afforded to personnel employed within them, are provided through statute. In addition, the Department of State employed over 10,000 Civil Service (CS) employees as of December 2017, who work in 11 different job categories. Congress has long had a significant role in the administration of the Civil Service, whose framework is now defined in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-454), as amended.", "Looking Ahead", "While the President possesses a level of control over executive branch personnel policies, several options are available to the 115th Congress and future Congresses to facilitate, alter, block, or conduct oversight of the executive branch's initiatives. These include legislative action through Department of State or foreign relations authorization measures and annual appropriations bills or other measures, as well as periodic hearings on management and reform issues. On personnel issues, for example, Congress could encourage the Department of State to further increase hiring with additional appropriated funds to the Human Resources category of the department's Diplomatic & Consular Programs account, which is used to pay salaries for the department's domestic and overseas American employees. Congress could also weigh in on the department's plans to improve workforce management, or consider changes to aspects of the presidential appointments process."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Shortly following his confirmation as Secretary of State in April 2018, Secretary Mike Pompeo lifted the hiring freeze that former Secretary Rex Tillerson left in place for over a year.

", "In general, some supporters of personnel reform argue that the Department of State has become increasingly overstaffed and sclerotic in recent decades, and that reform is needed to restore the department's foreign policymaking influence that it is perceived to have lost to other government entities such as the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. Others, however, have asserted that some of the Administration's policies, especially those under Secretary Tillerson, were leading to a weak, understaffed Department of State incapable of advancing and protecting America's foreign policy and national security interests abroad. Among those who have demonstrated concern with the Administration's approach is Senator Robert Menendez, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, who has commented that \"we have an emaciated State Department under this Administration.\" Since his confirmation, Secretary Pompeo has pledged that he will work to enable the Department of State to play a central role in implementing President Trump's agenda and protecting the national security of the United States, empower the department's personnel in their roles, and ensure that department personnel have a clear understanding of the President's mission. ", "While the President possesses a level of control over personnel policies at the Department of State, Congress has demonstrated interest in leveraging its constitutional and statutory prerogatives to shape the department's personnel policies since at least the mid-19 th century, when it codified compensation levels for individuals appointed to certain diplomatic and consular positions. More recently, passage of the landmark Foreign Service Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-465 ), building upon previous legislation dating back to the early 20 th century, created the infrastructure for the modern-day Foreign Service, which is the United States' professional diplomatic corps tasked with serving at both U.S. overseas posts and in key diplomatic positions based at the department's headquarters in Washington, DC and elsewhere in the United States. Among other matters, the law prescribes the admission, appointment, promotion, and separation procedures of the Foreign Service. These provisions are designed to uphold congressional intent that, as reflected in legislation for over a century, America's diplomats serve as part of a professional organization wherein individuals are appointed and promoted in a manner that reflects merit principles. ", "In addition to the Foreign Service, the Department of State also employed over 10,000 Civil Service (CS) employees as of December 2017. Congress has long been engaged in governing the administration of the Civil Service, passing the Pendleton Act of 1883, which is viewed by many as the legal foundation of the Civil Service. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-454 ), as amended, provides the modern statutory framework for the Civil Service. ", "Given the priority the Trump Administration has placed on implementing changes affecting Department of State personnel, some Members of Congress with varying degrees of support for the Administration's efforts have demonstrated renewed interest in applying congressional prerogatives to ensure that any changes enhance American capabilities to project and protect its interests overseas. Factoring in the Administration's existing priorities and the fact that the Administration's policies could expand in scope, this report provides a comprehensive background summary of Department of State personnel infrastructure and practices, including those areas where policies were established or could be adjusted through congressional action. It begins with an overview of the Foreign Service, including a summary of legislative efforts to codify a professional Foreign Service and its key personnel policies. It then explores the department's Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel categories in some detail, specifying key statutes and authorities that remain relevant to current department workforce issues. The report concludes by identifying selected issues for Congress, which comprise areas where the Trump Administration is seeking to implement changes, and where Congress may seek to weigh in directly or indirectly.

The department's domestic staff was initially extremely small, consisting of only three clerks and translators when Thomas Jefferson became Secretary of State i n 1790 and expanding to 10 such individuals by the conclusion of the 18 th century. Similarly, U.S. diplomatic representation abroad was fair ly limited during this period\u2014 only two commissioned American diplomats were present in Europe when President Washington was inaugurated in 1789. By 1797 , the United States maintained diplomatic relations with France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain , yet had only limited diplomatic ties with other countries , including Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Emergence of a Professional Foreign Service and Key Related Statutes4", "paragraphs": ["For nearly 70 years subsequent to the founding of the Department of State in 1789, an individual employee's rank and salary were attached to a specific position. In practice, this meant that the President appointed individuals to specific posts (frequently his political allies) and, upon his own determination, set the compensation that the individual would receive at that post. If a person was sent to a subsequent overseas post, another appointment was required and a new compensation level was established. Because of funding constraints, ministers at larger posts such as London and Paris often had to spend their own funds to maintain their ability to provide representation, limiting the scope of individuals capable of serving at such posts. Some observers refer to this framework as the \"spoils system\" or a \"patronage system.\" When addressing the spoils system, President Theodore Roosevelt reflected that", "[t]he spoils system of making appointments to and removals from office is so wholly and unmixedly evil, is so emphatically un-American and undemocratic, and is so potent a force for degradation in our public life, that it is difficult to believe that any intelligent man of ordinary decency who has looked into the matter can be its advocate. As a matter of fact, the arguments in favor of the merit system against the spoils system are not only convincing; they are absolutely unanswerable.", "Congress codified compensation levels for individuals appointed to specific diplomatic and consular positions beginning in 1855, in effect taking compensation determinations out of the hands of the President. U.S. consuls were also provided, for the first time, with annual federal salaries, the amount depending on where they were posted. However, the federal government continued to staff its bureaucracy through the spoils system. Following the Civil War, difficulties stemming from the spoils systems were becoming increasingly evident throughout the federal government, including the Department of State. It is reported that Secretary of State Hamilton Fish (1869-1877) threatened President Ulysses Grant with his resignation if President Grant and his political allies did not stop interfering with the organization and operation of the department and appointments of diplomats and consular officers.", "During this period, graft was found to be especially rampant in the consular service. On September 20, 1885, President Grover Cleveland issued an executive order placing the lower grades of the consular service under a merit system with emphasis on \"character, responsibility and capacity\" as criteria for appointment. President Theodore Roosevelt made efforts to professionalize the diplomatic service, placing diplomatic officers under previous laws intended to reform the Civil Service and creating a Board of Examiners tasked with developing an entrance examination system testing knowledge of international law, diplomatic usage, and modern language skills. It also was tasked with developing and overseeing a merit promotion system for all diplomatic and consular positions except those of minister and ambassador. The Stone-Flood Act (P.L 63-242, also known as \"An Act for the Improvement of the Foreign Service\") was later enacted in 1915, which gave previous executive orders in this area the force of law. This law also divided personnel into their own classes or grades for the first time, assigned salary levels to classes or grades, and stated that appointments to a class \"shall be by commission to the offices of the secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, or consul, and not by commission to any particular post.\" This marked the first time that the \"rank-in-person\" concept was incorporated into law for diplomatic personnel.", "In addition to combining the U.S. diplomatic and consular services for the first time and establishing the modern Foreign Service, the Rogers Act of 1924 (P.L. 68-135) included several provisions to further professionalize the Foreign Service. It defined a Foreign Service Officer as a \"permanent officer in the Foreign Service below the grade of minister, all of whom are subject to promotion on merit, and who may be assigned to duty in either the diplomatic or the consular branch of the Foreign Service at the discretion of the President.\" Furthermore, this law", "established grades and classes of Foreign Service Officers and established salaries for those grades and classes; stated that appointments to the position of Foreign Service Officer shall be made after examination and a suitable period of probation in an unclassified grade, or after five years of continuous service in the Department of State by transfer to the Foreign Service upon meeting the rules and regulations established by the President; established that all appointments to the Foreign Service shall be by commission to a class and not by commission to any particular post, and that a Foreign Service Officer shall be assigned to a post and may be transferred by the President from post to post depending upon the interests of the service; stated that Foreign Service Officers may be appointed as secretaries in the diplomatic service or as consular officers or both and that any such appointment shall be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and authorized the President to establish a Foreign Service retirement and disability system to be administered by the Secretary of State, and provided for a mandatory retirement age of 65 with 15 years of service.", "Congress worked to consolidate and revise laws pertaining to the administration of the Foreign Service when it passed the Foreign Service Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-724). This law created a new Director General of the Foreign Service and a Foreign Service Board with the intent of improving the department's administration of the Foreign Service, while a new Board of Examiners was authorized and tasked with maintaining the principle of competitive entrance into the Foreign Service. According to the Department of State, \"the law also provided for improvements in assignments policy, promotion procedures, allowances and benefits, home leave, and the retirement system.\" Congress did not pass significant new legislation to govern the Foreign Service for several decades, until the Foreign Service Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-465 ) was enacted. Among other measures, this law created a new Senior Foreign Service and reformed overseas allowances and spousal rights. Selected aspects of this legislation are discussed in detail below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Professional Attributes of the Foreign Service Provided for in the Foreign Service Act of 1980", "paragraphs": ["Like the Foreign Service Act of 1946, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 sought to maintain and strengthen the Foreign Service's status as a professional diplomatic corps. The law provides for admission, appointment, promotion, and separation procedures that reflect merit principles and a rank-in-person merit classification system. Section 101 of the law reaffirms that \"a career foreign service, characterized by excellence and professionalism, is essential in the national interest to assist the President and the Secretary of State in conducting the foreign affairs of the United States.\" Section 105 provides that \"all personnel actions with respect to career members and career candidates in the service (including applicants for career candidate appointments) shall be made in accordance with merit principles.\" ", "With specific regard to admission procedures, Section 301 requires the Secretary of State to \"prescribe, as appropriate, written, oral, physical, foreign language, and other examinations for appointment to the service (other than as a chief of mission or ambassador at large).\" In addition, Section 211 requires the President to establish a Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service to develop and supervise the administration of these examinations to candidates for appointment. The President is required to appoint the Board's 15 members, at least five of whom must \"be appointed from among individuals who are not Government employees and who shall be qualified for service on the Board by virtue of their knowledge, experience, or training in the fields of testing or equal employment opportunity.\" The Board must be chaired by a member of the Foreign Service. Individuals who pass the examinations and are admitted into the Foreign Service are required to serve for a trial period that generally does not exceed five years under a limited appointment prior to receiving a career appointment in the Foreign Service. Section 306 of the law requires that any decision by the Secretary of State to recommend that the President give a career appointment to such an individual shall be informed \"based upon the recommendations of boards, established by the Secretary and composed entirely or primarily of career members of the service, which shall evaluate the fitness and aptitude of career candidates for the work of the service.\" ", "As with admission requirements and procedures, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 intends to ensure that appointments processes preserve and bolster the Foreign Service's status as a professional organization. Section 302 provides the President the authority to, \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint an individual as a chief of mission, as an ambassador at large, as an ambassador, as a minister, as a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, or as a Foreign Service officer.\" Section 301 clarifies that \"an appointment as a Foreign Service officer is a career appointment,\" while Section 303 indicates that the Secretary of State's appointment authorities do not extend to the personnel categories specified for presidential appointments in Section 302. Thus, all Foreign Service Officers (with the exception of some Senior Foreign Service Officers) are career members of the Foreign Service, appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and typically serve over the course of several presidential administrations. Section 305 provides for authorized limited, noncareer appointments to the Senior Foreign Service under certain circumstances. ", "Sections 305 and 404 further stipulate that Foreign Service officers and other personnel, and both career and noncareer members of the Senior Foreign Service, shall be appointed to salary classes\u2014rather than to individual positions\u2014that the Secretary of State is authorized to establish. These provisions undergird the Foreign Service personnel system as a rank-in-person, rather than rank-in-position, approach. Figure 1 illustrates one current pay schedule, providing the salary classes to which Foreign Service Officers are appointed and promoted. ", "This rank-in-person orientation of Foreign Service personnel practices is widely perceived as a merit-based system. Inherent to the rank-in-person system are the \"up or out rules,\" which are mandated in Section 607 the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (where they are known as \"time-in-class limitations\"). These rules require that both career members of the Senior Foreign Service and the Foreign Service are either promoted within a specified time period denoted for each salary class (or a combination of salary classes) or are otherwise retired from the service if not performing at an adequate level. The process the law prescribes for considering the promotion of members of the Senior Foreign Service and the Foreign Service is also intended to promote merit-based practices. Section 602 mandates the establishment of selection boards tasked with evaluating the performance of these personnel through ranking the members of a salary class on the basis of relative performance and making recommendations for personnel actions, including promotion. The membership of selection boards is required to include public members and \"a substantial number of women and members of minority groups.\" The law also requires that the selection boards' recommendations and rankings reflect \"records of the character, ability, conduct, quality of work, industry, experience, dependability, usefulness, and general performance of members of the service.\" Section 605 further provides that the Secretary of State shall make promotions (and, with respect to career appointments into or within the Senior Foreign Service, recommendations to the President for promotions) \"in accordance with the rankings of the selection boards.\" It also provides the Secretary the authority to delay the promotion of an individual designated for promotion on a selection board list or remove that individual from a list in \"special circumstances\" provided for by department regulations. ", "Finally, provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 governing the separation of members from the service for cause seek to further preserve the Foreign Service's professional character and ensure that individuals are not separated without due process. Section 610 provides that the Secretary of State may \"decide to separate any member from the service for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\" However, in most cases any member of the Foreign Service serving under a career appointment or a limited appointment may not be separated on the basis of misconduct until the member in question receives a hearing before the Foreign Service Grievance Board and the Board decides that cause for separation has been established. The Foreign Service Grievance Board is itself authorized in Section 1105 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The law requires that its membership comprise individuals approved by the exclusive representative (labor organization) representing Foreign Service employees and the department itself; to further help ensure impartiality, five of board members are required by law not to be department employees. It also authorizes the Foreign Service Grievance Board to intervene in cases where it determines that the department is considering the involuntary separation of a grievant for reasons other than cause. If the Foreign Service Grievance Board finds that a grievant's claim is valid, it is authorized to direct the Department of State to retain the member in the service.

The Foreign Service Act of 1980 also placed within the purview of Congress the admission, appointment, promotion, and separation procedures of the Foreign Service. It authorized the Senior Foreign Service and the appointment of Foreign Service Nationals, Eligible Family Members, and Consular Agents, and required that the Foreign Service operate in a fashion consistent with merit principles. Table 1 makes note of categories of Foreign Service personnel described in the FAM. ", "In other areas, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 gives more discretion to the executive branch. It does not prescribe the five \"cones\" within which Foreign Service Officers work, nor does it explicitly prescribe the titles for the Senior Foreign Service salary classes. In still other cases, the law provides for arrangements where responsibilities are shared by the legislative and executive branch. For example, although the Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires candidates for the career Foreign Service Officer to serve a trial period prior to their appointment, the department is afforded flexibility to determine the duration and nature of the trial period.

Section 302(a) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires that the President appoint Ambassadors and Ambassadors-at-Large by and with the advice and consent of the Senate in nearly all circumstances; the President can circumvent the Senate only with respect to conferring the personal rank of ambassador on an individual in connection with a special, temporary mission for the President not exceeding six months in duration and, separately, through the use of recess appointments. ", "U.S. ambassadors who lead U.S. embassies abroad and ambassadors who head other official U.S. missions are usually appointed by the President as the \"Chief of Mission\" (COM), which is the title conferred on the principal officer in charge of each U.S. diplomatic mission to a foreign country, foreign territory, or international organization. Each COM thus serves as the President's personal representative, leading diplomatic efforts for a particular mission or in the country of assignment under the general supervision of the Secretary of State and with the support of the regional assistant secretary of state. COM authority is authorized by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 and is also derived from an array of executive branch orders and directives. Section 207 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 states that under the direction of the President, a COM \"shall have full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of all Government executive branch employees in that country,\" except for Voice of America (VOA) correspondents on official assignment and employees under the command of a U.S. Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC).", "While Section 304 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 provides that \"positions as chief of mission should normally be accorded to career members of the [Foreign] Service,\" the President is not required to appoint exclusively career Foreign Service Officers as COMs. In recent Administrations, approximately 70% of appointees to U.S. ambassadorships have been career Foreign Service Officers, while the remainder have been political appointees. Section 401 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 authorizes the President to compensate COMs at one of the annual rates payable for levels II through V of the Executive Schedule, with some conditions. ", "Ambassadors-at-Large, on the other hand, are \"appointed by the President and serve anywhere in the world to help with emergent problems, to conduct special or intensive negotiations, or serve in other capacities, as requested by the Secretary or the President.\" All individuals currently serving at the rank of Ambassador-at-Large are based in Washington, DC (see Table 2 ), and none are therefore currently employed as COMs abroad. Ambassadors-at-Large generally rank immediately below assistant secretaries of state in terms of protocol.

Foreign Service Officers are also referred to by the Department of State as \"Foreign Service Generalists,\" a term that does not appear in the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The term \"generalist\" derives from the view that Foreign Service Officers should be sufficiently flexible to accept a variety of assignments and effectively transfer their skills successfully across different jobs. According to the Department of State's website, \"the mission of a U.S. diplomat in the Foreign Service is to promote peace, support prosperity, and protect American citizens while advancing the interests of the U.S. abroad.\" ", "As previously noted, Section 302 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 authorizes the President to appoint individuals as Foreign Service Officers, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, after such individuals serve under a limited appointment as a career candidate for a trial period of service prescribed by the Secretary of State.

Congress intended for entrance standards into the SFS to be higher than those previously applied for promotion into the senior ranks. More stringent entrance standards and time-in-class limitations were intended to ensure that the ranks of the Senior Foreign Service did not become bloated and corresponded more closely to the number of available senior-level posts.

Although OMB Memorandum M-17-22, issued in April 2017, subsequently lifted the hiring freeze, the Department of State elected to maintain its hiring freeze, including with respect to offering appointments to AEFMs. This move elicited criticism from some observers, who argued that that it harmed morale at overseas posts. They also charged that it negatively affected the ability of overseas posts to complete important tasks carried out by AEFMs, including staffing medical units, ensuring that local housing meets security standards, and overseeing infrastructure repairs and maintenance. Finally, they stated that it deprived the department of cost-savings from using AEFMs to fill certain jobs that would otherwise be filled by Foreign Service Officers.

Department of State officials offered a different assertion, attributing the broader decline in the number of Senior Foreign Service personnel largely to Senate inaction in approving career Senior Foreign Service promotions transmitted for advice and consent.

Congress has also passed provisions in recent years that may be in line with the department's efforts to enhance workforce readiness and, separately, performance management and personnel accountability. For example, Section 121 of the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 ( P.L. 114-323 ) mandated new security training requirements for personnel assigned to high risk, high-threat posts to prepare such individuals for living and working at such posts. These requirements could result in a larger pool of department personnel capable of serving at such posts and being deployed in response to an overseas crisis. Similarly, Section 713 of this law requires the Secretary of State to \"make every effort to recruit and retain individuals that have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities, including individuals who have studied at an Islamic institution of higher learning.\" Such efforts may result in a department workforce wherein personnel knowledge, skills, and experience align more closely with mission demands. Section 203 of the law seeks to strengthen the capacity of the Department of State Office of Inspector General to hold State Department employees accountable, requiring that \"the head of a bureau, post, or other office of the Department of State\" shall submit to the Inspector General \"a report of any allegation of waste, fraud, or abuse in a Department program or operation\" and criminal misconduct on the part of a Department employee\" not later than five business days after the date on which the head of the department entity was made aware of the allegation.

It could model any such provision in part from Section 7081(b)(3) of P.L. 115-141 . This measure provides for new conditions the department must consider as it weighs new major information technology investments, which could affect implementation of Impact Initiative's Modernizing Information Technology and Human Resources Operations focus area. If it sought to facilitate the Administration's efforts to improve workforce readiness, Congress could authorize additional training programs and requirements in a manner similar to the training requirements mandated by Section 121 of P.L. 114-323 . Such provisions could also be enacted if Congress believed the Administration's efforts to improve readiness were incorrectly targeted, as Congress has the authority to authorize training programs focused on specified programmatic areas. Appropriations for such programs could be provided through additional funds appropriated to the Human Resources Programmatic Allocation of the Diplomatic & Consular Programs Account or, to ensure specific funding levels, through line-item appropriations. The State Department's stated efforts to improve performance management and employee accountability may prompt Congress to amend provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 that address these areas. For example, Section 610 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 provides that the Secretary of State may \"decide to separate any member from the service for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\" However, in many cases Senior Foreign Service Officers and Foreign Service Officers may not be separated from the service until the member receives a hearing before the Foreign Service Grievance Board and the Board decides that cause for separation has been established.

Former Secretary Tillerson issued hiring freeze waivers on several occasions, including to authorize new A-100 Generalist courses for incoming Foreign Service Officers and, separately, to allow for the employment of Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs) at overseas posts. Some Members of Congress and other observers publicly recommended that the Department of State fully rescind the hiring freeze. For example, on December 5, 2017, Senators Benjamin Cardin and Todd Young wrote in a joint letter to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan that the hiring freeze might erode the capacity of U.S. diplomats to protect and promote U.S. national security, economic, and humanitarian interests, which would in turn contribute to an increase in the \"frequency, duration, and severity of America's conflicts.\" Department of State officials and others defended the hiring freeze, arguing in November 2017 that despite its implementation, the Department of State had 13,873 Foreign Service Employees, comparable to the 13,980 employees in place in November 2016.", "OMB M-17-22 also directed all federal agencies to take immediate action to achieve near-term workforce reductions and cost savings. To comply with the directive, the Department of State revealed that it would leverage ongoing attrition and targeted buyouts to cut Foreign Service and Civil Service on-board employment by nearly 2,000, or approximately 8%, by the end of FY2018.

The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) expressed concern that \"the rapid loss of so many senior officers has a serious, immediate and tangible effect on the capacity of the United States to shape world events.\" AFSA also noted that increasing promotions was necessary to strengthen the Foreign Service as an institution through promoting deserving performers up the ranks. Department of State officials and other proponents of the Administration's initiatives argued that personnel reductions would make the department more efficient and accountable, that the Department of State's Senior Foreign Service and Foreign Service employment levels were virtually the same as those in place during the Obama Administration, and that if the cuts were fully implemented, the number of department personnel would still exceed that which existed at the onset of the Obama Administration.", "Following his confirmation by the Senate on April 26, 2018, Secretary Pompeo appears to be taking different approach toward the department's personnel levels.

This law also appropriated $2.77 billion to the Human Resources category of the State Department's Diplomatic & Consular Programs account, which is used to pay salaries for the department's domestic and overseas American employees.

Similarly, the Impoundment Control Act obligates the President to spend appropriated funds absent a bill rescinding those funds. Without the passing of such a bill, it could be argued that a hiring freeze that prevented appropriated funds from being spent could violate the act.

Of the department's 22 Assistant Secretary of State positions requiring Senate confirmation, President Trump as of May 14, 2018 was yet to transmit nominations to the Senate for seven such positions: the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs; the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs; the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs; the Assistant Secretary of State for Conflict Stabilization Operations; the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research; and the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration (see Figure 2 ). As of May 14, 2018, the Senate had confirmed 10 Assistant Secretary of State nominations transmitted by President Trump, and was yet to act on five additional nominations he has transmitted.

President Trump has stated that he does not believe filling all positions requiring presidential appointment is necessary and remarked that the Senate is responsible for the slower pace of filling PAS positions. On March 11, 2018, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Ranking Member Robert Menendez issued a statement asserting that the Administration \"has failed to fulfill its duties to nominate individuals\" for Senate-confirmed positions at the Department of State. Separately, in a hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on September 26, 2017, Representative Dana Rohrabacher made inquiries regarding the number of nominees for which the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations had not provided advice and consent, adding that \"if our elections, democratic process, mean anything, the president has to have his people in there to help direct policy because that's who the people voted for.\" Others, including some Members of Congress, point to reports of disagreements between the White House and the State Department regarding appropriate nominees that they say play a significant role in slowing down the process.

Some Members of Congress and other observers generally agree with assertions made by former Secretary Tillerson and others that the career State Department officials who fill these senior positions in an acting capacity are appropriately qualified and experienced to do so.

Secretary Pompeo commented that vacancies have caused the department's personnel to be stretched thin, making it more difficult for them to deliver on their mission. With respect to continued vacancies for important country ambassador positions, observers say that perceived Administration inaction in designating nominees could signal to such countries that the United States is devaluing key alliances and partnerships abroad, refraining from using its voice to preach American values on the international stage, or even abdicating its global leadership role.

As described below, Congress has taken, or may consider to take, some actions to alleviate concerns that Department of State PAS positions are not being filled expeditiously or, in other cases, are not being filled at all. Congress could expand on action in recent years to reduce the number of positions for which advice and consent is required to expedite the process for considering nominees. Enacted in 2012, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act ( P.L. 112-166 ) eliminated the requirement for advice and consent for 163 positions, including selected positions within the Department of State. In doing so, the legislation amended each section of the U.S. Code that established the 163 positions across the federal government generally by striking the phrase \"by and with advice and consent of the Senate,\" thus allowing the President to fill these positions on his own. In addition, in 2011, the Senate passed S.Res. 116 , which created a new process for Senate consideration of nominations to 272 positions, wherein the nominations would bypass formal committee consideration unless any single Senator objected. Congress could take similar actions to further reduce the number of Department of State positions for which advice and consent is required. The Senate could also change its procedural rules with the intent of increasing the likelihood that it will provide advice and consent for the President's nominees or expediting the pace at which the President's nominees are considered. On November 21, 2013, the Senate reinterpreted the \"cloture rule\" (Senate Rule XXII) to lower the threshold for invoking cloture, in effect allowing a simple majority of Senators voting (as opposed to three-fifths of the full Senate pursuant to the previous interpretation of the rule) to restrict the time for considering a nomination or other items of business. As a result, a nominee requires the support of only a simple majority of Senators voting for his or her nomination to receive a subsequent up or down vote.

Other proposals for changing the cloture process include reductions in the time costs associated with certain cloture-related actions or new or additional restrictions on debate in certain circumstances.

Secretary Pompeo has stated that \"the State Department's workforce must, by necessity, be diverse in every sense of the word\u2014in terms of race, religion, background, and more. I'll work to achieve that diversity.\" To date, he has not commented on former Secretary Tillerson's diversity-related priorities or indicated what diversity-related priorities he may pursue.

The Department of State has historically funded the grants provided by the Secretary of State for the administration of these programs through the Human Resources allocation of the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. Congress could include a line-item appropriation in future State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations laws to ensure these programs are funded at a level that reflects congressional intent. It could also increase the number of participants in these programs, as it did through Section 706 of the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (see preceding discussion). Administration officials and some Members of Congress have expressed willingness to expand the Department of State's efforts to recruit veterans into the Foreign Service. If Congress chooses to direct the Administration to take action in this area, it could provide a general authorization for veteran-centered recruitment programs modeled on Section 47 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended, or pass more targeted authorizations to establish specific programs.

While such measures could address aforementioned matters pertaining to implementation of the Impact Initiative, personnel staffing levels, diversity, and the provision of advice and consent by the Senate for nominees for selected State Department senior positions. Congress could also address other personnel issues through legislation. For example, the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 ( P.L. 114-323 ), provided new authorities on matters such as security training for personnel assigned to high-risk, high-threat posts, compensation for locally employed staff, the expansion of Civil Service opportunities, and means of lateral entry into the Foreign Service for mid-career professionals. The 115 th Congress is currently considering competing versions of an authorization bill for FY2018 ( S. 1631 in the Senate and H.R. 5592 in the House of Representatives) that, if enacted, would weigh in on additional personnel matters.
