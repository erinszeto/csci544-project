Corporate officers, employees, and agents are individually liable for the crimes they commit, for the crimes they conspire to commit, for the foreseeable crimes their coconspirators commit, for the crimes whose commission they aid and abet, and for the crimes whose perpetrators they assist after the fact.", "The decision whether to prosecute a corporation rests with the Justice Department. Internal guidelines identify the factors that are to be weighed: the strength of the case against the corporation; the extent and history of misconduct; the existence of a compliance program; the corporation's cooperation with the investigation; the collateral consequences; whether the corporation has made restitution or taken other remedial measures; and the alternatives to federal prosecution. As in the case of individual defendants, corporation prosecutions rarely result in a criminal trial. More often, the corporation pleads guilty or enters into a deferred or delayed prosecution agreement.", "During a criminal investigation and throughout the course of criminal proceedings, corporations enjoy many, but not all, of the constitutional rights implicated in the criminal investigation or prosecution of an individual. Corporations have no Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. On the other hand, the courts have recognized or have assumed that corporations have a First Amendment right to free speech; a Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; a Fifth Amendment right to due process and protection against double jeopardy; Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, jury trial, speedy trial, and to confront accusers, and to subpoena witnesses; and Eighth Amendment protection against excessive fines.", "Corporations cannot be jailed. Otherwise, corporations and individuals face many of the same consequences following conviction. The federal Sentencing Guidelines influence the sentencing consequences of conviction in many instances. Corporations can be fined. They can be placed on probation. They can be ordered to pay restitution. Their property can be confiscated. They can be barred from engaging in various types of commercial activity. The Guidelines speak to all of these.", "For example, the corporate fine Guidelines begin with the premise that a totally corrupt corporation should be fined out of existence, if the statutory maximum permits. A corporation operated for criminal purposes or by criminal means should be fined at a level sufficient to strip it of all of its assets. In other cases, the Guidelines recommend fines and other sentencing features that reflect the nature and seriousness of the crime of conviction and the level of corporate culpability.", "This report is available in an abbreviated form without the footnotes or citations and attributions to authorities that appear here.

Ordinarily, the agents and employees who commit the crimes for which their principals and employers are liable also face prosecution and punishment.", "Individual criminal statutes, Justice Department policies, and the Sentencing Guidelines largely dictate the circumstances under which, and the extent to which, agents, employees, corporations, and similar unincorporated entities are prosecuted and punished. This is a brief overview of federal law in the area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["It was said at common law that \"a corporation cannot commit treason, or felony, or other crime, in its corporate capacity: though its members may, in their distinct individual capacities.\" That perception changed over time. First, it was agreed that a corporation might be held criminally liable for its failure to honor certain legal obligations (nonfeasance); then for the inadequate manner in which it performed certain legal obligations (malfeasance). At the dawn of the 20 th century, the Supreme Court expressed a more sweeping view:", "It is true that there are some crimes which, in their nature, cannot be committed by corporations. But there is a large class of offenses ... wherein the crime consists in purposely doing the things prohibited by statute. In that class of crimes we see no good reason why corporations may not be held responsible for and charged with the knowledge and purposes of their agents, acting within the authority conferred upon them. If it were not so, many offenses might go unpunished and acts be committed in violation of law where, as in the present case, the statute requires all persons, corporate or private, to refrain from certain practices, forbidden in the interest of public policy.", "The Court spoke of \"crimes which in their nature, cannot be committed by corporations,\" but did not explain what specific crimes it had in mind. When it spoke, it did so in the midst of a debate over whether a corporation could be held criminally liable not only for crimes of action and inaction (malfeasance and nonfeasance) of its agents but also for those crimes which required that their agents acted with a specific intent (mens rea) such as the intent to defraud (\"since a corporation has no soul, it cannot have actual wicked intent\"). ", "The Court pointed toward resolution of the issue, however, when it observed that the question turns on the nature of the crime and not the nature of the corporation (\"some crimes in their nature, cannot be committed by corporations\"). Since, in the federal sphere, there is no crime but by act of Congress, the question is one of statutory proscription and congressional intent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Entities Subject to Corporate Criminal Liability", "paragraphs": ["Most federal criminal statutes apply to \"whoever,\" or to any \"person\" who violates their prohibitions. Although, in ordinary parlance, the word \"person\" usually refers to a human being, the law often gives it a broader meaning. The Dictionary Act provides that \"In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise ... the words 'person' or 'whoever' include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\" The courts have used the Dictionary Act definition to give meaning to the words \"person\" or \"whoever\" in the context of a criminal statute.", "Federal statutes frequently provide individual definitions of the entities that fall within their proscriptions. Some are as terse as that of the racketeering statute, \"'person' includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.\" Others, like the tax crime definition, are more detailed: ", "When used in this title, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof\u2014(1) Person.-The term \"person\" shall be construed to mean and include an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation. (2) Partnership and partner.-The term \"partnership\" includes a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization, through or by means of which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, and which is not, within the meaning of this title, a trust or estate or a corporation; and the term \"partner\" includes a member in such a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or organization. (3) Corporation.-The term \"corporation\" includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies.", "Still others have taken special care to mention governmental entities when listing those covered by their proscriptions. The caution reflects judicial reluctance, absent explicit language, to conclude that Congress intends to expose governmental entities to punitive measures. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of Authority", "paragraphs": ["In federal law, corporate criminal liability is ordinarily confined to offenses (a) committed by the corporation's officers, employees, or agents; (b) within the scope of their employment; and (c) at least in part for the benefit of the corporation. The test for whether an activity falls within the individual's scope of authority is whether the individual engages in activities \"on the corporation's behalf in performance of [his] general line of work.... those acts must be motivated, at least in part, by an intent to benefit the corporation.\" If the standard is met, the corporation will be liable notwithstanding the fact that it expressly directed its agent, employee, or officer not to commit the offense at issue.", "Under the Model Penal Code and many state penal codes, corporate criminal liability may depend upon the misconduct of senior management officials; the misconduct of lower level employees is not always enough even when they act within their scope of authority for the corporation's benefit. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Imputed Intent and Knowledge", "paragraphs": ["As a general rule, \"[c]orporations may be held liable for the specific intent offenses based on the 'knowledge and intent' of their employees.\" Again, the rule extends only to those instances when the employee or agent acted, or acquired knowledge, within the scope of his or her employment, seeking, at least in part, to benefit the corporation. The law is somewhat more uncertain when a corporation's liability turns not upon the knowledge or the intent of a single employee but upon cumulative actions or knowledge of several."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liability of Officers, Employees, Agents, Accomplices, and Conspirators", "paragraphs": ["With rare exception, statutes which expose a corporation to criminal liability do not absolve the officers, employees, or agents whose violations are responsible for the corporation's plight. From time to time, the courts have encountered the argument that an individual cannot be at once both the person who violates the statute and the personification of the corporation that violates the statute: \"[W]hen the officer is acting solely for his corporation, the appellee contends that he is no longer a 'person' within the Act. The rationale for this distinction is that the activities of the officer, however illegal and culpable, are chargeable to the corporation as the principal but not to the individual who perpetrates them.\" To which the courts have responded, \"No intent to exculpate a corporate officer who violates the law is to be imputed to Congress without clear compulsion.\"", "Conspiracy raises a slightly more difficult issue. Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to commit some other federal crime. Although the courts have sometimes recognized an intracorporate defense in civil conspiracy cases, they have concluded that a corporation and each of the participating individuals may be liable for plots among two or more of the corporation's officers or employees. On the other hand, a \"corporate officer, acting alone on behalf of the corporation, [may] not be convicted of conspiring with the corporation.\" ", "Conspiracy also presents one of the three situations in which corporate officials and employees may face criminal liability under federal law even though they themselves did not commit, and perhaps did not even know of, the misconduct of other officers or employees. Thus, though an officer or employee has no direct hand in the matter, he is liable for foreseeable offenses committed by one of his co-conspirators in furtherance of their common scheme. ", "The second situation occurs when the official or employee either instructs another to commit a federal offense or aids and abets another in the commission of a federal offense, or takes some action after the fact to conceal the commission of a federal offense by another. Like conspiracy, liability for procuring or aiding and abetting the offense of another focuses on conduct committed before the commission of the underlying substantive offense: ", "Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.", "\"In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\" The officer or employee must know of the colleague's pending misconduct and by his action intend to facilitate it. Moreover, unlike conspiracy, which requires at least two individuals, even a sole stockholder may be guilty of aiding and abetting the crime of a corporation.", "Misprision and liability as an accessory after the fact focus on conduct committed after the commission of the underlying substantive offense. Misprision requires proof that the defendant knew of the commission of a federal felony by another, and that he not only failed to report the offense to authorities but affirmatively acted to conceal it. An accessory after the fact charge requires proof that the defendant knew of the commission of a federal offense by another and assisted the other to avoid arrest, trial or punishment. Both statutes essentially create general obstruction of justice offenses. Consequently, the specific actions which offend their prohibitions will often constitute offenses under other more specific federal obstruction statutes. ", "The third instance of official liability triggered by the misconduct of others within the corporation requires no knowing participation, but instead occurs when a corporate official, responsible to do so, fails to prevent the commission of an offense. This is the least common of the three. It arises in the context of a regulatory scheme, crafted to ensure public welfare and capped with a criminal proscription which says nothing of the knowledge necessary for conviction. Two Supreme Court cases under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act first brought to prominence this so-called \"responsible corporate official\" doctrine. ", "The doctrine is triggered by legislation \"of a now familiar type which dispenses with the conventional requirement of criminal conduct-awareness for some wrongdoing. In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.\" The legislation generally involves the regulation of \"potentially harmful or injurious items.\" \"In such situations,\" the courts \"have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of a character that places him in responsible relation to a public danger, he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation,\" And they have further \"assumed that in such cases Congress intended to place the burden on the defendant to 'ascertain at his peril whether his conduct comes within the inhibition of the statute.'\" Thus, they \"essentially have relied on the nature of the statute and the particular character of the items regulated to determine whether congressional silence concerning the mental element of the offense should be interpreted as dispensing with conventional mens rea requirements.\"", "In such a legislative setting, \"the Government establishes a prima facie case when it introduces evidence sufficient to warrant a finding by the trier of the facts that the defendant had, by reason of his position in the corporation, responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct, the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prosecutorial Discretion", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Generally", "paragraphs": ["The decision to prosecute a corporation or its culpable employees or both is vested in the Justice Department. The courts will review the exercise of that discretion only in rare instances and then primarily to protect the constitutional rights of a defendant or potential defendant. ", "The Justice Department has two sets of guidelines governing the decision to prosecute\u2014one general (\"Principles of Federal Prosecution\") and the other a supplement devoted to corporations (\"Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations\"). As they make clear, the decision to prosecute is in fact a series of decisions. The first is whether to initiate, decline, or defer a prosecution. Here perhaps the most easily assessed factor is the strength of the case against the defendant or defendants. Prosecutors ordinarily will not initiate a prosecution unless there is probable cause to believe that a person has committed a federal crime. ", "On the other hand, prosecutors will seriously consider initiating a prosecution if they believe that they have sufficient admissible evidence to secure a conviction. In those instances, the additional factors that influence the determination to prosecute fall into three categories: the weight of the federal interest, the prospect of effective prosecution elsewhere; and the adequacy of other alternatives. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Interests", "paragraphs": ["Whether to proceed with a prosecutable case ordinarily turns on the nature and seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the defendants. Some crimes, such as those involving immigration, civil rights, or federal tax violations, may warrant federal prosecution because of their very nature. Others, such as those involving major fraud or illicit drug trafficking, may call for federal prosecution because of the wide-spread harm they can inflict. The critical factors when it comes to corporate liability, however, are culpability factors. The factors identified in the business organization guidelines include", "pervasiveness of the wrongdoing within the corporation; the corporation's history of misconduct; the existence and performance of compliance programs; the corporation's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing; the corporation's cooperation; absence of obstruction; collateral consequences; restitution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pervasiveness", "paragraphs": ["The question is, was the corporation the victim of a rogue employee or is it a rogue corporation? Is crime committed for the corporation's benefit condemned, tolerated, or encouraged?

Past criminal conduct is telling, but the guidelines explain that earlier civil or regulatory enforcement actions may also be taken into account. The same may be said of the past transgressions of subsidiaries or affiliates, although short of a corporate department for the commission of criminal offenses the presence of subsidiaries or other liability-limiting features of corporate structure are not considered dispositive. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance Programs", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, a corporation may be liable for employee misconduct even where it has warned its employees against committing the offense. However, both the guidelines and the U.S. Sentencing Commission's Sentencing Guidelines encourage compliance programs. While a mere \"paper program\" may be to little avail, a closely supervised, widely dispersed compliance program tailored to detect and prevent the offenses most likely to occur in the corporation's operational environment may have a real impact. An effective plan may reduce the chances of a prosecution and reduce the severity of the charges and any subsequent sentence should a prosecution occur. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cooperation", "paragraphs": ["The cooperative aspects of the guidelines are among its most controversial attributes. It may be thought unseemly for a corporation to profit from the misdeeds of an employee and then escape liability by turning its benefactor over to the authorities. Moreover, the lines between rewarding cooperation and punishing the assertion of constitutional and other legal rights are not easily drawn. The guidelines point out that the Justice \"Department encourages corporations, as part of their compliance programs, to conduct internal investigations and to disclose the relevant facts to the appropriate authorities.\" This is only one of the guideline's cooperation directives. A second is the reminder that cooperation alone does not necessarily shield a corporation from prosecution. Earlier Justice Department policies relating to corporate cooperation with federal prosecutors came under fire because of concerns that they might interfere with the Sixth Amendment rights of corporations and corporate officials. ", "The guidelines now seek to still those concerns by emphasizing that \"[w]hat the government seeks and needs to advance its legitimate (indeed, essential) law enforcement mission is not waiver of those [attorney-client and attorney work product] protections, but rather the facts known to the corporation about the putative criminal misconduct under review. In addition, while a corporation remains free to convey non-factual or 'core' attorney-client communications or work product\u2014if and only if the corporation voluntarily chooses to do so\u2014prosecutors should not ask for such waivers and are directed not to do so.\" By the same token, while corporate officials are not free to obstruct an investigation, the mere fact that a corporation pays the attorneys' fees of its officers or employees or enters into joint defense agreements will ordinarily not constitute obstruction. Attorneys who feel a prosecutor has breached these assurances are encouraged to contact senior Justice Department officials.", "A corporation may also receive credit for agreeing to make victim restitution, disciplining offending employees, or addressing short-comings in its compliance program.

They may elect to forgo prosecution in favor of civil sanctions.", "Finally, since corporate misconduct often occurs in a regulatory context, civil or regulatory sanctions may be available. Whether prosecutors consider them appealing alternatives may depend in part on the severity of the misconduct and the severity of the sanctions.

As part of, or in conjunction with an agreement, a corporation may be induced to shed executives, assist in their prosecution, underwrite extensive remedial action, pay substantial fines, acquiesce in the confiscation of property of considerable value, establish a robust compliance process, and accept an oversight monitor for assurance of its continued good behavior.", "The guidelines address deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements primarily in their plea bargain instructions. As in the case of individuals, the guidelines remind prosecutors to include at least a basic statement of facts.

Unless the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense is greater, the organization's base fine is pegged at one of 33 levels corresponding to its offense level\u2014from $5,000 for an offense level of 6 or less to $72.5 million for an offense level of 38 or more. ", "The applicable fine range is then ascertained by multiplying the amount assigned to the offense level by minimum and maximum factors determined by the corporation's culpability score. A corporation's score sheet begins at 5. Points are added or subtracted to reflect greater or less culpability. The lowest culpability score merits a range ascertained by multiplying the offense level amount by .05 (setting the bottom of the range) and 0.2 (setting the top). Conversely, the highest culpability score merits a range ascertained by multiplying the offense level amount by 2.0 (setting the bottom of the range) and 4.0 (setting the top). ", "The Guidelines then identify 11 factors to be considered when deciding where within the applicable range a corporation ought to be fined. The absence of an effective ethics and compliance program is perhaps the most distinctive factor on the list. The Guidelines also identify a number of circumstances that may require or argue for a fine outside of the recommended range. First, the sentence imposed must conform to statutory requirements. Thus, applicable statutory maximums or minimums trump any conflicting Guideline sentencing range boundaries. Second, the sentencing process may leave the corporation with the windfall from its misconduct. Consequently, the Guidelines recommend that the fine level be set so as to disgorge any illegally gotten gains that would otherwise be left to a corporation after the payment of its fine, compliance with the restitution order, or other remedial costs. On the other side, a fine below the recommended range should be imposed when necessary to permit restitution or may be below that range when the corporation will be unable to pay a higher fine even on an installment basis. A below-range corporate fine may also be fitting in light of individual fines imposed upon the owners of a closely held corporation. ", "The Guidelines supply several examples of when a fine outside the recommended range might be considered. A fine above the range (referred to as upward departures) may be warranted when", "the offense resulted in a risk of death or serious bodily injury; the offense constituted a threat to national security; the offense presented a threat to the environment; the offense presented a threat to the market; the offense involved official corruption; appropriate to offset reductions attributable to compliance programs; and the corporation's culpability score exceeds the limit for additional multipliers.", "Departures below the range (referred to as downward departures) may be warranted when", "the corporation provides substantial assistance to authorities; the corporation is a public entity, for example, a local governmental agency; the corporation's beneficiaries (other than stockholders) are also victims of the offense; and the corporation's remedial costs far exceed its gains from the misconduct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Probation", "paragraphs": ["Corporations convicted of a federal crime must be placed on probation, if the court elects not to fine them.
