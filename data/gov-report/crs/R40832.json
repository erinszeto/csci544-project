As such, traceability is limited specifically to movements from the animal's point of birth to its slaughter and processing location.", "On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced that USDA was revising its approach to achieving a national capability for animal disease traceability. The previous plan, called the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), first proposed in 2002, was being abandoned.

Since 2008, key committee leaders in Congress had expressed frustration with the slow pace of NAIS implementation and, as a result, had reduced annual funding appropriations for the program. USDA's decision to revise NAIS was made after a series of 15 listening sessions across the country in 2009, and after receiving thousands of comments concerning NAIS. While the poultry and pork industries have endorsed a mandatory national animal ID program in general, certain portions of the U.S. cattle industry have shown strong resistance to what they perceive as a costly government intrusion in their private affairs. Participation in the initial phase of NAIS, premises registration, reflected this same degree of interest, as very high percentages of eligible premises were registered for most major animal species\u2014poultry (95%), sheep (95%), swine (80%), goats (60%), and horses (50%)\u2014with the exception of cattle (18%).

The economic harm from these disease outbreaks first hits the farm enterprise that suffers direct loss of its animals and its livelihood. But it also extends well beyond the farm place to disrupt domestic and international markets, causing losses all along the marketing chain and ultimately hitting consumers. ", "To date, the United States has been fairly fortunate in avoiding a catastrophic animal disease outbreak of the nature of the FMD events that occurred in Taiwan in 1997 or the United Kingdom in 2001. Were a similar FMD outbreak to hit the United States, the economic consequences could be staggering\u2014possibly in the range of $30 billion to $100 billion in cost to the U.S. cattle industry alone, according to House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson in remarks made at a March 11, 2009, hearing by the subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry to review animal identification systems.", "The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks that occurred during the 1990s and early 2000s provided the impetus for the development and implementation of animal identification (ID) and traceability systems in many countries. The motivation and nature of these programs varies across countries, ranging from voluntary programs focused on animal health as in the United States, to mandatory programs focused on both food safety and animal health as in the European Union (EU), Japan, and South Korea ( Figure 1 ).

With respect to trade in animal products, the United States is the world's leading exporter of pork, the second-leading exporter of poultry (behind Brazil), and the third-leading exporter of beef, while ranking first as the world's leading importer of beef.

Enhance s animal health surveillance and disease eradication .", "According to USDA, animal ID would facilitate early detection of dangerous and costly animal disease outbreaks, while a traceability system would help to identify the source as well as those animal populations that were exposed to the disease, and to contain them via zoning or compartmentalization. Together, USDA claims that a national animal ID and traceability program would likely reduce animal producers' disease testing costs by controlling and/or eradicating animal diseases at both regional and national levels. ", "2. M inimize s economic impact of an animal disease outbreak .", "Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, while leaving the remaining areas outside of that zone free of the particular disease and not at risk for international trade restrictions. Rapid identification and compartmentalization of a disease outbreak limits both the spread of commercially harmful diseases and, thereby, the number of animals that would otherwise have to be destroyed or removed from marketing channels. Compartmentalization also facilitates re-establishing international market access and the reopening of lost export markets. The more rapid the response to a disease outbreak, the more limited the economic damage. ", "3. Increase s d omestic m arketing o pportunities .", "Many farmers and ranchers already keep track of individual animals and how they are being raised, in order to identify and exploit desirable production characteristics\u2014such as \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\" or \"hormone-free\"\u2014that can command substantial price premiums in certain retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food, including many meats, are widely used by processors and retailers to manage inventories, add value to products, and monitor consumer buying. When consumers seek meat, eggs, or milk from animals raised according to specified organic, humane treatment, or environmental standards, ID and traceability can help firms verify production methods.", "Government-coordinated programs also have been established for these purposes. For example, a process verification program operated by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) \"provides livestock and meat producers an opportunity to assure customers of their ability to provide consistent quality products by having their written manufacturing processes confirmed through independent, third party audits,\" according to AMS. USDA \"Process Verified\" suppliers can have marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices, and so label them, under this voluntary, fee-for-service program.", "Other programs employing varying levels and types of traceability include the domestic origin requirement for USDA-purchased commodities used in domestic feeding programs; the national organic certification program, which AMS also oversees; and the mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) program.", "4. Provide s a valuable management tool for producers . ", "A traceability program that follows animal products to consumers would provide post-mortem information on cattle with respect to success of various production techniques (e.g., feed types, feed-pasture ratios, or genetics). Similarly, an ID system would be ideally suited for tracking the performance history, along with other relevant criteria, of racing or show animals. It would also increase transparency in the supply chain from producers to consumers; thereby reducing the risk of unfounded liability claims against livestock producers. Finally, an animal ID and traceability program would help producers maintain records on animal movements and health, breed registries, and other marketing activities.", "5. Addresses f ood s afety and n ational s ecurity c oncerns . ", "Federal and state food safety agencies collaborate with APHIS to protect the food supply from the introduction, through animals, of threats to human health, such as tuberculosis, and foodborne illnesses from bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. Generally, when local health officials can link an illness to a particular product, firms and their regulators have been able to trace that product back to the processor and/or slaughter facility. It has been more difficult to determine which particular animals, herds, or flocks were involved. Some believe that a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls, possibly contain the spread of a foodborne illness, and help authorities stem future incidents. Others, particularly many within the food industry, strongly disagree, countering that such a system would not be based on sound science, and would be technically unworkable and costly.", "6. Enhance s foreign marketing opportunities for animal products .", "In the global marketplace, animal disease programs, aided by traceability systems, are used both to reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and to satisfy foreign veterinary and/or food safety requirements. In addition, they assist in assuring credible attributes of animal products with consumers, thus improving opportunities for capturing value-added niche markets by certifying production processes\u2014that is, for export programs that ensure certain aspects of the animal production process such as hormone- or antibiotic-free production.", "After BSE appeared in North America in 2003, USDA's AMS developed an export verification (EV) program for U.S. plants seeking to meet the differing beef import specifications of various countries like Japan, a key foreign market for U.S. beef. AMS establishes the standards that U.S. suppliers must follow if they want to ship beef to these countries, and certifies that the proper procedures are in place. While EV is \"voluntary,\" it also has become a prerequisite for access to the Japanese, Korean, and other foreign markets. ", "USDA contends that establishing an internationally recognized system of traceability is likely to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. exports of animals and animal products. In fact, the lack of a standardized, national animal identification system was one factor that prevented the United States from receiving \"negligible risk\" status (the best status possible under the rating system) for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Receiving negligible risk status would likely enhance the United States' ability to compete internationally, but USDA contends that it would also support U.S. domestic price structures, so that all producers\u2014regardless of their interest in international marketing\u2014would benefit when the United States expands its export markets.", "7.

Increase s c osts and technical c omplexity .", "Other critics cite the likelihood of increased producer-level costs of implementation with no guarantee of any market benefit. This concern was at least partially born out by a USDA-funded benefit-cost analysis of animal ID implementation in the United States (discussed in detail in a later section of this report) which found that over 90% of the annual cost of such a program would fall upon the cattle sector.", "In addition, the as-yet-unknown technology requirements (e.g., computer hardware/software, record keeping, radio frequency recording, etc.) could potentially increase the complexity of operations and could easily exceed an operator's capability.", "3. Rewards vertical integration at the expense of family farms .", "Studies have shown that the cattle industry is expected to bear the brunt of the costs of implementing a national ID program, in large part because each individual animal will have to be tagged, unlike in the large, vertically integrated pork and poultry industries, where animals are usually raised and moved in lots. Critics claim that this added cost factor would unfairly disadvantage cattle producers in domestic and international meat markets. For small operators who are unable to spread such new costs over large operations, ID costs would likely erode an already thin profit margin.", "4. D isadvantages family farms with a l ack of market power in price structure . ", "It has also been argued that, as more tracing requirements are imposed, large retailers and meat packers will exercise market power to shift compliance costs backward to farms and ranches, making it even more difficult for the smaller, independent ones to remain in business.

Is objectionable on r eligious grounds .", "Certain religious groups claim that a government program marking individual animals is an apocalyptic sign of the world's end and should therefore be avoided.", "6. Other potential reasons for producer push-back .", "Although the issue is unstated, some producers are likely concerned that greater transparency at the farm level as a result of more thorough counting and reporting of livestock numbers and sales may increase both income and property tax liabilities, particularly for those producers who previously provided less than full disclosure of animal numbers and farm operations.

For example, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)\u2014the federal agency that oversees animal health in consultation with state veterinary authorities\u2014directs several programs for animal disease eradication and control that include animal identification components effectively requiring ID and tracking. As part of a brucellosis eradication program, uniquely numbered brucellosis ID tags were routinely attached to animals, noting that they had been vaccinated or tested. The program was successful, and brucellosis has largely been eradicated from U.S. commercial herds; as a result, animal ID became less common as the program wound down. ", "In addition to ID requirements under selected APHIS programs, certain classes of livestock have long had official identification requirements before entering interstate commerce. For example, the official disease programs for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep require that both of these species be officially identified before entering interstate commerce. Often state laws or breed association rules require animals of these and other species, like cattle and horses, to be identified to participate in shows or races. But these various programs are not national in scope and vary in their manner of animal identification, record keeping, and data management.", "U.S. animal ID limitations were noted after bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) was discovered in the United States (in a Canadian-born dairy cow) in December 2003. A number of trading partners that had quickly closed their borders to U.S. beef reportedly were reluctant to reopen them, due in part to U.S. difficulties in tracing the whereabouts of other cattle that had entered the United States with the BSE-infected cow; similar difficulties arose in determining the whereabouts and/or herd mates of the two later U.S.-born BSE cases. ", "The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, first proposed in 2002, attempted to build on and learn from these earlier programs, and, although administered by USDA's APHIS, was based on a state-federal-industry partnership that provided the opportunity for producers not part of a disease program to voluntarily participate in national animal health safeguarding efforts. Certain states have mandated some components of animal identification, such as premises registration; however, at the federal level, NAIS was a voluntary program.", "USDA's February 5, 2010, decision to replace NAIS with a more flexible, state-based program that mandates traceability only for livestock moving in interstate commerce responds to strong criticism of NAIS from the U.S. cattle sector, in large part because the burden of cost and implementation would fall most heavily on cattle producers.

If the animals could not be tagged at their current premises, producers might elect to have their animals tagged at an auction market providing tagging services when they were ready to market their animals. In such cases, when the animals were unloaded, they would be tagged before they were commingled with animals from other premises. In some areas, tagging services are available.

Chapter four of the OIE's Terrestrial Code includes two sections on animal identification and tracing: section 4.1 which defines general principles, and section 4.2 which provides general guidance on the design and implementation of systems. In April 2008, the Director General of the OIE (Bernard Vallet) called for progressive implementation of animal identification and product traceability systems from the \"farm to the fork\" be progressively implemented worldwide. Under internationally recognized OIE standards, robust animal identification and tracing systems would allow compartmentalization and regionalization of a disease outbreak so that trade could continue for animal products from other parts of the country. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes two sections that deal with compartmentalization: section 4.3 which defines general principles of zoning and compartmentalization, and section 4.4 which discusses application of compartmentalization.", "Export Certification", "Certification is frequently part of export verification processes imposed by importing countries. In the United States, certification is handled by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Although each specific country can have its own specific beef importing requirements, certification generally refers to the idea that animal production methods and processing plants comply with the importer's veterinary, animal health, and sanitary standards. This often involves sanitary sampling and plant inspection by the importing country. The OIE contributes to harmonization of international certification standards through its various programs and via the promotion of transparency and reliance on scientific information as a basis for evaluation.

Initially, identification was based on traditional CCIA-approved ear tags. However, in 2003 the Canadian cattle industry committed to transitioning to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Since September 1, 2006, all cattle leaving their farm of origin must be tagged with a CCIA-approved RFID tag consisting of a transponder with encoded chip and antenna. According to the CCIA, RFID benefits include exceptional tag retention and readability, increased data integrity, ability to read at a distance without line of sight, and future capabilities of full animal movement tracking.", "CCIA executive director Kerry St. Cyr, estimated that, as of March 2009, the nationwide compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was between 99-100%.

NLIS is a permanent whole-of-life system that allows individual animals to be identified electronically and tracked from property of birth to slaughter. A mandatory system for cattle has been in place since July 1, 2005, while a tracing system has been operational for sheep and goats since January 1, 2009. Similar tracing systems are under development for pigs and alpacas. ", "Australia began its animal identification system in the early 1960s in coordination with a national program to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory property identification system for cattle was started in 1967 that identified herds in relation to a parcel of land; these were referred to as Property Identification Codes (PICs)\u2014an eight-digit number that identifies the state, region, and specific location of a property\u2014and provided the ability to trace all cattle back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the established visual-read-only PIC system was converted to an electronic (using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs)) whole-of-life individual cattle identification system on the grounds that it was only a matter of time before such a system would be needed to ensure biosecurity, food safety and market access. In 1998, in response to a trading partner, individual identification was made compulsory for producers supplying the European Union (EU) market to provide meat from Hormone Growth Promotant-free cattle. In 1999, the NLIS was introduced. ", "In a 2004 audit of the NLIS\u2014the National Livestock Tracing Audit\u2014all of the animals identified using NLIS were traced to their property of origin within 24 hours. In contrast, only 41% of cattle without NLIS tags were located within 24 hours. In 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, and all stock movements must be read at points of transfer including saleyards and slaughterhouses. ", "In Australia, at slaughter each individual animal is assigned a unique ID number that is attached to a bar code. As a result, individual animal ID information is linked not only to live animals, but can also be linked to carcasses, hides, and byproducts of each animal. However, unless specific agreements are reached between producers and harvesting facilities, the animals are generally grouped into lots by harvest date and time, and the individual animal information (carcass data) is not available.", "Australia's NLIS is a joint commitment and working partnership between the Australian Government at federal and state levels and Australian industry. However, the Federal government has an overall policy coordination role and supplies funding to underpin the national system. State governments have legal jurisdiction over the movement and health of livestock. The state governments work with industry in joint management committees to develop and implement legislation that underpins the animal identification program. This committee in each state coordinates extension and producer education programs such as demonstration sites, an assistance hotline and industry seminars that assist producers with on-farm use of technology. The state governments have established a registry of PICs, are responsible for ordering of identification devices and have assisted with establishing the reading infrastructure and more recently auditing device performance and monitoring compliance with legislative requirements.

The basic objectives for EU rules on the identification of animals are the localization and tracing of animals for veterinary purposes for the control of infectious diseases. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved over time in response to particular disease events including the outbreaks of classical swine fever in 1997 and foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, as well as the 1997 BSE crisis. As the various animal ID systems evolved within the EU, they have each incorporated trace back and general traceability as a system goal along with animal identification.", "In April 1997, in response to the BSE crisis, the Council of the European Union implemented a mandatory system of permanent identification of individual bovine animals enabling reliable traceability from birth to death. All bovine animals were required, by January\u00a01, 2000, to be identified with double ear tags that identify individual animals, a register must be maintained at each animal location (farm, market, etc.), cattle passports to record movements, and a computerized electronic national database includes both ID and tracking information. On July 17, 2000, an additional regulation was passed that fully implemented and made mandatory the bovine ID and traceability system that is currently in place in the EU.", "In addition to tracking animals from birth through harvest, the EU regulations stipulate the labeling of meat products in the following way: (1) a reference number that links the meat product to the animal or animals of origin; (2) identification of the member state where the meat was harvested and processed; and (3) the harvesting or fabrication facility's approval number(s). Mandatory food traceability has been a part of the general food law of the EU since January 1, 2005.", "Since July 1, 2000, it is compulsory for all equidae moving within the EU to be accompanied by a passport during their movements (on foot and during transport).

However, political pressure for such a requirement appears to be building.", "In response to a series of food safety crises in the early 2000s, including the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Japan's domestic cattle herd and a series of labeling scandals, the Japanese government implemented a series of animal traceability regulations and food safety oversight. The first phase began in July 2002 when the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures was enacted. As part of this new law, Japan implemented a set of bovine animal traceability and identification laws that required traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. In the second phase, Japan's Diet passed the Food Safety Basic Law on May 23, 2003, establishing the Food Safety Commission. Then, in June 2003 the Beef Traceability Law was enacted that required traceability be extended from slaughterhouses to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. As a result, Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers to allow consumers to reference information about the domestic beef that they buy and eat.", "In June 2003, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) also announced a new Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program to certify the traceability of imported beef. To gain certification, exporters must be able to provide all the same information required under the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures\u2014date of birth, sex, breed, name and address of owner, location of fattening, date fattening commenced, and slaughter date\u2014plus the names of all feeds and pharmaceuticals used in producing the animal.", "South Korea", "South Korea has a mandatory domestic Beef Traceability System (BTS). Initiated in 2004 as a voluntary program, the BTS became mandatory for domestically produced beef in 2009. The BTS requires individual identification and registration in a central database system (known as the Beef Traceability database). The BTS operates as a whole-of-life traceability system, tracking each individual animal from birth to the consumer. For domestic beef produced under the BTS, Korean consumers can access a range of animal-specific information including the sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth and subsequent premises, owner's personal information, feed administered, medications given, location and date of slaughter, date of inspection, and location of processing.", "In July 2009, a South Korean agriculture official reported that the South Korean government intends to impose traceability requirements on imported beef as soon as December 2010.

In August 2004, the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG) was established when industry approached the government to work together to improve animal traceability in New Zealand. In March 2006, an Animal Identification and Traceability Governance Group (AITGG) was established to oversee the development of a new animal ID system under the name NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing). As of early 2009, NAIT still exists more as a project under development than as a functioning system. ", "Currently New Zealand has several partial systems that allow for traceability at herd levels but fail to provide effective traceability for individual animals. In addition, these partial systems leave substantial coverage gaps at the national level. The current focus is on developing traceability for cattle and deer populations. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has stated that the addition of other species\u2014whether flock/group or individual identification\u2014to the NAIT system should only be considered once the system is up and running for cattle and deer. ", "New Zealand's existing animal ID systems began under the Bio-security Act of 1993 which provided for two systems of partial bovine animal ID: the Management Information System for Dairy Administration (MINDA) and the National Bovine Tuberculosis Identification Program (NBTIP). MINDA is a voluntary livestock and herd management system that has very high dairy herd participation (97%) in New Zealand. However, MINDA was not designed and does not function well for animal traceability. In contrast, the NTBIP is a mandatory, herd-based system that requires the identification of cattle and deer before movement from their property of origin. In addition to these two systems, several other private and governmental traceability databases are available for producers' use on a voluntary basis. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011. The inclusion of deer is dependent on confirmation of the in-field performance of radio frequency tags.", "Brazil", "In 2001, Brazil created the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV, now renamed ERAS) as a farm-level identification system for cattle. In September 2006, SISBOV was extended to include the entire beef chain rather than just producers. Initially, SISBOV was intended as a mandatory program for identification of individual animals with a target date of 2008 for mandatory national participation; however, Brazil's domestic market had little demand for origination information and Brazilian cattle producers resisted adoption. As a result, SISBOV remains a voluntary program focused primarily on those premises engaged in providing animals to slaughterhouses that supply products destined for foreign markets that require origination information\u2014most notably the EU which was Brazil's largest beef export market at that time and which requires substantial identification and traceability criteria for imported animal products. In addition, instead of identifying individual animals, animal classification has been by group lot under SISBOV. The EU has accepted individual tags for each group of cattle sold to export slaughterhouses.", "Since 2003, successive audits of SISBOV conducted by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office (EU/FVO) have found severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system. In 2008, the EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil, unless they were sourced from farms that had been approved by Brussels. However, in a report released on August 4, 2009, the EU/FVO suggests that the situation in Brazil was getting worse. Europe has two major concerns: a lack of robust information, and the fear that foot-and-mouth disease could inadvertently enter the EU from Brazil. ", "Argentina", "In 2003, Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability\u2014the Argentine Animal Health Information System (SGS) \u2014directed at animal products destined for the EU. The Argentine system included farm-of-origin information and permits that document cattle movements including whether the animals have been in areas exposed to FMD. However, as in Brazil, Argentina operates its animal identification system primarily for identifying cattle (generally in group lots) destined for export markets. ", "Starting in 2007, official ID tagging has been required for all calves born after September 2007. The compulsory cattle identification program will facilitate tracking cattle from birth to slaughter; however, the entire Argentine beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017.", "Because Argentina has traditionally been unable to control disease outbreaks\u2014particularly foot and mouth disease (FMD)\u2014its beef exports to the United States have been primarily restricted to thermo-processed beef (heated to a specific temperature for a specified amount of time). These export limitations provide ample incentive for Argentina to improve its animal identification and traceability system.", "Uruguay", "Uruguay is very dependent on external markets for selling a large portion of its annual domestic production. An estimate 68% of Uruguay's annual beef production was sold in foreign markets during the 2004-2008 period. As a result, Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information as demanded by foreign buyers; however, it is only since late 2006 that Uruguay has been able to institute a comprehensive national program. ", "On September 1, 2006, Uruguay's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries (MAGyP) implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG). Under SNIG, all individual animals must be identified (i.e., tagged) before six months of age or before they are transported from their property of birth. Two tags are required for all cattle, one highly visible and one electronic, for example, an RFID device. In addition, the appropriate paperwork that tracks cattle from birth to slaughter must accompany each animal. The Uruguayan government plans to have all herds registered and all cattle tagged by 2010. At that point, the government will require traceability be extended, not just to the point of slaughter, but also to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin.", "SNIG builds on Uruguay's national premises identification system (DICOSE)\u2014established in 1973\u2014which, for participating producers, provided information on each individual animal in their herds. Private individuals or companies registered within SNIG must be used for movement notification. Termination records are recorded by MAGyP. The SNIG database then includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. SNIG does not yet mandate further traceability to consumers, although this is under consideration. The Uruguayan government currently pays for the ID tags, although it plans to shift the cost to the producers at some point in the future. ", "Countries Not Implementing Animal ID Programs ", "Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs\u2014examples include Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for the non-existence of animal ID programs in these countries include the following. Many of these countries have large land masses consisting of mainly agrarian populations that are not technologically advanced. Also, several of these countries lack national distribution chains for animal products, instead relying on local production and marketing processes. Alternately, in many poorer countries of the world, consumers are simply unable financially to be overly discriminating in their choice of animal products. As a result, many lower-income consumers are not willing to pay a premium for food that is identified and traceable."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
