That is, agencies and groups of employees have been \"carved out\" from government-wide provisions in Title 5 in areas like hiring, pay, performance appraisal, and labor-management relations. These subsets of employees may be broken down, for example, by branch of government, agency, and occupation. In addition, the civil service system has become increasingly decentralized in execution. Agencies also use discretion to create subtle or significant differences within the systems they establish to manage employees. As a result of these trends, the civil service has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades. At the same time, it has become more difficult for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and stakeholders to comprehensively monitor and oversee developments related to human capital management (HCM) across the federal government.", "Fragmentation has been evident not only in law, but also is apparent in the data for federal scientific and technical (S&T) personnel.

In addition, employees oftentimes are described and categorized according to distinct skill sets that they use in their jobs (e.g., scientific and engineering workforce).", "Other examples of the latter usage include the acquisition, information technology, and human resources workforces. These categories of employees have been referred to colloquially as \"functional workforces\" or \"occupations.\" Employees in one of these workforces may work within one agency or across several agencies. Still further ways of categorizing employees relate to how they are hired (\"appointed\") and paid. Because the procedures for hiring and paying employees frequently are specified in statute and regulation, a workforce may be referred to as corresponding to a certain section of the United States Code or part of the Code of Federal Regulations .

Demonstration projects authorized by OPM and the contracting out of S&E work seem to have provided agencies with the flexibility deemed necessary to overcome some of the difficulties associated with recruitment, retention, and utilization of scientists and engineers.", "A follow-up to this report, released in 1993, entitled Improving the Recruitment, Retention, and Utilization of Federal Scientists and Engineers , discussed recruiting requirements, challenges in coping with the civil service system, federal pay reform, and issues such as who should be responsible for federal S&Es, how the effectiveness of the current system should be evaluated, and special provisions for administering the S&E workforce. Among the report's recommendations are the following:", "The pay reform provisions and related flexibilities provided by FEPCA should be implemented as fully as possible by the President and the departments and agencies, in order to redress pay inequities and reward superior performance among all federal employees, including scientists and engineers. OPM should follow its aggressive effort to delegate its authorities under FEPCA with an equally strong effort to see that FEPCA authorities and flexibilities are decentralized to the appropriate levels within the departments and agencies. To help carry out its responsibilities for encouraging, assisting, and overseeing the departments and agencies, OPM should develop an organizational focus for science and engineering personnel policy staffed by individuals who have had experience as senior managers of scientists and engineers. Each federal agency with a science and engineering workforce should develop a comprehensive action plan, with assistance from OPM, to (1) identify agency goals and develop an appropriate science and engineering staffing plan, and (2) use the authorities provided under FEPCA to improve recruitment, retention, and utilization of scientists and engineers. A new interagency committee on federal scientific and engineering personnel should be established in the Executive Office of the President under the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET) to (1) evaluate and recommend science and engineering personnel policies and their implementation; (2) develop model strategies for combining the relevant flexibilities in FEPCA and for science and engineering personnel program evaluation; (3) share successful and unsuccessful experiences; (4) monitor the overall success of the government in recruiting and retaining scientists and engineers across agencies; and (5) provide a forum for identifying and working out solutions to common problems. Congress and the executive branch should work together to make further changes in the civil service system that address the problems beyond pay flexibility per se. Meanwhile, Congress and OPM should continue the personnel demonstrations as testbeds for policies and practices that are not necessarily permitted under FEPCA or other federal personnel laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RAND Science and Technology Policy Institute", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, the RAND Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) prepared a report entitled Will the Scientific and Technology Workforce Meet the Requirements of the Federal Government? for the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).

The other set of mechanisms proposed entitled \"shaping the workforce\" are focused on adjusting the labor pool through immigration measures, and adjusting the workforce through federal agency mechanisms to recruit, retain, and promote the STEM workforce.

If Congress wishes to evaluate the ability of the federal government and its agencies to recruit and retain S&T personnel, the variety of statutory authorities provide illustrations of topics that might be examined. In addition, the federal government's experience with these statutory authorities might inform Congress's deliberations, if Congress wished to consider modifying the ability of the federal government to recruit highly-qualified scientific, engineering, and technical personnel. ", "In evaluating current efforts or considering future modifications, Congress may wish to consider factors that include the following:", "Given perceived problems regarding recruitment and retention of federal S&E personnel, agency-specific and executive-branch-wide approaches could be considered. If an executive-branch-wide approach were pursued, it may be possible to structure legislation to leverage the involvement of entities such as OPM, the federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council, OSTP, and OMB, in addition to agencies with S&E workforces themselves. Tools to galvanize action by agencies, OPM, and OMB might be pursued through several means, including requirements for strategic planning, coordination, evaluation, and solitary or joint reporting. Although many statutory authorities have focused on providing additional flexibilities to agencies, it is not clear how much accountability has been gained in exchange. A number of observers have, over extended periods, expressed concerns about the ability of OPM to effectively oversee agency use of these authorities. The goal of a number of programs is to recruit staff for term appointments of one to five years. However, if the goal is for an agency to build a long-term workforce who stay for more than five years, reliance on short-term appointments may not be an appropriate model. Further, even if an agency has the goal of building a shorter-term workforce of five years or less, prospective recruits may be unwilling to take a position that has a pre-determined endpoint, even if the rate of compensation is higher. Several of the programs only apply to a small number of individuals. If the goal is to recruit a large number of individuals, these may not be appropriate models. Although various recruiting mechanisms have been developed and are in active use, there is insufficient evidence as to whether or not these programs are likely to achieve a given employment goal. Some of the agencies continue to experience challenges in employing the personnel they need despite such programs. Some policies are targeted at entry-level employees, while others are targeted at more senior employees. Each may prefer different incentives. As a result, one factor to consider is whether or not the goal of a program is to recruit entry-level staff, senior staff, or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obama Administration Actions", "paragraphs": ["According to news reports, the OPM Director John Berry plans to pursue a significant reform of the civil service system in Title 5, including a pay for performance system, in response to concerns that the federal pay system is \"balkanized to the point of a risk of failure.\" The three-pronged strategy, approved by President Obama, would \"reform the law on federal employee pay: create a fair and credible performance appraisal and accountability system; develop training that would prepare employees for promotion and support them throughout their careers; and establish genuine parity between federal and private-sector salaries for employees in comparable occupations.\" ", "The Obama Administration has taken several actions related to federal S&E personnel actions.
