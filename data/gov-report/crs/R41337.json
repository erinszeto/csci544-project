This lengthy heritage notwithstanding, some observers describe the \"modern era\" of evaluation, and particularly \"program evaluation\" (focusing on government social programs), as emerging in the 1960s and growing appreciably since then. Expansion of social, economic, and environmental programs, among others, in many cases has been accompanied by legislation mandating and funding evaluation or by executive directives ordering such studies. These changes facilitated and increased the diversification of program evaluation, based on a perceived need to better inform the understanding of policy problems, formulate responses, and strengthen oversight by the executive and legislature over a growing expanse and complexity of federal programs. Accompanying this development, program evaluation has also become more sophisticated and selective in terms of its methods, methodology, type and level of operation, and subject or policy area.", "The 1990s gave added impetus to assessments, evaluations, and reviews of programs, activities, and operations through a number of laws, which remain on the books. Among these supporting evaluation efforts, directly or indirectly, are the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act; P.L. 101-576 , 104 Stat. 2838); Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA; P.L. 103-62 , 107 Stat. 285); Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, later renamed the Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA; Division E of P.L. 104-106 , 110 Stat. 679, and P.L. 104-208 , 110 Stat. 3009-393); and Federal Financial Assistance Improvement Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-107 , 113 Stat. 1486). These and other earlier relevant statutes, including the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), as amended, allow for flexibility in determining various evaluation requirements, particularly concerning individual projects and programs.

This arises, in part, because of different rationales, expectations, research questions, and conditions surrounding the establishment of the positions. Because of this, the resulting independent evaluators lack standardization and uniformity across-the-board, and a number have been given substantial flexibility in organizing their own operation. Structural differences might also arise, at least in some cases, because the creator of the entity (the President, agency head, or Congress) intends to allow for discretion and flexibility at the implementing level (for the agency or IE, reflecting his or her expertise and experience). Along with this, the establishing authority for many positions\u2014public law, executive order, or administrative fiat\u2014often do not specify certain characteristics of the office, such as its funding, reporting requirements, tenure, or evaluation standards.", "Disagreements, moreover, have arisen over the value, importance, and means of supporting independence for evaluators. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), when it examined the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) guidance for the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in 2005, found that a", "source of tension between OMB and agency evaluation interests was the evaluation's independence. PART guidance stressed that for evaluations to be independent, nonbiased parties with no conflict of interest, for example, GAO or an Inspector General should conduct them .... OMB subsequently revised the guidance to allow evaluations to be considered independent if the program contracted them out to a third party or they were carried out by an agency's program evaluation office. However, disagreements continued on the value and importance of this criterion.", "Furthermore, an evaluation scholar noted that independence may not be an important dimension of an evaluation if the objectives of the evaluation primarily focus on strengthening institutions or building \"agency or organizational capacity in some evaluative area.\"", "Other considerations tie into program evaluation in general, no matter where it is carried out. These could extend to whether the subject of the evaluation is either (1) too large and broad an undertaking for the evaluator, thereby overwhelming him or her; or (2) to the contrary, too small and narrowly focused to be of utility apart from the immediate project (in developing, for instance, recommendations for best practices or the entire program). Along the same lines are concerns about whether the evaluation is integrated into the overall operation of a program and whether an evaluator might be perceived as \"usurping\" or competing with the prerogatives of a parallel office. Others, discussed further below, deal with selecting the most appropriate evaluation technique or method, especially in light of the diversity among them, as well as the right evaluator.", "Independent evaluation entities do not arise or exist in a vacuum. Their establishment, powers, performance, effectiveness, and impact are subject to a variety of influences. And because they are usually ad hoc and idiosyncratic, they differ in their structure and operation. IE-like offices range from modest efforts\u2014beginning with a position without separate funding or staffing, evaluating only a single, short-term project\u2014to major undertakings, extending to a separate unit composed of a number of individuals, with its own budget and resources, operating continuously throughout the life of a long-term, interagency, and sometimes intergovernmental program. In between these ends of the spectrum are a number of possible combinations. Variations exist even among units evaluating programs in the same broad subject area. Six of the examples below, for instance, deal with interagency, intergovernmental, and, in some cases, interstate waterway programs; yet the evaluation units differ from one another, sometimes significantly, in their main characteristics or in the specifications in their establishing authority.", "In sum, the characteristics of independent evaluators and similar constructs are determined by a number of formal and informal factors. Differences among evaluation constructs are reflected in the powers and protections in the authorities that established the IEs\u2014public laws, executive orders, or administrative directives\u2014as well as in their relationships with executive officials. Besides the variables already identified, other influences, some informal or intangible, add to this mixture. These include the expertise of the staff, competency and impartiality of the evaluator, and trust and confidence between an evaluator and the program office.

Specifying an independent evaluator's jurisdiction\u2014over the subject matter, specific projects or programs, and the agencies to be covered\u2014is especially important with regard to interagency, intergovernmental, and interstate programs. Clear separation from the program or project office . A range of options exist here. For instance, this might occur through an evaluation unit which is external to the office, its parent agency, or both. An outside unit could be established in a number of ways: setting up a new office, operating under standards and guidelines that protect its independence (e.g., prohibiting revision by political appointees or OMB); contracting with a private organization; making arrangements with a relevant government-chartered organization; or relying on an appropriate federal agency, such as an IG, an executive organization with relevant expertise and experience, or GAO. Another possibility involves an office within the agency. The independence of such an evaluation might also be protected if it were assigned to an in-house program evaluation office unconnected with the program or project implementer. Avoidance of a (potential) conflict of interest, actual or perceived . For an evaluator, this might mean, among other considerations, no direct ties to the program or project office, its implementing agents, or affected parties. Neutrality, objectivity, and impartiality in conducting an evaluation as well as in reporting and disseminating its findings, conclusions, and recommendations . Even if an evaluation entity were not housed separately from the program being implemented, third-party review of the evaluation, for example, might detect or deter bias, providing some assurance of independence. In addition, evaluations might be required to focus on several competing definitions of programmatic \"success,\" if the proper goals of a government activity were contested. Appropriate criteria and standards for conducting an evaluation and for basing its conclusions . Such criteria and standards would be determined by the subject matter being assessed as well as by the extent and detail of the coverage called for. This attribute for an independent evaluation would serve to justify the validity and reliability of its findings and conclusions. Specified type(s) of evaluation . GAO identifies these as cost-effectiveness, implementation, impact, and outcome. Refinements of these and other possibilities might be considered as well. Designated responsibilities and duties . These could extend beyond assessing program performance, to developing appropriate measures, providing information and data to operational offices, monitoring compliance with program directives, issuing recommendations for corrective action, sharing best-practices, and responding to and reconciling concerns or criticisms from report subjects. Competency and expertise (in the subject area, in evaluation, or in both) . This applies to both the principal evaluator and staff. Sufficient resources . Resources for the IE or similar posts include funding, staff, and, if necessary, contracting authority, appropriate equipment and facilities, among other items. Access to and use of relevant information and data which are reliable and valid. Program evaluations\u2014and their credibility\u2014rely upon the reliability and validity of the data and information that they use and that are appropriate for the subject.

These outcomes are likely to be enhanced by clear and specific requirements regarding the purposes, responsibilities, and duties of the IE entities as well as protections for their officers. Posed as questions, these considerations, which closely relate to one another and in some circumstances may overlap, include the following:", "Selection Requirements: Are any requirements or criteria for an IE's selection specified in the authority creating the entity or position? If so, is he or she to be selected for relevant expertise or experience in the subject area or in evaluation? Appointing Authority and Requirements: Who appoints the individual who will lead the IE entity? If the independent evaluator is an individual, who will appoint the individual? Is the appointment made by a certain agency official (head of the agency or of a program office)? Is it an individual officer or a committee (in the case of an intra-agency, interagency, or intergovernmental unit)? If the appointment is made by the chair of a committee, is he or she directed to consult with other panel members? Is the appointing authority advised to or required to consult with inspectors general or with outside organizations in determining prospective candidates? Tenure : How long is an evaluation officer's tenure? Is it confined to a short-term project or a fixed deadline, such as six months or one year? Or does it extend indefinitely, throughout the life of an entire program? Funding: How is the entity funded? Are the funds from an administrative account at the discretion of an agency or program official? Or is the funding a specified amount or percentage of the overall budget of a program or project? Supervision: Who, if anyone, supervises the IE's operations? Purposes: Why exactly has an office been established, and what is it expected to accomplish? Is it to conduct an evaluation over a long-term broad program, a short-term narrow project, or a series of these? Is the unit to offer recommendations, as well as findings and conclusions? What roles is an evaluation unit expected to play in the ongoing operation of the program or project, in advising an overseer or program manager, or in the final assessment of the program? Are the IE's findings, conclusions, and recommendations expected to contribute to management and best-practices approaches, for instance, or to examine the effectiveness of the program itself, separate from its implementation? Substantive Considerations and Type of Evaluation : What substantive research questions is it to address? What type or types of evaluation is the entity to perform? How much discretion will be necessary to leave to the IE to make these decisions? Mandated Studies: What particular studies, if any, are mandated? Is an IE required to conduct certain studies (e.g., interims as well as a final) or does he or she have some discretion over the range and frequency of studies? Study Standards and Procedures : What standards, procedures, and guidelines, if any, is an IE expected to follow in conducting evaluations? Are these detailed in the unit's establishing authority? Consultation with Outside Organizations: Is an IE entity required to consult with other governmental or nongovernmental organizations in carrying out its responsibilities? In general, should the IE consult with private sector specialists in evaluation or with inspectors general; in scientific matters, with one of the relevant National Academies or private organizations; and in public administration matters, as an example, with the National Academy of Public Administration? Types of Reports: What types of reports are ordered? Are the reports limited to particular projects or stages thereof; are their contents outlined; and are the reports to contain recommendations for change? Reporting Schedules: When are the reports to be issued?\u2014according to a fixed time schedule?\u2014at the completion of a particular stage of a project or program?\u2014at the end of the entire program?\u2014or at the discretion of the IE?

Suggested or recommended standards and criteria, although having commonalities, are not duplicative in all respects, with some being more detailed and expansive than others.

A perceived need for flexibility in IE structure, organization, operations, and activities appears in some establishments, which allows the IE (or other officials) to determine the entity's features. By comparison, others are given detailed duties and directions upon their creation. Demands and expectations differ among IEs. The political context in which IEs are established differs over time and within and among policy arenas. Because of these and other factors, independent evaluators follow no single path or set of directions.
