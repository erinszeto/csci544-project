Subsequently, in 1982, Section303(b) of P.L. 97-241 renamed ICA to be the U.S. Information Agency (USIA). In 1994, theinternational broadcasting activities were consolidated by Title III, P.L. 103-236 and administeredby a new entity referred to as the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

For example, in November 2001, two months after theterrorist attacks, the Bush Administration created the Coalition Information Center (CIC)headquartered in the Old Executive Office Building. The CIC, which was touted by theAdministration as public diplomacy, coordinated U.S. government agency press conferences andtalking points, dispersing them rapidly and around-the-clock worldwide. Soon thereafter, thePresident created, by Executive Order, the Office of Global Communications (OGC), which replacedthe CIC with a primary mission to \"coordinate strategic communications with globalaudiences.\" (2) Also,then-National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice established a Strategic Communication PolicyCoordinating Committee (PCC) in September 2002. The PCC mission was to coordinateinteragency activities, develop the White House message, and disseminate it abroad. ", "More recently, the President created the Muslim World Outreach Policy CoordinatingCommittee in July 2004 which replaced the Strategic Communications Policy CoordinatingCommittee. The State Department also established an Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources inthe Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.", "Informally in 2002 and officially in 2003, the Pentagon created the Office of StrategicInfluence (OSI) to oversee military propaganda and other information related to the war on terrorism. The Secretary of Defense dissolved OSI after press coverage claimed the Office was to placedisinformation deliberately in foreign media. In October 2003, the Department of Defense issued Information Operations Roadmap which involves the direction that DOD wants to take in publicdiplomacy and other information operations.

Since 2004, USAID has acted to more prominently inform U.S.aid recipients that the aid they have received was a gift from American taxpayers.
