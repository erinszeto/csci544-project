Components of the federal budget categorized as \"human resources\" account for the majority of federal outlays (70% in FY2010) and would be affected by these proposals. Six functional categories comprise the human resources \"superfunction\": education, training, employment, and social services; health (primarily Medicaid); Medicare; income security; Social Security; and veterans benefits and services.", "President Obama submitted a detailed FY2012 budget request to Congress on February 14, and in April, he released a set of deficit reduction policies intended to build on the February proposal called the President's Framework for Shared Prosperity and Shared Fiscal Responsibility. On April 15, the House passed a concurrent resolution on the FY2012 budget (H.Con.Res. 34) that was based on a document called Path to Prosperity, released by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan on April 5. The Senate has not yet acted on a budget resolution for FY2012.", "As a share of the national economy, spending for human resources is expected to have peaked at 16.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY2010 and, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), will fall to 14.8% in FY2014. This decline reflects the assumed economic recovery, lower spending for programs that respond automatically to economic conditions (e.g., Unemployment Insurance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and expiration of stimulus funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). However, CBO estimates that, with no changes in current law, human resources spending will rise again as a share of GDP and reach 15.7% by FY2021 due to the continuing effects of the baby boom generation's retirement and increased enrollment in Medicare and Social Security, real growth in initial Social Security benefits, medical cost inflation in excess of general inflation, and new spending related to the health care reform law of 2010.", "Reflecting these trends, all projected growth in the human resources budget will occur in three functional categories: health (primarily Medicaid), Medicare, and Social Security. CBO estimates that spending for income security will contract as a share of GDP over the next decade, as will spending for the two smallest human resources categories (i.e., education, training, employment, and social services; and veterans benefits and services).", "Both the President's budget and H.Con.Res. 34 include provisions intended to reduce spending overall. However, the President's February proposals would result in spending for human resources that would closely follow, and slightly exceed, the CBO current law baseline, while the House resolution sets spending targets that are significantly lower. Specifically, human resources spending would equal 15.9% of GDP in FY2021 under the Administration's February budget and 13.5% under the House resolution, compared to CBO's baseline estimate of 15.7%. The most significant reductions from the CBO baseline, if all provisions assumed in the House resolution were enacted, would occur in three categories: education, training, employment, and social services (the smallest human resources category); Medicaid; and income security. As widely reported, the House resolution assumes enactment of legislation to convert Medicare into a \"premium subsidy\" program; however, this change would not occur until FY2022, which is after the resolution's 10-year budget window.

The figure also shows CBO's projections for these categories, assuming no change in current law, through FY2021. The figure illustrates the growth in spending for human resources over the last five decades, and shows the importance of this component of the budget, in relation to other government spending. Specifically, the figure shows that outlays for human resources, as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), have grown substantially since 1962, when they accounted for 5.6% of GDP. CBO expects they will have peaked in FY2010, at 16.4%, and will fall to 14.8% in FY2014. This pattern reflects the assumed economic recovery, lower spending for programs that respond automatically to economic conditions such as Unemployment Insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the expiration of all stimulus funding.

While this is lower than the FY2010 level of 16.4% of GDP, it still exceeds the pre-recession (2007) level of 12.7%. Fueling this increased spending are several factors, including the continuing effects of the baby boom generation's retirement and increased enrollment in Medicare and Social Security, certain program design features such as wage indexing in Social Security (which allows initial monthly benefits to replace a constant proportion of pre-retirement earnings and keep pace with rising living standards), medical cost inflation in excess of general inflation, and new spending attributable to implementation of the health care reform law of 2010. ", "The effect of these factors can be seen in Figure 3 , which shows the trend in outlays for each of the six human resources budget functions, as a share of GDP, from FY1962 through FY2010 and then projected through FY2021. The figure illustrates that spending in the human resources superfunction has been increasingly dominated by four categories: health (Function 500, which primarily consists of Medicaid), Medicare (Function 570), income security (Function 600), and Social Security (Function 650). With no change in current law, CBO projects that spending for income security as a share of GDP will contract over the next decade, as will spending for the two smallest functions\u2014education, training, employment, and social services (Function 500), and veterans benefits and services (Function 700).

A review of these programs shows the same trend discussed above; that is, health care is growing as a share of the economy while spending for other services (other than Social Security) contracts. A CRS analysis of federal outlays for major federal low-income programs shows aggregate spending for these programs, as a share of GDP, will have peaked in FY2010 but will rise again starting in FY2013. However, all projected growth in spending for these low-income programs will be for health programs (specifically Medicaid, CHIP, and the refundable portion of a health insurance tax credit created under the 2010 health care reform law, which is scheduled to begin in 2014).

The Administration budget would track closely with CBO, which expects an initial drop in Medicaid spending in FY2012, due to the scheduled expiration of enhanced federal matching to states initially authorized by ARRA, and the effects of the economic recovery on the Medicaid caseload. However, spending would then climb sharply, starting in FY2013, under both the CBO baseline and the Administration's February budget.

It also includes the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and the American Battle Monuments Commission. This function includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation, life insurance, and burial benefits, among other benefits and services. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services; almost 90% of appropriated funding in Function 700 goes to veterans' health care. ", "Spending under this function is divided among five subfunctions: ", "income security for veterans; veterans education, training, and rehabilitation; hospital and medical care for veterans; veterans housing; and other veterans benefits and services.", " Figure 10 shows estimated outlays for Function 700 programs, from FY2011 through FY2021 in constant FY2011 dollars, under the CBO baseline, the Administration's February budget request, and the House budget resolution. The Administration and House budgets for veterans benefits and services are virtually identical, and both very slightly exceed the CBO baseline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Programs categorized as \"human resources\" comprise the majority of federal outlays and have grown over the last five decades as a share of the overall national economy. CBO expects that spending for these programs will have peaked in FY2010 and will fall through FY2014, although spending levels will remain higher than they were before the recent recession. CBO further expects that overall human resources spending will begin to climb again starting in FY2015; however, all of the projected growth will be in health care (Medicaid and Medicare) and Social Security. All other components of the human resources superfunction will diminish as a share of the economy over the coming decade, according to CBO's current law baseline.", "The Administration and Congress are engaged in a debate over reducing the federal deficit and stabilizing the national debt; proposals to reduce and change the composition of federal spending are a major part of this debate. In February, the Administration gave Congress a detailed budget request for FY2012, which includes proposals to reduce spending for certain programs and increase spending for others; the February budget request was followed in April with an additional set of deficit reduction principles. Based on an analysis of the February budget, the Administration proposes no overall reduction in outlays for the human resources superfunction, although some of the proposals included in the April Framework would further lower spending for this portion of the budget. The budget resolution passed in April by the House, on the other hand, sets spending targets that would reduce outlays in the human resources superfunction to a level that would be 14% below the CBO baseline by FY2021. ", "Within the human resources category, the House resolution would reduce spending primarily in three functions. By FY2021, the resolution would result in spending for Function 500 (education, training, employment, and social services, or ETESS) that is 36% below the CBO baseline. The largest reduction from the CBO baseline, if all provisions in the House resolution were enacted, would occur in Function 550 (health, including Medicaid); the House spending target for this function in FY2021 would be 50% below the baseline. Finally, spending for Function 600 (income security) in FY2021 would be 11% below the baseline under the House resolution. As noted earlier in this report, most federal programs specifically directed to low-income populations are in the human resources superfunction and are most likely to be included in the three specific functions just mentioned. ", "In comparing these proposals, it is important to note the significant difference in size among the functions. For example, while the House budget resolution envisions a relatively large reduction in spending for Function 500 (ETESS) than would otherwise occur under current law, this proposal would contribute relatively little toward deficit reduction because of the small size of the function overall. On the other hand, with no change in current law CBO expects the function that includes Medicaid will be more than six times larger than Function 500 in FY2021 and the income security function will be more than four times larger; thus, reductions from the baseline in these functions would yield greater savings.", "Although the House resolution assumes conversion of Medicare into a premium subsidy program, this would not take effect until FY2022, which is beyond the 10-year budget window and therefore not reflected in the spending trends displayed in this report. Likewise, neither the Administration's budget nor the House budget resolution includes specific changes to Social Security or veterans benefits and services. Social Security is currently the largest of the human resources functions under current law, and would remain so under both the Administration and House proposals, with projected spending in FY2021 that is 10 times that of Function 500 (ETESS) and more than twice that of Function 600 (income security). Projected Medicare spending would be more than seven times that of Function 500 in FY2021 and more than 50% larger than Function 600."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
