The report also includes a list of floor votes since 1979 on implementing legislation for trade agreements that were passed under TPA fast-track procedures. Although TPA expired on July 1, 2007, four free trade agreements (FTAs) were signed in time to be considered under TPA expedited procedures in the 110th Congress. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act was passed by Congress (H.R. 3688) and signed into law as P.L. 110-138 on December 14, 2007.

This process is tied to the President's authority provided by Congress to enter into trade agreements to reduce U.S. tariff and non-tariff barriers with other countries. The fast-track authority provides that Congress will consider trade agreement implementing bills within mandatory deadlines, with a limitation on debate, and without amendment, as long as the President meets prescribed requirements set out by law.", "Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (P.L. 73-316), Congress delegated renewable authority to the President to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions. The Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) expanded this authority to include negotiations of nontariff trade barriers, but required more extensive reporting and consultations between Congress and the President during trade negotiations. This act also had a provision under which Congress would consider implementing bills for trade agreements under expedited congressional procedures, known as fast-track. Table 1 shows how Congress renewed fast-track authority on particular dates. In the years following the expiration of fast-track authority in 1994, there were several legislative proposals to reauthorize the trade authority procedures; these bills, including H.R. 2621 in the 105 th Congress, did not pass.", "In the 107 th Congress, several legislative proposals on trade promotion authority (TPA) were considered. The original House version of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act ( H.R. 3005 ) passed by one vote on December 6, 2001 (215-214). Another bill, H.R. 3009 , was amended several times in the House and the Senate to include additional trade issues. Following House and Senate negotiations and agreement to the conference report for H.R. 3009 , the President signed H.R. 3009 , as P.L. 107-210 , the Trade Act of 2002, on August 6, 2002. This major piece of trade legislation has the TPA provisions in Title XXI, Section 210l, as the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA procedures apply to implementing bills for trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2007.", "Although TPA expired on July 1, 2007, four proposed U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) were signed in time to be considered by Congress under TPA procedures in the 110 th Congress; the U.S. FTAs were negotiated separately with the countries of Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.

On April 10, 2008, the House passed H.Res. 1092 , relating to H.R. 5724 ; this resolution provided a rule that disallowed the use of time limitations for consideration of the implementing bill. No further legislative action on H.R. 5724 occurred in the 110 th Congress.", "In the 111 th Congress, no legislation for the three proposed U.S. trade agreements (with the countries of Colombia, Panama, and South Korea) was introduced.
