U.S. government contracting efforts encompass a significant portion of U.S. activity in Afghanistan and are a key component of the current counterinsurgency (COIN) effort. From FY2005 through 2011, the U.S. government obligated over $50 billion for contracts performed primarily in Afghanistan.

In wartime, however\u2014and particularly in a counterinsurgency environment\u2014cost, schedule, and performance are often secondary to the larger strategic goals of promoting security and denying popular support for the insurgency. For example, in peacetime, the primary purpose of building a road is often to have the road built to specification in the most efficient and least expensive way. Other policy considerations may be factored in (such as small business or environmental concerns), but if the road is built on time, on schedule, and to the required specifications, the contract is usually deemed a success. In wartime, however, these may not be the right measures, as other goals may be equally or more important. Winning the support of the local village is often more important than staying on schedule. Helping train local nationals and building up the technical capabilities of local firms may be well worth a substantial increase in contract costs.", "Contract risks can also differ greatly between peacetime and wartime. Peacetime risks generally include cost overruns, schedule slips, and poor performance. Additional risks that must be considered when awarding a contract in an environment such as Afghanistan include diverting millions of dollars to warlords, criminal networks, or insurgents; hiring private security and other contractors who may engage in abuses that undermine the legitimacy of coalition forces; and the inflow of large sums of poorly managed contracting dollars fueling corruption. As General Allen stated in his contracting guidance to commanders in Afghanistan, it is important to \"look beyond cost, schedule, and performance. Evaluate the success of a contract by the degree to which it supports the Afghan people and economy and our campaign objectives. Include operational criteria in decisions to award contracts, such as the effect of the contract on security, local power dynamics, and the enemy.\" For these reasons, contracting in wartime is often far more complex than contracting in peacetime.", "Some of the weaknesses of the current federal government acquisition process can be exacerbated by and exploited in a wartime environment, making it more difficult to adhere to best practices. These weaknesses include inadequate acquisition planning, poorly written requirements, and an insufficient number of qualified and capable acquisition and contract oversight personnel. For example, in a wartime environment, it is more difficult to write a good contract that incorporates the sometimes competing goals of counterinsurgency (COIN) contracting, more difficult to research and evaluate companies bidding on a contract, and more difficult to conduct oversight of projects being built in dangerous locations. It is also more difficult to protect against contracting fraud and corruption in countries that have weak law enforcement and judicial systems. Corrupt officials and warlords can exploit these weaknesses to divert contracting funds to their own coffers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges of Wartime Contracting", "paragraphs": ["The challenge in Afghanistan is to ensure that U.S. funded contracts not only meet the stated requirements of customers, but do so without undermining the overall mission. Ideally, contracts will fulfill requirements while simultaneously contributing in other ways to the overall U.S. and International Security Assistance Force-Afghanistan (ISAF) mission of promoting security and building Afghan economic and government capacity.", "DOD contracts in Afghanistan are generally written to", "1. sustain the force (base support, LOGCAP ), 2. build physical infrastructure (roads, power plants, cell towers, buildings), 3. develop the capacity of Afghans to sustain government operations and economic growth (training and mentoring Afghans, building technical capabilities of Afghan companies), or 4. create a secure environment and diminish violence.", "Because defense contracting in Afghanistan is intended to support the overall U.S. military and coalition mission, it is more difficult to write contract requirements that truly capture the underlying goals of the commander. As the example of the road construction project illustrates, while the specific requirement may be for a road, the broader requirement of the commander may be to promote security, economic development, and winning over the local community. Writing a requirement that captures the overall needs of the commander, and structuring a contract that advances the overall mission, is more difficult than writing requirements and structuring a contract for a road. Some contract provisions that can promote counterinsurgency goals include providing incentives to the non-Afghan prime contractor to train Afghan subcontractors in advanced engineering (meeting the goal of developing the economic capacity of Afghans), restricting competition or requiring contractors to employ locals (meeting the goal of promoting security by providing jobs to Afghans who might otherwise join the insurgency or turn to criminal activity), or ensuring that funds are reserved for long-term maintenance and operation of the road (ensuring sustainability of the effort).", "Even if the broader intent of the commander is addressed and a project is approached with COIN effects in mind, there is a larger question of how a given project coordinates with other projects to contribute to the overall national strategy. For example, if one area commander focuses on power generation, another focuses on road infrastructure, and a third focuses on irrigation, the result may be that millions of dollars are spent to create a patchwork of uncoordinated and ill-conceived projects that do not substantially contribute to economic development. Some observers believe that such fragmentation of effort is particularly pronounced in Afghanistan, where projects are funded by numerous agencies and organizations, including DOD, Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Afghan government, the United Nations, the Asia Development Bank, the governments of other coalition partners, and many others.", "Another factor further complicating project development and contracting writing, even when an overarching strategy is in place, is the challenge of figuring out how to create a project to best fit the unique needs and resources of Afghanistan. A number of projects built in Afghanistan were built to Western standards; these standards are not always appropriate for Afghanistan. For example, building a school according to American specifications may not be appropriate for Afghanistan if the lighting specifications require bulbs that are not readily available in Afghanistan. Building to Western standards also often results in higher operation and maintenance costs\u2014costs that the Afghan government cannot afford to underwrite. Determining what are the most appropriate standards and quality of work in Afghanistan for a specific project further complicates the job of U.S. acquisition personnel who are accustomed to American standards and specifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The State of Government Contracting in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Personnel System Challenges", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government personnel rotate in and out of Afghanistan for tours generally ranging from 4 to 12 months, and sometimes for as little as 3 weeks. The constant rotation in and out of theatre makes it difficult to sustain long-term development strategies. For example, one military officer stated that when he was responsible for a region in Afghanistan, he implemented a micro-loan program to stimulate the economy. According to the officer, most loan recipients were repaying their loans. When the brigade rotated out of the region, the incoming brigade instituted a program that offered micro-grants instead of loans. The effect of the micro-grant program was to create divisions within the local community because many locals were upset that they had to repay loans when their neighbors received grants. In another instance, an officer stated that his strategy was to use micro-grants to help nurture the local economy and then graduate to other types of assistance. However, when his unit rotated out, the new unit decided to start a new micro-grant policy, resulting in some of the same people receiving additional grants. These examples illustrate the disruption and lack of coordination caused by constant troop rotation.", "The constant rotation of U.S. personnel also makes it difficult to plan, implement, and oversee contracts. An important aspect of wartime contracting is understanding the local political and economic landscape to ensure that contracts do not have a negative impact on the community, such as inflating prices or undermining the existing political structure. As General Allen wrote, commanders and contracting personnel must \"consider both the potential positive effects of contract spending on the Afghan economy and potential negative effects, in concert with the Commander's campaign plan.\" However, it is difficult for commanders, acquisition personnel, and contracting officer representatives to understand the contracting landscape when they have only been in theatre for a short period.", "Another personnel-related challenge results from the way staff are assigned to positions in Afghanistan. Often, individuals are assigned to positions or given tasks to perform when they have no relevant background or experience in the subject matter\u2014for example, an officer with a PhD in urban planning who was assigned to work at the Afghan Customs Department. As a result of the sometimes ad hoc nature of assigning people in the military, people who have no contracting experience have been assigned to develop contracting strategy, and contracting officer representatives with no construction experience oversee minor construction projects. Some senior ranking officers are assigned ad hoc to lead contracting efforts when they have no relevant experience in the subject matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficient Contract Oversight", "paragraphs": ["According to some government officials, there are simply not enough contracting officer representatives (CORs) in theatre to conduct adequate oversight. Insufficient numbers of oversight personnel increase the risk of poor contract performance. In Afghanistan\u2014where corruption is rampant, criminal networks are thriving, and an insurgency is actively seeking to disrupt and undermine coalition efforts\u2014insufficient contract oversight creates opportunities for criminals and insurgents to enrich themselves to the detriment of coalition goals. Contract management and oversight are therefore more important in Afghanistan than in peacetime settings. At the same time, actually performing contract oversight in Afghanistan is more difficult.", "In some instances the problem is not the number of contracting officer representatives, but the lack of expertise of those assigned to conduct oversight. According to DOD officials, the current training may qualify CORs, but it does not necessarily make them sufficiently capable for their particular assignments. According to a senior contracting official in Afghanistan, CORs with no construction experience are often assigned to oversee minor construction projects. These CORs may be called upon, for example, to determine whether a concrete slab meets the requirement of withstanding 3,000 psi of pressure without the expertise to make such a judgment.", "As previously discussed, the shortage of capable CORs is exacerbated by a wartime environment that results in a constant rotation of personnel in and out of theatre, as well as by a security environment that makes it difficult to conduct project oversight in remote locations. The constant rotation of military and civilian personnel means that there is weak continuity of oversight and that the contractors, who have been in Afghanistan for years, have a better understanding of the contracting landscape. Sometimes there are gaps between when one COR leaves theatre and another COR is appointed to a contract. In addition, the lack of security means that even if there are capable oversight personnel in place, it may be difficult to get to the location where a project is being built or a service is being performed. In September 2011, a contracting officer representative working for the Army Corps of Engineers was kidnapped and killed by an Afghan security guard. The victim is not the first American believed to have been killed as a result of efforts to conduct oversight. Because many contractors and their employees are Afghan, effective oversight is further hampered by the inability of most contract oversight personnel to speak to workers without an interpreter.", "All these factors combine to create an environment where there is insufficient oversight of many U.S. funded projects currently underway in Afghanistan. As a result, some contracts are not being performed to required specifications and tens of millions of dollars' worth of equipment, repair parts, and supplies are stolen. According to numerous government officials, intelligence sources, and contractor reports, significant amounts of contracting funds flow to criminal networks and insurgents.", "The lack of effective oversight also enables corruption and fraud. According to acquisition officials in Afghanistan, documents are signed accepting the work of contractors even when government officials have not inspected the goods or services being delivered and without rejecting work that does not meet the contract requirements. A number of analysts and officials have argued that until commanders view contract performance as a priority, contract oversight will continue to suffer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corruption and Criminal Activity", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge is contracting in an environment that is rife with corruption, defined in this context as the misuse of a position of authority for personal gain, to the detriment of society and the goals of the mission.

One USAID official estimated that on some projects, up to 30% of contracted project costs can be attributed to corruption. A number of government and industry officials stated that corruption is the \"price of doing business\" in Afghanistan. Corruption takes many forms, including government officials charging bribes for transporting goods across the border and extorting protection payments. Many analysts view large swaths of the judicial sector and the attorney general's office as corrupt, as evidenced by the lack of prosecutions against high-ranking government officials or warlords accused of being involved in criminal activity or rampant corruption. In other instances, members of the Afghan security forces use their position to demand bribes and extort shipping companies at Afghan borders and airports.", "According to many analysts, substantial sums of aid money flowing into Afghanistan are being pocketed by corrupt officials and criminal networks, and are being diverted out of the country into bank accounts in Dubai and other overseas destinations. According to one joint Afghan government-ISAF estimate, the amount of goods flowing into Afghanistan should generate approximately $2 billion of customs revenue annually; instead, approximately $1 billion flows to the government and $1 billion is being diverted by local officials at the border. Approximately $70 million a week (more than $3.5 billion annually) flows out of Afghanistan legally, and many analysts believe that the illegal flow of money is substantially higher. This compares to the Afghan government's total core budget of $3.4 billion in FY2010.", "At a strategic level, the extent of corruption in Afghanistan raises questions as to how much of the money spent on U.S. government contracting is having a positive impact on the Afghan economy, and how much of the funds is actually staying in country. At a project level, the threat of corruption raises a number of questions for commanders and contracting officers, including whether a given project is an appropriate use of funds if the \"corruption cost\" is high, and how contracts can be structured or oversight can be performed to mitigate the threat of corruption. Among many Afghans, there is a perception that U.S. government contracting practices have enriched a select few at the expense of the general population."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Efforts to Improve Contracting in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["Numerous reports have been written about the state of contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Other recommendations have called for mechanisms for improving interagency coordination or elevating the importance of contracting by creating senior agency positions responsible for contingency contracting matters.", "Other analysts have argued that nothing short of a culture shift in the military is required to improve contracting during contingency operations.

The message was, if done right, contracting is a powerful way of supporting and promoting the mission; if done wrong, contracting can undermine the mission. This message is reinforced when commanders discuss contracting as part of overall discussions, as was recently done when General Allen discussed the new National Afghan Trucking contract in the daily COMISAF standup briefing.", "According to analysts and government officials, the contracting guidance has raised the awareness of the importance of contracting and the impact that contracting can have, both positive and negative, on the overall mission in Afghanistan. To many, the contracting guidance represented a philosophical shift requiring operational commanders to be more actively involved in contracting decisions and ensuring that contracting is more integrated with logistics, operations, intelligence, and COIN strategy.", "The role of contracting was also elevated when responsibility for contracting strategy and execution became the responsibility of generals. Under General Petreus, the position of Senior Contracting Official-Afghanistan was elevated from a colonel to a brigadier general. Under General Allen, implementation and coordination of COIN contracting guidance is the responsibility of several brigadier generals (see discussion below).", "Some analysts and military personnel believe there is room for senior leadership to engage even more on contracting issues, such as requiring contracting and economic development to be more fully integrated into daily leadership briefings. A number of general officers and acquisition personnel believe that the current level of leadership engagement is starting to change the way people think about how contracting is being done in Afghanistan.

The Department of Defense signed this contract for ground transportation to provide over 70% of the total dry goods and fuel for U.S. and coalition troops. The contract was awarded to eight prime contractors: two U.S., three Afghan, and three multi-national joint-venture companies. According to the contract, each contractor was responsible for its own security. The contract started in March 2009 and ended on September 15, 2011. Over $700 million was paid to eight transportation companies for delivery of services because of what DOD acquisition officials believe were inflated U.S. government cost estimates.", "Several Host Nation Trucking vendors are believed to have directed money through subcontractors to warlords and insurgents. Vendors were linked to criminal networks. According to military officials in Afghanistan, poor accountability and enforcement of supply procedures made cargo loads susceptible to fraud and pilferage. But because there were only eight prime contractors available to bring in large volumes of goods, there was little option but to use all of the contractors regardless of how well they performed or what they did. Because deliveries were not awarded based on performance, the U.S. government had limited ability to affect contractor behavior. Eventually, most of the prime contractors were suspended or debarred.", "In September 2011, the Host Nation Trucking Contract was replaced with a new contract, the National Afghan Trucking Contract. Leveraging some of the infrastructure that was put in place to improve contracting in Afghanistan, the new contract is viewed by many DOD officials and analysts as more effectively tailored to account for the unique wartime environment. Task Force 2010 reviewed the Host Nation Trucking contract and found that the way the statement of work was structured created opportunities for excessive profit and waste. For example, the same fee was paid without regard to whether security was actually used, and the payment structure inflated the market price, thus adversely impacting the local economy by adversely distorting market prices.", "With the help of Task Force 2010 and with senior leadership attention at military headquarters in Afghanistan, the new contract includes a number of different strategies, including", "providing separate cost structures depending on the specific security needs associated with the convoy in question, to ensure that the government only pays for actual security costs; inserting contract clauses that require prime contractors to provide information on subcontractors; and increasing the number of transportation companies from 8 to 20 to provide more flexibility in giving work to good companies and limiting the need to subcontract.", "Other changes include an order-of-merit list that awards new missions based on contractor performance and incorporation of new technologies aimed at getting better in-transit visibility and timely delivery.

Senior U.S. officials have publicly acknowledged that Afghanistan cannot sustain its own security budget.

Instead of funding new or completing current projects that cannot be sustained, should aid money be deposited into an account that will fund future operations and maintenance? Do all appropriate reconstruction projects require that Afghan firms be sufficiently trained and capable of operating and maintaining the completed project?
