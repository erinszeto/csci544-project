On December 22, 2008, national attention was turned to issues regarding the waste when a breach in an impoundment pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) Kingston, TN, plant released 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry. The estimated cleanup cost will likely reach $1.2 billion.", "The characteristics of CCW vary, but it generally contains a range of heavy metals such as arsenic, beryllium, chromium, lead, and mercury. While the incident at Kingston drew national attention to the potential for a sudden catastrophic release of waste, the primary concern regarding the management of CCW usually relates to the potential for hazardous constituents to leach into surface or groundwater, and hence contaminate drinking water, surface water, or living organisms. The presence of hazardous constituents in the waste does not, by itself, mean that they will contaminate the surrounding air, ground, groundwater, or surface water. There are many complex physical and biogeochemical factors that influence the degree to which heavy metals can dissolve and migrate offsite\u2014such as the mass of toxins in the waste and the degree to which water is able to flow through it. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that arsenic and lead and other carcinogens have leached into groundwater and exceeded safe limits when CCW is disposed of in unlined disposal units.", "In addition to discussions regarding the potential harm to human health and the environment, the Kingston release brought attention to the fact that the management of CCW is essentially exempt from federal regulation. Instead, it is regulated in accordance with requirements established by individual states. State requirements generally apply to two broad categories of actions\u2014the disposal of CCW (in landfills, surface impoundment, or mines) and its beneficial use (e.g., as a component in concrete, cement, or gypsum wallboard, or as structural or embankment fill).", "In May 2000, partly as a result of inconsistencies in state requirements, EPA determined that national regulations regarding CCW disposal were needed. To date, regulations have not been proposed. However, on March 9, 2009, EPA stated that regulations to address CCW disposal in landfills and surface impoundments would be proposed by the end of 2009. Also, in March 2007, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the disposal of CCW in mines was released by the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining (OSM). Draft rules have not yet been proposed. With regard to potential uses of CCW, EPA has stated that there have been few studies that would definitively prove that certain uses of CCW are safe, but that its use should include certain precautions to ensure adequate groundwater protection. It is unknown whether regulations regarding beneficial uses of CCW will be included in the upcoming rulemaking.", "Some Members of Congress and other stakeholders have expressed concern regarding how CCW will ultimately be regulated. Among other issues, there is concern that the upcoming regulations will be either too far-reaching, and hence costly, or not far-reaching enough\u2014meaning that they will not establish consistent, enforceable, minimal federal requirements applicable to CCW disposal units. On December 17, 2009, EPA issued a statement that its pending decision on regulating CCW would be delayed for a \"short period due to the complexity of the analysis the agency is currently finishing.\""], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Disposal and Use Issues", "paragraphs": ["Coal fired power plants account for almost 45% of electric power generated in the United States. The coal combustion process at those facilities generates a tremendous amount of waste. In 2008, industry estimates indicate that 136 million tons of coal combustion waste (CCW) was generated. That would make CCW the second largest waste stream in the United States, second to municipal solid waste, or common household garbage. How CCW is managed and how those management methods are regulated have come under increased scrutiny in the last year.", "Coal combustion waste is managed in two ways: It may be disposed of in landfills or surface impoundment ponds, or in mines as minefill, or it may be used in some capacity (commonly referred to as \"beneficial use\")\u2014for example, as a component in concrete, cement, or gypsum wallboard, or as structural or embankment fill. These management methods are largely unregulated at the federal level. Instead, they are regulated according to state requirements that vary from state to state.", "On December 22, 2008, national attention was turned to potential risks associated with CCW management when a breach in an impoundment pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) Kingston, TN, plant released 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry. The release covered more than 300 acres and damaged or destroyed homes and property. The sludge discharged into the nearby Emory and Clinch rivers, filling large areas of the rivers and resulting in fish kills. Sampling at the site in January 2009 found arsenic levels that exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Removal Action Level (contaminant levels at which time-critical response actions may be required).", "According to TVA, the estimated cleanup cost will likely reach $1.2 billion. TVA recognized that this estimate could change significantly depending on the method of containment or the amount of ash ultimately disposed of as well as the impact of new coal ash laws and regulations that may be implemented at the state or federal level. Further, TVA's estimate does not include the potential costs associated with future regulatory actions, litigation, fines or penalties that may be assessed, final remediation activities, or other settlements. EPA and TVA have estimated that the cleanup may take two to three years.", "In addition to the Kingston release, other events related to CCW management have attracted national media attention, as well as the attention of various stakeholders and some Members of Congress. For example, on December 30, 2008, a $54 million class action settlement was approved between Constellation Energy and Maryland residents after CCW that had been disposed of in a Gambrills, MD, quarry contaminated the owners' drinking water. Wells were determined to be contaminated with arsenic, lead, cadmium, and sulphates at levels above EPA drinking water standards.", "Concern for a potential accidental release or contamination associated with CCW management is not new. However, the recent high-profile incidents have brought increased attention to the issue. Concerns about CCW management generally center around the following issues:", "The waste is generated in tremendous volumes and has been accumulating at some sites for decades. Individual power plants may generate thousands to hundreds of thousands of tons of the waste each year\u2014the majority of which is disposed of onsite. Some plants have been in operation for decades (the site of the Kingston release has accumulated ash sludge since 1954), resulting in the disposal of millions of tons of CCW at individual plants across the United States. The waste likely contains certain hazardous constituents that EPA has determined pose a risk to human health and the environment. Those constituents include heavy metals such as arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury, and certain toxic organic materials such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. Under certain conditions, hazardous constituents in CCW migrate and can contaminate groundwater or surface water, and hence living organisms. For example, EPA determined that the potential risk of human exposure to arsenic and other metals in CCW (via the groundwater-to-drinking-water pathway) increased significantly when CCW was disposed of in unlined landfills. That risk criterion was slightly higher for unlined surface impoundments. According to EPA, the majority of new landfills and surface impoundments are constructed with liners and have groundwater monitoring systems. However, it is difficult to determine how many older units that may be operational do not have liners or groundwater monitoring. Although CCW contains hazardous constituents, it has been specifically exempt from federal hazardous waste management regulations. Instead, it is regulated in accordance with requirements established by the states. In 1999, EPA determined that national regulations regarding CCW disposal were needed, in part due to inconsistencies in state requirements. Since then, various surveys have been conducted and data gathered, but EPA has not proposed regulations.", "Members of the public, particularly those near utility plants, have expressed concern that their health or property values may be affected by either a sudden release of waste, as in Kingston, or the gradual release of contaminants. Industry organizations insist that the waste is generally safe and does not pose a significant risk that would warrant the increased cost of more stringent management\u2014costs that would be ultimately borne by rate payers. They also argue that being required to manage the waste according to hazardous waste regulations would limit its potential for use\u2014thereby increasing the amount that must be disposed of. Environmental organizations argue that the Kingston spill was a warning sign of spills to come and that there is currently inadequate oversight and monitoring of either existing or closed disposal sites.", "Some Members of Congress have also expressed concern over these issues, both before and after the Kingston release. Like other stakeholders, their concerns have stretched across various areas including the role that coal mining plays in our economy, the role that coal-fired utilities play as a major source of domestic energy, the federal role in the regulation of CCW, as well as the potential risks posed to their constituents if CCW is managed improperly.", "EPA has been studying how best to regulate CCW since at least 1980. Waste management is regulated under provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901 et seq .). In May 2000, EPA determined that CCW did not warrant regulation under subtitle C of RCRA (the federal hazardous waste requirements). EPA did, however, determine that national regulations under subtitle D of RCRA (the solid waste management requirements) were warranted for CCW when it is disposed in landfills or surface impoundments. EPA also found that CCW used to fill surface or underground mines warranted regulation under RCRA's solid waste requirements or possibly under modifications to existing regulations established under authority of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). Since then, various surveys have been conducted, reports issued, and data gathered, but no federal regulations have been proposed.", "On March 9, 2009, in the wake of the Kingston release, EPA declared its intent to move forward with CCW regulations to address the management of coal combustion residuals. EPA stated that regulations would be proposed for public comment by the end of 2009.", "Since EPA's statement, industry and environmental groups, state government representatives, and some Members of Congress have expressed concerns regarding how the waste will ultimately be regulated. Generally those concerns center around whether CCW will be regulated as a solid or hazardous waste. Subsequently, representatives with EPA have declared that, although they felt that regulating CCW under RCRA's solid waste management requirements (e.g., subtitle D's landfill criteria and permitting requirements) would provide sufficient protection, the agency had no authority to do so. Instead, their only existing authority was to regulate the waste under RCRA's hazardous waste management requirements (for more information, see \" The Current Rulemaking \"). On December 17, 2009, EPA issued a statement that its pending decision on regulating CCW would be delayed for a \"short period due to the complexity of the analysis the agency is currently finishing.\"", "Regardless of the ultimate choice of waste management, the amounts of CCW generated each year are tremendous. As power plant emission standards become more stringent and air emission control devices capture more contaminants, both the total waste generated and the amount of toxins in the waste can be expected to increase.", "To provide information and context on this issue, this report discusses the nature of the waste itself; potential risks associated with its management; the regulatory history of CCW management requirements, including why CCW is exempt from federal regulations and issues associated with the current rulemaking; and CCW management options (e.g., landfill and surface impoundment disposal) and the likely state and federal requirements associated with those management methods.

Therefore, its characteristics are strongly influenced by the source coal itself (e.g. lignite, bituminous). T he chemical characteristics of any co- fired materials .

T he processes or technology used at individual utility plants . Waste characteristics are affected by the particular combustion technology, air emission control devices used to capture regulated contaminants (e.g., sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury), and residue-handling technology (collection systems result in either dry or wet residues) used at the plant.", "While the components of each type of ash vary, depending on these factors, all CCW will likely include certain amounts of toxic constituents, primarily heavy metals such as arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium. The waste will also likely include a certain level of toxic organic materials such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds.", "With regard to the source coal, the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a database of coal quality characteristics of coal basins in the United States. The three types of coal most often used in utility boilers, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite, vary in terms of their chemical composition, ash content, and geological origin. Some of the principal components in the fly ash from these types of coal are silica, alumina, iron oxide, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These same components can make CCW usable as an ingredient in Portland cement or as a soil amendment.", "Knowledge of coal chemistry\u2014as well as the technology used to fire, filter, and collect it\u2014is important to determine which mitigation procedure will be most efficient in reducing the amount of hazardous material potentially generated as waste."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Risks Associated with CCW Management", "paragraphs": ["Generally, there are two potential risks associated with the disposal or use of CCW. Disposal or use that involves direct applications of the waste to the ground may allow hazardous constituents in the waste to leach from the material, migrate, and contaminate groundwater or surface water and, ultimately, living organisms.

Those factors include:", "T he volume and degree to which water is able to flow through the waste . Water, such as precipitation or groundwater flow, is the primary mechanism for the transport of hazardous constituents through the waste.

However, there is little data regarding contamination associated with its disposal in mines or the \"beneficial use\" of CCW when it is place directly on land\u2014such as when used as embankment or structural fill.

Those options, as well as selected and pros and cons outlined by various stakeholders, are summarized in Table 3 .", "On December 17, 2009, EPA issued a statement indicating that the regulatory proposal is on hold."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Requirements Applicable to CCW Management", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, CCW is managed in one of two ways\u2014it is either disposed of in landfills, surface impoundments, or mines, or it is put to some beneficial use . In 2008, 136 million tons of CCW were generated. Industry estimates indicate that 8% was disposed of in mines as minefill and 37% was used in some capacity (e.g., as a component in concrete, cement, or gypsum wallboard, or as structural or embankment fill). The remainder was disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments. Requirements applicable to each of these management methods are determined by individual states. Generally, the only federal role in their management may be that certain state permit programs (e.g., those related to wastewater discharges to surface water) are implemented under the authority of federal law. Other than that, there is little federal role in CCW management.", "It is difficult to make any broad statements about regulations applicable to CCW management methods. Regulations do not just vary from state to state, but from unit to unit. For example, a given state likely regulates surface impoundments and landfills under different requirements associated with regulations applicable to solid waste and wastewater management, while mine disposal and beneficial uses may be largely unregulated.", "Regulatory requirements within a given state may also vary depending on when a disposal unit went into operation. For example, requirements applicable to older landfills may be grandfathered in, under less stringent requirements than newer units, as new laws are enacted. Also, no industry or federal agency tracks the total number of disposal units or waste usage sites (e.g., locations where waste may have been used as structural fill). That is not to say that the waste is necessarily unregulated or disposed of improperly\u2014only that there are many unknown elements of both current disposal and use practices, and probably even less that is known about sites that have been closed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Landfill and Surface Impoundment Disposal", "paragraphs": ["Landfilling CCW involves the long-term disposal of generally dry waste that is placed on an area of land or an excavation for permanent disposal. Surface impoundment units hold liquid waste that is generally sluiced directly from a power plant to the impoundment unit, where solids settle out, leaving relatively clear water at the surface (which may be recirculated into the plant or discharged to surface water). The impoundment itself may be a natural or man-made depression or diked area formed of earthen materials used for temporary or permanent storage or treatment of liquid waste. Solids may accumulate until the impoundment unit is full, or they may be dredged periodically and taken to another disposal unit such as a landfill.", "In 2006, in a joint-agency effort, EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) conducted a study to determine state regulatory requirements applicable to CCW landfills and surface impoundments built between 1994 and 2004. At the time, it was estimated that roughly two-thirds of the waste was disposed of in landfills and the remainder in surface impoundments. However, it is unknown how accurate that estimate is. In March 2009, when EPA surveyed power plants to determine the integrity of existing surface impoundments, the agency estimated that there were approximately 300 ponds nationwide. Instead, survey results found that there are 584. There is no comparable data on the number of landfills.", "The EPA/DOE study also found that regulations varied for each type of surface disposal unit, and varied significantly from state to state. A common regulatory element was that all disposal units were required to have some type of permit to operate\u2014generally more than one. The most commonly issued state permits were issued in accordance with a state's solid waste requirements, wastewater or water pollution control requirements, or dam safety requirements.", "As noted in the EPA/DOE study, these requirements applied to \"new\" landfills and surface impoundments. It is unknown how many landfills and surface impoundments built before 1994 exist, are still in operation, or may not have been properly closed. Older units may be required to have permits to continue operation, but would not likely have been required to install liners, leachate collection systems, or groundwater monitoring devices. ", "With regard to surface impoundments, states commonly regulate two elements of a unit\u2014the structure itself (commonly pursuant to the state's dam safety requirements) and any discharges from the unit to surface or groundwater (commonly pursuant to the state wastewater or water pollution control requirements).", "Another complicating factor in determining state CCW disposal requirements is states' tendency to allow a certain number of \"exceptions\" to state regulatory requirements. For example, a state may have specific requirements for landfill and surface impoundment liners or groundwater monitoring systems, but allow an individual plant to implement an alternative means of compliance on a case-by-case basis.", "With regard to both surface impoundments and landfills, many states are likely to require groundwater monitoring to detect contamination from a disposal unit, but fewer states are likely to have regulatory requirements intended to prevent groundwater contamination from occurring (e.g., they would not likely require a plant to install a liner in an older, unlined landfill). These potential variations within a state's own program make comparison from state to state even more difficult. This variation, in part, was the basis for EPA's 2000 determination that consistent, national regulation regarding CCW disposal under RCRA Subtitle D was needed.", "Although details of each state's regulatory requirements vary, there are certain broad requirements that may be similar. For example, a state is likely to regulate new landfills under provisions of the state's solid waste management program.

If a state regulates CCW landfills under its solid waste permit program, new CCW landfills likely are required to have a liner and groundwater monitoring system. Permits may also require leachate collection systems, closure and post-closure requirements, siting controls, or a financial assurance requirement.", "Not all states regulate CCW landfills through a permit program. For example, in the EPA/DOE study, of the 11 state programs analyzed, five adopted laws and regulations that resulted in exemptions from solid waste permitting requirements for certain CCW landfills. That does not necessarily mean that those states exempt CCW landfills from regulation, just that operational requirements established by the state are not met by complying with the terms of a permit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dam Safety Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Many states use their dam safety requirements to regulate the construction, operation, and maintenance of surface impoundments. Such requirements would be intended to prevent a breach of a unit (such as the breach that occurred at Kingston). State dam requirements applicable to CCW surface impoundments may be similar to those for mining waste surface impoundment requirements found in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA)\u2014specifically requirements applicable to the unit design, construction, inspections, and emergency reporting. For example, West Virginia, a state that generates a significant amount of CCW, has dam safety requirements applicable to CCW surface impoundments. Selected elements of those requirements are:", "Units must have an application on file and a certificate of approval from the state to place, construct, or perform major repairs of a waste disposal dam. Plans and specifications of the design and construction must include, among other information, data regarding existing site conditions, subsidence potential, routine inspection and maintenance procedures and schedules, sediment control measures, the placement of spillways, seeding and mulching of the project area, surface drainage structures, installation of reading and monitoring devices, and an inventory of protected sites. Units must meet specific design requirements, such as conformance to general hydrological requirements and, like SMCRA, address criteria applicable to foundation stability, structural consideration, and spillways. Units must meet construction requirements regarding inspections, operations and safety (including emergency procedures), and maintenance.", "The presence of strong dam safety requirements is not a guarantee that regulated units will actually be operated and maintained according to those requirements. The requirements may be only as strong as a state's ability to enforce them. A state may have hundreds of structures required to meet its dam safety requirements and only a limited number of inspectors to insure that they are operated or maintained in an appropriate manner. In addition, a state may have strict requirements applicable to dam construction and operation, but limited ability to inspect those dams as often as necessary to ensure compliance.

As a federal requirement, all states that have been authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program are required to regulate discharges to surface waters in accordance with certain minimum requirements (e.g., in accordance with federally mandated effluent standards). Specifics regarding how a permit program is implemented may vary (as long as minimum federal requirements are adhered to). For example, state water quality agencies may evaluate facilities on a case-by-case basis to determine the need for groundwater-protection measures such as impoundment liners and groundwater monitoring.", "Even facilities that do not discharge wastewater to surface or groundwater may still be regulated in accordance with alternative water pollution control permits.

However, unlike landfill and surface impoundment disposal, some states define minefill disposal as a beneficial use that is exempt from any regulation or restriction.", "In its May 2000 regulatory determination, EPA stated that regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA (and/or possibly modifications to existing regulations established under the authority of the SMCRA) were warranted when these wastes are used to fill surface or underground mines. In 2000, minefill disposal was a relatively new practice that lacked long-term monitoring data regarding its potential risks. In 2003, Congress requested that EPA commission an independent study of the health, safety, and environmental risks associated with the placement of CCW in active and abandoned coal mines in all major U.S. coal basins. As a result, the National Research Council (NRC) established the Committee on Mine Placement of Coal Combustion Wastes in September 2004.", "In March 2006, the NRC committee published its study Managing Coal Combustion Residues in Mines . In part, it found that placing CCW in coal mines as part of the reclamation process is a viable management option as long as the waste placement is properly planned and carried out in a manner that avoids significant adverse environmental and health impacts, and that the regulatory process for issuing permits includes clear provisions for public involvement.", "The NRC committee cautioned that an integrated process of waste characterization, site characterization, management and engineering design of placement activities, and design and implementation of monitoring is required to reduce the risk of contamination moving from a mine site to the ambient environment. It stated further that comparatively little is known about the potential for minefilling to degrade the quality of groundwater and/or surface waters, particularly over longer time periods.", "The committee recommended the establishment of enforceable federal standards to govern the placement of CCW in mines. The committee's reasoning for its recommendation, after reviewing the laws and other relevant literature, was that, although SMCRA does not specifically regulate CCW placement at mine sites, its scope is broad enough to encompass such regulation during reclamation activities. Further, while SMCRA and its implementing regulations indirectly establish performance standards that could be used to regulate the manner in which CCW may be placed in coal mines, neither the statute nor those rules explicitly addresses regulation of the use or placement of CCW, and some states have expressed concern that they do not have the authority to impose performance standards specific to CCW. Therefore, the committee recommended that enforceable federal standards be established for disposal of CCW in mines.

As part of that effort, EPA formed the Coal Combustion Products Partnership (C2P2) program with the American Coal Ash Association, Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, DOE, U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration, and Electric Power Research Institute to help promote the beneficial use of CCW and \"the environmental benefits that result from their use.\"", "EPA has been criticized for promoting certain \"beneficial uses\" of CCW without first determining if such uses are safe. In particular, the safety of agricultural uses or its use as structural or embankment fill has been questioned.

However, from the available data, it has not been determined conclusively that the fly ash placed on the site has impacted nearby residential wells. Monitoring of the site is ongoing.", "Issues associated with the Battlefield Gold Course site brought attention to what little is known about certain \"beneficial\" uses of CCW. In November 2009, the EPA Office of Inspector General issued its findings in an investigation into allegations of a cover-up in the risk assessment for the coal ash rulemaking. The Inspector General found no evidence of wrongdoing, but in that report stated that it has opened an investigation into the EPA's \"partnership\" with the coal industry to market coal ash and other combustion wastes in consumer, agricultural, and industrial products. The report recommended a new probe of why EPA was promoting coal ash prior to determining whether these commercial applications were prudent or safe.
