This report focuses on one pillar of the Dodd-Frank Act's (P.L. 111-203) response to addressing financial stability and ending too big to fail: a new enhanced prudential regulatory regime that applies to all banks with more than $50 billion in assets and to certain other financial institutions. Under this regime, the Federal Reserve is required to apply a number of safety and soundness requirements to large banks that are more stringent than those applied to smaller banks. These requirements are intended to mitigate systemic risk posed by large banks:", "Stress tests and capital planning ensure banks hold enough capital to survive a crisis. Living wills provide a plan to safely wind down a failing bank. Liquidity requirements ensure that banks are sufficiently liquid if they lose access to funding markets. Counterparty limits restrict the bank's exposure to counterparty default. Risk management requires publicly traded companies to have risk committees on their boards and banks to have chief risk officers. Financial stability, regulatory interventions that can be taken only if a bank poses a threat to the financial stability.", "Most of these requirements apply to about 30 U.S. bank holding companies or the U.S. operations of foreign banks. The requirements do not apply to other types of financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets (unless individually designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council), including a few large securities and insurance firms that are chartered as thrift holding companies.", "In addition, a number of provisions, such as higher capital requirements, that stem from the international \"Basel III\" agreement apply only to a handful of the largest banks. This is an example of how the current system is tailored, with the largest banks facing more stringent regulatory requirements than medium-sized and smaller banks.", "Congress is debating whether to modify the $50 billion threshold because some Members believe that it applies to too many banks that do not pose systemic risk. Bills to amend which banks are subject to enhanced regulation include H.R. 3312/S. 1893, H.R. 10, and S. 2155.", "Many economists believe that the economic problem of too big to fail is really a problem of firms that are too complex or too interdependent to fail. Size correlates with complexity and interdependence, but not perfectly. Size is a much simpler and more transparent metric than complexity or interdependence, however. As a practical matter, if size is well correlated with systemic importance, a dollar threshold could serve as a good proxy that is inexpensive and easy to administer. Designating banks on a case-by-case basis could raise similar issues that have occurred in the designation of nonbanks, such as legal challenges to overturn their designation.", "This report also examines the question of which banks are systemically important. However, examining the banks above and slightly below the threshold does not reveal any natural cut off points that divide bank organizations into two groups that clearly present substantively different risks to systemic stability. This is because the size differences between each bank and those nearest to it are incremental and because banks vary across numerous characteristics. For these reasons, making an objective and definitive size-based determination of the point that a bank becomes systemically important is difficult. Regulators do employ an empirical methodology to identify globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) based on a score that is calculated using 12 indicators that measure the size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity of a bank. However, the results of this exercise do not produce a clear and uncontestable score threshold at which institutions clearly become systemically important."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["\"Too big to fail\" (TBTF) is the concept that a financial firm's disorderly failure would cause widespread disruptions in financial markets and result in devastating economic and societal outcomes that the government would feel compelled to prevent, perhaps by providing direct support to the firm.

Some of these large firms were nonbank financial firms, but a few were depository institutions. To avert the imminent failures of Wachovia and Washington Mutual, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arranged for them to be acquired by other banks without government financial assistance. Citigroup and Bank of America were offered additional preferred shares through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and government guarantees on selected assets they owned. In many of these cases, policymakers justified government intervention on the grounds that the firms were \"systemically important\" (popularly understood to be synonymous with too big to fail). Some firms were rescued on those grounds once the crisis struck, although the government had no explicit policy to rescue TBTF firms beforehand.", "In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter, the Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203 ), a comprehensive financial regulatory reform, was enacted in 2010.

This report focuses on one pillar of that approach\u2014the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) enhanced (heightened) prudential regulation for all banks that have more than $50 billion in assets. Recent Congresses have debated modifying this enhanced regulatory regime, with several proposals to reduce the number of firms subject to the regime. In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 10 , the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, would provide banks with an \"off ramp\" from enhanced regulation if they maintained a leverage ratio of 10%. H.R. 3312 , the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017, would replace the $50 billion threshold with a case-by-case designation process, while automatically subjecting banks that have been designated as globally-systemically important banks (G-SIBs) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international forum. Section 401 of S. 2155 , the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, would automatically subject banks that had been designated as G-SIBs and banks with over $250 billion in assets to enhanced regulation. Banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets would still be subject to supervisory stress tests, and the Fed would have discretion to apply other individual enhanced prudential provisions to these banks if it would promote financial stability or the institution's safety and soundness. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would no longer be subject to enhanced regulation, except for the risk committee requirement.", "This report begins with a description of enhanced prudential regulation.

For example in 2017, the adverse scenario is \"characterized by a severe global recession that is accompanied by a period of heightened stress in corporate loan markets and commercial real estate markets.\" ", "Capital requirements are intended to ensure that banks have enough capital backing their assets to absorb any unexpected losses on those assets without resulting in insolvency. Title I requires enhanced capital requirements for banks with more than $50 billion in assets. Overall capital requirements were revamped after the financial crisis through Basel III. Basel III did not include enhanced capital requirements at the $50 billion threshold, but it did include more stringent capital requirements for the largest banks (described below in \" What Other Size-Based Requirements Exist in\u00a0Bank\u00a0Regulation? \"). For banks with more than $50 billion in assets, enhanced capital requirements were primarily implemented through capital planning requirements that are tied to stress test results.

The capital plans must include a projection of the expected uses and sources of capital, including the planned issuance of debt or equity and the planned payment of dividends. The plan must demonstrate that the bank will remain in compliance with capital requirements under the stress tests.

In 2017, the Fed removed qualitative requirements from the capital planning process for banks with less than $250 billion in assets that are not complex.

An asset can qualify as a HQLA if it has lower risk, has a high likelihood of remaining liquid during a crisis, is actively traded in secondary markets, is not subject to excessive price volatility, can be easily valued, and is accepted by the Fed as collateral for loans. Different types of assets are relatively more or less liquid, and there is disagreement on what the cutoff point should be to qualify as a HQLA under the LCR.

Different types of funding and assets receive different weights based on their stability and liquidity, respectively, under a stressed scenario. The rule defines funding as stable based on how likely it is to be available in a panic, classifies it by type, counterparty, and time to maturity. Assets that do not qualify as HQLA under the LCR require the most backing by stable funding under the NSFR.

Another tier of regulation applies to G-SIBs.

G-SIB Capital Surcharge. Basel III also required G-SIBs to hold relatively more capital than other banks in the form of a common equity surcharge of at least 1% to \"reflect the greater risks that they pose to the financial system.\" In July 2015, the Fed issued a final rule that began phasing in this capital surcharge in 2016. Currently, the surcharge applies to the eight G-SIBs, but under its rule, it could designate additional firms as G-SIBs, and it could increase the capital surcharge to as high as 4.5%. The Fed stated that under its rule, most G-SIBs would face a higher capital surcharge than required by Basel III. Countercyclical Capital Buffer. In addition, the banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a Basel III countercyclical capital buffer applied to the advanced approaches banks. The countercyclical buffer would require advanced approaches banks to hold more capital than other banks when regulators believe that financial conditions make the risk of losses abnormally high. It is currently set at zero, but can be modified over the business cycle. Because the countercyclical buffer has not yet been in place for a full business cycle, it is unclear how likely it is that regulators would raise it above zero, and under what circumstances an increase would be triggered.

To further the policy goal of preventing taxpayer bailouts of large financial firms, the Fed issued a 2017 final rule implementing a TLAC requirement for U.S. G-SIBs and the U.S operations of foreign G-SIBs effective at the beginning of 2019. The rule requires G-SIBs to hold a minimum amount of capital and long-term debt at the holding company level so that these equity- and debt-holders can absorb losses and be \"bailed in\" in the event of the firm's insolvency.", "In addition, the Fed tailored some of the Title I requirements for banks with more than $50 billion in assets in its implementation so that more stringent regulatory or compliance requirements were applied to advanced approaches banks or G-SIBs. For example, more stringent versions of the LCR, NSFR, and SCCL are all applied to advanced approaches banks than to banks with more than $50 billion in assets that are not advanced approaches banks. The SCCL as proposed also includes a third, most stringent, requirement that applies to only G-SIBs.", "These requirements all determine how the largest banks have to fund all of their activities on a day-to-day basis. In that sense, these requirements arguably have a larger ongoing impact on banks' marginal cost of providing credit and other services than most of the Title I provisions discussed in the last section that impose only fixed compliance costs on banks.", "Other Provisions U sing Size Thresholds. As noted in the previous section, two Title I requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act (company-run stress tests and risk committee requirements) were applied to banks with more than $10 billion rather than $50 billion in assets.

For example, by statute, only banks with more than $10 billion in assets are subject to the Durbin Amendment, which caps debit interchange fees, and CFPB supervision for consumer compliance. By regulation, there are additional compliance standards for the Volcker Rule for firms with more than $10 billion and $50 billion in assets.

If so, TBTF firms could have a funding advantage compared with other banks, which some call an implicit subsidy.", "According to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the purpose of enhanced regulation is \"to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions.\" General prudential regulation applying to all banks is intended to be microprudential , focusing mainly on the individual institution's safety and soundness. Enhanced regulation is intended to be macroprudential , focusing mainly on the broader systemic risk posed by large institutions. Enhanced regulation is not necessarily mutually exclusive with other policy approaches to eliminating TBTF, although combining approaches could dilute any single approach's effectiveness. Different parts of the Dodd-Frank Act pursue several different approaches to eliminating TBTF.", "One rationale for enhanced prudential regulation holds that restraints on risk-taking at systemically important banks must be in place because eliminating such banks is infeasible or impractical, as is credibly eliminating all expectations of future government support. In this view, at least a few firms will likely come to dominate certain segments of the financial system due to economic incentives to grow larger, such as achieving economies of scale or increasing market power. Thus, breaking up large banks or eliminating all spillover effects would reduce the efficiency of the financial system. Eliminating TBTF through assurances that large firms would not be bailed out may lack credibility with market participants who witnessed the bailout of firms without a prior commitment to provide assistance in the previous crisis. If TBTF institutions cannot be eliminated, then enhanced regulation may be the most practical option for containing it. ", "Few claim that prudential regulation can prevent all failures from occurring; regulated depository institutions have failed throughout U.S. history. Nor is a system without any failures necessarily a desirable one, since risk is inherent in all financial activities. However, enhanced regulation could potentially prevent large banks from taking greater risks due to moral hazard than their smaller counterparts. If successful, fewer large failures or market disruptions would occur, creating a more stable financial system and limiting potential taxpayer exposure through FDIC-insured losses.", "Certain observers are skeptical of the ability of the enhanced prudential regulatory regime to successfully increase systemic stability and eliminate the TBTF problem. Critics cite the fact that most large banks have grown or remained the same size in dollar terms since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act as evidence that TBTF has not been solved. ", "Some critics argue that in general, more prudential regulation may be counterproductive because it curbs the role of market discipline, resulting from such things as creditors monitoring and disincentivizing risky behavior. Enhanced prudential regulation may arguably have a limited effect on market discipline, however, because it only incrementally increases the regulation of large banks. Although regulation is intended to limit risky behavior, it may inadvertently increase systemic risk by causing greater correlation of losses across firms by encouraging all firms to engage in similar behavior. For example, one economist testified that \"many financial sector experts believe that coordinated supervisory stress tests encourage a 'group think' approach to risk management that may increase the probability of a financial crisis.\"", "Other critics question the effectiveness of regulators to prevent the buildup of excessive risk, pointing out they were arguably unable or unwilling to prevent excessive risk-taking before and during the crisis, including in some cases by large banks they directly regulated. Although regulators have adapted in response to weaknesses raised by the crisis, the next crisis is likely to pose a novel set of problems. In addition, some critics fear that the enhanced regime is particularly vulnerable to \"regulatory capture,\" the phenomenon in which the regulated exercise influence over their regulators to undermine the intended goals of regulation. Some have argued that large banks are \"too complex to regulate,\" meaning regulators are incapable of identifying or understanding the risks inherent in complicated transactions and corporate structures. For example, the six largest BHCs had more than 1,000 subsidiaries each, and the two largest had more than 3,000 each in 2012. Further, their complexity has increased over time\u2014only one BHC had more than 500 subsidiaries in 1990, and the share of assets held outside of depository subsidiaries has grown over time for the largest BHCs. Arguably, one of the benefits of enhanced regulation is that it provides opportunities (through living wills, for example) for the Fed and FSOC to better understand the risks institutions pose and the characteristics that could make certain banks systemically important.", "Enhanced regulation could also fail to reduce systemic risk if problems at large firms during the crisis\u2014such as excessive leverage, a sudden loss of liquidity, concentrated or undiversified losses, and investor uncertainty caused by opacity\u2014were not caused by large firms per se, but were instead inherent in certain financial activities. If, in fact, they were representative of problems that firms of all sizes were experiencing, policy should directly treat these problems in a systematic and uniform way for all firms. In other words, prudential regulation could be applied to all firms operating in a given activity or area rather than just large banks, so arguments for and against these policy options do not apply only to their application to large banks. If systemic risk is caused mainly by activities, not large firms, then enhanced regulation could cause systemic risk to migrate away from large banks to other\u2014potentially less regulated\u2014firms, rather than being reduced. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Costs and Benefits of Enhanced Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Specific components of the enhanced regulatory regime are arguably well targeted to mitigating some of the sources of systemic risk. Stress tests are intended to verify that large banks could survive another crisis, living wills are intended to explain to regulators how a failing bank can be safely wound down, counterparty credit limits are intended to limit spillover effects when firms fail, and liquidity requirements attempt to reduce reliance on funding sources that proved to be unreliable during the crisis. However, the degree to which these benefits are realized and the question of whether these benefits justify the cost the regulation may impose are contentious issues.", "Quantifying the benefits of systemic risk provisions is difficult because the benefits of preventing another financial crisis are large, but the probability of another crisis at any given time is small. Furthermore, the ability to isolate the benefits of any particular provision is hindered by the fact that maintaining financial stability likely depends on the joint effects of a number of policies. Some of these provisions come from the Dodd-Frank Act, and others come from Basel III.", "Comparing the magnitude of benefits to the costs they impose involves additional difficulty. Generally, enhanced prudential requirements impose costs on large banks. However, the extent to which those costs are passed on to customers potentially depends on a variety of economic factors, such as the degree of market competition and the price sensitivity of customers. Furthermore, from an economic net benefit perspective, the cost to large banks is less relevant than the overall effects on the costs and availability of credit. At least partly offsetting the higher costs of credit by banks subject to enhanced regulation would be relatively lower costs of capital for other firms. Some of these firms will be small banks, but some financial intermediation could also migrate from large banks to firms that are not regulated for safety and soundness. In that sense, even if a heightened prudential regime worked as planned, net benefits (i.e., reduction of overall systemic risk) could be smaller than anticipated.", "The possibility that TBTF banks create market distortions creates additional considerations. Normally, higher costs imposed by regulation reduce economic efficiency, which must be balanced against the benefits they provide. However, if TBTF banks create moral hazard (a market failure that reduces efficiency), then regulatory costs may increase efficiency (from a societal perspective) by reducing risk-taking. Put differently, if there is a TBTF subsidy, then enhanced regulation may reduce that subsidy by mitigating large banks' lack of prudence. ", "Regardless of whether the benefits of enhanced regulation outweigh the costs, there is also the question of whether the regime could be modified to reduce costs without a meaningful decline in benefits. In particular, there are areas of potential overlap among provisions that potentially raise costs. Capital planning requirements impose a de facto additional capital requirement in addition to existing capital requirements that apply to all banks. There are three separate liquidity requirements imposed on banks with more than $50 billion in assets (in addition to liquidity requirements that apply to all banks). Banks with more than $50 billion in assets are required to prepare both living wills and credit exposure reports, both of which require banks to report on their counterparties. Banks with more than $50 billion in assets must also participate in company-run and Fed-run stress tests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Are All Banks with More Than $50 Billion Systemically Important?", "paragraphs": ["Although systemic importance is not the only rationale provided for enhanced prudential regulation, it is the primary one. This section reviews data to attempt to determine whether all of the banks subject to enhanced regulation are systemically important. In particular, critics of the $50 billion threshold distinguish between regional banks (which tend to be at the lower end of the asset range and, it is claimed, have a traditional banking business model comparable to community banks) and Wall Street banks (a term applied to the largest, most complex organizations that tend to have significant nonbank financial activities). Definitively identifying banks that are systemically important is not easily accomplished, in part because potential causes and mechanisms through which a bank could disrupt the financial system and spread distress are numerous and not well understood in all cases. ", "Size is one factor that could make a bank systemically important. For example, a bank with a large amount of liabilities would inflict larger losses on counterparties in the event of default. In addition, because such a bank has larger funding needs, if it experienced liquidity problems and was forced to sell assets\u2014often referred to as forced deleveraging \u2014the large selloff could decrease certain asset prices and trigger fire sales. These are just two examples of how size can cause spillover effects that spread systemic risk more broadly throughout the financial system. ", "When examining banks' asset sizes, there is substantial variation across a number of bank characteristics, but none that clearly identify a cutoff point at which banks begin or cease to be systemically important. Among banks above the $50 billion threshold, organizations vary greatly in size, and except for the very largest, there are no natural breaking points that clearly distinguish one group of banks from another. The largest banks hold about 40 times as many assets as those near the threshold (as shown in Table 1 ), but beyond the largest handful of banks, size decreases fairly incrementally. Although not depicted in the table, the same difficulties are present when analyzing banks near but below the $50 billion threshold\u2014asset size decreases incrementally, with no natural breaking points.", "Size is not the only potential characteristic through which a bank could disrupt financial stability. Regulators have developed certain methodologies to empirically measure systemic importance. A prominent example is the \"method 1 systemic score\" used to determine which institutions are designated as G-SIBs. The scoring methodology uses 12 indicators across five categories to calculate a bank's score. In addition to size, these categories are as follows:", "I nterconnectedness . How interconnected one institution is to other financial companies could lead to contagion effects if its default results in destabilizing losses at other institutions or markets. Interconnectedness is measured in method 1 by a bank's intra-financial system assets and liabilities. S ubstitutability . This metric determines whether other banks or financial institutions could perform the critical functions currently performed by the bank in question should it fail. Substitutability is measured in method 1 by a bank's assets under custody, payments activity, and underwriting. C omplexity . Banks differ substantially across their business models, and certain activities could make them more or less risky and, in the event they experienced distress or failure, more or less likely to destabilize the financial system. Many large bank organizations are engaged in numerous lines of business, including securities trading, insurance, swap dealing, custodial services, credit card issuance, merchant banking, and clearing and settlement services, among others. These activities may not necessarily be systemically risky (diversifying business lines could arguably make an individual institution less risky), but they may warrant additional regulatory scrutiny because they are outside the traditional prudential regulatory model for commercial banking and increase the number of markets and activities through which an institution could trigger a systemic event or spread systemic risk. Complexity is measured in method 1 by over the counter (OTC) derivatives, level 3 (i.e., illiquid) assets, and trading and available for sale (AFS) securities. C ross- J urisdiction A ctivity . Measured by cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities, this metric captures the degree to which the bank operates internationally.", "The score is a weighted average of each institution's share of a global aggregate of each of the 12 indicators, expressed in basis points. Any institution with a score of more than 130 is determined to be systemically important to the global financial system. One drawback to using this indicator is that it is intended to measure global systemic importance, whereas the enhanced prudential regime is intended to apply to domestic systemically important banks. For example, cross-jurisdictional metrics may be more pertinent to global importance than domestic importance. Nevertheless, banks with low scores arguably may not be domestically systemically important.", "Examining the U.S. banks with more than $50 billion in assets reveals a wide range of scores, as seen in Table 2 . Eight banks exceed the 130 threshold. The rest are not close to this number, and half have a score of less than 15, including all of the banks with less than $100 billion in assets. Some relatively large banks have low scores. For example, Capital One had $334 billion in assets at the end of 2015, but a score of 20. Conversely, State Street, the smallest bank by asset size to be designated a G-SIB, had assets of $224 billion and a score of 148. Such scoring may suggest that size alone is not well correlated with systemic importance, and may also support assertions that the $50 billion threshold is set too low.", "However, given uncertainty about the relative importance to financial stability of the various indicators that comprise the score, it is useful to observe whether any banks play an outsized role in any individual activity that makes up the score. Table 3 illustrates that some banks with low aggregate scores nevertheless have individual indicators that are at least three times the median value for this group of banks. For example, five banks with aggregate scores under 15 have three times the median value for the underwriting indicator. Similarly, there are low-aggregate-scoring banks with high concentrations in payments, level 3 assets, and cross-jurisdictional indicators. Overall, 18 banks have three times the median value for multiple indicators, and 4 banks have three times the median for one indicator. Two of the four banks that have high values for one indicator have less than $100 billion in total assets. If the G-SIB indicators accurately correlate with systemic riskiness, it is unlikely that the 12 banks with values below three times the median for all of the indicators are systemically important. If a higher multiple of the median value is chosen to identify banks that play outsized roles in the activities shown in Table 3 , fewer banks would qualify. For example, if 10 times the median value were used as a threshold, then 11 banks would meet that threshold in multiple categories, and 3 banks would meet it in one category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Options", "paragraphs": ["Fed officials, former Representative Barney Frank, and critics of the Dodd-Frank Act have called for a higher threshold or for replacing the threshold with an alternative method, but no consensus has emerged over what should take its place.

One type of ratio is a leverage ratio, which compares capital to assets (or another measure of exposures) and does not adjust the values of balance sheet items based on an estimation of this riskiness. H.R. 10 would provide depositories of all types and sizes that maintained a 10% leverage ratio with an \"off ramp,\" under which they would no longer be subject to various banking regulations. The exempted regulations include current capital and liquidity requirements, regulations under which regulators can block capital distributions, and regulations that reference protecting against threats to financial stability. As a result, \"off ramp\" banks with more than $50 billion in assets would no longer be subject to Title I's enhanced regulation and any Basel III provisions, including those applying to only large banks.", "Traditional banks would have to meet a 10% leverage ratio under H.R. 10 . Nontraditional banks would have to meet a 10% supplementary leverage ratio, a higher standard that includes off-balance-sheet exposures. The bill defines traditional banks as those that have no trading assets or liabilities; do not engage in swaps except interest rate or exchange rate swaps; and have a total notional exposure of swaps of less than $8 billion.", "As the financial system has become more complex, postcrisis reforms to mitigate systemic risk, such as enhanced regulation, have made the regulatory regime more complex. Some critics argue that this approach is likely to backfire and simple regulations are more likely to be robust. Off-ramp proponents criticize this \"needless complexity,\" which they see as an example of \"central planning.\" In their view, the complexity generally benefits those largest banks that have the resources to absorb the added regulatory cost, thereby reducing competition. They argue that as long as sufficient capital is in place in case of losses, banks should not be subject to excessive regulatory micromanagement. Others, however, contend that the different components of prudential regulation each play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions and are essential complements to bank capital. In other words, capital can absorb losses, but unlike other forms of prudential regulation, it cannot make losses less likely. The fact that the off ramp explicitly exempts qualifying banks from regulations that reference threats to financial stability underlines that its focus is on an institution's ability to absorb losses (microprudential concerns), not its systemic riskiness (macroprudential concerns).", "Predicting which banks would elect to hold the 10% leverage ratio involves a degree of uncertainty, but CBO did make such an estimate when scoring the bill. One source of uncertainty the CBO had to address is that some banks that hold enough capital to meet the requirement would not necessarily make the election. CBO estimated that half the banks with a leverage ratio (as defined by the bill) currently above 10%\u2014most of which are banks with less than $50 billion in assets\u2014would make the election. For those below currently 10%, CBO estimated a \"small probability\" they would choose to raise enough capital to make the election.

Legislative proposals to raise the threshold in Section 165 could include (as is the case in H.R. 3312 / S. 1893 ) or omit a change in the threshold found in these other sections as well. Some of these sections reference banks covered by Section 165, whereas other sections reference banks with more than $50 billion in assets. In the former case, changing the threshold only in Section 165 would automatically raise the threshold for these other sections, whereas in the latter case, those sections' thresholds would remain unchanged. Another option is to repeal some of these other provisions. For example, H.R. 10 would repeal the Hotel California provision, the powers to mitigate grave threats to financial stability, management interlocks, early remediation requirements, FDIC examination and enforcement authority, and certain assessments.", "In addition, Section 165 includes two requirements that apply to all banks with more than $10 billion in assets\u2014company-run stress tests and risk committee requirements for publicly owned banks.

More generally, Congress could consider whether the current tiered regulatory approach with multiple thresholds or a \"one size fits all\" approach would be more desirable.", "Congress might also consider whether other financial stability provisions that are now determined on a discretionary basis should also be based on the Section 165 size threshold. For example, the other main financial stability title in the Dodd-Frank Act is Title II, which creates the orderly liquidation authority (OLA) to wind down firms that pose a risk to financial stability. The decision about whether to place a failing firm in OLA is not based on institution size, such as the $50 billion threshold. Instead, it is based on a finding by the Treasury Secretary that the firm's failure would have \"serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States,\" following a recommendation by two-thirds of the Fed's Board of Governors and two-thirds of the FDIC's board."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indexing the Threshold?", "paragraphs": ["The $50 billion threshold does not automatically change over time, even though prices, gross domestic product, and financial-sector assets all tend to increase from year to year.

If Congress wished to avoid this outcome, it could index the threshold to some economic indicator. The more quickly the index rose, the more slowly new banks would cross the threshold. Of three metrics noted here, inflation tends to grow most slowly, whereas financial-sector assets grow the most quickly but are the most volatile.

One concern with this approach is that it could be redundant with similar home country regulation for the parent company. This depends on whether the banks' home country regulators have similar regulatory provisions, and whether home country regulators have yet implemented them. The Dodd-Frank Act states that enhanced regulation of foreign banks should \"give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and take into account the extent to which the foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable\" to U.S. standards. On the other hand, a number of these foreign banks are the U.S. operations of foreign G-SIBs, and may merit additional scrutiny by U.S. regulators because of potential systemic risk via a problem at their parent company.", "Alternatively, the intermediate holding company threshold could be expanded to include U.S. branch and U.S. agency assets of foreign banks.
