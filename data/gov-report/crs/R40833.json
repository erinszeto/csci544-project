But with half of electric power in the United States currently generated from coal, electric power generation is responsible for 40% of domestic carbon dioxide emissions (the primary anthropogenic GHG), and over one-third of all U.S.GHG emissions.

Less often, green jobs have been defined to also include employment that results directly from reducing and mitigating pollution and from conserving natural resources (e.g., water). To this direct employment (i.e., direct jobs), indirect and induced employment are sometimes added as well.", "A variety of researchers, usually with the financial support of advocacy groups, have operationalized the diverse definitions of green jobs in order to estimate the number of green jobs at present or at some time in the future. The estimates are based on varying assumptions about, for example, the percentage of U.S. electricity that will be generated by different combinations of renewable resources in the coming decades or the level of public and private sector investments in various renewable energy sources. Less often, the job estimates are based on firm-specific information about the number of persons who are currently employed producing green goods (e.g., solar panels) or providing green services (e.g., energy audits). As a consequence of differences in definitions, assumptions, and methodologies, analysts have produced widely divergent estimates of current and prospective green jobs.", "Complicating the estimation of the number of green jobs is the absence of an authoritative data source. Federal statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), categorize the data they collect according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). In the case of the utility industry, for example, NAICS disaggregates firms into the categories of hydro, fossil fuel, nuclear and \"other\" sources. NAICS does not disaggregate the \"other\" category into those that use renewable sources of electricity production such as wind, solar and biomass. Because renewables are part of the \"other\" category, no government series provides data on their output and employment. Analysts consequently have developed ways to address the data deficiency, although their methods usually are not clearly articulated. For its part, the government agency responsible for labor force statistics, BLS, has requested funding for FY2010 to develop data on the number of green jobs and their characteristics (e.g., wages, training requirements) by industry and occupation. Industry statistics are expected to be available in FY2011.", "In addition, much of the empirical research has estimated only the numbers of green jobs. Estimation or discussion of the net impact on total U.S. employment generally is lacking. Net estimates take into account jobs throughout the economy eliminated or forgone in addition to those created to advance toward a low-carbon environmentally friendly economy. Similarly, the literature does not take into account factors, such as supply constraints (e.g., a tight labor market) and improvements in labor productivity (i.e., output per hour worked), that could affect attainment of estimated levels of green employment.", "A review of several analyses of the number of green jobs associated specifically with the use of renewable energy sources is presented below. The distinctions between definitions, assumptions and methodologies of green job studies are addressed when possible.", "(1) Management Information Services, Inc. (MISI) prepared the report Defining, Estimating, and Forecasting the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Industries in the U.S. and in Colorado for the American Solar Energy Society. ", "The economic research firm developed the following definition of the renewable energy (RE) \"industry\":", "an employee working in one of the major RE technologies included in this report \u2013 wind, photovoltaics, solar thermal, hydroelectric power, geothermal, biomass (ethanol, biodiesel, and biomass power), and fuel cells and hydrogen. In addition, in this study, jobs in RE include persons involved in RE activities in the federal, state, and local governments, universities, trade and professional associations, NGOs, consultants, investment company analysts, etc.", "MISI estimated that there were 217,600 direct jobs in the domestic RE industry in 2007. The great majority (154,100 or 70%) were in the biomass segment, chiefly ethanol and biomass power. MISI further estimated the number of indirect and induced jobs supported by the RE industry to be more than twice the number of direct jobs. Although MISI included induced jobs, it acknowledged that some jobs are less green than others (e.g., \"ancillary jobs created across the street from a factory producing solar collectors shortly after it opens, such as a doughnut shop, fast food restaurant, dry cleaner, etc. whose customers are primarily the workers at the renewable energy factory\"). Based on this broad definition, the report states that there were a total of 503,500 (direct, indirect and induced) jobs in the RE industry in 2007.", "MISI took the analysis further by specifying, in vague terms, three scenarios for the future use of RE and projecting associated job creation. The base case is a \"business as usual\" scenario \"based loosely on the EIA [Energy Information Administration] reference case.\" The base case scenario yields a direct, indirect, and induced job total of 1.3 million in 2030. The moderate scenario, which assumes among other things an increase over the base case in government RE initiatives, produces a total of 2.8 million jobs in 2030. The advanced scenario \"pushes the envelope\" in terms of what might be economically and technologically feasible as a result of greatly heightened government support for RE through 2030. Under the study's most ambitious assumption of RE utilization almost 20 years in the future, 7.3 million direct, indirect and induced jobs might be created.", "The analysis does not estimate the impact of labor market conditions on achieving the job projections. If the unemployment rate is low in 2030, there might not be sufficient numbers of jobless workers to fill the projected RE positions. RE employment would either be less than forecast or the jobs would be filled largely by individuals working elsewhere in the economy. In the latter case, job growth in the RE industry would to some degree come at the expense of employment in other industries. The study also does not estimate the number of jobs that might be forgone or lost due to reduced production of energy from fossil fuel sources.", "(2) The Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory (RAEL) at the University of California-Berkeley prepared Putting Renewable s to Work: How Many Jobs Can the Clean Energy Industry Generate? ", "The researchers developed three scenarios which assume that a 20% Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) would be attained by 2020, and that electricity demand in 2020 would remain unchanged from 2002 (with gains in efficiency offsetting the usual 2%-3% annual increase in demand). The difference between the three scenarios is the proportions of the RPS composed of biomass (wood and waste) electricity, wind energy and photovoltaic (PV) solar.", "Two additional scenarios were developed in which the 20% of electricity produced by renewables in the first three scenarios is instead produced by different mixes of fossil fuels. All five scenarios are shown in Table 1 . RAEL concluded that substituting any one of the three renewable scenarios for either of the fossil fuel scenarios would create more direct and indirect jobs. The results also show that increasing use of renewables could result in a reduction of jobs in the fossil fuel industry. In acknowledgement of this point, the authors note that a study conducted by Tellus Institute and MRG Associates for the World Wide Fund for Nature projected a net loss of 23,900 jobs in coal mining and 61,400 jobs in oil and gas extraction by 2020 due to implementation of various clean energy policies.", "There are several ways in which the RAEL and MISI studies differ. The primary difference is one of definition, which causes the job estimates of the RAEL analysis to be considerably lower than those of the MISI analysis. First, RAEL does not include induced employment which some do not regard as green jobs. Second, it excludes hydropower. And third, RAEL focuses on electricity generation alone. In addition, the timeframes of the two studies differ (i.e., 2020 RAEL vs. 2030 MISI), and no growth in demand is assumed by RAEL.", "(3) Global Insight prepared Current and Potential Green Jobs in the U.S. Economy for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The economic research firm estimated that there were 751,051 green (direct and indirect) jobs in 2006, with the largest number related to renewable power generation (127,246). A green job is defined as: ", "any activity that generates electricity using renewable [including hydroelectric] or nuclear fuels, agriculture jobs supplying corn or soy for transportation fuel, manufacturing jobs producing goods used in renewable power generation, equipment dealers and wholesalers specializing in renewable energy or energy-efficiency products, construction and installation of energy and pollution management systems, government administration of environmental programs, and supporting jobs in the engineering, legal, research and consulting fields.", "Global Insight next forecast the number of green jobs in the categories of renewable electricity generation, residential and commercial retrofitting, and renewable transportation fuels. The second category, retrofitting, is beyond the scope of this report and will not be discussed.", "In terms of power generation, Global Insight relied on its Energy Group's forecast of a 30% increase in net electricity generation between 2008 and 2038. It assumed that 40% of net electricity generation in the United States during the 30-year period will come from five sources, with wind comprising 30%; solar, 20%; geothermal, 10%; biomass, 30%; and incremental hydropower, 10%. The analysis used several factors to calculate direct green energy jobs in manufacturing and construction and in operations and maintenance. The factors come from research conducted by other parties, which is also the case in the RAEL report. Unlike that study, the Global Insight analysis includes more sources of renewable energy and assumes that energy demand increases over time.", "In terms of renewable transportation fuels, Global Insight used a forecast of total fuel production rising to 142,000 million gallons between 2008 and 2038. It assumed that 30% of the total gasoline and diesel consumed by passenger cars and light trucks in 2038 will come from alternative fuels. The analysis used separate factors to calculate direct jobs in manufacturing and construction needed to build additions to the ethanol and biodiesel infrastructure, and in agriculture to grow the feedstock and operate the facilities to turn it into fuel. The factors come from research conducted by the Renewable Fuels Association.", "According to this report, there might be 407,200 (direct and indirect) jobs in renewable electric power generation by 2018; 802,000 by 2028; and 1,236,800 by 2038. In renewable transportation fuels, there might be 1,205,700 (direct and indirect) jobs by 2018; 1,437,700 by 2028; and 1,492,000 by 2038. Global Insight does not provide estimates of potentially slower job growth elsewhere in the economy due to competition for workers in future years or of jobs forgone due to the assumed percent increases in electricity generation and transportation fuels from renewables. Global Insight does caution that:", "It is important to recognize these forecast results depend heavily on our chosen scenarios. Altering any of the assumptions regarding the share of electricity to be generated from alternative resources, the extent of retrofitting, or the share of transportation fuels from renewable sources would obviously change the results.", "(4) In Study of the Effects on Employment of Public Aid to Renewable Energy Sources , Gabriel Calzada of the King Juan Carlos University analyzed the net jobs impact of Spain's policy initiatives to increase its capacity to generate electricity by wind, mini-hydro, and PV solar power.", "The study reportedly was conducted with support from the Institute for Energy Research. It adopted the direct and indirect job creation estimates for Spain's three main renewable sources of electricity that MITRE, a research firm, previously had developed. Specifically, MITRE estimated that Spain's subsidies created 15,000 jobs in wind power, 4,700 jobs in mini-hydro and 14,500 jobs in PV solar between 2000 and 2008, for a total of 50,200 direct and indirect jobs. The researcher then calculated the total public subsidy that created these green jobs to be 28,671 million Euros, or an average government subsidy per worker added of 571,138 Euros.", "In order to know how many net jobs are destroyed by a green job program for each one that it is intended to create, we use two different methods: with the first, we compare the average amount of capital destruction (the subsidized part of the investment) necessary to create a green job against the average amount of capital that a job requires in the private sector; with the second, we compare the average annual productivity that the subsidy to each green job would have contributed to the economy had it not been consumed in such a way, with the average productivity of labor in the private sector that allows workers to remain employed.", "Both methods produced the same outcome, namely, an average of 2.2 jobs were not created elsewhere in Spain's economy for each subsidized job created.", "This study takes a much different approach than other job creation analyses by estimating the number of jobs had Spain's government not subsidized the three renewable sources of electricity generation. In developing its estimate, the author relies on average measures of capital and productivity across the entire private sector of the economy \u2013 but the cost of job creation can differ substantially from economic activity to another. A better comparison might have been with measures of capital and productivity in other electricity-generating industries (e.g., fossil fuel).", "(5) Robert Pollin, James Heintz and Heidi Garrett-Peltier of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts prepared The Economic Benefits of Investing in Clean Energy with support from the Center for American Progress. ", "The study, which provides perhaps the clearest explanation of its assumptions and methodology, estimates the number of jobs per year that might be created as a result of spending and other provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and a version of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 which is being considered by Congress.", "The analysts calculate that the two measures working together might yield $151 billion per year in new \"clean-energy investments\" made by the government and private firms, and generate a net annual increase of about 1.7 million direct, indirect and induced jobs. This net employment gain is composed of a gross increase economy-wide of approximately 2.5 million jobs and a gross loss of 795,000 jobs if the entire $151 billion annual investment in clean energy came at the expense of the fossil fuel industry. About one-fourth ($41 billion) of the total spending is estimated to occur in the following renewable energy areas: on-grid renewable electricity production and transmission to residential, commercial, and industrial customers ($30 billion), off-grid renewable electricity generated by solar panels on buildings ($3 billion); off-grid nonelectric renewable energy production by geothermal pumps ($3 billion); and alternative motor fuels such as cellulosic biofuels ($5 billion). Thus, the researchers estimate that the great majority of clean-energy investments prompted by the two pieces of legislation involve energy efficiency activities, which they defined as building retrofits, mass transit/freight rail, and smart grid.", "The data in Table 2 below underpin the analysts' conclusion that an expenditure on \"clean energy sources\" creates more jobs than an equivalent expenditure on fossil fuel energy sources. Estimates of jobs per $1 million of spending on renewable resources of energy production are shown in the bottom third of the table, and estimates for comparable spending on fossil fuel sources of energy production are shown in the top third. For example, the wind energy industry (as defined by the analysts) would generate 9.5 direct and indirect jobs per $1 million invested, while $1 million invested in the oil and gas energy industry (as defined by the analysts) would generate 3.7 direct and indirect jobs.", "From the perspective of spending that provides the most \"bang for the buck\" \u2013 a major concern when government tries to mitigate the labor market impact of an economy in recession \u2013 the results of this analysis suggest that investment in renewable energy sources is superior to fossil fuel sources in terms of job creation. (Both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and H.R. 2454 , the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, have been characterized by some as \"jobs bills.\") With an unemployment rate of 9.7% in August 2009 and forecasts that the rate will continue to rise through at least year-end and remain elevated for some time to come, the supply of labor is unlikely in the near-term to prevent reaching the analysts' estimate of green job creation. Once the labor market recovers from the recession, however, attainment of the annual job estimate could become increasingly untenable even if $151 billion per year continued to be invested in clean energy (including renewable) sources.", "(6) The Pew Charitable Trusts and Collaborative Economics , a policy research firm, developed The Clean Energy Economy: Repowering Jobs, Businesses and Investments Across America . Unlike the above-described analyses which largely were based on models of the U.S. economy, the authors of this report attempted to identify companies engaged in clean energy activities and the number of clean energy jobs at those individual businesses. Put very succinctly, the researchers used multiple sources of information to develop a database of \"clean energy economy\" firms in selected industry classification codes. Employment statistics for the individual companies in these industry codes came from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database, which is based on Dun & Bradstreet information covering the population of business establishments in the United States. ", "Our analysis is conservative relative to other studies because we count actual clean energy economy businesses and jobs rather than entire occupations (such as all jobs in mass transit, or all electricians). For example, our report counts the workers who manufacture hybrid cars and buses, technicians who construct wind turbines, electricians who install solar panels on homes and engineers who research fuel cell technology, but it does not include all auto manufacturers, electricians, technicians and engineers. In addition, we focus exclusively on producers and suppliers in the clean energy economy. We do not count jobs that use these products and services\u2014for example, jobs within utilities responsible for purchasing energy monitoring equipment or the mass transit operations that buy hybrid buses\u2014because data limitations prevented the disaggregation of specific jobs within these types of companies.", "The researchers define the clean energy economy as (1) clean energy, (2) energy efficiency, (3) environmentally friendly production, (4) conservation and pollution mitigation, and (5) training and support. The five categories are further divided into 16 segments. In the case of clean energy, the segments are energy generation (e.g., wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydro, marine and tidal, hydrogen), energy transmission (e.g., power monitoring and metering services, smart grid), and energy storage (e.g., advanced batteries, fuel cells). Nuclear power is excluded \"because of significant, ongoing questions about how and where to safely store its waste.\"", "In 2007, according to the Pew analysis, there were 770,385 jobs in the clean energy economy. The clean energy category of renewable sources of energy generation, transmission and storage accounted for 89,000 jobs or 11.6% of the total. About two-thirds of the jobs (501,551) were in the conservation and pollution mitigation category. Each of the remaining categories accounted for fewer jobs than clean energy: 73,000, energy efficiency (e.g., geothermal heating and cooling, smart lighting); 53,700, environmentally friendly production (e.g., biofuel, coal gasification, ethanol, hybrid vehicles, biodegradable products; and aquaculture); and 50,000, training and support (e.g., research in renewable sources of energy generation and in alternative fuels, emissions trading and offsets, and project financing). Some of the jobs in these three categories likely were included by other analysts in their renewable energy estimates. For example, the MISI analysis appears to define the RE industry to encompass related research and investment activities. The Pew report, in contrast, classifies such activities in its \"training and support\" rather than \"clean energy\" category.", "In summary, the preceding studies of green job creation in the renewable energy industry vary greatly in a few key respects.

But energy efficiency may see as much or more achieved from new construction standards than may be achieved from retrofits to today's existing buildings and housing.", "Most of the future growth in green jobs is generally envisioned as coming from the growth in deployment of renewable energy technologies. A common misperception in the studies of green jobs seems to be that all renewable energy technologies have generally the same qualities, with regard to job creation potential. Little effort is made to differentiate between them. ", "However, renewable energy technologies are designed to harness renewable energy resources with very different physical characteristics, such as the wind and the sun. Different technologies have seen different levels of investment over the years based upon various evaluations of potential and economic readiness to serve current markets or applications. The timeframe under consideration is important in any discussion of the potential for renewable energy technologies to create jobs, for the technologies are at different stages in their development cycles and have attributes suited to different applications. Consequently, the costs of generating electricity varies with each renewable energy technology, and the potential for deployment often depends upon local incentives and the quality of the renewable resource. As such, renewable energy deployment programs from state governments have had a great influence on the current deployment levels of renewable energy technologies and resultant jobs.", "Historically, the federal investment in renewable energy technologies in the United States has not been about creating jobs, but instead simply focused on developing the technologies to a point where they are considered ready for commercialization. Even though renewable energy projects are currently being deployed, further development of the technologies is needed if these technologies are to meet the perceived future needs of the marketplace. Some of today's renewable energy technologies may in fact turn out to be \"transitional\" as advances in technology have and could further lead to new research directions. Innovation could be stimulated from within the industry or induced by developments ancillary to the industry, such as the development of the Smart Grid or schemes to encourage Demand Response. Further research, development, and deployment is likely necessary to develop a more robust renewable energy industry and potential spillover benefits to the economy at large from the R&D spending. ", "Enabling mechanisms for renewable energy technologies, such as those discussed to help with deployment (i.e., the feed-in tariff in Europe), were designed not so much to create jobs as they were to encourage the use of the new technologies. The U.S. government is now discussing how to invest in renewable energy technologies as a growth engine for future jobs. The investment may not result in large direct jobs creation in the short-term, but prepares for potential growth in the near future especially as climate change considerations may shift paradigms regarding electricity generation choices. This transition would likely require further domestic policies to develop the supporting infrastructure and supply chains to enable the success of new clean energy industries. Additionally, a transition to low carbon energy technologies may result in jobs being lost in other parts of the economy, but this may be considered part of the opportunity cost of making the decision. ", "Many of the studies concerning green jobs and renewable energy technologies provide estimates of employment reflecting the state of technology at a specific point in time. It is important to recognize that as a specific renewable energy technology becomes more efficient, the number of jobs per Megawatt (MW) of output is likely to decrease. The increase in efficiency may also be reflective of an increase in productivity of manufacturing processes. This has particular relevance if most jobs in renewable energy are likely to be in manufacturing and construction, as opposed to fossil energy in which most jobs relate to fuel processing and operations and maintenance activities.

This scenario expects a global economic recovery to begin in 2010, spurring demand for oil and corresponding increases in oil prices to $110 per barrel (2007 dollars) by 2015, increasing to $130 per barrel in 2030.

EIA also has a scenario called No GHG Concern case which removes cost-of-capital adjustments for GHG-intensive technologies from the Reference Case. The AEO 2009 Reference Case shows all renewable energy sources accounting for approximately 8.5% of electricity generation in the base year of 2007. Projecting forward to 2030, the Reference Case sees renewable electricity growing to 14% of total generation. Using the LW110 case, the analysis projects renewable energy sources accounting for 22% of all electricity generated.", "EIA also has analyzed two additional scenarios specifically for changes in the cost of renewable energy technologies. In the case of High Renewable Energy Cost, capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, and performance levels for wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal resources are assumed to remain at 2009 levels through to 2030. In this case, it is assumed that dedicated energy crops do not become available. In its Low Renewable Energy Cost scenario, EIA assumes that levelized costs of generating renewable energy will decline 25% below AEO 2009 Reference Case costs by 2030. Generally, this is realized through lower capital costs to construct the plants, and in the case of biomass, fuel supplies are assumed to be 25% less expensive compared to the Reference Case costs. Under the Low Renewable Energy Cost scenario analysis of AEO 2009, renewable electricity sources could account for as much as 22% of power generation for the (non-nuclear) electric power and end-use sectors by 2030.

Agricultural wastes (such as corn stover) are another potential feedstock. With wood and biomass net summer capacity reported at 7 Gigawatts (GW) for 2007, DOE estimates that 41 GW of domestic biomass generation could be available by 2030. Sustainable management of biomass resources, especially forests, will be critical to this future.", "Biomass combustion is a relatively mature technology but it is not widely used and is generally not very efficient unless it is used in a combined heat and power application. As of 2003, there were approximately 66,000 direct jobs in the biomass power segment. Large scale co-firing of biomass with coal is a higher efficiency, lower per unit cost application. Technologies for biomass gasification could result in higher efficiencies when used to produce synthesis gas or hydrogen for heat and/or power production. Demonstration and deployment of newer industrial gasification technologies is needed to scale-up plants and provide economical designs with high degrees of availability. Huge potential exists for the biomass category, as it is generally regarded as a carbon-neutral source of energy. Wood-burning stoves and solar water heaters are the most common applications of residential renewable energy. But improvements are needed to increase fuel efficiency and lower toxic air pollutants for wood stoves.", "Liquid biofuels can readily be made from biomass using fermentation processes. Ethanol, the most widely produced biofuel today, is commonly blended with gasoline as a transportation fuel thus reducing GHG and particulate emissions. Other biofuels with transportation potential are methanol and butanol, both of which can be made from renewable sources such as wood wastes, agricultural or municipal solid wastes.

Wind turbine sizes are increasing in generating capacity, with domestic turbines in 2007 averaging 1.6 MW in size. When the wind is blowing at speeds which can be harnessed, electricity can be generated at prices nearly competitive with conventional fossil energy based generation. Most of today's wind turbines use a three-bladed windmill rotor design to generate electricity from the wind, but new turbine designs are being developed to generate power at lower wind speeds. Since the wind doesn't blow all the time and varies in strength, integration of large amounts of wind into an electricity grid has often been raised as an issue. Backup generation in the form of natural gas combustion turbines has been the standby choice in some instances. Energy storage (using batteries or other means) is often suggested as a potential answer to deal with intermittency and load variability concerns. Since many of the best wind resource areas in the United States are far from population centers where the electricity generated will be used, the development of transmission facilities to carry power to population centers will likely be needed for wider development. Given these factors, DOE estimates domestic capacity from wind could reach 61 GW by 2030. Additionally, DOE projects as much as 20% of the nation's electrical supply could be provided by wind energy by 2030. This would require wind power capacity to reach 300 GW, or a growth of over 280 GW over the next 21 years.
