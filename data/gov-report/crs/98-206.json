It postpones for one year the revisionof hardrock mining regulations (43 CFR 3809), pending a study by the NationalAcademy of Sciences (Section 120). The law reauthorizes through FY2001 theannual hardrock claim maintenance fee at $100 per claim or site, and provides for a60-day period to correct any defects to small miner waiver applications(administrative provisions to the BLM section). General provisions also affect otherissues. For instance, one provision directs the BLM to reauthorize grazing permitsprior to completion of reviews under applicable laws, such as the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (Section 124). ", "A number of provisions of the omnibus law cut across agency jurisdictions. One such provision prohibits the Interior Secretary from purchasing land in Alaskawithout first attempting to acquire such lands through exchange of unreserved publicland (Section 127). Because it addresses land purchases by the Secretary of theInterior, the provision could affect the National Park Service (NPS) and the Fish andWildlife Service (FWS), in addition to BLM, although it is likely that the landsinvolved in the exchange would be BLM lands.

Congress accepted this language and cap. The language limits thediscretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings, e.g., if lawsuitsmandate agency action on listing certain species. It exempts steps to de-list ordown-list a species from the cap. Without a cap, funding would either have to betransferred away from ongoing listing activities to meet the additional requirementsof a lawsuit, or from other programs within the agency's Resources Managementfunction. With the cap, a court order to carry forward a listing decision on particularspecies makes listing into a zero sum game, at least at a fiscal level: the listing ofsome species or designation of their critical habitats would preclude the listing ofothers. FWS supported this change to protect the budgets of other programs. In arelated subject, the Administration proposed transferring de-listing and down-listingactivities from the Listing function to the Recovery function. The step did notrequire congressional action, but combined with the above limitation, only newlistings or new designations of critical habitat will be affected by the limitation on thefunds.", "The Administration proposed $10.0 million (-7.2%) for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, which provides payments to local governments in recognition ofreduction of the local tax base due to the presence of federal land. Congressappropriated $10.779 million, the FY1998 level. The payment levels have beencontroversial, since the small additions of land to the National Wildlife RefugeSystem over the last several years mean that reduced dollars must be spread stillfurther. The situation has produced calls for Congress to increase the appropriation,especially since local governments often (incorrectly) view the payments asentitlements, even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations.

The National Park Service (NPS) currently manages the 376 units that comprise theNational Park System, including 56 \"full or actual\" National Parks, the premier unitsof the System. In addition to the National Parks, the diverse Park System includesnational preserves, recreation areas, reserves, monuments, battlefields, seashores anda number of other categories. The System has grown to more than 80 million acres,in 49 states and the District of Columbia. In recent years over 270 million visitorshave visited the parks annually. The NPS has the often contradictory mission offacilitating access and serving Park System visitors while protecting and preservingthe natural and cultural resources entrusted to it.", "For nearly two decades the Park Service has operated with tight budgets. During this period, Congress restricted appropriations to operate and maintain thePark System while continuing to add new units to the System. Combined withincreased visitation, the essentially static funding had stretched personnel, impairedoperations, and generated a multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance. However, spending for the NPS now appears to have a higher priority. Temporaryclosure of NPS units (part of a federal government-wide shutdown during the budgetdebates of late 1995 and early 1996) helped galvanize public support for increasingNPS operations and maintenance funding in FY1997, FY1998, and FY1999.", "The Administration's Operations budget request for the NPS for FY1999 totals $1.321 billion. The House recommended $1.333 billion and the Senaterecommended $1.288 billion. The conference agreement provides $1.286 billion foroperation of the National Park System.", "Deferred Maintenance. The Park System has a formidable maintenance burden, with thousands of permanentstructures, roads, bridges, tunnels, employee housing units, water and waste systems, etc . The NPS has valued these assets at over $35 billion, but they would deterioratewithout adequate care and maintenance. In FY1999, the Administration proposedattacking the deferred maintenance backlog with a $62 million increase in NPSmaintenance from FY1998, with a total request for $446 million. The HouseCommittee recommended a slightly larger increase ($64 million) and the SenateCommittee recommended a smaller increase, but still $18 million (5%) above theFY1998 level. The conference agreement provides $412 million for maintenance.", "Mounting concerns about the build-up of unmet maintenance needs has prompted Congress to seek new funding sources. Congress and the Administrationhave generally agreed to address problems and adequately fund the operation of thepark system and to aggressively attack the maintenance backlog. In the FY1999budget request, the Administration had a proposal that would add more than $25million annually for NPS management purposes from Park concessioners franchisefees. (A number of large concession contracts are due for renewal and the trend hasbeen for substantial increases.) The proposal is to keep the concession fees for thePark System, rather than having them returned to the General Fund of the Treasury(as is current practice).", "Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. The Administration's proposal for maintenanceparallels the recreation fee demonstration program being tested by the NPS and threeother federal land management agencies. The recreation fee program began inFY1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees, with the added fees beingretained by the unit where the money is collected. It was hoped that the additionalfees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive in pursuing\"self-financing\" for operating and maintaining their units. The NPS is expecting tocollect $136.5 million under this program in FY1999. The Omnibus Appropriationsbill extended the fee demonstration program for 2 additional years.", "Urban Park and Recreation Fund. The House had approved an amendment to the bill to fund the Urban Park and RecreationRecovery (UPRR) program at $2 million (the Administration's request). Althoughthe program was last funded in FY1994, previous appropriations were about $5million annually, with communities competing for many more grants than there wasmoney available for. The highly popular matching grant program had helped localgovernments rehabilitate playgrounds, recreation centers, ball courts, and playingfields in urban areas.

Critics of the agency, pointing toreported discrepancies between posted prices and fair market value prices that are thebasis for royalty valuation, argue that the U.S. Treasury is being underpaid. MMShas proposed a rule change for crude oil valuation that would rely less on postedprices and more on an index price to better reflect fair market value. Oil industryofficials have criticized using index prices as a benchmark and have offered a numberof other options for benchmarks. The MMS extended its comment period on thevaluation rule twice in July (7/9 - 7/24 and 7/24 - 7/31) to allow for additionalindustry and congressional input. Industry representatives believe that the extensionwas necessary to make further improvements to the proposal while critics of theextension argue that enough has been said on the proposed rulemaking and that noextension is necessary.

The extension was continued through FY1998. In previousappropriations since the early 1980s, the moratoria had been approved annually,without extensive discussion. Each year, Congress banned the expenditure ofappropriated funds for any leasing activity in environmentally sensitive areas of theOCS. In 1990, President Bush issued a directive which parallels the moratoria,essentially banning OCS leasing activity in places other than the Texas, Louisiana,and Alabama offshore. The executive branch ban remains in effect. The moratoriaapply only to environmentally sensitive areas.

In the BIA this policy has taken three forms: tribal contracting to run individual BIA programs under the Indian Self-Determination Act( P.L. 93-638 , as amended); tribal compacting with the BIA to manage all or most ofa tribe's BIA programs, under the Self-Governance program ( P.L. 103-413 ); andshifting programs into a portion of the BIA budget called Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA), in which tribes have more influence in BIA budget planning and within whicheach tribe has authority to reprogram all its TPA funds. In FY1998 TPA accounts for49.5% of the BIA's operation of Indian programs (including most of the BIA fundingfor tribal governments' operations, human services, courts and law enforcement,natural resources, and community development) and for 44.5% of total BIA directappropriations.", "The issue of the equitable distribution of BIA funding--often referred to as \"means-testing\"--has two aspects, one relating to how funds are distributed, theother relating to whether a tribe's other financial resources are taken into account. First, much if not most BIA funding, even while serving tribal needs, is not requiredto be distributed on a national per capita or other formula basis. Second, tribes' ownnon-BIA resources, especially business revenues, are not always required to be takeninto account. Both the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House InteriorAppropriations Committee take note of the issues. For both the FY1998 and FY1999Interior appropriations bills, the Senate Appropriations Committee has proposed (1)requiring the BIA to develop several alternate formulas for distributing TPA fundson the basis of need, taking into account tribal business revenues including gaming,and (2) requiring tribes to submit tribal business revenue information to BIA, and inthe FY1999 bill proposed implementing the new distribution formula in FY2000. Inaddition the Senate committee's FY1999 bill proposed reallocating half of TPAfunds from tribes (outside Alaska) in the top 10% of per-capita tribal businessrevenues to tribes in the bottom 20% of per-capita tribal business revenues. TheHouse Committee provided $250,000 in FY1999 to continue the FY1998TPA-allocation work group (see below) to develop needs-measurement methods,directed the BIA to develop TPA allocation criteria that address equity in TPAfunding, and included an administrative provision assuring tribes who return fundsto the BIA that the federal trust responsibility to them, and the federalgovernment-to-government relationship with the tribes, will not be diminished.", "Supporters of the Senate committee's proposals claim that BIA funding is inequitably distributed, that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding, that tribalTPA funds received per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need, thatonly 30 percent of TPA funding is based on formulas, and that a GAO study showssome rich tribes got more TPA funds in FY1998 than tribes with no outside revenues. Opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty, that BIA funding isinsufficient to meet tribal needs, and that means-testing TPA funding would penalizetribes who still have severe needs, would violate the federal trust responsibility totribes, has not been fully analyzed, and would be unfair since it is not required ofstate or local governments receiving federal assistance.", "In considering similar proposals in the FY1998 appropriations bill, Congress had dropped the requirements for a formula and tribal income data, and instead haddistributed some FY1998 TPA funds so that each tribe might receive the minimumfunding recommended by the 1994 report of the Joint Tribal/BIA/DOI Task Force onBIA Reorganization ($160,000 per tribe, except $200,000 per tribe in Alaska), withallocation of any remaining TPA funds based on recommendation of a tribal/federaltask force. In addition, several Senators had requested the GAO to report on TPAdistribution issues. The tribal/federal TPA task force made its distributionrecommendations January 29, 1998, and also recommended creating a long-termwork group on TPA funding allocation, a recommendation the BIA supported. TheGAO presented its TPA distribution study in April and July, 1998. Among the GAOfindings were that two-thirds of FY1998 TPA funds were distributed based onhistorical levels and one-third was distributed based on formulas, that TPAdistribution per capita varied widely across BIA areas, and that tribal governments'reporting of revenues were inconsistent in including or excluding non-federalrevenues. The GAO results were used by the Senate Appropriations Committee indeveloping the FY1999 proposals described above.", "Congress, in the Interior appropriations portion of the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act, dropped the Senate Appropriations Committee's proposedreallocation scheme and dropped the requirement that tribes submit revenue data, butretained the requirement that the BIA develop proposals for alternative TPA fundingmethods. Congress also retained the House provision of $250,000 for the TPA workgroup and the language concerning tribes returning funds to the BIA.", "During congressional debates over FY1997 and FY1998 Interior appropriations, Congress considered but did not approve several additional controversial provisions. One proposal, considered in the House, would have prohibited the Interior Secretaryfrom using his general authority to take land into trust for a tribe unless the tribe hadagreed with state and local governments on the collection of state and local retailsales taxes from non-members of the tribe. (This proposal has also been put forwardin the 105th Congress in H.R. 1168 , on which hearings were held June24, 1998.) The other provision, proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee,would have waived tribal governments' sovereign immunity to civil suit in federalcourt if a tribe accepted TPA funding. The tribal immunity waiver provision waswithdrawn on the Senate floor. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held severalhearings this year on a bill ( S. 1691 , introduced February 27, 1998)restricting tribal sovereign immunity. One of the issues raised at the hearings was thedegree to which tribes are insured against torts and other liability claims. At theCommittee's mark-up of S. 1691 , consideration was postponed on themotion of the bill's sponsor, who later introduced five new, more specific bills. Neither of these proposals was offered during consideration of FY1999 Interiorappropriations. In the Interior portion of the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act,however, Congress required the Interior Secretary to study tribal liability insurancecoverage and make a report with legislative recommendations.", "In considering the FY1999 bill, both the Senate Appropriations Committees and the House took note of several further issues. Congress addressed most of theseissues in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act. Both the House and the Senatecommittee supported placing BIA-funded law enforcement under centralized lineauthority and both made BIA law-enforcement funds unavailable for reprogramming;Congress approved these proposals. Concerning support costs for self-determinationcontracts and self-governance compacts, both forbade use of FY1999 funds to payfor unpaid contract support costs from earlier years, in spite of court decisionsconfirming federal responsibility for such costs; Congress again approved. TheHouse recommended a one-year moratorium on self-determination contracts andself-governance compacts, so that BIA and tribes can address the contract supportcosts problem. The Senate committee directed the GAO to conduct a study of theissue. Congress approved both ideas. Both the House and the Senate committee alsonoted environmental penalties against BIA for violations regarding undergroundstorage tanks and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and theHouse provided funds for environmental cleanup; Congress approved $3 million forthis purpose. Only the Senate committee included bill language restricting the\"Huron Cemetery\" in Kansas to use as a cemetery (an Oklahoma tribe has at timesproposed using it for gaming); Congress retained this provision. The Senatecommittee also prohibited taking lands into trust in Scott County in Minnesota, nearMinneapolis-St. Paul, but Congress dropped the provision because the BIA assertedit would make no decision on such lands in FY1999. The Senate committee alsodirected the Interior Secretary to develop a five-year plan for the repair orreconstruction of all BIA school facilities, and to review Indian post-secondaryinstitutions' current facility needs; Congress did not address this issue. The Senateduring debate on the FY1999 Interior appropriations bill approved an amendmentprohibiting the Interior Secretary from approving class III Indian gaming compactswithout state approval and from promulgating during FY1999 proposed regulationsfor approving gaming compacts in situations where a state invokes its immunity fromsuit over compact negotiations. Congress chose only to prohibit promulgation of theregulations, and that only for the first half of FY1999.

Indian trust funds comprise two sets of funds: (1)tribal funds owned by 338 tribes in approximately 1,500 accounts, with a total assetvalue of about $2.5 billion; and (2) individual Indians' funds, known as IndividualIndian Money (IIM) accounts, in 345,356 accounts with a total asset value of $463.7million. (Figures are from the OST FY1999 budget justifications.) The fundsinclude monies received both from claims awards, land or water rights settlements,and other one-time payments, and from income from physical trust assets (e.g., land,timber, minerals), as well as investment income. In 1996, at Congress' direction,trust fund management was transferred from the BIA to the OST. The SpecialTrustee in 1996 estimated the eventual cost of recommended improvements intrust-fund management at $100 million.", "While a congressionally-required outside audit has been made of non-investment transactions--deposits and withdrawals--in tribal trust fundaccounts (for the 20-year period 1973-1992), Congress did not require that theoutside auditors examine transactions in the IIM accounts, so their reconciliationstatus has been in doubt. On June 11, 1996, a class-action suit was filed against thefederal government on behalf of all IIM account owners. The suit sought anaccounting of the IIM funds, establishment of adequate management systems, andfull restitution of any money lost from the IIM accounts. The case was certified asa class action in February 1997, and is scheduled to go to trial on March 15, 1999.", "In April 1997 the OST submitted its Strategic Plan for improving the management of Indian trust funds and trust assets. The plan recommended creationof a new federally chartered agency, to which trust funds and assets would betransferred, and management and investment of the funds and assets to assist Indianeconomic growth. While considering FY1998 Interior appropriations, Congressnoted departmental and some tribal opposition to the Strategic Plan, especially to theproposed new agency. Congress directed the OST not to implement the proposednew agency but to pursue trust funds systems improvements and OST responsibilitiesrelating to the settlement of financial claims made by tribal and individualbeneficiaries, before Congress and in court, because of BIA trust-fundsmismanagement.

Like the FY1997 and FY1998 Interior appropriations acts, theFY1999 Interior appropriations bill proposed by the President, and the bills reportedby the Senate Appropriations Committee or approved by the full House, as well asthe version enacted into law in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act, all containeda proviso forbidding ONHIR from evicting any Navajo family from Hopi partitionedlands unless a replacement home is provided. This language appears to preventONHIR from forcibly relocating Navajo families, since ONHIR has a large backlogof other families that need homes. The settlement agreement approved by P.L.104-301 , however, allows the Hopi Tribe under certain circumstances to beginquiet-possession actions against the United States in the year 2000 if Navajo familieson Hopi partitioned land have not entered into leases with the Hopi Tribe.", "Congress has for a long time been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees' apparent low level of interest in moving to the \"new lands\" acquiredfor the Navajo reservation for relocatee use. Appropriations committee reports in1995, 1996, and 1997 called on ONHIR to explore termination of the relocationprogram, and the Senate in the 104th Congress considered a bill phasing out ONHIR. The House FY1998 Appropriations Committee report directed ONHIR to stop furtherdevelopment work on the new lands beyond that required to meet relocatee demand.", "For FY1998, ONHIR received appropriations of $15 million. For FY1999 the Administration proposed the same amount. The Senate Appropriations Committeeagreed with the Administration figure, while the House of Representatives approved$13 million, a 13% reduction from FY1998. In the Interior appropriations portionof the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act, Congress approved $13 million for theONHIR.", "Other Related Agencies. One of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delineated below is whetherfederal government support for the arts and culture is an appropriate federal role, andif it is, what should be the shape of that support. If the continued federal role is notappropriate, might the federal commitment be scaled back such that greater privatesupport or state support would be encouraged? Each program has its own uniquerelationship to this overarching issue.", "Smithsonian. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum, education and research complex of 16 museums andgalleries and the National Zoo. Nine of its museums and galleries are located on theMall between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington monument, and counted over 30million visitors in FY1997. The Smithsonian is estimated to be 70+ percent federallyfunded. A federal commitment was established by initial legislation in 1846. Inaddition to receiving federal appropriations, the Smithsonian has private trust funds,which include endowments, donations, and other revenues from its sales stores andmagazine.", "The FY1999 Clinton Administration budget would have provided $419.8 million to the Smithsonian, and $357.3 million of that amount would be for salariesand expenses. Of the total for the Smithsonian, $16 million (and a request for anadvance appropriation of $19 million for FY 2000) would be provided to completeconstruction of the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) on the Mall.The NMAI was controversial; opponents of the new museum argued that the currentSmithsonian museums need renovation and repair, and maintenance of the collectionwith over 140 million items, more than the public needs another museum on theMall. Proponents felt that there had been too long a delay in providing a museum \"inWashington\" to house the Indian collection. Private donations to the Smithsonianand a fund-raising campaign totaled $37 million, required to meet thenon-appropriated portion of project funding. Of this amount, $15 million came fromthe Indian community directly. However, the total cost of the American Indian museum was estimated at $110 million; Congress asked that there be an attempt to\"scale down\" the plans and cost. The final FY1998 Interior appropriations provided$29 million for the construction of the American Indian Museum. ", "The FY1999 budget would have included $40 million for repair and renovationof the Smithsonian. Four of the Smithsonian's buildings account for approximately30% of the SI's public space: the National Museum of Natural History (built in1910), the American Art and Portrait Gallery (built between 1836 and 1860), theCastle building (built 1846), and the Arts and Industries building (1849). The costto renew these four buildings is approximately $200 million. The Smithsoniancontends that funding for repair and renewal of SI's facilities has not kept pace withneed, resulting in accelerated deterioration of the physical plant. ", "The Smithsonian has indicated that it has completed a 5 year strategic plan andan associated performance plan for FY1999 under the Government Performance andResults Act of 1993 and in keeping with the Smithsonian's mission. On anothermatter, the final report of the Latino Oversight committee, Toward a Shared Vision:U.S. Latinos and the Smithsonian Institution , was released in October 1997. Itindicates that although there is a significant change in commitment at the top (SImanagement) toward including Latinos in all aspects of the Smithsonian, some of theimplementation of the plan has lagged. Latinos accounted for only 2% of seniorSmithsonian personnel and 4% as members of Smithsonian boards andcommissions. Those critical of the Smithsonian urge that Latino representation beaddressed in this budget cycle.", "The Smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in FY1997 and generated public programs associated with it including \"America's Smithsonian,\" a traveling exhibit.The Smithsonian indicated that the traveling exhibit (free to the public) was toocostly, and to offset the cost, SI might institute admission charges for special exhibitsin the Smithsonian buildings on the Mall. In view of the trend toward diminishedfederal support, the Smithsonian has also begun to use bond issues for someconstruction projects including the renovation of the National Museum of NaturalHistory and the Dulles National Air and Space Museum extension.", "On June 18, 1998, the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the FY1999 Interior appropriations bill, allowing $397.5 million for the Smithsonian.On June 25, the House Appropriations Committee concurred with the earlier estimatethat would provide $397.449 million, (allowing $346.449 million for salaries andexpenses). Also, on June 25, the Senate Appropriations Committee ordered reportedthe Interior bill providing $404.554 million for the Smithsonian (allowing $352.154million for salaries and expenses, and providing $16 million for construction of theNational Museum of the American Indian.) The full House approved itsAppropriations Committee's recommendation. The FY1999 Omnibus AppropriationsAct provides $347.154 million for salaries and expenses of the Smithsonian; with$16 million for construction, primarily for the National Museum of the AmericanIndian; and $40 million for repair and restoration of Smithsonian buildings.", "For further information on the Smithsonian , see its World Wide Web site at http://www.si.edu/ ", "National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Museum Services. One ofthe primary vehicles for federal support for arts, humanities and museums is theNational Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, composed of the NationalEndowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH),and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS, now a newly constituted Institute ofMuseum and Library Services (IMLS) with an Office of Museum Services (OMS)). The authorizing act, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, hasexpired but has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law.The last reauthorization for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanitiesoccurred in 1990 and expired in FY1993. Authority has been carried throughappropriations language since that time. The 104th Congress established the Instituteof Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under P.L. 104-208 .", "Among the questions Congress is considering is whether funding for the arts, humanities, and museums is an appropriate federal role and responsibility. Thecurrent climate of budget constraints raises questions about the need for such support.Some argue that NEA and NEH should be abolished altogether, contending that thefederal government should not be in the business of supporting arts and humanities. They also argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support.Proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federalgovernment has a long tradition of such support, beginning with congressionalappropriation of funds for works of art to adorn the U.S. Capitol in 1817. Spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap thatwould be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts. Some argue that abolishing orany significant reduction to NEA, NEH and IMLS will curtail or eliminate theprograms that have national purposes (such as touring theater and dance companies,radio and television shows, etc.)", "The Administration's FY1999 budget would provide $136 million for NEA and NEH and $26 million for OMS within the Institute of Museum and Library Services. For the NEA this would include a $15 million increase in state Partnership funds toallow NEA to work with state arts agencies by investing in arts education activities.For the NEH, $5 million in start-up funds would support regional humanities centersas part of a new special initiative Rediscovering America: the Humanities and theMillennium . For the IMLS, OMS would receive $17 million for General Operatingsupport to help museums improve the quality of their services to the public--they arealready popular, serving over 600 million visitors annually.", "In the 105th Congress, elimination of the NEA was once again on a list of priorities for some House members. Among the House Republican leadership, asmall group was formed called the \"values action team,\" to coordinate legislativeaction with conservative groups (e.g., Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family andthe Family Research Council). In contrast, the Congressional Member Organizationfor the Arts (CMO) testified in favor of full support for the arts at the FY1999Administration budget request level. The President's Committee on the Arts releaseda publication, Creative America that recommends that federal funding be restored forNEA, NEH and IMLS to levels \"adequate to fulfill their national roles.\" The goalexpressed was for appropriations to equal $2.00 per person by the year 2000 for allthree agencies.", "The controversy involving charges of obscenity concerning a small number of NEA individual grants remains an issue despite attempts to resolve these problemsthrough statutory provisions. To date, no NEA projects have been judged obscene bythe courts. In addition, a federal appeals court (Nov. 5, 1996) upheld an earlierdecision, ruling that applying the \"general standards of decency\" clause to NEAgrants was \"unconstitutional.\" Prior to the federal appeals court decision, Congresseliminated funding for most grants to individual artists; and in anticipation of theCongress's action, NEA had already eliminated grants to individuals by artsdiscipline except to maintain Literature fellowships, Jazz masters and NationalHeritage fellowships in the Folk and Traditional Arts. On June 25, 1998, theSupreme Court reversed the federal appeals court decision for NEA v.Finley by avote of 8 to 1, stating that the NEA can consider \"general standards of decency\"when judging grants for artistic merit, and that the decency provision does not\"inherently interfere with First amendment rights nor violate constitutional vaguenessprinciples.\"", "On November 14, 1997, the FY1998 Interior Appropriations bill was enacted as P.L. 105-83 . In spite of attempts by the House to eliminate funding for NEA, theCongress approved $98 million for NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and $23.280million for the OMS, IMLS, with reform language included for NEA. The NEAreform measures included an increase in the percentage of funding to states for basicstate arts grants and for grants to underserved populations from 35% to 40%. Inaddition, language emphasizing arts education was included. There would be a 15%cap on funds allocated to each state, exempting only those grants with a nationalimpact. It was recommended that three members of the House and three membersof the Senate serve on the National Council on the Arts, and that the size of theNational Council be reduced to 20 from 26. Both NEA and NEH were given specificauthority to solicit funding and to invest those funds.", "On June 18, 1998, the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the FY1999 Interior Appropriations bill, allowing $23 million for the IMLS-OMS,$110 million for NEH, and recommending \"termination of $98 million for theNational Endowment for the Arts.\" On June 25, the House AppropriationsCommittee restored $98 million for NEA (an amendment to restore funding wasadopted by a vote of 31-27) under the FY1999 Interior appropriations bill. Also, onJune 25, the Senate Appropriations Committee ordered reported the FY1999 Interiorappropriations, providing $100.060 million for NEA, and $110.7 million for NEH,and $23.280 million for the OMS, IMLS. ", "On July 21, 1998, during consideration of the FY1999 Interior Appropriations bill, the House voted (253-173) to approve an amendment to restore $98 million forthe NEA in FY1999. Prior to this vote the House, on a point of order, had removed$98 million for NEA, stating that there was no program authorization. On July 23, the full House approved H.R. 4193 , which included the above notedHouse figures. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $98 million forthe NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and $23.405 million for the OMS.", "( Notes on reauthorization: The authorization has expired for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. The 104th Congress considered butdid not enact legislation to reauthorize the National Foundation on the Arts and theHumanities. However, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) wasauthorized through the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, mergingthe previous Institute of Museum Services with library resources programs. On July23, 1997, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee ordered reported S. 1020 , a bill to reauthorize for 5 years the National Foundation on theArts and the Humanities Act of 1965.
