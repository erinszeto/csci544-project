It also authorizes certain activities and functions. The HEA was first enacted in 1965. It has since been amended and extended numerous times, and it has been comprehensively reauthorized eight times. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 under the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA; P.L. 110-315), which authorized most HEA programs through FY2014. Many of the programs with HEA authorizations set to expire at the end of FY2014 were automatically extended through FY2015 under Section 422 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Additionally, many HEA programs due to expire at the end of FY2015 were extended through FY2016 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113).", "This report identifies provisions under the HEA that were, with GEPA extensions, set to expire at the end of FY2015. It also discusses authorization and appropriations options for extending the statutory authorities that are scheduled to lapse. These options include an explicit extension of, or an appropriation of funds for, these programs either through a regular appropriations measure or a continuing resolution. Finally, for all HEA mandatory and discretionary programs and activities, the report provides information on the authorization of appropriations or mandatory budget authority, the duration for which such authority is provided, the applicability of extensions under GEPA, and FY2016 appropriations and mandatory budget authority."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Higher Education Act Authorization", "paragraphs": ["The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA; P.L. 89-329), authorizes the operation of numerous federal aid programs that provide support both to individuals pursuing a postsecondary education and to institutions of higher education (IHEs).

However, under generally applicable provisions in the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), the authorization periods for most HEA programs were effectively extended through the end of FY2015. From September 30, 2015, through December 18, 2015, Congress provided additional appropriations for many of these programs with three consecutive continuing resolutions. On December 18, 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 was enacted ( P.L. 114-113 ), under which Congress provided additional appropriations for many of the HEA programs through FY2016, such that they will continue operation until through September 30, 2016. Additional legislative action must occur for the provisions extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 to continue beyond September 30, 2016. ", "Not all authorizations of appropriations in the HEA were set to expire at the end of FY2014. For some HEA programs, authorization of appropriations or mandatory budget authority is permanent, while for others authorization is provided through a date beyond the end of FY2014. For a number of programs, the period during which appropriations are authorized to be provided has ended. For instance, the authorizations of appropriations for Teacher Quality Partnership Grants expired at the end of FY2011. In a few other instances that are discussed below, program authority had a sunset date (e.g., the end of FY2014, the end of FY2015)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Education Provisions Act", "paragraphs": ["The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) contains a broad array of statutory provisions that are applicable to the majority of federal education programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED).

This additional one-year extension terminated at the end of FY2015. The implications of this expiration in the context of a particular program or activity depend on the nature of the provision that expired. ", "In general, there is a distinction between an authorization provision that establishes the authority for a program, policy, project, or activity and a provision that explicitly authorizes subsequent congressional action to provide appropriations. The Comptroller General has explained that there is no constitutional or general statutory requirement that an appropriation must be preceded by a specific act that authorized it. \"Congress may ... appropriate funds for a program or object that has not been previously authorized or which exceeds the scope of a prior authorization, in which event the enacted appropriation, in effect, carries its own authorization and is available to the agency for obligation and expenditure. \" That is, in the event that an authorization of appropriations has lapsed, an appropriation would generally provide the necessary legal authorization for the agency to spend money for the particular purpose specified in the appropriations act. Furthermore, if an authorization of appropriations for an activity expires but the underlying authority for that activity does not, those statutory authorities still exist and the agency may continue to take actions pursuant to them, assuming that appropriations are available for those purposes.", "Extension of the HEA authorization provisions that expired at the end of FY2014 and were extended through GEPA to the end of FY2015, the vast majority of which are discretionary authorizations of appropriations, could be addressed in a variety of ways through either the authorization or appropriations processes (or both). For instance, one or more laws could be enacted that extend the authorization of appropriations for an individual program or multiple programs. Alternatively, a program for which the authorization of appropriations has expired may continue to operate if Congress continues to appropriate funds for it. In a few other instances, however, where the authority for the program itself terminates, an explicit extension of that program would be required for it to continue to operate. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Explicit Extension", "paragraphs": ["For the HEA provisions that, with the GEPA extension, expired at the end of FY2015, a law could be enacted to explicitly extend the authorization. For instance, prior to the enactment of the HEOA ( P.L. 110-315 ) in 2008, the most recent reauthorization of the HEA, HEA programs were extended beyond their prior terminal authorization date of FY2003 through a series of Higher Education Extension Acts that temporarily extended the HEA.

As was previously mentioned, in general, an appropriation for the purposes of a program with an expired authorization of appropriations would ensure the continued operation of that program. For example, although the authorization of appropriations under HEA, Title II, Part A, for Teacher Quality Partnership Grants was provided only through FY2011 (and extended under GEPA through FY2012), the program remains operational due to continued funding provided in previous appropriations acts through FY2015, and now through FY2016 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016.", "While it seems that most of the HEA programs that expired at the end of FY2015 could continue operations with the appropriation of funds for FY2016, it appears that an explicit extension would be required for the advisory committees mentioned above to ensure continued operation in their current form beyond the end of FY2015.

In most cases, the appropriation of funds for a program through a CR would be sufficient for a program's continued operation. However, for those programs with explicit termination or sunset dates, a CR or other appropriations law would likely need to contain specific language, beyond the appropriation of funds, indicating Congress's intent to continue the operation of the program. Thus, for certain provisions, the extension of the explicit authorization for the program or activity may be required for continued operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2016 Appropriations and Extensions", "paragraphs": ["Beginning on September 30, 2015, a variety of measures were taken to provide additional appropriations for federal programs beyond FY2015.

Then, on December 18, 2015 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 was enacted ( P.L. 114-113 ), under which Congress provided additional appropriations for many of the HEA programs through FY2016. Thus, many of the HEA programs that, under GEPA provisions, were set to expire at the end of FY2015 continued to operate through December 18, 2015, under the various CRs and will continue to operate through FY2016 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. ", "Congress did not, however, extend the authorization of or provide additional funding under any of the CRs or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 for the Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance. Because the Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance neither received additional funding nor an extension of authorization, it has disbanded and operations ceased immediately upon the expiration of its authorization. ", "Additionally, although Congress did not provide additional funding for the Federal Perkins Loan program under the CRs or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, it did provide authorization for the continued operation, but not additional appropriations, for the program through separate legislation\u2014the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-105 ). Under the act, institutions of higher education may continue to award Perkins Loans to eligible undergraduate students through September 30, 2017 and to eligible graduate and professional students through September 30, 2016.

Should this occur, an agency must suspend operations of affected programs, except in certain situations when law authorizes continued activity, until further appropriations are provided. The programs may subsequently resume once funds for them are appropriated, unless otherwise provided. ", "In many past instances, a CR following a funding gap has contained authorization extensions and provided that those extensions shall be considered to have been enacted on the date that the funding gap commenced, as if no funding gap occurred. For instance, under the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-46 ), which followed the FY2013 16-day funding gap from October 1, 2013, to October 16, 2013, appropriations were provided for federal programs and the time covered by the joint resolution was \"considered to have begun on October 1, 2013.\" This may be especially relevant for programs with a specific termination date, such as the advisory committees discussed above. While additional action beyond providing appropriations is likely needed to continue their operation, should these programs not receive an explicit extension prior to the termination, it appears that Congress would have the ability to restore the committees through provisions in a CR as if a lapse in authorization never occurred, such that it may be unnecessary to reform the committees completely (e.g., appoint new committee members)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Freely Associated States", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the HEA, the Compact of Free Association contains several provisions that relate to the eligibility of students and IHEs of the Freely Associated States to participate in the HEA programs.
