As the largest single consumer of fuel in the United States, DOD has the potential to make important contributions to the national effort to reduce the use of and reliance on fossil fuel. Aviation fuel makes up the largest portion of fossil fuel consumed by DOD and therefore represents the area of greatest potential energy savings. This report examines DOD's use of aviation fuel and possibilities to reduce that use by examining related issues and presenting options Congress may choose to consider.", "Reducing DOD's consumption of aviation fuel could by itself significantly reduce the department's overall reliance on fossil fuel. In Fiscal Year 2005, DOD consumed roughly 125 million barrels of oil\u2014approximately 1.2% of the nation's total. About 74% of that was used to power mobility vehicles\u2014Air Force aircraft, Navy ships, and Army ground vehicles. Over half (roughly 52% ) was aviation fuel. (Note: aviation fuel is also used in \"non-aircraft\" systems such as tanks and generators in order to reduce logistics requirements on the battlefield.", "There are several ways in which DOD can reduce its use of fossil-based aviation fuel. Each has advantages and disadvantages and no single option provides the perfect solution. Advanced technologies, such as synthetic fuels, offer potential alternatives but further development and study are required before DOD can employ them on a large scale. DOD can also take measures to decrease its use of fuel. Possible options include upgrading aircraft engines and modifying operational procedures. Many of these measures, however, are costly and must compete for funding with other operational priorities.", "Congress also recognizes that DOD has a role to play in the nation's quest for alternative energy sources. Language contained in the FY2007 Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts requires DOD to report to Congress on their actions to reduce consumption of fossil fuel, increase the energy efficiency of their weapon platforms, and explore the use of synthetic fuel made from coal. Additional proposed legislation would require DOD to further study coal as a fuel source and would remove certain DOD contracting restrictions viewed as a potential obstacle to synthetic fuel development.", "DOD has publically expressed its intention to devote resources to this issue; Air Force leadership has stated a goal of using domestically produced synthetic fuel for half of its domestic aviation fuel by 2016. At the present time, however, DOD does not seem to have a comprehensive long-term energy strategy or centralized leadership focused on energy issues for the department. This may affect the department's ability to achieve its long-term energy goals.

For a number of years, the department has been making steady progress at decreasing their use of fossil fuels on their installations and in their facilities but following the sharp rise in oil prices after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, DOD stepped-up its examination of fuel use in weapon systems.", "The largest portion of fossil fuel used by DOD is in the form of aviation fuel. Although formulated for use in aircraft, aviation fuel is also used in other, land-based, platforms such as tanks and generators to reduce DOD's logistics requirements. Reducing DOD's consumption of aviation fuel could, by itself, significantly reduce the department's overall use of and reliance on fossil fuel.

Approximately 74% of its energy powers its mobility vehicles and over half\u2014roughly 52% of the total\u2014is comprised of\u00a0aviation fuel. By comparison, aviation accounts for only about 4% of the energy used in the\u00a0United States.", "Fuel costs, although less than 3% of the total DOD budget, have a significant impact on the department's operating costs. For every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, DOD's operating costs increase by approximately $1.3 billion. DOD budgets for fuel a year or more in advance of its purchase, therefore and sudden large increases in fuel costs must be paid for with emergency funds or by shifting funds from other programs. The Air Force, which operates most of DOD's fixed-wing aircraft, spends the largest share of DOD's fuel budget. Every $10 increase in a barrel of oil increases the Air Forces' already sizable annual fuel costs by $600 million.", "Fuel use varies significantly among the different types of aircraft. For example, the B-52H, one of the oldest aircraft in the service's inventory, has a maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds, runs on eight TF-33 turbine engines, and burns approximately 3500 gallons per flight hour. That is 138 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per hour. By contrast, the C-5B, designed with 1980s technology, is a larger aircraft with four engines, has a maximum takeoff weight of 769,000 pounds, and also burns about 3500 gallons per flight hour. That is 219 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per hour-an increase of 59% over the B-52 capabilities. The T-38, a high-performance jet-engine aircraft used for training, has a maximum takeoff weight of 12,000 pounds and burns only about 395 gallons per flight hour. That is only 30 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per hour-much less than either of the above. The lower fuel efficiency of the T-38 compared to either the B-52H or the C-5B is a reflection of the smaller aircraft's aerodynamic design, afterburning engines, and much shorter sortie length rather than the efficiency of its engines. Fuel consumption rates for a representative selection of Air Force aircraft is provided in Table 1 .", "Delivering fuel to the operational user can add substantially to its cost. The \"fully burdened\" cost of fuel refers to the price of fuel with the costs of delivery added in. Costs of delivery include the acquisition, maintenance, and operating costs of an aerial refueling tanker and the crew that flies it. The cost of a gallon of fuel delivered to an aircraft on a flight line is a relatively straight-forward computation and generally ranges between $2 and $3 per gallon. On the other hand, the fully burdened cost of a gallon of fuel delivered to an aircraft in flight is estimated to be around $20 per gallon. / The complexity of measuring fuel use and costs for aircraft is one of the many challenges DOD has to becoming a more efficient user or making other changes in its fuel use, such as using alternative fuels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies on DOD Fuel Use", "paragraphs": ["As fuel costs rose, DOD recognized the need to understand factors that contribute to the department's heavy usage and examine ways to mitigate them. Consequently, DOD has conducted or sponsored a number of studies in recent years to examine DOD's fuel use, determine the extent to which that use is problematic, and recommend actions to decrease its use. Two general conclusions seem to emerge from various government studies. The first is that there does not appear to be one ideal alternative fuel with which to replace or augment the fossil fuel already although different technologies are being pursued to varying degrees. The second is that there appears to be several methods currently available to DOD with which it can decrease fuel consumption.", "The earliest comprehensive DOD study on fuel use, conducted by the Defense Science Board in 2001, focused on the fuel efficiency of weapon systems and was the first to suggest that the true cost of fuel\u2014the fully burdened rate\u2014was not sufficiently understood by decision-makers. Two other comprehensive studies were completed more recently, in September 2006. The JASON report, Reducing DOD Fossil Fuel Dependence , asserted that an energy shortage was unlikely in the near term to hinder DOD operations and emphasized the value of optimizing the energy efficiency of weapon systems over pursuing alternative fuels at this time. The Defense Task Force on Energy Security was an internal cross-functional group that looked at energy use throughout the department. It presented three recommendations: 1) increase the energy efficiency of weapon systems, 2) accelerate energy-saving initiatives for facilities, and 3) establish an alternative fuels programs. The most recent government sponsored report, completed in April 2007 by LMI Government Consulting, Inc. (LMI), identified areas in which DOD's energy goals are not synchronized with their current practices and recommended actions to address the misalignment. Each of these studies is more fully examined below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2001 Defense Science Board Task Force", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) directed the Defense Science Board (DSB) to form a task force to examine how DOD could improve the fuel efficiency of their weapons systems. The task force would also identify institutional barriers that impeded the department's understanding of and ability to capture the full advantages of more fuel efficient systems. The task force was not asked to look at possible sources of alternative fuel and they did not address that topic in their report. They reported five significant findings.", "Finding #1: Although significant warfighting, logistics and cost benefits occur when weapons systems are more fuel-efficient, these benefits are not valued or emphasized in the DOD requirements and acquisition processes. When buying new weapons, DOD placed performance as its highest priority and seemed to overlook how fuel efficiency could result in improved performance. Furthermore, when developing new systems the department did not seem to take into account how the fuel use of a particular system could have far-reaching effects on the total force (e.g., a system's logistical requirements may create a vulnerable delivery chain).", "Finding #2: The DOD currently prices fuel based on the wholesale refinery price and does not include the cost of delivery to its customers. This prevents a comprehensive view of fuel utilization in DOD's decision-making, does not reflect the DOD's true fuel costs, masks energy efficiency benefits, and distorts platform design choices. The DSB pointed out that overlooking the true cost of fuel also masks the real benefits of fuel efficiency. As a consequence, fuel efficiency is not regarded as a relevant factor in the acquisition of weapon systems or in other logistics related decisions. For example, in 1997, using an average fuel price of 97 cents, the Air Force estimated that re-engining the B-52H would generate a savings of just under $400 million over 40 years. Based on that calculation, the service concluded that retrofitting was not cost-effective. The DSB reworked the equation using an average fuel cost of $1.50 per gallon (the board estimated that 10% of the fuel would be delivered via aerial refueling at a cost of $17.50 per gallon) and calculated a savings of $1.7 billion.", "Finding #3: DOD resource allocation and accounting processes (the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), DOD Comptroller) do not reward fuel efficiency or penalize inefficiency. The task force found that DOD interest in fuel efficiency had been mainly limited to meeting goals established by legislation or executive order. Since those goals mainly applied to installations, including their non-warfighting vehicles, there was little incentive to improve the fuel efficiency of weapon systems. Additionally, the department had no way to quantify\u2014and therefore value\u2014the benefits of conserving fuel.", "Finding #4: Operational and logistics wargaming involving fuel requirements are not cross-linked to the Service requirements development or acquisition program processes. The\u00a0task force found that in DOD combat simulation exercises, each military service emphasized\u00a0mission execution while adequate fuel supplies were considered a constant. DSB asserted that doing so left DOD unaware of the potential effects of fuel efficiency on combat operations and of the vulnerability of the fuel supply chain. Furthermore, with no model of efficient or inefficient fuel use, DOD could not analyze fuel related logistical requirements as part\u00a0of the acquisition process.", "Finding #5: High payoff, fuel-efficient technologies are available now to improve warfighting effectiveness in current weapon systems through retrofit and in new systems acquisition. The task force found that there were existing technologies that could increase weapon systems' fuel efficiency. However, without the tools to analyze the collective benefits of fuel efficiency to warfighting capability, the value of improvements could be misjudged and not fully appreciated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JASON Report", "paragraphs": ["JASON, an independent scientific advisory group for DOD, was asked by the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) to assess ways in which DOD could reduce its demand for fossil fuel using advanced technology, including alternative energy sources. The group was asked specifically not to conduct a detailed analysis of U.S. Air Force fuel use.", "The JASON report contained three relevant findings:", "Finding #1: DOD fuel costs, though high, represent only about 2.5-3% of the DOD budget and should not be a \"primary decision driver at present.\" JASON determined that other fuel related issues such as life-cycle costs of weapon systems and the supply chain (in terms of both money and human life) were more significant and compelling factors but that the cost of fuel may become a significant issue in the future. They further noted that the number of Air Force aircraft, the largest source of fuel consumption in DOD, is expected to decline significantly in the next several decades, which should result in a corresponding decrease in fuel use.", "Finding #2: Although revolutionary options in weapon system design exist in their early stages, the technologies that currently promise the most significant fuel savings are light -weighting and modernizing diesel engines. JASON saw little use at the present for most alternative ground vehicle designs such as hybrids, all-electric, or fuel-cell vehicles. In the case of the first two, military use patterns would not allow optimal use of the technologies. In the case of fuel-cells, JASON found that the technology was not sufficiently mature and that there was not a good way to transport hydrogen to theater. JASON suggested light-weighting vehicles by decreasing the weight of manned vehicles and using more unmanned vehicles.", "JASON recommended upgrading the gas turbine engine in the Army M-1 Abrams tanks to a modern diesel and that the Army, in particular, install fuel consumption tracking devices in vehicles. The resulting data will allow DOD to gauge use patterns and provide data with which to make informed decisions on engine selections and optimal efficiency.", "Finding #3: The Department of Defense uses less than 2% of the oil consumed in the United States and is therefore not a large enough consumer to drive the market for conventional or alternative fuels. JASON and others have suggested that finding substitutes for fossil fuels must be a national endeavor.", "According to DOD it uses roughly 340,000 barrels of oil a day whereas the daily consumption rate for the United States is approximately 21 million barrels. DOD agrees that it plays a significant role in testing, certification, and demonstrating the use of synthetic jet fuel but is not a large enough consumer to drive the market.", "JASON contended that in the search for alternative fuels, the most economical and environmentally sound method is to use Fischer-Tropsch technology to produce liquid fuel from\u00a0\"stranded\" natural gas.

Strategic: DOD's dependence on foreign supplies of fuel limits its flexibility in dealing with certain producer nations;", "2. Operational: DOD seeks greater mobility, persistence, and agility for its forces but the energy requirements of its forces limits the department's ability to attain those things; and", "3.

They can be placed in two categories: 1) increasing the use and supply of alternative fuels and 2) decreasing the demand for petroleum-based fuel.", "In the first category, options include producing synthetic fuel from coal, natural gas, and biomass, as well as hydrogen fuel cells. In the second category, DOD can use various existing technologies to increase the fuel-efficiency of weapon systems and modify operating procedures and polices to use less fuel. All the options have limitations and none provide a perfect solution.", "Whether it is more prudent to aggressively pursue alternative fuels or concentrate resources on decreasing the department's fuel demand is a matter of debate. There are many who suggest that DOD can spur the development of a viable domestic Coal-To-Liquid industry.

Ultimately, DOD would like there to be just one in part to decrease risks associated with the elaborate and vulnerable fuel delivery system now in place. However, that may be several years away. Although DOD has been exploring the use of synthetic fuel for aircraft, there is no indication that DOD is actively pursuing alternative fuels for battlefield ground vehicles. There is speculation that this is due to the difficulty of altering the current logistical system and also to the fact that research and development in alternative ground fuel are still in the early stages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Synthetic Fuel", "paragraphs": ["The technology used to produce synthetic liquid fuel from coal, natural gas, or other solid carbon-containing feedstocks has existed since around 1923 when two German researchers, Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, found a way to turn carbon-based materials into useable petroleum products.

F-T fuels produce approximately 2.4% less carbon dioxide, 50%-90% less particulate matter, and 100% less sulphur than traditional petroleum-based fuels. Other positive attributes of F-T fuels include excellent low temperature properties that improve high altitude operations and low temperature starting; and \"superior\" thermal stability, which makes possible the development of highly fuel efficient engines.", "Another oft cited advantage of F-T fuel for DOD is that it can be produced using resources available within the United States. Coal and natural gas, two common feedstocks , are relatively abundant in the United States. The Energy Information Administration estimated in a 1995 report that the United States has an approximately 250 year supply of coal. It should be noted that an increased demand for coal driven by a growing F-T industry may affect that estimate.", "The Air Force has already conducted testing of F-T GTL fuel with positive results. In September, 2006, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the Air Force tested a 50/50 mix of F-T synthetic fuel and Jet Propellant 8 (JP-8) in one engine of a B-52 Stratofortress. No detrimental effects were noted as a result of the flight. In December, 2006, the Air Force tested the synthetic fuel mixture in all eight of the B-52's engines and again, no detrimental effects were noticed.

One is that it reduces the fuel's ability to provide lubrication causing stress on the engine's moving parts. The other problem is that less sulphur results in fewer aromatic hydrocarbons, which, in traditional petroleum-based fuels, have the desirous effect of causing engine seals to swell and prevent leakage.", "Critics of F-T fuel also point to the potential environmental hazards posed by increased coal mining as an additional drawback. Some fear a \"mining boom\" that could lead to the strip mining of public lands, degraded water quality in some locations, and additional miners put at risk. They question whether a relatively small dent in oil imports is worth what they predict as a 40% increase of coal production. Instead a need for increased fuel efficiency and cleaner energy alternatives is often cited.", "Recent efforts at constructing F-T plants in the United States have proven challenging. In September 2006, after supplying DOD 100,000 gallons of synthetic fuel to test in the B-52, Syntroleum, a company that produces synthetic fuel, closed its demonstration plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, its revenue falling after completion of its contracts with DOD and the Department of Transportation. In a February 2007 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Secretary of Energy Samuel W. Bodman, in response to questions about why the Department of Energy proposed halting funding for a CTL diesel fuel plant in Pennsylvania, stated that the \"financial viability\" of the project was questionable. Cost estimates had grown from an original $612 million in 2003 to approximately $800 million. On the other hand, potential developers may be encouraged by DOD's interest in synthetic fuels. In May 2006, when the Defense Energy Support Center, the agency within the Defense Logistics Agency that purchases fuel for DOD, asked companies to submit proposals for the production of 200,000 gallons of F-T fuels for testing by the Air Force and Navy in 2008 and 2009, it received over 20\u00a0responses.", "The Air Force has set a goal of using a domestically produced synthetic fuel blend for 50 percent of its aviation fuel by 2016.

The committee notes that winglets are currently used on commercial aircraft and result in a five to seven percent increase in fuel efficiency. On September 16, 1981, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration released the KC-135 Winglet Program Review on the incorporation of winglets for KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft. However, the Air Force concluded that the cost of adding winglets to the KC-135 did not provide sufficient payback in fuel savings or increased range to justify modification. Although the Air Force did conclude that modifying aircraft with winglets could increase fuel efficiency, the Air Force determined that re-engining the KC-135 aircraft produced a greater return on investment. The committee believes that incorporating winglets on military aircraft could increase fuel efficiency on certain platforms and that the Air Force should reexamine incorporating this technology onto its platforms.", "Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report to the congressional defense committees by March 1, 2007, examining the feasibility of modifying Air Force aircraft with winglets. The report shall include a cost comparison analysis of the cost of winglet modification compared to the return on investment realized over time for each airlift, aerial refueling, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft in the Air Force inventory; the market price of aviation fuel at which incorporating winglets would be beneficial for each Air Force platform; all positive and negative impacts to aircraft maintenance and flight operations; and investment strategies the Air Force could implement with commercial partners to minimize Air Force capital investment and maximize investment return.", "FY2007 Defense Appropriations Act ( H.R. 5631 /P.L. 109-289)", "The Senate Appropriations Committee, in its report ( S.Rept. 109-292 of July 25, 2006) on H.R. 5631 states:", "The Committee notes the recent developments relating to the conversion of coal to liquid fuels.
