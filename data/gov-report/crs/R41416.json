At the federal level, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI, the Bureau) implemented a forward-leaning approach with a revision to the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations.

It appears that U.S. law enforcement has effectively exploited the Internet\u2014which radicalizing individuals can mine for information and violent jihadists use while plotting\u2014in its pursuit of terrorists.

Because of this, they may turn to violence involving less planning and preparation, such as assaults using firearms. However, the possibility that homegrown violent jihadists can commit large strikes that kill or wound numerous victims and disrupt everyday life for thousands of Americans is not out of the question. The bombing of the 2013 Boston Marathon by the Tsarnaev brothers suggests as much. ", "Al Qaeda appears to have embraced such homegrown terrorist plots. In March 2010, As Sahab, Al Qaeda's media wing, released an English language video titled \"A Call to Arms\" featuring American-born spokesperson Adam Gadahn. In the video directed toward jihadists in the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom, Gadahn extols alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan as a \"trailblazer\" who did not attract law enforcement attention by training abroad or relying on conspirators. Gadahn encourages would-be terrorists to select realistically hittable targets that are familiar to them and have some broadly symbolic\u2014especially economic\u2014resonance. In an early June 2011 English language video message titled \"Do Not Rely on Others, Take the Task upon Yourself,\" Gadahn even more clearly emphasized lone wolf operations. In the video he suggests possible weapons, ", "Let's take America as an example. America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?", "Gadahn stresses \"targeting major institutions\u2014after a clip showing the logos of such firms as Exxon, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America\u2014and 'influential public figures.'\" At about the same time as this video was released, users of jihadist websites apparently began posting potential targets and developing hit lists. ", "In the same vein as Gadahn's video, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (an Al Qaeda affiliate) has issued an English language propaganda magazine titled Inspire . The magazine has encouraged homegrown violent jihadist activity in the West, focusing on smaller scale strategies such as using a vehicle to run over victims. The magazine has featured articles attributed to three prominent violent jihadist propagandists with strong American ties: Gadahn, radical U.S.-born imam Anwar al-Awlaki, and Saudi-born American citizen Samir Khan. In September 2011, the latter two died in a widely reported U.S. strike in Yemen.", "This does not mean that homegrown terrorists are incapable of sophisticated, coordinated action or linking up with international groups. For example, in 2008 foiled New York City subway bomber Najibullah Zazi received explosives instruction from Al Qaeda in Pakistan. He and co-conspirators then tried to implement this training in the United States. U.S. authorities assert that senior Al Qaeda official Adnan el-Shukrijumah possibly recruited Zazi and his fellow plotters. Shukrijumah\u2014a Saudi-born, naturalized American citizen who spent part of his youth in Brooklyn\u2014and others involved in Al Qaeda's \"external operations\" program allegedly planned the attack. The relative sophistication of Zazi's plot, involving both individuals in the United States and abroad, may have actually exposed it to greater law enforcement and intelligence agency scrutiny. ", "The conventionally perceived shortcomings of homegrown terrorists may, in fact, pose some challenges for law enforcement, intelligence, and security officials charged with detecting, preventing, or disrupting terrorist plots. According to one terrorism analyst, \"The smaller cells tend to be less powerful than a central terrorist organization like Al Qaeda, but they are harder to detect\u2026. When the group of conspirators are [sic] small it's much more difficult for the FBI\u2026. The larger the group, the greater the chances the FBI can infiltrate.\" Former Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair noted that many of the terrorist schemes disrupted in 2009\u2014including homegrown activity\u2014relied on short-term planning. These quickly generated schemes are harder to identify and disrupt than more traditional and more highly organized international terrorist conspiracies, which can gestate for years. ", "According to at least one study, homegrown terrorists can be nimble adversaries, because as U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, they can travel easily between the United States and foreign countries. While abroad, they could receive training from foreign terrorist organizations, conduct surveillance operations against foreign targets, and plan attacks. In the case of recent immigrants to the United States, they are particularly comfortable moving between American and foreign cultural contexts. English language skills, the ability to navigate Western culture, society, and context are likely key ingredients for successful strikes. Three cases involving homegrown terrorists illustrate how these factors possibly facilitate terrorist plotting:", "In February 2011, Colleen LaRose (aka \"Jihad Jane\") pled guilty \"to all counts of a superseding indictment charging her with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, making false statements, and attempted identity theft.\" She allegedly discussed with her co-conspirators how her mainstream American physical appearance would allow her to \"blend in with many people.\" On March 18, 2010, David Headley, born Daood Sayed Gilani to an American mother and Pakistani father, pled guilty to helping plan the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, and for plotting to attack the offices of a newspaper in Copenhagen, Denmark.

", "The study describes a general four-step process of radicalization leading to violent extremism. First, individuals exist in a pre-radicalization phase in which they lead lives unaware of or uninterested in either violent jihad or fundamentalist Salafi Islam. Next, they go through self-identification in which some sort of crisis or trigger (job loss, social alienation, death of a family member, international conflict) urges them to explore Salafism. Third, individuals undergo indoctrination or adoption of jihadist ideals combined with Salafi views. The study indicates that, typically, a \"spiritual sanctioner\" or charismatic figure plays a central role in the indoctrination process. Finally, radicalizing individuals go through \"jihadization,\" where they identify themselves as violent jihadists, and are drawn into the planning of a terrorist attack.

The NYPD report itself acknowledges that individuals who begin this process do not necessarily pass through all the stages nor do they necessarily follow all the steps in order, and not all individuals or groups who begin this progression become terrorists.

Jose Pimentel was building explosive devices when he was arrested after two years of surveillance by the NYPD. He sympathized with Al Qaeda and drew inspiration from Awlaki. The would-be bomber is reputed to have tried but failed to correspond with Awlaki via email, and the cleric's death may have sped up his plotting. In December 2010, federal officials charged Antonio Martinez, a Muslim convert, in a plot to bomb an Armed Forces recruiting station. A sting operation by the FBI ensnared Martinez. He allegedly planned to attack an Armed Forces recruiting station in Maryland, using a sport utility vehicle loaded with what he believed was a bomb. During the course of his plot, he also allegedly praised Awlaki. Naturalized U.S. citizen Farooque Ahmed was arrested in October 2010 for attempting to assist people he believed to be terrorists in planning the bombing of Washington, DC, Metrorail stations. Ahmed allegedly possessed a biography of Awlaki and listened to his online sermons. Also apprehended in October 2010, U.S. citizen Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, who allegedly tried to join overseas extremist groups such as the Taliban, modeled one of the jihadist websites he managed after Awlaki's teachings. The website offered hyperlinks to Awlaki's online lectures. According to DOJ, Shehadeh also discussed Awlaki's ideas with an individual he tried (and failed) to recruit for violent jihad. Zachary Chesser, who allegedly tried to join the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab as late as July 2010 and propagandized online, emailed Awlaki. The cleric responded twice, according to court documents. In July 2010, Paul Rockwood Jr. pled guilty to making false statements in a domestic terrorism investigation. He closely followed Awlaki's online pronouncements and developed an \"execution\" hit list that included 15 people Rockwood believed had desecrated Islam. According to court documents, Shaker Masri encouraged an FBI cooperating source to \"review speeches\" by Awlaki. Arrested in June 2010 while allegedly trying to join al-Shabaab, Mohamed Alessa and Carlos Almonte, watched videos of and listened to sermons by Awlaki.", "According to media sources, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant who admitted that he attempted to detonate an explosives-filled vehicle in New York City's Times Square on May 1, 2010, cited Awlaki and another cleric, Abdullah Faisal from Jamaica, as key influences on him. Also, a surveillance recording from 2007 captured one of six individuals eventually convicted of plotting to attack Fort Dix in New Jersey talking about an Awlaki lecture. ", "U.S. officials believe Awlaki also had contact with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the young Nigerian who concealed an explosive device in his underwear and attempted to detonate it on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. In October 2011, when he pled guilty to his involvement in the plot, Abdulmutallab stated, \"I was greatly inspired to participate in jihad by the lectures of the great and rightly guided mujahedeen who is alive, Sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki, may Allah preserve him and his family and give them victory, Amin, and Allah knows best.\" A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the topic's sensitivity, told The Washington Post that Awlaki was the first U.S. citizen added to a list of suspected terrorists the CIA was authorized to kill.", "Even after Awlaki's death, his teachings have influenced would-be plotters. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has reportedly indicated to authorities that he and his brother, Tamerlan, watched videos of Anwar Al-Awlaki in the period before the siblings allegedly bombed the 2013 Boston Marathon. In January 2013, Erwin Antonio Rios, an individual who allegedly desired to travel abroad to wage violent jihad, purportedly discussed the writing of the deceased radical cleric with a law enforcement informant.", "Samir Khan\u2014 before he was killed in the same strike as Awlaki\u2014served as the editor of Inspire magazine, launched in 2010 by AQAP. Inspire has been described as \"a slick magazine for jihadists ... that featured political and how-to articles written in a comfortable American vernacular.\" The magazine is intended to attract would-be jihadists in the West. ", "The Saudi-born Khan lived in Queens, New York, and Charlotte, North Carolina. He radicalized after the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001, and moved with his parents to Charlotte in 2004. He left Charlotte in 2009 and joined AQAP in Yemen. Prior to leaving the United States, Khan had gained some notoriety as a jihadist blogger and as creator of the online magazine, Jihad Recollections \u2014 Inspire ' s forerunner.", "Reportedly, Khan and his online publications may have influenced homegrown jihadists.", "In November 2012, Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales was arrested for allegedly plotting with three others to join either Al Qaeda or the Taliban in Afghanistan. According to DOJ, he had read articles from Inspire about bomb making and weapons training. In July 2011, U.S. Army private Naser Abdo was arrested near Fort Hood in Texas for allegedly plotting a shooting spree and bombing in the area. Abdo intended to kill soldiers near the same place where Army Major Nidal Hasan killed 13 individuals in 2009. Federal officials noted that Abdo also possessed an article on how to construct an explosive device, among other items. The article was from Inspire . In November 2010, Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-born naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested as part of an FBI sting operation, moments after he tried to detonate a van he believed was packed with explosives in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square. According to DOJ, Mohamud wrote articles for Khan's first magazine, Jihad Recollections .", "Aside from editing Inspire , Khan also contributed to it. Additionally, the magazine included commentary from Awlaki and another American Al Qaeda propagandist, Adam Gadahn.", "Adam Gadahn has served as a translator and English-language propagandist for Al Qaeda and has been charged with treason by the United States. He has appeared in a number of the organization's videos widely circulated on the Web. Born in 1978 and raised in California, Gadahn converted to Islam as a teenager and moved to Pakistan by 1999. As a young convert in California, Gadahn was influenced by two jihadists involved with a discussion group he attended. One of these men also likely introduced him into Al Qaeda circles in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2004, he first appeared in a widely released video threatening attacks on the United States, and in another dispatch he urged Americans to convert to Islam. In a video posted on June 20, 2010, Gadahn rails against President Barack Obama, describing him as \"treacherous, bloodthirsty, and narrow-minded.\"", "Omar Hammami, also known as \"Abu Mansour al-Amriki,\" is originally from Daphne, Alabama. In 2007, he emerged as a key international intermediary for the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab but has since broken with the group. In September 2013, he publicly renounced his ties to al-Shabaab and Al Qaeda, and news reports indicated that he was killed by assassins from the terrorist group. Before that, he spent years trying to influence would-be violent jihadists to join with the Somali terrorist group. The son of a Syrian-born father and an American mother, he has been featured in propagandist videos distributed by the group. In one, he instructs recruits in urban warfare. Zachary Chesser saw Hammami as a role model. He even imitated Hammami's adoption of \"al-Amriki\" (the American) as part of his own jihadist name\u2014\"Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee.\" Somali officials tie Hammami to al-Shabaab recruitment and financial management. He may also have led battlefield skirmishes. In August 2010, DOJ unsealed a 2009 superseding indictment against him. In October 2011, Hammami released a video calling Western Muslims to violent jihad.", "As a child, Hammami lived between the Christian world of his mother and the Muslim beliefs of his father. He converted to Islam in high school, and while a student at the University of South Alabama, he led the Muslim Student Association and began adhering to Salafi doctrine. His Salafism allegedly sprang in part from a desire to rebel against his father. In 2002, he dropped out of school, and by 2004 he had found his way to Toronto, Canada, where American combat in Iraq and Afghanistan encouraged him to reconsider his nonviolent Salafi views. One of his friends alleges that Hammami began surfing the Web for information on jihad at this time. While in Canada, he married a Somali woman. In 2005, they moved to Cairo, and by late 2006 he was in Somalia pursuing violent jihad.

This blurring possibly encourages people who interact in such forums to more easily see themselves as part of broader jihadist movements and not just casual readers or online spectators. They may eventually engage in more substantive activity\u2014actual propagandizing, financial support, or joining a terrorist network.

They viewed themselves as the \"media wing\" for Al Qaeda in Iraq. In the eyes of some terrorism experts, the Mehanna case highlights the shift away from core members of Al Qaeda toward Internet-inspired, homegrown radicalization and self-starting terrorists. The Mehanna case emphasizes how recruiters from foreign terrorist organizations no longer seem necessary to shepherd radicalized individuals into terrorist training abroad.

DOJ has publicly released information on unsealed terrorism convictions between September 11, 2001, and March 18, 2010. CRS analysis of this information indicates that homegrown jihadists unconnected to any specific violent plots were prosecuted for materially supporting terrorists in at least six schemes. The six schemes supported violent jihadist or jihadist-linked groups such as Al Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah, Abu Sayyaf, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT). They included the following:", "Rahmat Abdhir: A U.S. citizen living in San Jose, California, Abdhir was indicted in 2007 for providing material support to his brother, Zulkifli Abdhir, a member of Jemaah Islamiyah based in the Philippines. The U.S. government accused Rahmat of sending to his brother more than $10,000 in supplies, including chocolates, underwear, knives, guns, and radios. Ahmed Abdellatif Sherif Mohamed: According to DOJ, during a routine traffic stop in Goose Creek, South Carolina on August 4, 2007, law enforcement officials found explosive materials (PVC pipe containing potassium nitrate and kitty litter as well as about 20 feet of fuse) during a consensual search of the trunk of the Toyota Camry Mohamed was driving. A laptop retrieved from the car yielded a video produced by Mohamed depicting how components from a remote controlled toy car could be used to fashion a detonator for an explosive device. Mohamed had uploaded the recording to YouTube. Although no specific terrorist group was linked to Mohamed, he did admit that he intended the recording as instruction to \"suiciders\" on how to spare themselves in attacks. An Egyptian resident of Tampa, Florida, Mohamed entered the United States on an F-1 student visa. Tarik Shah, Rafiq Abdus Sabir, Mahmud Faruq Brent : In an investigation stretching back at least to December 2001, the FBI infiltrated a group of acquaintances interested in supporting international jihadist terrorist organizations. Shah and Brent pled guilty to material support in 2007 and Sabir was convicted of the charge the same year. In 2005, Shah, a Bronx, New York City, jazz musician and martial arts instructor, had sworn allegiance to Al Qaeda in the presence of an FBI agent who posed as a recruiter for the group. He had also allegedly offered to train Al Qaeda fighters in hand-to-hand combat. Shah purported to have been interested in traveling to Afghanistan in 1998 to attend terrorist training camps. Sabir, a doctor from Florida, swore allegiance to Al Qaeda in the same ceremony as his friend, Shah. Sabir also offered his medical skills to treat injured Al Qaeda fighters.

According to DOJ, a subsequent terrorism investigation uncovered (among other things) evidence that Brice had \"posted instructions on the manufacturing of chemical improvised destructive devices ... and other anti-law enforcement literature\" on a \"foreign-based jihadi internet site.\" He was arrested in May 2011. In May 2011, FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan (a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of Miami) and two of his sons Izhar Khan and Irfan Khan (both naturalized U.S. citizens).

Nima Ali Yusuf: A lawful permanent resident of the United States living in San Diego, Yusuf was arrested on November 12, 2010, on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to al-Shabaab and for making false statements to a government agency regarding an international terrorism matter. In December 2011, Yusuf pled guilty to conspiring to provide material support to al-Shabaab. Mohamud Abdi Yusuf, Abdi Mahdi Hussein, and Duwayne Mohamed Diriye participated in a scheme to provide material support to al-Shabaab, according to an indictment unsealed November 3, 2010. Yusuf, a resident of St. Louis, Missouri, is accused of sending funds to people tied to the terrorist organization in Somalia, including Diriye. Yusuf purportedly worked with Hussein to structure financial transactions while the latter was an employee of a licensed money-remitting business. In November 2011, Yusuf \"pled guilty to providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\" According to an indictment unsealed on November 2, 2010, San Diego residents Basaaly Saeed Moalin, Mohamed Mohamed Mohamud, and Issa Doreh conspired to provide material support to al-Shabaab. The indictment states that Moalin received a request for financial support from one of al-Shabaab's military leaders in December 2007 and subsequently worked with Mohamud and Doreh to fill the request. In a separate indictment unsealed on December 3, 2010, Anaheim resident Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud was tied to the scheme. The quartet was convicted of material support in February 2013. Barry Bujol: According to DOJ, Bujol, a U.S. citizen living in Texas, allegedly attempted to provide money, pre-paid telephone calling cards, and global positioning system receivers (among other items), to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula after he had communicated with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. He was arrested on May 30, 2010. In November 2011, he was convicted of attempting to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization as well as aggravated identity theft. Khalid Quazzani: On May 19, 2010, Quazzani, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Morocco and living in Kansas City, Missouri, pled guilty to participating in a material support scheme that provided more than $23,000 to Al Qaeda. Syed Hashmi: A Pakistan-born U.S. citizen, Hashmi pled guilty to material support charges on April 27, 2010. He admitted that while he was a graduate student in London, he allowed a roommate to store in his apartment ponchos, sleeping bags, and waterproof socks destined for Al Qaeda. Hashmi also loaned the individual $300 to travel to Waziristan, Pakistan, to deliver the goods. Raja Lahrasib Khan: On March 25, 2010, Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, was charged with providing material support (in the form of money) to Al Qaeda. The criminal complaint alleges that Khan accepted $1,000 from an undercover agent and assured him that the money would be used to purchase weapons and possibly other supplies.

The government claims that they gathered equipment, including tactical-brand flashlights and combat boots. The pair also purportedly saved over $7,000 to fund their foreign violent jihad. The criminal complaint describes how the two discussed violent jihad and downloaded jihadist rhetoric. For example, Almonte is said to have kept a lecture by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki on his cell phone. The U.S. government contends that Alessa viewed a video including scenes of Al-Qaeda spokesperson Adam Gadahn praising Nidal Hasan, the alleged Fort Hood shooter. Also, according to the criminal complaint, Almonte possessed computer files of violent jihadist documents authored by Osama Bin Laden and his second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri. For the government, Alessa and Almonte's transformation from radicals to terrorists likely culminated when the two allegedly booked reservations for separate flights to Egypt scheduled for June 5, 2010.

Preventing future terrorist attacks likely requires effective domestic intelligence collection that is best accomplished by local authorities.", "Integrating state, local, and tribal law enforcement into the national counterterrorism effort continues to be an abiding concern of policymakers. After the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission) cited breakdowns in information sharing and the failure to fuse pertinent intelligence (i.e., \"connecting the dots\") as key factors in the failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks several efforts were made to improve the sharing of terrorism information between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies: ", "States and major urban areas established intelligence fusion centers. Congress has defined fusion centers as a \"collaborative effort of two or more Federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies that combines resources, expertise, or information with the goal of maximizing the ability of such agencies to detect, prevent, investigate, apprehend, and respond to criminal or terrorist activity.\" By 2013, there were 78 federally recognized fusion centers. In the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ( P.L. 108-458 ), Congress mandated the creation of an Information Sharing Environment (commonly known as the \"ISE\") to provide and facilitate the means of sharing terrorism information among all appropriate federal, state, local, and tribal entities, and the private sector through the use of policy guidelines and technologies. Congress made information sharing a priority of the new intelligence structure in DHS, requiring it \"to disseminate, as appropriate, information analyzed by the Department within the Department, to other agencies of the Federal government with responsibilities related to homeland security, and to agencies of State and local government and private sector entities, with such responsibilities in order to assist in the deterrence, prevention, preemption of, or response to, terrorist attacks against the United States.\" Congress mandated that DHS support fusion centers in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-53 ) .

It is a standardized, integrated approach to gathering, documenting, processing, analyzing, and sharing information about suspicious activity that is potentially terrorism-related while protecting the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.

In agent provocateur cases\u2014often called sting operations\u2014government undercover operatives befriend suspects and offer to facilitate their activities. As the \"Al Capone,\" moniker suggests, historically, these tactics have been employed against many types of targets such as mafia bosses, white-collar criminals, and corrupt public servants. While these techniques combined with the cultivation of informants as well as surveillance (especially in and around mosques) may be effective in stymieing rapidly developing terrorist plots, their use has fostered concern within U.S. Muslim communities.

This approach fits within a preventative mode of counterterrorism prosecution and has received media scrutiny. Experts have noted that immediately after 9/11, DOJ often leveled lesser charges against terrorist suspects to preemptively squelch potential attacks. However, according to the Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law, DOJ has moved toward trying suspected terrorists as terrorists instead of leaning heavily on lesser charges. In 2001 and 2002, 8% of defendants labeled as terrorists in the media were charged under terrorism statutes, this figure rose to 47% by 2006 and 2007. Regardless, the Capone approach is still used in terrorism cases.", "Lying to an FBI Special Agent is one of the violations reminiscent of the Capone approach. A recent example stands out. On July 21, 2010, Paul Rockwood, Jr., a U.S. citizen and Muslim convert, pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI. Rockwood's wife, Nadia Rockwood, also pled guilty to making false statements related to her husband's case. By early 2010, while living in King Salmon, Alaska, Paul Rockwood had developed a list of 15 people he planned to kill, believing that they had desecrated Islam. He had also researched explosives and shared with others ideas about mail bombs or using firearms to kill his targets. It appears that prosecutors could not pursue a case based on more substantive terrorism charges and opted to neutralize a threat\u2014someone apparently preparing to kill people\u2014by using the Capone approach.", "The utility of this preventative technique coupled with actual terrorism charges was exhibited by the FBI in its case against Najibullah Zazi. As mentioned above, Zazi arrived in New York on September 10, 2009, with explosive material and plans to detonate bombs in New York's subway system. Zazi feared authorities had caught up to him and returned to Denver on September 12. Between September 10 and 19, the FBI monitored his activities and bolstered its case with searches of a vehicle and locations linked to him in New York and Denver. Zazi also agreed to interviews with the FBI in Denver. On September 19, Special Agents first arrested Zazi in Aurora, Colorado, for knowingly and willfully lying to the FBI. Presumably this was done because he might flee. Four days later, a grand jury returned a more substantive one-count indictment against him on weapons of mass destruction charges. ", "DOJ used similar charges against Ahmad Wais Afzali, an imam from Queens. He was arrested for tipping off Zazi to the FBI's investigation. On March 4, 2010, Afzali pled guilty to lying to federal officials. He admitted that he warned Zazi that the FBI had asked about him. Afzali also stated that during the phone conversation he simply cautioned Zazi not to \"get involved in Afghanistan garbage.\" He stated in court that he misled the FBI about a telephone conversation he had with Zazi. Afzali claimed that by lying to investigators he had hoped to protect himself, not Zazi. Afzali had been a source of information for federal and New York City investigators in the past. ", "In another instance of the Capone approach, in 2008 the federal government charged Tarek Mehanna for lying to FBI agents regarding his relationship to Daniel Maldonado, subsequently convicted and jailed for terrorism-related offenses. Mehanna's 2008 arrest occurred at Boston's Logan International Airport as he was preparing to leave the country, according to news reports. He was subsequently released on bail. His defense attorney claimed that the FBI wanted Mehanna to become an informant, and his refusal precipitated his 2009 indictment and re-arrest on terrorism charges.

On November 26, 2010, Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to set off what he believed was a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. Mohamud thought he had plotted with terrorists to detonate the bomb. In actuality the device was a dud assembled by his co-conspirators, FBI undercover operatives. Mohamud offered the target for the strike, provided components for assembly of the device, gave instructions for the operation, and mailed passport photographs for his getaway plan to FBI undercover operatives.

On May 26, 2010, he pled guilty to one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Smadi's apprehension resulted from an FBI operation including at least three undercover employees. The operation duped Smadi into believing he was planning an attack with Al Qaeda operatives. It ended with Smadi driving a truck he believed to contain a live bomb into the underground garage of 60-story Fountain Place in Dallas, Texas. He used a cell phone to try and trigger the dud. ", "The same day of Smadi's arrest, the FBI apprehended Michael C. Finton in Springfield, IL, on similar but unrelated charges. Finton's case also relied heavily on undercover FBI personnel. Allegedly they supplied him with a van Finton believed contained almost one ton of high explosives. According to the DOJ, he drove and parked the van near the Paul Findley Federal Building and Courthouse in downtown Springfield. FBI Special Agents arrested Finton after he tried to detonate the bogus bomb using a cell phone.", "Initially, the FBI appears to have just tracked the activities of Finton and Smadi. How Mohamud's case played out is less certain, based on publicly available information. However, the investigations\u2014particularly the Finton and Smadi cases\u2014likely reached tipping points encouraging the Bureau to initiate much more proactive agent provocateur-type operations. Finton had converted to Islam while in prison on aggravated robbery and battery charges. According to court documents, he was released in 2006 but in 2007 was re-arrested and returned to prison because of a parole violation. At the time, a search of Finton's vehicle revealed passages he wrote that championed martyrdom as well as attempted correspondence with John Walker Lindh, a U.S. citizen who pled guilty in federal court to serving in the Taliban army and carrying weapons. In 2008, after Finton was released from prison for his parole violation, members of the FBI's Springfield JTTF interviewed him. The JTTF also used an informant to monitor Finton, who engaged in radical rhetoric after his release. In January 2009, the informant reported that Finton planned to travel to the Gaza strip to fight Israelis. At this juncture in the investigation, the FBI allegedly initiated its agent provocateur strategy to nab Finton. ", "The tipping point in the Smadi investigation is a little less specific. He allegedly had come to the agency's attention because the jihadist sentiment he displayed among an online group of extremists supposedly \"stood out.\" Investigators claim Smadi exhibited \"vehement intention to conduct terror attacks in the United States and ... zealous devotion to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda.\" As a result, an FBI undercover employee communicated with Smadi. More than 10 exchanges between the two emphasized Smadi's desire to conduct violent jihad on behalf of Al Qaeda. Thus, the FBI determined he was a \"legitimate threat,\" introduced him to another undercover employee who posed as a senior member of an Al Qaeda sleeper cell, and ostensibly set the sting in motion.", "The tipping point in the Mohamud investigation is even less clear due to ambiguity in the publicly available information regarding the timeline of the case. At some point, someone from the local Muslim community alerted the FBI to Mohamud, a 19-year-old Somali-born naturalized U.S. citizen. Media reports have suggested that a family member, perhaps Mohamud's father, relayed concerns about the young man to officials. According to DOJ, in December 2009 Mohamud communicated with an individual the U.S. government believed to be a terrorist located in Pakistan. The duo allegedly discussed Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to prepare for violent jihad. After Mohamud was not allowed to board a flight from Portland to Kodiak, Alaska, on June 14, 2010, the FBI interviewed him. He purportedly told the FBI that he planned to take a fishing job in Alaska for the summer and that he had previously wanted to travel to Yemen but had neither purchased tickets nor obtained a visa. According to court documents, shortly thereafter, on June 23, an FBI undercover employee professing to be an associate of the Pakistan-based terrorist emailed Mohamud. It is unclear whether or not Mohamud's attempt to travel to Alaska and his interview precipitated the undercover operation.", "Court documents in the Smadi, Finton, and Mohamud cases allege that FBI undercover employees tested the suspects to ascertain the depth of their intent to do harm. The FBI evaluated Mohamud's resolve on a number of occasions. Two stand out. Mohamud's first meeting with an undercover FBI operative entailed a discussion in which the would-be violent jihadist was told that he could help \"the cause\" in \"a number of ways \u2026 ranging from simply praying five times a day to becoming a martyr.\" The young man responded, saying that he wanted to become \"operational\" and needed help in staging an attack. When in a following meeting Mohamud suggested the Christmas tree lighting ceremony as his intended target, an FBI undercover employee noted that children attend such events. Mohamud responded by saying that he wanted a large crowd \"that will ... be attacked in their own element with their families celebrating the holidays.\"", "In the Smadi and Finton cases, the suspects received reassurances that if they quit the schemes, they would face no repercussions from their fellow (sham) plotters. FBI undercover operatives repeatedly tried to discourage Smadi's violent jihadist sentiments. In July 2009, an undercover employee (the fictitious senior member of an Al Qaeda sleeper cell), offered Smadi a way out of the plot. The mock Al Qaeda operative counseled Smadi by saying that different types of jihad existed, and he did not have to follow through on the plot if he was uncomfortable with it. He reassured Smadi by stressing that if he backed out, he would remain part of Al Qaeda's \"brotherhood.\" Regardless, Smadi steadfastly believed in the plot and refused to quit. Like Smadi, Finton was given at least one opportunity to abandon his scheme.

Another unplanned result: government loses legitimacy and support in the eyes of targeted communities, if they feel they have been manipulated.", "Acknowledging the challenge, then-FBI Director Robert Mueller said in 2009, \"Oftentimes, the communities from which we need the most help are those who trust us the least. But it is in these communities that we ... must redouble our efforts.\" Then-FBI spokesman John Miller has said the agency values its relationships with Muslims and has worked hard on outreach efforts that range from town hall meetings to diversity training for FBI agents. Miller said there is no factual basis for claims the FBI infiltrates mosques or conducts blanket surveillance of Muslim leaders. \"Based on information of a threat of violence or a crime, we investigate individuals, and those investigations may take us to the places those individual go.\" ", "Former FBI agents and federal prosecutors note that informants are \"still one of the government's best weapons to thwart terrorists and that the benefit to national security is likely to far outweigh any embarrassment to the agency.\" They claim that \"although the law places almost no constraints on the use of informants, the agency takes sending an informant into a mosque very seriously and imposes a higher threshold for such requests.\" Former FBI counterterrorism chief Robert Blitzer states that \"What matters to the FBI is preventing a massive attack that might be planned by some people ... using the mosque or church as a shield because they believe they're safe there. That is what the American people want the FBI to do.

Many of these challenges revolve around balancing security and liberty. These challenges focus on the ability of government officials to develop policies and programs that address terrorism both publicly in the marketplace of ideas and secretively in the realm of counterterrorism investigations. Depending on local communities to provide critical information to further proactive policing while simultaneously building trust and preserving the freedoms of community members is seen as difficult within this context. Law enforcement investigative tactics may pose particular complications in community engagement. Especially challenging are policing efforts perceived by community members to be unfairly targeting law-abiding citizens or infringing on speech, religion, assembly, or due process rights. ", "The use of informants\u2014essential to many law enforcement investigations\u2014is one technique that may pose obstacles when police officials attempt to engage the same populations their agencies investigate. For example, some Muslim community activists fear that law enforcement coerces immigrants into becoming informants, especially those with legal problems or those applying for green cards. Others fear that informants target and potentially entice impressionable youth into fictitious terrorist plots. There has also been public discussion of the trustworthiness of informants with criminal backgrounds. In considering the tradeoff between security and liberty, policy makers face a key judgment call in cases when investigative tactics might inflame members of a particular community. Will the controversy surrounding an investigative tactic outweigh its usefulness in bringing terrorists to justice?", "In Appendix A that follows, details about each of the post-9/11 homegrown jihadist plots and attacks are provided in reverse chronological order.

As reported, the 58-year-old avionics technician and U.S. citizen worked at the airport. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI, the Bureau) case on the would-be bomber began in the early summer of 2013. It evolved into a sting operation culminating in Loewen's failed attempt to drive what he thought was a functional car bomb into a secure area of the airport and detonate the explosive while still in the vehicle. ", "The plot started with an online interchange. It is unclear if and when he became a Muslim, but DOJ asserts that by the summer of 2013, the would-be terrorist was conversing online with an FBI undercover employee about violent jihad. Investigators claim that Loewen believed that this acquaintance was an individual tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). According to the criminal complaint in the case, in October 2013, Loewen sent his ersatz friend \"photographs of his airport access badge, entrance gates to the tarmac, and the devices used to access the gates.\" Loewen also allegedly claimed that Osama Bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki were \"a great inspiration\" to him and that he had read significant screeds related to violent jihad. The pen pals began fleshing out details for an attack at the airport and also worked through at least one misgiving Loewen had\u2014the killing of children. Loewen's online companion eventually placed him in direct contact with another FBI undercover employee who posed as a member of AQAP.

Sheikh, a Pakistani immigrant, lawful permanent resident of the United States, and 29 years old at the time of his arrest, resided in Cary, NC. He reputedly used Facebook accounts to post material related to violent jihad and to contact sympathizers. Via his online activity, he purportedly came into contact with an informant working for the FBI. DOJ has stated that the informant steered Sheikh toward an individual online who claimed to be affiliated with the Nusra Front. In reality, this person was an FBI online covert employee who appears to have played a central role in the sting operation that ended up nabbing him. ", "Reportedly, Sheikh had tried to travel to Syria in 2012, getting as far as nearby Turkey, where he grew disillusioned by what he saw as the materialism of some of the revolutionaries confronting the Asad regime and returned home. He also booked a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, in September 2013, but did not go to the airport. Sheikh had grown worried, because he could not reach his reputed contact in Turkey.

The indictment leveled against Nguyen charged him with making a false statement on a passport application and providing material support to a terrorist organization. In December 2013, Nguyen pled guilty to the latter. Authorities allegedly apprehended him in Santa Ana, CA, as he \"prepared to board a bus for Mexico with plane tickets to Pakistan,\" where he hoped to train terrorists. Additionally, Nguyen admitted to prosecutors that during 2012 he was involved in the conflict between rebel groups and the Bashar al Asad Regime in Syria. It is unclear for whom he fought\u2014it may have been the Free Syrian Army.

As a result, Bell was charged \"with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to terrorists.\" Bell is from Jacksonville, Florida, and was 19 years old when his indictment was made public in July 2013. Reportedly, he had been in jail since January 2013 on charges of grand theft and organized fraud. It is not clear whether these charges stem from a sham business he allegedly ran to help fund his plot. It is also unclear what caused the FBI to start its case on Bell. According to media sources, in 2012, leaders from a Jacksonville mosque contacted the FBI when they discovered that Bell may have been talking about violent jihad with the son of a congregant. Reputedly, Bell, who is said to have converted to Islam, attended prayers at the mosque but was not a member.", "DOJ claims that Bell spent much of 2012 preparing to become a foreign fighter.

They claimed the lives of three individuals and injured more than 200 people. The alleged perpetrators were Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (respectively ages 26 and 19 on the day of the bombing). Prior to the bombing, the ethnic Chechen duo lived for several years in the Boston area, primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tamerlan died after the duo, using firearms and explosives, reportedly battled law enforcement officers in the early morning hours of April 19. Authorities arrested Dzhokhar in the evening of April 19, 2013. In June 2013, he was charged \"with the use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and conspiracy; bombing of a place of public use resulting in death and conspiracy; malicious destruction of property resulting in death and conspiracy; use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence causing death; carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury; interference with commerce by threats or violence; and aiding and abetting.\" ", "In a criminal complaint and an indictment, DOJ has identified Tamerlan and Dzhokhar as the bombers who set off the explosions at the Boston Marathon. Some media outlets have reported that the brothers may have initially planned to attack the festivities marking Independence Day (the 4 th of July) in Boston. According to unnamed officials quoted in press reports, the duo moved up the date of their attack and targeted the Marathon, because they completed building their explosive devices sooner than they had initially planned. They also purportedly chose not to use suicide as a tactic in the Marathon bombing. Dzhokhar reportedly indicated to authorities that the brothers selected the Marathon as a target only one or two days prior to the event.", "In the aftermath of the bombing, on April 18, the FBI released video and still images of two individuals that the Bureau suspected were the bombers. Dzhokhar reputedly indicated to authorities that once the brothers realized that these were images of them, they decided to travel to New York City's Times Square to detonate the remaining explosive devices they had made. According to DOJ, at about 10:00 PM on April 18, the brothers armed themselves with a semiautomatic handgun, five explosive devices, a machete, and a hunting knife. Late in the evening of April 18, the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly killed an on-duty police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That night, the duo also supposedly carjacked a sport utility vehicle (SUV) in the Boston neighborhood of Brighton. Wielding a handgun, Tamerlan reportedly threatened the driver of the SUV and ordered him to drive as Dzhokhar trailed in another vehicle. Tamerlan and his captive are said to have eventually picked up Dzhokhar. The two alleged bombers appear to have discussed going to New York City, used the victim's automated teller machine card to withdraw money, and purchased gasoline for the SUV in nearby Cambridge. According to the hostage's own account, at this point\u2014after 90 minutes under the control of the Tsarnaevs\u2014the hostage escaped and called police. The Tsarnaevs' hostage had left his cellphone in the vehicle, however. ", "Purportedly, authorities used the carjacking victim's cellphone to determine that the brothers were in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. Early in the morning of April 19, a local police officer identified the brothers driving the stolen SUV and another car. The brothers and law enforcement officials quickly became embroiled in a gunfight. The Tsarnaevs lobbed explosive devices during the incident, which claimed Tamerlan's life and led to the wounding of a transit police officer. Dzhokhar reportedly got away in the stolen SUV, quickly abandoned it, and fled on foot. Police found unexploded bombs at the site of the confrontation. The younger Tsarnaev brother was discovered on the evening of the 19 th hiding in a boat parked in a residential neighborhood in Watertown. Law enforcement officers opened fire on the boat and apprehended Dzhokhar. At the time of his arrest, he had gunshot wounds to \"the head, neck, legs, and hand.\"", "Allegedly, some of the bombs used by the brothers were assembled in the Cambridge apartment that Tamerlan shared with his daughter and his wife, Katherine Russell. Reportedly, some of these explosive devices were built out of pressure cookers. Media reports have suggested that jihadist material has been found on a computer belonging to Russell. She has not been charged in the bombing case. It is unclear if she shared the computer with Tamerlan. ", "Dzhokhar reputedly admitted to law enforcement officials that he and his brother had relied on the English language violent jihadist magazine, Inspire , for bomb-making instructions. One month prior to the Marathon bombing, Inspire published its \"Lone Mujahid Pocketbook,\" a guide that included directions for assembling a pressure cooker bomb using explosives gleaned from fireworks. DOJ claims that Dzhokhar had downloaded a copy of Inspire's first volume from 2010 that also included instructions for assembling a bomb with components including a pressure cooker. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have noted that such devices \"contain[ing] the initiator, switch, and explosive charge frequently have been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan.\"", "At least four additional people have been linked to this case. Two men, 19 years old at the time of their arrests, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov , \"both of New Bedford [Massachusetts], were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by conspiring to destroy, conceal, and cover up tangible objects belonging to suspected marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\" Robel Phillipos , from Cambridge and also 19 at the time of his arrest, was charged with \"willfully making materially false statements to federal law enforcement officials during a terrorism investigation.\" Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are citizens of Kazakhstan. They were visiting the United States on student visas when arrested. Phillipos is a U.S. citizen. The three and Dzhokhar were friends while attending the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.

DOJ argues that Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov also \"admitted that they agreed to get rid of [the backpack] after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.\" The backpack, which DOJ asserts Kadyrbayev threw out, contained fireworks that had been \"opened and emptied of powder.\" In the room, Dzhokhar's friends also purportedly found a jar of Vaseline that they thought might have been used in bomb making. According to DOJ, a month before the bombing, Dzhokhar had told Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov that he knew how to fashion an explosive device. On April 26, law enforcement agents found the backpack (including the emptied fireworks and jar of Vaseline) in a landfill in New Bedford.

The FBI claims that Todashev initiated the violent confrontation. Media reports have described Todashev as a Chechen immigrant who had been granted political asylum in the United States. These reports have speculated that he was tied to an illegal drug-related triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 2011, alleging that just before he was killed, Todashev may have implicated Tamerlan in the Waltham crime.", "Based on publicly available sources, prior to 2011, the Tsarnaev brothers had not come to law enforcement attention. In 2011, at the request of the Russian government, both the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) examined the backgrounds of Tamerlan and his mother, Zubeidat. The FBI claims that the Russian request indicated that Tamerlan \"was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups.\"", "The FBI responded to the Russian request by opening an assessment on Tamerlan and his mother. A Customs and Border Protection officer detailed to the Boston Joint Terrorism Taskforce (JTTF) also added Tamerlan's identity to the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS). This process would potentially alert customs officials and law enforcement about Tamerlan's international travel. Additionally, Tamerlan's identity entered the FBI's Guardian threat tracking system\u2014a classified tool used by the FBI to store information about terrorism-related suspicious activity.", "As part of its assessment, the Bureau allegedly interviewed Tamerlan (as well as other family members), visited the community college Tamerlan attended, and checked databases for information about possible links he or his mother had to terrorists. The FBI found no such ties. Investigators also reputedly conducted surveillance of the Tsarnaev apartment in Cambridge. By June 2011, the Bureau closed its assessment. In August 2011, the FBI provided the assessment's results to the Russian government. The Bureau also asked the Russian government for more details but purportedly received nothing else. In congressional testimony, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis claimed that the FBI did not share the fact that they investigated Tsarnaev with the Boston Police Department. It is unclear what impact, if any, such sharing may have had on subsequent events.", "In September 2011, the Russian government also provided the CIA with the same information on Tamerlan and his mother that it had given to the FBI. The CIA turned over this information to the National Counterterrorism Center, and in October 2011, Tamerlan and his mother were added to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the U.S. government's \"central repository of information on international terrorist identities.\" The names were also entered into the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). Administered by the FBI, this database contains the names of foreign and domestic \"individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism.\" It is used as the basis for narrower screening processes, including the No Fly and Selectee lists used by the Transportation Security Administration for air passenger screening. It appears that neither Tamerlan nor his mother was included in any other lists aside from TIDE, the TSDB, and TECS.", "In January 2012, Tamerlan traveled to Russia. While there, he allegedly visited the Russian Republic of Dagestan. Reportedly, three days prior to his flight from the United States to Russia, the TECS system\u2014as it is designed to do\u2014notified the FBI that Tamerlan was set to travel. However, a second designed follow-up notification meant to alert authorities the day of travel failed to happen, possibly because of a misspelling of his name by an airline employee that occurred as Tsarnaev checked in for his flight. When Tamerlan returned to the United States in July 2012, the Boston JTTF received a TECS notification, but this information was not widely shared within the JTTF.", "It is unclear exactly when, why, or how Tamerlan and Dzhokhar may have radicalized. There is the possibility that one or both of the brothers had contact or ties to foreign terrorists. However, U.S. officials, including President Obama, have suggested that the Tsarnaev brothers radicalized on their own. At the very least, Dzhokhar radicalized in the United States. Unlike his brother, he did not travel abroad in 2012. ", "The brothers may have been motivated by U.S. military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. A note allegedly left by Dzhokhar in the boat where he was captured appears to support this claim.

Shortly after Harroun's return to the United States, the FBI reportedly took the 30-year-old U.S. citizen, self-described convert to Islam, and former U.S. Army soldier into custody. He was indicted in June 2013 for conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiracy to use destructive devices overseas.", "It appears that in building its case, the FBI relied on Harroun's own portrayals of what he did while in Syria. According to DOJ, before his arrest, Harroun voluntarily submitted to an FBI interview at a hotel in northern Virginia. During it, he allegedly admitted to being part of a Nusra \"RPG team\" and engaging in combat. Prior to his meeting with the FBI in Virginia, Harroun also voluntarily participated in three interviews with the Bureau at the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. During the sessions in Turkey, he allegedly claimed to have initially fought with the Free Syrian Army (a Syrian opposition group), only falling in with the Nusra Front after he, his Free Syrian Army comrades, and a band of Nusra fighters engaged in a skirmish against Syrian regime forces. Additionally, the FBI searched Harroun's Facebook account in March 2013. The Bureau states that it found photographs of him holding RPGs and other weapons.

At the time, Wilson resided in Mobile and Abukhdair was in Egypt. (Abukhdair had moved to Egypt in 2007 to study Arabic.) DOJ claims that both had ties to suspected terrorists prior to meeting. Allegedly, Wilson knew Omar Hammami, and Egyptian officials ended up arresting Abukhdair on terrorism charges in 2010. Egyptian authorities kept him in prison for two months and then deported him to the United States in early 2011. He moved to Mobile in October 2011 and lived with Wilson and his family. It is unclear whether Abukhdair radicalized in the United States or abroad or how his experience in an Egyptian prison shaped his outlook. The criminal complaint describes one conversation in which the plotters discussed attacking targets in the United States, however, it appears that their scheme almost completely revolved around joining a foreign terrorist group.

David Kris, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, reported that \"The Criminal complaint alleges that Hosam Smadi sought and attempted to bomb the Fountain Place office tower, but a coordinated undercover law enforcement action was able to thwart his efforts and ensure no one was harmed.\" Undercover FBI agents, posing as members of an Al Qaeda \"sleeper cell\" were introduced to Smadi, who repeatedly indicated to them that he came to the U.S. for the specific purpose of committing \"Jihad for the sake of God.\" Smadi clarified that he was interested in \"self-jihad\" because it was \"the best type of jihad.\" The investigation determined Smadi was not associated with other terrorist organizations.", "DOJ also claims that \"undercover FBI agents repeatedly encouraged Smadi to reevaluate his interpretation of jihad, counseling him that the obligation of jihad can be satisfied in many ways. Every time this interaction occurred, Smadi aggressively responded that he was going to commit significant, conspicuous acts of violence as his jihad.\"", "In late August 2009, while meeting with one of the undercover FBI agents in Dallas, authorities allege that", "Smadi discussed the logistics and timing of the bombing, stating that he would have preferred to do the attack on \"11 September,\" but decided to wait until after the month of Ramadan, which ended on September 20, 2009. At the conclusion of the meeting, Smadi decided that a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) would be placed at the foundation of the Fountain Place office tower. Unbeknownst to Smadi, the FBI ensured the VBIED contained only an inert/inactive explosive device which contained no explosive materials.", "Tom Leppert, Dallas mayor at the time of the plot, said local authorities were notified of the operation before it happened. \"We were clearly communicated to that there was not going to be danger to anybody.\"", "On May 26, 2010, Smadi pled guilty to one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

Prosecutors say he parked and locked the vehicle, then moved a few blocks away before twice making cell phone calls he believed would trigger a blast that would kill or injure people inside the building. In May 2011, he pled guilty to attempting to bomb the building and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.", "Finton reportedly had converted to Islam while in an Illinois prison from 2001 to 2006, serving a sentence for aggravated robbery and aggravated battery. He came to the attention of federal authorities in August 2007 when a search of his vehicle turned up a letter about his dreams of being a shahid , or martyr.", "According to the affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint, \"after his arrest it was discovered that Finton had written a letter to John Walker Lindh, an American who was captured fighting for the Taliban and is imprisoned on terrorism violations. In a January 2008 interview with the FBI after his release from prison on a parole violation, Finton allegedly explained that he idolized Lindh. The affidavit further alleges that, in March 2008, Finton received funds from an individual in Saudi Arabia that he used to travel to Saudi Arabia the following month. He returned to the United States in May 2008.\"", "In February 2009, an FBI special agent posing as a member of Al Qaeda was introduced to Finton. The affidavit alleges that in the ensuing months, Finton discussed possibly targeting locations in the United States and ultimately suggested the Paul Findley Federal Building and Courthouse in downtown Springfield as a primary target. He conducted surveillance of the building and proposed a remotely detonated car bomb for the attack. Further, according to the affidavit, Finton observed that U.S. Congressman Aaron Schock's office, located at the corner of East Monroe and 6 th Streets, would be a secondary target.\"", "On September 1, 2009, Finton met with the undercover FBI officer and was told that the vehicle for the attack would be carrying close to one ton of explosives.

Zazi told investigators that he and two friends planned to strap explosives to their bodies, board trains at the Grand Central and Times Square stations\u2014two of the busiest in New York City\u2014and explode their bombs during the crowded rush hour.", "On February 22, 2010, Zazi pled guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder overseas, and providing material support for a terrorist organization. There is no complete picture of Zazi's radicalization process, but there are details regarding his plot. In his youth, he may have listened to the radical messages of Saifur Rahman Halimi\u2014an Imam who advocated jihad, attended the same mosque as Zazi's family, and lived in the same Queens building. Zazi has admitted that he and others agreed to travel to Afghanistan to join Taliban forces. In August 2008, he and his accomplices flew from Newark to Peshawar, Pakistan, and instead of training with the Taliban, Al Qaeda recruited and trained them in the Waziristan region of Pakistan. Al Qaeda asked Zazi and his companions to return to the United States and engage in suicide operations.", "While training, Zazi received instruction on explosives, discussed specific targets, and took detailed notes. He returned to the United States in January 2009 and moved to Colorado, taking a job driving a shuttle bus at Denver International Airport. Between July and early September, he and accomplices purchased chemicals at beauty supply stores in Denver. Investigators suggest that Zazi used the same hotel suite twice to try and produce bomb-making chemicals using handwritten bomb making notes developed while in Pakistan to guide his production of triacetone triperoxide (TATP). He even supposedly contacted an individual for production guidance. In the hotel's ventilation system, the FBI gathered residue from the chemicals Zazi had heated. Beauty store surveillance footage also recorded Zazi's activities. He also searched the website of a Queens store that carried muriatic acid, which can be used to develop TATP.", "On September 8, 2009, Zazi rented a car and departed for New York the next day. Upon arriving in New York City on September 10, Zazi's car was stopped by Port Authority of New York Police at the behest of the FBI as he crossed the George Washington Bridge. It has been reported that to avoid tipping him off, the police pretended the stop was a random drug checkpoint. Authorities initially stated that they found nothing incriminating. However, court papers indicated that law enforcement subsequently found a laptop in the car containing an image of nine pages of handwritten notes on how to make and handle bombs. When FBI agents interviewed Zazi, he claimed that he drove to New York from Aurora, Colorado, to deal with an issue involving a coffee cart business his family operated in Manhattan. He then falsely stated he had never seen the notes. Zazi has subsequently admitted that he planned to finish bomb construction over the September 12-13 weekend, and then target New York's subway lines on September 14, 15, or 16. However, when he suspected that the police were on to him, he claimed he shut down the operation.", "During this time, the NYPD was showing Zazi's photograph to people in his old neighborhoods in Queens and, at one point, the police towed Zazi's car. The New York Times reported that with their interest exposed, \"law enforcement agents feared that some part of a plot they had not yet uncovered might be aborted and evidence destroyed.

In an eight-count superseding indictment unsealed on November 29, 2010, he was also charged with obstruction of justice, witness tampering, making false statements, and visa fraud. In July 2011, the elder Zazi was found guilty in federal court on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and one count of obstruction of justice. Ahmad Wais Afzali , a Queens Imam, was arrested for informing Zazi of the FBI investigation. Afzali had been a source of information for federal and New York City investigators in the past. On March 4, 2010, Afzali, pled guilty to lying to federal officials. He stated in court that he lied about a conversation he had with Zazi tipping him off to the FBI's investigation. Afzali hoped to protect himself, not Zazi. Afzali claimed that during his phone conversation with Zazi, he simply cautioned him not to \"get involved in Afghanistan garbage.\" During sentencing on April 15, 2010, Afzali told the judge, \"Honest to God, it was never my intention to help those idiots for what they do in the name of Islam.\" On July 5, 2010, he left the United States as specified in his plea agreement. He may not return without special permission. Naqib Jaji , Zazi's uncle, was secretly arrested in the case. In 2010, he pled guilty to obstructing justice in the investigation.

That information has reportedly helped U.S. forces target Al Qaeda camps with drone attacks and understand how Al Qaeda provides its members with training in assassinations, poison, kidnappings, forgery, and advanced bomb-making.

That led federal and local authorities in the New York region to launch a 16-month sting operation focused on the activities of Defreitas. According to the complaint filed in the case, Defreitas conducted surveillance of the airport four times in January, focusing on fuel tanks, noting security precautions and reviewing an escape plan.", "Defreitas was apparently unaware that one of the plotters with him much of the time was a law enforcement informant who recorded much of what he said.

The government informant is a longtime New York City drug trafficker who began cooperating with federal investigators after NYPD detectives arrested him on a Bronx street and charged him with possession of about $2 million in cocaine.

His words were 'all sizzle and no steak.'\" After five days of deliberation, however, the jury convicted both men of five counts of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism.", "In June 2010, Nur pled guilty to providing material support to terrorism.

Four received life sentences without parole and the other received a 33-year sentence. A sixth man pled guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. As far as is known, the group had no connection to any foreign terrorist organization.", "The arrests were made after a 16-month FBI operation that included infiltrating the group. The investigation began in January 2006 with a tip from an electronics store clerk in Mount Laurel, Pennsylvania. Two men dropped off an 8-millimeter tape and wanted it converted to a DVD. The tape showed the defendants firing rifles and shouting Islamic battle cries. The clerk called police.

The indictment states that the weapons used were an SKS semi-automatic rifle, a Beretta Storm semi-automatic rifle, a Mossberg 12-gauge pump and a 9mm Beretta handgun. These were all firearms that Abdullahu owned legally. However, it is a crime for illegal immigrants like the Duka brothers to possess guns.

Prior to his arrest, Shareef had plotted to set off hand grenades in a garbage can at the CherryVale Shopping Mall near Rockford on the Friday before Christmas 2006. Shareef was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against persons and property and with attempting to maliciously damage and destroy, by means of fire and an explosive, a building and real and personal property used in interstate commerce.", "The case began in September 2006, when the FBI assigned a cooperating witness, William \"Jamaal\" Chrisman, to befriend Shareef.

Hayat confessed to FBI agents that he had attended a terrorist training camp but his attorneys later argued that his admissions were fabrications intended to appease the federal agents he hoped would let him go home.

They were sentenced to 15 years in prison. Aref is a refugee from Iraqi Kurdistan and Hossain is an immigrant from Bangladesh who has lived in the United States for over two decades.", "The case was the result of a sting operation by the FBI which had been watching the Masjid As Salam since 2002 after one of its founders had been deported following the 9/11 attacks. The FBI had an undercover informant befriend Hossain, a member of the mosque who was reported to be having financial problems with his pizza business. The informant was a Pakistani immigrant facing a long prison sentence and deportation after he had pled guilty to one felony count of engaging in the production and transfer of false government identification documents. After a period of time, Hossain asked the informant for a loan. The informant proposed a scheme to launder through Hossain's pizza shop and real estate holdings the proceeds of the sale of a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile, which was purportedly to be used in a fictitious plot to assassinate Pakistan's United Nations envoy.", "According to court records, the Kurdish Imam, Yassan Aref, was not approached by the informant. Rather, Aref was enlisted by Hossain to witness the transactions under Muslim tradition. However, federal authorities admitted that Aref was the \"ultimate target\" of the sting operation. Two months after the sting began, American military forces found Aref's name and phone number in a notebook at a bombed out encampment in Iraq that the government contended was occupied by \"terrorists.\" The notebook was said to contain a reference in the Kurdish language to Aref as \"commander\" which led prosecutors to believe that Aref might be connected to the Ansar al-Islam terrorist group. It was also cited by the judge in the case as grounds for denying bail to the defendants.", "Later, however, federal prosecutors admitted to making an error and acknowledged that the word in question could be translated as \"brother,\" rather than \"commander.\" The U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York was quoted as saying that the translation discrepancy was not terribly significant. He said the heart of the case had to do with Mr. Aref's and Mr. Hossain's failure to turn away from the fake plot even after they knew the intentions of the government informer.", "Aref and Hossain were arrested on August 5, 2004, on a 19-count indictment charging them with money laundering. The government subsequently added more charges, including allegations the men conspired to provide material support to a Pakistani terrorist group.", "The case was not without controversy. Aref and Hossain maintained their innocence throughout their trials. Defense attorneys claimed the two were entrapped. Pakistan angrily protested to Washington over the FBI sting operation describing it as \"a bizarre mission.\" Albany's two main daily newspapers\u2014the Albany Times Union and the Schenectady Daily Gazette \u2014ran editorials at the time of the sentencing asking for extreme leniency. Two of the columnists who had followed the trial closely were also very critical of the prosecution. And several inmates at the Rensselaer County Jail, where Aref and Hossain were being held, wrote letters to the judge in the case vouching for the defendants' good character and benign influence.", "After the indictment, an article in The New York Times quoted government officials as saying that Aref's case resulted from evidence gathered by the warrantless National Security Agency domestic wiretapping program. On January 5, 2006, defense attorneys filed a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss the indictment as the fruit of illegal surveillance. The district court denied that motion in a sealed ex parte opinion based on a sealed ex parte submission by the government.

The station, near Madison Square Garden, is the third busiest in the city's transit system. The investigation was largely conducted by the NYPD's Intelligence Division which used a paid informant, Osama Eldawoody, an Egyptian-born nuclear engineer. Eldawoody testified that he volunteered to troll the city's mosques and Muslim communities out of patriotism and a desire to show that violent extremists are the exception rather than the rule in Islam. Prosecutors at the Siraj's trial played tapes secretly recorded by Eldawoody in which Siraj discusses the plot to bomb the subway station \"at length and with great zeal.\"", "James Elshafay immediately agreed to cooperate with the government and pled guilty to involvement in the plot. Elshafay testified against Siraj at the latter's trial. He acknowledged taking medication for depression and schizophrenia and described the delusions that landed him in a psychiatric ward just months before he conspired with Siraj to bomb the subway station. Elshafay was sentenced to five years in prison.", "Siraj rejected a plea agreement and went to trial. His attorneys argued that he was entrapped by the police informant, Osama Eldawoody. They also attacked the credibility of the informant on the grounds that he was paid a total of $100,000 by the police. However, prosecutors called an undercover detective who testified that he had had frequent conversations with Siraj long before he met Eldawoody. \"The conversations, the detective said, were filled with Mr. Siraj's approval of suicide bombings and Osama bin Laden.\" The jury rejected the defense argument of entrapment and convicted Siraj on four counts of conspiracy, including plotting to bomb a public transportation system.

Faris admitted to traveling to New York City in late 2002 to examine the bridge, and said he concluded that the plot to destroy the bridge by severing cables was unlikely to succeed because of the bridge's security and structure. In early 2003, he sent a message that \"the weather is too hot\"\u2014a coded message indicating that the bridge plot was unlikely to succeed. ", "He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.", "Time Magazine reports that government officials were led to Faris by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the high-ranking Al Qaeda operative and alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks who is in U.S. custody. Reportedly, after Mohammed's capture in Pakistan, agents discovered the coded, \"the weather is too hot\" email sent from the U.S. to one of his associates. The email was one of the factors that helped investigators pull Faris' name out of Mohammed during his interrogations by U.S. authorities. Faris was then secretly detained two weeks later. Faris acknowledged that he wrote the email and was referring to the impossibility of an Al Qaeda plot to bring down the sturdy, well-guarded Brooklyn Bridge by cutting its suspension cables.", "Sometime in March 2003, according to DOJ officials, FBI agents persuaded Faris to cooperate with the government.

Although the assassination and hijacking plots never got past the talking stage, it was alleged that between September 2002 and June 2003, Abu Ali had met with several unnamed co-conspirators, two of whom were later revealed to be leaders of an Al Qaeda cell in Medina\u2014 Sultan Jubran Sultan al-Qahtani , and Ali Abd al-Rahman al-Faq'asi al-Ghamdi . Among the discussions with the co-conspirators were \"options for assassinating President Bush: (1) an operation in which Abu Ali would get close enough to the President to shoot him on the street, and (2) an operation in which Abu Ali would detonate a car bomb.\" At trial, Abu Ali's attorneys countered that while in Saudi custody their client had been beaten and whipped repeatedly until he agreed to confess. But, the judge, jury, and appellate court rejected that argument. A juror said after the trial that Abu Ali's videotaped confession was \"chilling\" and showed no sign of coercion.", "Abu Ali was originally sentenced to 30 years in prison.

The men were accused of being part of a jihadist network whose objective was to wage holy war against nations deemed hostile to Islam.

The email referred to an upcoming \"big meal\" that authorities interpreted as a code for an impending terrorist attack. Additional intelligence information was later received that suggested the Lackawanna suspects were the targets of an Al Qaeda recruitment operation. In the tense atmosphere after the 9/11 attacks, this led to concerns that the group may be a sleeper cell.", "When the FBI learned that al-Bakri had traveled to Bahrain to get married, they asked authorities there to detain him. During an interview with an Arabic-speaking FBI agent, a-Bakri admitted to having attended Al Farooq camp and named the other members of the Lackawanna Six, who were then subsequently arrested on September 13, 2002.", "In their joint report, \"Chasing the Sleeper Cell,\" The New York Times and Public Broadcasting Service's (PBS's) Frontline summarized the disposition of the Lackawanna Six and others associated with the case:", "Sahim Alwan was a college-educated, married man with three children. After he arrived at Al Farooq camp, Alwan claimed he quickly had a change of heart and begged the camp authorities to let him return home. He was allowed to leave, but first was taken to a personal meeting with bin Laden, in which Al Qaeda's leader asked about the status of Muslims in the United States. He was also asked by a bin Laden associate to deliver two copies of a videotape showing the bombing of the USS Cole to a contact in Pakistan, which he did. After being confronted with information obtained from the arrest and interrogation of Mukhtar al-Bakri, Alwan confessed to the FBI and in April 2003, pled guilty to material support of terrorism. He was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. Yahya Goba did not grow up in Lackawanna. He was born in The Bronx, was raised for a while in Yemen, and moved to Western New York in the late 1996. In his March 2003 guilty plea, Goba admitted having trained to use firearms, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, as well as explosives. He also said that Osama bin Laden had spoken at the camp of men \"willing to become martyrs for the cause.\" In December 2003, Goba was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The group met in his apartment, where he reportedly told them that attacks on Muslims around the world obligate them to train for jihad to defend their Muslim brothers. Authorities believe that the trip by the group to Afghanistan grew out of religious discussions led by Derwish. He was reportedly killed in 2002 by a CIA Predator drone that was tracking Qaed Salim Sinan al Harethi, known as \"Abu Ali,\" and believed to be one of the planners of the USS Cole bombing. Juma Al Dosari is described as a Muslim fighter and itinerant Imam from Saudi Arabia, who is believed to have fought with Derwish in Bosnia. Upon his arrival in Lackawanna, the reportedly charismatic Al Dosari gave a sermon railing against Arab governments who do nothing while Muslims die on a daily basis. According to people in the community, the leaders of the Lackawanna mosque were so troubled by Al Dosari's militant tone that he was not invited back. Two weeks after the 9/11 attacks, Al Dosari left Lackawanna to fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was captured sometime in the fall of 2001 and declared an enemy combatant. He was subsequently sent to the special prison camp at the U.S. Naval Base on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His interrogation there led to the information that the Lackawanna Six were the targets of an Al Qaeda recruitment operation. In 2007, after five years of the detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he was released to Saudi Arabia, with no charges against him. Jaber A.

At the camp, Elbaneh told Alwan that he wanted to fight with the Taliban and was willing to become a martyr. He never returned to the U.S. after his trip to Afghanistan and eventually fled to Yemen. In May 2003, the U.S. government unsealed an indictment charging him with providing material support to Al Qaeda. The FBI also put him on its list of world's most wanted terrorism suspects.

This led to a legal confrontation between the Bush Administration and Padilla's attorneys as well as various civil liberties groups that lasted several years and reached all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The constitutional issues involved the extent to which the President, as commander-in-chief, has the authority to take extraordinary measures for the security of Americans even if those measures infringe on an accused citizen's access to legal counsel and relief from unlawful detention ( habeas corpus ).", "The government's initial suspicions about Padilla were based on information provided to interrogators by Abu Zubaydah , a senior official of Al Qaeda who was in American custody at an undisclosed location overseas. He did not name Mr. Padilla but described him physically and referred to him as a Latin American man who went by a Muslim name. Intelligence agents then were able to link the name given by Abu Zubaydah to \"an Arab alias not mentioned by the detainee.\" That \"alias\" led the agent to Mr. Padilla's Florida driver's license. The photo on that license was shown to \"a detainee,\" presumed to be Abu Zubaydah, who confirmed that Mr. Padilla was the \"Latin American\" he had been describing.", "Padilla remained in custody for one month after his arrest in May 2002 on a material witness warrant. But, Justice Department officials faced a deadline to release him pursuant to laws that protect U.S. citizens from indefinite detention. They were also confronted with the challenge of making a case against Padilla that would stand up in court without bringing Abu Zubaydah or other captured Al Qaeda officials into an American courtroom. Instead, on June 9, 2002, President George W. Bush approved Padilla's reclassification as an \"enemy combatant,\" which would not entitle him to trial in civilian courts. He was transferred after midnight to the brig of a South Carolina naval base, where he was held incommunicado, not even allowed visits from his attorney, for over 3-1/2 years, most of which was spent in solitary confinement.", "In announcing Padilla's May arrest, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft announced at a June 10, 2002, news conference, \"We have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb.\" He added that the government's suspicions about Padilla's plans came from \"multiple, independent, corroborating sources.\"", "But shortly thereafter, CBS News reported that FBI sources were \"backing off\" Ashcroft's assertion that there was a specific, developed, and real plan to use a \"dirty bomb\" in the United States.

The case was largely derived from statements made by Padilla himself while he was interrogated in military custody, but which Comey claimed was substantiated by other sources. At the news conference, Comey traced Padilla's travel through Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. He identified Al Qaeda officials he met, which included not only Abu Zubaydah, but Al Qaeda military commander Mohammed Atef and 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. He also described the training Padilla received and terrorist plots discussed including one to blow up apartment buildings in the United States using natural gas as well as an attack using a dirty bomb.", "Comey also noted that the government could not make a case against Padilla through the criminal justice system when he was originally arrested two years before \"without jeopardizing intelligence sources.\" But, he went on to say that the questioning of Padilla was not undertaken to try and make a criminal case against him. \"It was done to find out the truth about what he knew about Al Qaeda and threats to the United States.\"", "Soon after Padilla was declared an enemy combatant, his appointed counsel filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which held that Padilla had filed his habeas petition in the wrong court. In 2004, Padilla's counsel filed a new habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for South Carolina. The District Court ruled that Padilla's detention had not been authorized by Congress and was therefore unlawful. The government appealed to the Fourth Circuit. On September 9, 2005, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, reversed the trial court's decision and held that the president was authorized to detain enemy combatants under the Authorization of Use of Military Force passed by Congress in the wake of September 11. Padilla then filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.", "In November 2005, while the Supreme Court was considering Padilla's petition for review, the Bush Administration suddenly announced that criminal charges had been filed against him in federal court in Miami. The new indictment made no mention of the dirty bomb or most of the other original charges. Instead, Padilla was charged with being part of a \"North American support cell\" that worked to support violent jihad campaigns in Afghanistan and elsewhere overseas from 1993 to 2001.", "The government then asked the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to vacate its decision upholding Padilla's confinement. The Fourth Circuit refused to vacate its order or approve of Padilla's transfer from military to civilian custody. In an opinion by Judge J. Michael Luttig, the Fourth Circuit worried about \"an appearance that the government may be attempting to avoid consideration of our decision by the Supreme Court.\" Judge Luttig also \"chastised the administration for using one set of facts to justify holding Padilla without charges and another set to persuade a grand jury in Florida to indict him.\"", "Padilla's attorneys, in the meantime, sought to have the criminal charges against him dismissed on the grounds that the psychological damage he suffered during his confinement from abuse and extreme isolation had left him incompetent to stand trial. The judge in the case denied the motion, without ruling on the merits of the defense accusations of abuse. The criminal trial began in September 2006.", "Padilla was convicted on August 16, 2007, along with two co-defendants, Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi , of conspiracy to murder, kidnap and maim people in a foreign country.
