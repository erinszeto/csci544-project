Contracts issued utilizingFY2003 appropriations were provided under sole source or limited competition procedures thatultimately benefitted U.S. firms. The national security interest was a key justification for excludingcompetition, domestic as well as foreign. However, as most contracts were then provided by USAIDand treated as foreign assistance, they became subject to \"buy America\" provisions of law under theForeign Assistance Act of 1961, and exempt from international procurement agreements. (6) Foreign countries could,however, participate as sub-contractors to the selected American firms, and are estimated to composehalf or more of the total cost of these contracts.", "Most FY2004 appropriations -- managed by the CPA -- are being treated somewhatdifferently.

The United States Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program(LOGCAP) (11) is aninitiative to manage the use of civilian contractors who perform services in support of DOD missionsduring times of war and other military mobilizations. It was established on December 6, 1985, withthe publication of Army Regulation 700-137. LOGCAP is administered through the Army MaterielCommand (AMC), Operations Support Command, and is a centrally managed program to coordinateefforts to negotiate pre-existing (such as contingency) contracts with vendors from the United States. LOGCAP has been used in a variety of military contingency operations, and provides for theawarding of contingency, or bridging contracts, or for the inclusion of contingency clauses inpeacetime contracts. LOGCAP contracts have been previously awarded for work in Rwanda, Haiti,Saudi Arabia, Kosovo, Ecuador, Qatar, Italy, southeastern Europe, Bosnia, South Korea, and Kuwait. ", "LOGCAP contracts are \"costs-plus award fee\" contracts, meaning that there is a fee paidbased on contract costs, in addition to the potential for incentive fees based on performance. Tasksadministered under LOGCAP contracts are executed through \"task orders.\" Task orders outline thespecific actions that the contractor needs to perform. The scope and breadth of the tasks to beperformed by the contractor are determined by the base commander. LOGCAP contracts allow taskorders to be approved as needed, without having to compete. Tasks orders have the effect of actingas small contracts, are awarded without benefit of competition, and can be quite large. Reportedly,three of the LOGCAP task orders given to Halliburton/KBR under the LOGCAP III contract wereeach worth at least $60 million. (12) In an audit of several task orders issued under theHalliburton/KBR LOGCAP III contract, the Defense Contract Audit Agency found a number ofdeficiencies, such as pointing out that four task orders, totaling $227 million, did not show evidenceof current, accurate and complete cost or pricing data. The report concluded that ... \"Collectively,the deficiencies described above bring into question BRS' (13) ability to consistentlyproduce well-supported proposals that are acceptable as a basis for negotiation of fair and reasonableprices. We recommend you contact us to ascertain the status of the BRS' estimating system prior toentering into future negotiations.\" (14) ", "The first LOGCAP contract (LOGCAP I) was awarded by the Army Corps of Engineers toKellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR) in1992. The contract was used to support the United Statesmilitary services and the United Nations military forces in Somalia. The second LOGCAP contract(LOGCAP II) was awarded to DynCorp in 1994. The third LOGCAP contract was awarded to KBR(now a subsidiary of Halliburton) in 2001. According to the LOGCAP Program Manager, (15) each of the three LOGCAPcontracts was awarded competitively. ", "The third LOGCAP contract (LOGCAP III), a ten-year contract (one base year, followed bynine option years), was awarded in 2001 to Halliburton/KBR to perform a variety of tasks. Initialpress reports indicated that this LOGCAP III contract would be for the development of a contingencyplan for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq; however, subsequent press reports include such tasks asproviding housing for troops, preparing food, supplying water, and collecting trash. This contractwas awarded under a cost-plus-award-fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract. (16) The 2001 contract isbased on specific task orders which are issued individually, and only for those services that DODfeels are necessary to support the mission in the near term. During 2003, the Halliburton/KBRLOGCAP III contract rose to more than $3.5 billion. According to one press account,Halliburton/KBR earns a fixed 1% profit above costs on LOGCAP III, with the possibility of anadditional 2% as an incentive bonus, (17) while another press account reports that the Halliburton/KBRLOGCAP III contract is a cost-plus, award fee contract that earns a 2% fixed fee with the potentialfor an extra 5% incentive fee.

(19) This contract was asole-source contract to repair and operate oil wells in Iraq. According to the Army Corps ofEngineers, KBR was selected for this contract because KBR was judged to be the only contractorthat could begin implementing the contingency plan on such extremely short notice. DOD hasasserted that KBR had equipment and personnel in the region, and requiring competition for thework would have delayed the response to the oil well fires in Iraq. (20) This contract wasexpected to be used for an interim period, until the Army Corps of Engineers had an opportunity toaward additional contracts to provide a broader range of services to execute more of the contingencyplan. It appears that DOD justified the awarding of this contract based on an \"unusual andcompelling urgency\" (see DFARS 206.302-2).", "As a Result of Questions Raised over the Awarding of theHalliburton Sole-Source Contract, What Action Did the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)Take? The Army Corps of Engineers made the decision to conduct a competitionto award two new contracts to replace the sole-source Halliburton contract. The Corps conducteda competition for two new costs-plus-award fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts fora full range of services to assist the continued recovery operations in Iraq. The Request for Proposal(RFP) was issued on July 9, 2003, and closed on August 14, 2003. The Corps held a conference withall interested parties on July 14, 2003.

On Friday, January 16,2004, the Corps awarded Halliburton subsidiary KBR the first of the two contracts, a competitivebid to rebuild the oil industry in Southern Iraq. Soon after, USAID announced that Bechtel had beenawarded the second of the two contracts, a contract to repair bridges and roads, electrical powergenerators and grids, water and sewage systems, and airport facilities; the contract also calls forBechtel to rebuild up to100 hospitals and 6,000 schools and may be worth up to $1.8 billion dollarsover two years.

As of March 31, $7.6 billionof these assets and funds had been transferred. ", "The CPA established a coordination center in Baghdad that took over issues previouslyhandled by the OFFP. The website http://www.cpa-iraq.org/oil_for_food offers a section onfrequently asked questions that is useful for contact information and details on contract funding,amendments, and prioritization. Terminating the OFFP also put a limit on contract applications forthe export of goods to Iraq. With consideration of Iraqi views and needs, a priority system wasdeveloped. Categories of eligible and ineligible contracts are provided on the CPA website withdetails about specific suppliers listed in tables arranged by country.", "Press reports in February and March 2004, apparently based on material released by the IraqiGoverning Council and in other news briefs attributed to documents found in Iraq by the CPA, referto allegations of abuse of the OFFP by the Hussein government (and when the OFFP was under U.N.authority) including a list of individuals, companies, and organizations that may have receivedkickbacks. (23) Sincenearly the beginning of the OFFP there have been allegations of program abuses, and audits havebeen conducted at different points over the life of the program. Apparently, U.S. officials wereparticularly concerned about whether Iraq was using the additional revenue to buy prohibited militaryand WMD technology.

Halliburton/KBR, on behalf of the CPA,has purchased oil fuels for consumption by the Iraqi population. Gasoline has been purchased fromKuwait and Turkey, and delivered into Iraq by truck. While roughly 75% of the gasoline has comefrom Turkey, both the commodity cost of the fuel and the cost of transport from Kuwait are eachmore than twice as high as the corresponding charges associated with Turkish supplies. What canexplain the cost differential in each element of this transaction? In most cases, fuels for Iraq werepurchased in two geographically separate markets. Supplies came from both Turkish suppliers andinternational spot markets in the Mediterranean oil trading area. Offshore purchases were importedinto the Mediterranean ports of Iskenderum and Mersin, and shipped overland by Turkish truckersto Iraq. In other cases, fuels were purchased from a Kuwaiti supplier not directly in the oil business,who also made transport arrangements.", "Between May and October 2003, Halliburton imported about 179 million gallons fromTurkey and 61 million gallons from Kuwait. Turkish supplies averaged $1.24 per gallon delivered;those from Kuwait averaged $2.64, including $1.21 for the fuel and the remainder transport and KBRfees. (28) This is the mostrecent price data available, despite purchases continuing through the end of March 2004.", "Information on the quantities of gasoline obtained for Iraq were provided to the HouseGovernment Reform Committee by the Corps of Engineers for the whole period of Halliburton fuelprocurement management. The cheaper Turkish purchases -- which comprised about 75% of a totalof 464 billion gallons acquired (29) -- may well have comprised all the available supply in thattrading area; hence, perhaps the need for the higher priced supplies from nearby Kuwait.

", "Meanwhile, KBR supplied fuel while being under investigation for wrongdoing under thesupply contract. The investigation continues, although no new developments have been announced. The Pentagon Inspector General made a preliminary finding that KBR had overcharged $61 million.On January 23, 2004, the Wall Street Journal reported that two Halliburton employees had admittedtaking $6 million in kickbacks. (30) The company confirmed this. The Wall Street Journal went onto note specifically, that the kickbacks did not involve the gasoline purchases under scrutiny,although the employees involved worked in the same office in Kuwait that handled the gasolinecontract.

Between October andDecember 2003, the spot market price of gasoline in the Persian Gulf area, as quoted in PlattsOilgram Price Report , increased from 71 cents per gallon to over $1.00 per gallon. (31) Has this thinly traded spotmarket been unduly affected by Halliburton/KBR fuel purchases? Spot market gasoline prices inthe Persian Gulf trading area have risen from about $30 per barrel at the beginning of October, 2003to about $44 per barrel in mid-January 2004. That $14 increase -- the equivalent of 33 cents pergallon -- represents a substantial hike, well exceeding that which might be attributable to crude oilincreases.", "Higher gasoline prices beyond increases in crude oil costs were likely caused by increaseddemand in the limited regional market where fuel is purchased for Iraq. After several months ofunusual demand pressure from continuous short-term purchases, markets have responded in a waysuggesting that local conditions could not support the Iraqi demand without escalating the cost ofthe Kuwait-Iraq procurement. As DESC prepares to take over this program, one clear considerationis to source future petroleum product purchases in more robust markets better able to accommodatethe greater demand without such price increase.", "In a December 30, 2003, press release, DESC announced it would support the TaskForce-Restore Iraqi Oil (TF-RIO) through the Defense Logistics Agency.
