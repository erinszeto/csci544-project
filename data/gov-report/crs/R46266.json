The use of this funding is limited to the reclamation of coal mining sites abandoned or unreclaimed as of August 3, 1977 (the date of SMCRA enactment). Title V of SMCRA authorized the regulation of coal mining sites operating after the law's enactment. Coal mining sites regulated under Title V are ineligible for grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.", "The balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is provided by fees collected from coal mining operators based on the volume or value of coal produced, whichever is less.

The FY2022 grant amounts would depend on the fees collected in FY2021, and payments from the fund would begin in FY2023, continuing annually until the balance has been expended. As of November 11, 2018, OSMRE reported that the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund was approximately $2.3 billion. Reclamation grants to eligible states and tribes receiving grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund would continue for some years until the balance is expended if coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized.", "The balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is several times less than the estimated unfunded reclamation costs. OSMRE recently reported estimates of the unfunded reclamation costs as $12.4 billion. Congress may consider whether and how to fund the remaining unfunded coal reclamation needs. If the fees are reauthorized, the adequacy of those receipts to pay the remaining unfunded reclamation needs would depend in part on decisions made by Congress (e.g., source of funds, duration of the fee extension, and fee rate). Additional factors include the status of domestic coal production, upon which the fees are based, and the potential emergence of additional reclamation needs.

The actions necessary to attain these objectives may vary from site to site depending on the nature of the hazards and the technical or engineering feasibility of reclamation alternatives to mitigate the hazards. The severity of the hazard would also determine the prioritization of funding for reclamation. Examples of reclamation activities include removing or stabilizing coal mining waste piles, re-contouring and re-vegetating affected lands, mitigating the potential for subsidence, filling voids or sealing tunnels, and treating acid mine drainage. The costs to complete reclamation at a particular site would depend on the scope and nature of actions necessary to mitigate the potential hazards and any technical or engineering challenges to implement the selected actions.", "The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, established under Section 401 of SMCRA, provides funding to eligible states and tribes for the reclamation of surface mining impacts associated with historical mining of coal.

The fees are 28 cents per ton of coal produced by surface mining, 12 cents per ton of coal produced by underground mining, or 10% of the value of the coal, whichever is less. The fee for lignite coal is different from non-lignite coal and is 8 cents per ton or 2% of the value of the coal, whichever is less. Congress decreased the fee rates authorized in the original enactment of SMCRA to these fee rates in the 2006 amendments to SMCRA.", "Annual receipts credited to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund from these fees therefore depend on the fee rates applied to the amount or value of coal production each year. SMCRA does not set or guarantee any particular amount of receipts on an annual basis. Regardless of the fee rates, this framework may result in receipts fluctuating annually with changes in the amount or value of coal production in the United States. Coal reclamation fees generally increased until FY2007, after which the trend in fee revenue decreased from FY2008 to FY2019. During these years, coal reclamation fees collected by OSMRE decreased by approximately 49% in nominal dollars (i.e., without adjusting for inflation) ( Figure 1 ). U.S. coal production declined during that same time period by approximately 34%. While the nominal coal reclamation fees collected peaked in FY2007, the inflation-adjusted value of the coal reclamation fees have generally decreased since FY1979. The extent to which the reduced fee rates in 2006 contributed to the decline in fee receipts during this time period would depend on whether the fee receipts were based on the tonnage or value of coal produced.

Priority 1 projects involve the reclamation of lands and waters to protect public health, safety, and property from extreme danger. 2. Priority 2 projects involve the reclamation of lands and waters to protect public health and safety from adverse effects of coal mining practices. 3.

In some instances, the proximity of hazards and risks of AML lands to communities may elevate the risks to public health and safety in a way that similar circumstances would merit a lower priority if they occurred at a more isolated and remote location. However, proximity alone is not necessarily an indicator of risk if contamination may migrate from the mining site to an affected community. The geographic scope of the site may be larger than where the coal was mined, because it includes all the affected lands and waters. ", "AMD causes persistent water quality impairment when minerals within coal are exposed to atmospheric oxygen and water, which causes a reaction generating sulfuric acid. The production of acid creates low-pH conditions in the water, enhancing the solubility of iron, sulfate, and other trace metals from the exposed ore. Those dissolved constituents may discharge to downgradient streams and water bodies and may generate secondary minerals within the stream and on the stream beds. Streams and other ecosystems impacted by AMD can become functionally impaired. States may consider reclamation projects to abate AMD water quality issues as a higher priority if that impaired water could pose a risk to public health. ", "Section 402 allows states receiving grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to deposit up to 30% of their annual grants into an acid mine drainage abatement fund. The state may establish an acid mine drainage abatement fund in accordance with that state's law, and the monies in the fund are not subject to SMCRA's three-year limitation on expenditure and may accrue interest.

Certain coal mining company bankruptcies after 2006 also affected health benefit coverage for other retirees.", "Subsequent amendments to SMCRA in the 114 th and 115 th Congresses expanded the populations of beneficiaries who could be eligible for federal payments to the UMWA health benefit plans. Prior to the Bipartisan American Miners Act, Section 402(h)(2)(C) of SMCRA limited General Fund supplemental payments for the 1993 UMWA health benefit plan based on funding needs to cover beneficiaries enrolled in that plan as of May 5, 2017 (with coverage retroactive to January 1, 2017) and retirees whose benefits were denied or reduced as a result of coal mining company bankruptcies commenced in 2012 and 2015. ", "Since that time, funding needs to cover health benefits for additional populations of retirees have increased. The Bipartisan American Miners Act amended Section 402(h)(2)(C) of SMCRA again to expand the eligibility of the 1993 UMWA health benefit plan for General Fund supplemental payments to cover beneficiaries eligible as of January 1, 2019, and retirees whose benefits were denied or reduced as a result of coal mining company bankruptcies commenced in 2018 and 2019. This expansion of eligibility for federal funding to ensure health benefit coverage for these additional populations of beneficiaries may lead to increases in General Fund supplemental payments to the UMWA health benefit plans.", "The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 also authorized annual General Fund payments to the 1974 UMWA pension plan to address the solvency of that plan. The act established a new cap of $750 million annually on the aggregate amount of General Fund payments to certified states and tribes, UMWA health benefit plans, and the UMWA pension plan combined. The cap serves as a mechanism to control federal direct spending from the U.S. Treasury. After in lieu payments to certified states and tribes and supplemental payments to the UMWA health benefit plans each fiscal year, the act authorizes any remaining amount within the $750 million annual cap to be transferred to the UMWA pension plan.", "If the aggregate annual certified state and tribal payments and the supplemental payment for the UMWA health plans would exceed $750 million in a fiscal year, the UMWA health plans would be reduced to the cap, and the UMWA pension plan would not receive a federal payment that fiscal year. SMCRA gives funding priority to certified state and tribal payments that would not be reduced by the $750 million annual cap unless the amount for this purpose alone otherwise would exceed the cap. Given that certified state and tribal payments are based on shares of coal reclamation fees, these payments would not reach the cap unless coal production in certified state and tribal lands were to rise several fold compared to recent fiscal years. ", "Supplemental payments to UMWA health plans may vary depending on the availability of interest accrued on the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, the annual funding needs of the plans, and the amount available within the $750 million annual cap for supplemental payments.

From FY2008 to FY2020, General Fund payments authorized in Title IV of SMCRA totaled approximately $6.0 billion ( Table 3 ).

The FY2020 payment of $1.6 billion to the UMWA pension plan included cumulative payments from FY2017 through FY2020. The amount available for each of these fiscal years was subject to the $750 million annual cap and was based on the remainder within the cap after the certified state and tribal payments and the supplemental payments for the UMWA health benefit plans. The $1.6 billion payment to the UMWA pension plan in FY2020 was the largest annual General Fund payment authorized under Title IV of SMCRA ( Figure 4 ). For FY2021 and subsequent fiscal years, General Fund payments to certified states and tribes and the UMWA health and pension benefit plans will remain subject to the $750 million annual cap. Certified state and tribal payments would cease after FY2022 in current law absent the reauthorization of coal reclamation fees upon which these payments are based.", "Since FY2008, supplemental payments to UMWA health benefit plans from the General Fund have contributed a greater amount than have interest transfers from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund ( Table 3 ). Absent reauthorization of the coal reclamation fees, as the balance from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is paid down after FY2023, the interest payments would continue to have a relatively smaller contribution to UMWA health plans. Thus, the supplemental payments from the General Fund for the UMWA health plans would continue to contribute a larger share of contributions to the plans as the amount of interest payments decrease.

Whereas funding for reclamation grants is dependent on coal reclamation fee collections, most of the UMWA plan funding is tied to the $750 million annual cap on General Fund payments, which are not financed with these fees. OMB estimates that coal reclamation fee receipts would continue to decline through FY2021, after which time the fee collection authority expires in current law.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 provides a measure to control federal spending by placing a percent reduction on permanent appropriations to remain within prescribed caps.

If the coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized beyond FY2021, Section 401 of SMCRA directs the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to be distributed among eligible states over a series of fiscal years beginning in FY2023 based on what the state received in FY2022 as its share of fee collections from the prior year. Those payments would continue in that same amount each fiscal year thereafter until the balance of the fund is expended.

Congress was faced with a similar issue in the debate over the reauthorization of Superfund excise taxes for the Superfund Trust Fund under CERCLA ( P.L. 96-510 ). From the enactment of CERCLA in 1980 through FY1995, the balance of the Superfund Trust Fund was provided by revenues from the collection of a Superfund excise tax on petroleum, chemical feedstocks, corporate income, transfers from the General Fund, and other receipts.
