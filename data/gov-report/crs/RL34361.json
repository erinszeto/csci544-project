H.R. 116 (Foxx) would add automated political calls to the federal do not call list. S. 1077 (Feinstein) would restrict the timing and volume of calls and would require certain information to be disclosed. H.R. 4641 (Lofgren) proposes similar restrictions. Finally, H.R. 4749 (Price, N.C.) would extend \"stand by your ad\" disclaimer requirements to various political messages, including prerecorded calls.", "Automated political calls received attention in both chambers during the 110th Congress.

The Senate Rules and Administration Committee considered S. 2624 at a February 27, 2008, hearing.", "Empirical research and data about automated political calls are limited. Existing research suggests that the calls are an increasingly common campaign tactic and that various political committees spent millions of dollars on those efforts. Despite media reports of strong public disdain for automated political calls, the FEC has received few recent formal complaints on the issue. However, FEC enforcement data are not necessarily a reliable indicator of public sentiment toward automated political calls. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reportedly does not track data about complaints it receives on automated political calls.", "This report provides an overview of how automated political calls are used in federal campaigns. This includes attention to recent spending estimates and polling data about automated political calls. The report also discusses legislation that would affect the calls. Policy options discussed in the report include maintaining the status quo, gathering additional data, revising federal disclosure or disclaimer requirements, adding the calls to the federal do not call list, or restricting the number and timing of calls. Some of those options would likely involve contentious questions about which organizations and messages should be regulated by campaign finance law.

The calls can therefore play an important role in get-out-the-vote (GOTV) and voter-education activities. Those who oppose the calls generally argue that they are intrusive, that too many calls are placed to individual voters, or that they are too often used to convey negative information. Identifying those responsible for calls is also a concern.", "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) does not require detailed reporting about automated political calls. Political committees also have few incentives to make information about automated calls public. In addition to this lack of data from regulators and practitioners, campaign tactics and political consulting receive limited scholarly attention.

Several bills introduced in the 110 th Congress would have imposed additional regulations on automated political calls, but would not necessarily apply to all circumstances in which the calls are used. Legislation on the topic has also been introduced in the 111 th Congress. Many of the concerns surrounding automated political calls are not about the calls themselves, but about how those calls are used. Congress, therefore, has various options for addressing automated political calls, if it chooses to do so at all. Aside from maintaining the status quo, one relatively cautious option would be gathering additional data before choosing a policy approach. Federal agencies and the oversight process could provide such information. Another relatively limited approach would be to encourage voluntary changes by practitioners. By contrast, if Congress chose to require policy changes, it could add political calls to the do not call list or restrict the timing or number of calls.

According to one political consultant, official automated calls have been used to announce \"town hall\" meetings, solicit constituent input on votes, and provide information about federal programs (e.g., student loans).

Similarly, messages not authorized by candidate committees (e.g., by party committees) must clearly state that a candidate committee is not responsible for the call and must provide the \"full name and permanent street address, telephone number, or World Wide Web address of the person who paid for the communication.\" The latter requirement also appears to apply to \"general public political advertising\" (including telephone banks) paid for by \"any person\" that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate or solicits funds.", "The requirements discussed above suggest that automated political calls paid for by political committees (i.e., candidate committees, political action committees (PACs), or party committees) must include disclaimers identifying the sponsor. The same is true for other \"persons\" engaging in express advocacy (advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates) or fundraising. However, it is possible that entities other than political committees could avoid disclaimer requirements as long as they did not engage in express advocacy or fundraising related to federal candidates. These entities or individuals also would not normally fall under FEC jurisdiction. To summarize, automated political calls that propose election or defeat of federal candidates, or solicit funds for those candidates, appear to require disclaimers identifying the sponsor. However, these requirements do not appear to apply to calls that are not sponsored by political committees or that do not engage in express advocacy or fundraising for federal candidates.

Reports submitted to the FEC must include the name and address of the payee, date of payment, and a brief description of the purpose of disbursement. However, political committees are generally not required to use particular terminology when itemizing expenditures, as long as their descriptions are specific enough to determine the purpose. Policy guidance issued by the FEC in 2007 did not address how automated political calls should be described in expenditure reports. (This topic is discussed in more detail later in this report.) Therefore, although payments for automated calls must be disclosed, committees are largely free to determine how they wish to characterize their expenditures on reports submitted to the FEC.

When promulgating rules under the TCPA, the FCC was required by Congress to consider exempting calls made for non-commercial purposes. In its order implementing the TCPA, the FCC chose to exempt calls made for a non-commercial purpose from the prohibition on calls using prerecorded messages to residential telephone lines. Calls made by campaigns or other political organizations generally are considered to be calls made for a non-commercial purpose.", "Though automated or prerecorded telephone calls and calls using automated telephone dialing systems, including calls made to deliver political messages, to residential telephone lines are not prohibited by FCC regulation or the TCPA, these types of calls are subject to some regulation.

Some professional political consultants also specialize in automated calls. Data about the political consulting profession are frequently limited because consultants identify themselves by various titles, are often self-employed, and frequently do both political and non-political work. All these factors make tracking the profession difficult, particularly in terms of specialized groups such as those providing automated calls. A legislative working group of the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC) recently identified 129 firms claiming to provide automated political calls. The group's research suggested that no more than 10-20 of the 129 firms are professional political consulting firms, with the remainder primarily engaged in other business ventures. The AAPC figure is roughly consistent with a 2006-2007 estimate compiled by Dennis Johnson, professor of political management at George Washington University and a former political consultant. Johnson identified 28 \"telephone and direct voter contact\" firms operating in 2006-2007, but did not differentiate between firms offering automated calls versus other services. Johnson found, however, that voter contact is a small subset of the political consulting industry, particularly compared with more common specializations such as direct mail (126 firms), media consulting (78 firms), and polling/research (76 firms).", "Although few firms specialize in automated political calls, computer technology is reportedly making it easier for those without specialized knowledge to pursue political telemarketing. One consultant asserted that a \"bifurcation\" exists between professional political consultants and other firms or individuals offering automated calls. He also suggested that limited knowledge among the latter group could account for technical problems associated with some calls, such as late-night or truncated calls, and that an ability to place automated calls does not necessarily imply professional knowledge of how to use those calls effectively in campaigns.

The committees spent approximately $8.6 million on activities itemized with some variation of the term \"telemarketing,\" but it is unclear what proportion of those expenses, if any, were for automated calls. In addition, a large proportion of the \"telemarketing\" expenses were from one committee (the DCCC), suggesting that others simply chose not to use the term frequently in their reports. The $8.6 million figure also does not include other large disbursements that could represent automated calls, including expenditures itemized as \"generic phone banks\" or using variations of the word \"telephone.\" Without additional information, however, the exact purpose of those disbursements is unclear.", "Some caveats are important to consider when interpreting the party-spending information. First, as noted above, the party committees are not required to provide detailed information about automated political calls, or any other expense, in their FEC reports. Indeed, examples of acceptable itemized disbursements provided by the FEC do not include references to automated political calls. Second, analyzing data from four party committees is simpler than doing so for hundreds or thousands of candidate committees, PACs, etc. Therefore, the party committees provide a snapshot of possible automated calls spending.

In fact, if groups were limited to a certain number of calls, it is possible that other organizations could emerge solely for the purpose of placing multiple calls to the same voters. Constitutional considerations (speech issues) that could affect this policy option are discussed below."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "First Amendment Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Political calls to potential voters are political speech and entitled to the highest degree of protection under the First Amendment. Laws or regulations that would burden or prohibit such calls if they use automated dialers or prerecorded messages, therefore, must withstand so-called strict scrutiny in order to be considered constitutional. Under a strict scrutiny analysis, if a governmental restriction is challenged in court, the government must demonstrate that the restriction on automated political calls serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive alternative to serve that interest.", "A regulation that would ban the use of automated telephone dialing systems or prerecorded messages in political calls may place too high a burden on core political speech to withstand such exacting scrutiny. The First Amendment \"protects [a speaker's] right not only to advocate their cause but also to select what they believe to be the most effective means for so doing.\" The Supreme Court announced this principle in the context of invalidating a state law that prohibited the use of paid workers to obtain signatures on voter-initiative petitions as an impermissible burden on political speech. The Court found that the law restricted \"access to the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse.\" The Supreme Court also has noted that \"[i]t is of no moment that [a statute] does not impose a complete prohibition. The distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree.\" Accordingly, though a ban on the use of prerecorded messages or automated dialing systems would not prohibit all political calls, if a court finds that prohibiting the use of such technology would limit such calls to a lesser degree, such a restriction could be considered an impermissible burden on the First Amendment free speech rights of those placing political calls.", "Governments, however, are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of speech so long as they are content-neutral, narrowly tailored (though not necessarily the least restrictive means), and serve a significant government interest (though not necessarily a compelling interest), and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information. Laws that \"do not foreclose an entire medium of expression, but merely shift the time, place or manner of its use\" likely will be upheld so long as \"ample alternative channels for communication\" are left open. In order to qualify for the less exacting \"reasonable time, place, and manner\" restriction analysis, the law must be content-neutral. It is important to note that a restriction on the use of automated telephone dialers or prerecorded messages that applied only to political calls would likely be characterized as a content-based restriction on speech, which would require strict scrutiny, as described above. Content-based discrimination could be avoided if the restriction encompassed all speech that utilized these technologies.", "There is little case law on this question; however, at least one federal court has addressed the issue in a decision that was subsequently reversed on unrelated grounds. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana upheld the constitutionality of an Indiana statute that bans the use of automated dialing systems, unless the called party has given prior consent or the message is immediately preceded by a live operator who requests consent to play the message. The court found that the statute did not violate the First Amendment, because it was content-neutral and a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction that left open ample alternative modes of communication. The court distinguished the provisions at issue from other Supreme Court decisions that applied strict scrutiny to restrictions on the modes of delivery for speech because the statute applied to all speech regardless of content and did not single out political speech.", "The decision of the district court was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit held that the district court should have abstained from deciding the case, because the related state court action had been filed first, important state interests were implicated, and state courts were able to afford ample opportunity to address the federal questions raised by the case. The case now awaits decision in Brown County Circuit Court, an Indiana state trial court.", "A related case was argued before the Indiana Supreme Court. The case concerned whether Indiana's Auto-Dialer Law applies to all calls (including political calls) or only to commercial calls. On December 23, 2008, the court issued its decision holding that the statute applies to all calls placed using autodialers. The court did not, however, analyze whether the statute is valid under the First Amendment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Much remains unknown about automated political calls. Although empirical data are limited, estimates suggest that the calls reach at least a majority of American voters, occur frequently during federal campaigns, and could represent millions of dollars in spending by various political committees. Despite media accounts of strong public disdain for automated political calls, the FEC has received few formal complaints on the issue since 2003. Several bills introduced in the 111 th and 110 th Congresses would (or would have) impose additional regulations on automated political calls, but would not necessarily apply to all circumstances in which the calls are used.", "Congress has several policy options for restricting automated political calls, if it chooses to do so. Aside from maintaining the status quo, a relatively cautious option might be gathering additional data before choosing a policy approach. Federal agencies and the oversight process could provide additional information. Another relatively limited approach would be to encourage voluntary changes by practitioners. By contrast, if Congress chooses to require policy changes, it could add political calls to the do not call framework or restrict the timing or number of calls. Finally, Congress could place additional disclosure or disclaimer requirements on political calls. Some of those options would likely involve sensitive questions about which groups and messages should be covered by campaign finance law. Constitutional considerations could also be a factor."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Research Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As this report discusses, publicly available data about automated political calls are virtually nonexistent. FECA does not require detailed reporting about automated political calls. Political committees also have few incentives to make information about automated calls public because doing so potentially alerts opposing candidates, groups, and the media to campaign strategy. In addition to this lack of data from regulators and practitioners, scholarly literature is limited. Academic research that does exist tends to focus on campaign strategists, such as media consultants and pollsters, but not on vendors who provide technical services such as automated calls. Automated calls as a campaign tactic have also received limited scholarly attention.", "Given the limited publicly available information about automated political calls, CRS employed a broad research strategy designed to gather as much information as possible. This included consultations with staff at the FCC, FEC, prominent political scientists, staff from the four national congressional campaign committees, the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC), individual political consultants, and a political journalist. CRS also conducted keyword searches in databases that provide archives of news sources, scholarly journals, dissertations, and polling data (e.g., LexisNexis, Proquest, JSTOR, Polling the Nations, etc.). The primary author also conducted telephone interviews with three political consultants and analyzed disclosure and enforcement data provided by the FEC. Use of individual data sources is documented in the text of this report.", "Finally, Internet research revealed many political web log (\"blog\") references to automated political calls in recent elections. Many of these entries contained claims about allegedly unethical or illegal campaign practices. Because CRS cannot verify the information contained in these blogs, it is not included in this analysis."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
