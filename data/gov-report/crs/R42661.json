The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA, P.L. 111-152) provided $500 million per fiscal year in mandatory appropriations for TAACCCT for FY2011 through FY2014. In FY2013 and FY2014, the funding for the program was reduced to $474.5 million and $464 million, respectively, due to sequestration. Funds equal to at least 0.5% of the total annual funding for grants must be awarded to institutions in each state.", "TAACCCT grantees may use funds to design, develop, and offer career training programs. Allowable uses of funds include personnel as well as materials and other expenses related to content development and delivery.

This period includes 36 months for the design, development, and delivery of a training program and 12 months for data gathering and evaluation.", "Statute requires that grant applications include a description of the proposed project and how it will serve trade-affected workers. Statute further specifies that grants will be judged on the merit of the proposed project and the local employment prospects for individuals who would complete the proposed program. SGAs have specified an expanded set of criteria for program grants to operationalize the aims of the TAACCCT program.", "The first SGA was issued in January 2011 and grantees were announced in September 2011.

TAAW offers subsidized training and other supports for displaced workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign trade.

The remaining funds (approximately $300 million) are intended for larger awards to consortium applicants.

Proposed programs must demonstrably improve educational and employment outcomes. Applicants replicating or adapting existing strategies should provide evidence of effectiveness. Applicants proposing new strategies should cite \"preliminary research findings, related research findings, and/or reasonable hypotheses to support the design of the program[.]\" 2. Career Pathways . Applicants must develop a curriculum that offers a clear sequence of coursework and/or credentials focused on one or more industry sectors. Applicants must also offer accelerated and contextualized remediation, competency-based assessments, stacked and latticed credentials, and transferability of credits to other two-year and four-year institutions within the state or consortium. 3. Advanced online and technology-enabled learning . TAACCCT proposals must consist of courses that are conducted online, in hybrid (combining traditional and online coursework), or otherwise incorporate technology. The SGA suggests that applicants may use technology or online courses to \"enable rolling and open enrollment processes, modularize content delivery, simulate assessments and training, and accelerate course delivery strategies.\" The SGA also expressed interest in technology that will customize content to the student's prior knowledge or expand upon technology developed in prior TAACCCT projects. 4. Strategic alignment with the workforce system and other stakeholders . Applicants must partner with at least one local Workforce Investment Board and the state agency that administered the TAA for workers program. Applicants must illustrate local needs and avoid duplication by demonstrating alignment with the governor's Economic Development plan and the state's Workforce Investment Act-Wagner Peyser (WIA-WP) integrated workforce plan. Applicants are also encouraged to coordinate their proposal with any private sector or philanthropic entities that may align with the proposed project. 5. Sector strategies and employer engagement . Applicant institutions must partner with at least two employers and a regional industry representative for each industry that the proposed program targets. These partners are expected to support curriculum development and provide work-based training opportunities, as appropriate. 6. Alignment with previously-funded TAACCCT projects . Applicants are expected to research projects that received funding under prior rounds of TAACCCT and design their applications to decrease duplication and strengthen the geographic reach of projects. Since all resources developed in previous TAACCCT grants are openly licensed, applicants may also align with prior grantees by incorporating existing resources into a new curriculum."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reporting and Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Statute requires DOL to report annually to the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means on each TAACCCT grant awarded and the impact of each award on TAAW-eligible workers.", "The SGA establishes reporting requirements for grantees.

The last annual performance report will serve as the grant's final performance report and should include annual and cumulative information on the grant's activities. Single institution grantees will submit data directly to DOL. Consortium member institutions will submit reports to the consortium's lead institution, which will compile data and submit a single report to DOL.", "The SGA specifies that each TAACCCT application must also include a budget, design, and implementation plan for a third-party evaluation of the proposed project.
