Led by China, India, and Brazil, these rising economic powers pose varied challenges and opportunities for U.S. economic interests and leadership of the global economy. They also raise significant policy issues for Congress, including the future direction of U.S. trade policy and negotiations, as well as for the multilateral economic institutions that have historically served as the foundation of an open and rules-based global economy.", "This report addresses ongoing shifts in global trade and finance and projected future trends resulting from the emergence of these economies. It is the first of a three-part CRS series that focuses on how the Rising Economic Powers are affecting U.S. interests and raising challenges for congressional oversight of U.S. international trade and financial policies.", "The major trends in the global economy identified and discussed in this report are:", "The balance of global economic power is shifting from the United States and Europe to a number of fast-growing and large developing countries. These economies account for rising shares of global GDP, manufacturing, and trade, including a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries (South-South trade). These shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies, particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries. Rising economic powers are becoming more important players in international finance. They have increased holdings of foreign exchange reserves, established sovereign wealth funds, borrowed capital from international capital markets, and attracted substantial foreign investment. Their multinational corporations, many state-owned, are investing assets globally and are competing with U.S. firms for natural resources and access to other developing-country markets. The long-standing distinction between advanced and developing countries, particularly for rising economic powers, is blurring. The advanced countries may still be the richest countries in terms of per capita income, but their economies may no longer be the largest, the fastest-growing, or the most dynamic. Rising economic powers are exerting greater influence in global trade and financial policies and in the multilateral institutions that have underpinned the global economy since World War II. These developments, in turn, have implications for U.S. global leadership that are subject to debate. While the impact of the rising economic powers is considered by most economists to be strongly positive for the U.S. economy overall, not all groups of Americans have benefitted equally. Highly educated workers are seen gaining more job opportunities and higher wages than workers with less education.", "Issues for Congress on the international trade and finance policies raised by the changing global landscape could include:", "Seizing full advantage of growing markets for U.S. manufacturers, service providers, agricultural producers, and their workers, including preparing for increased competition.

In the early 1950s, the world economy was essentially divided between developed or industrialized countries in the \"North\" and developing or non-industrialized countries in the \"South.\" Developed countries, excluding Japan, at that time accounted for 90% of world manufacturing output and 90% of world exports of manufactured goods. Production remained largely enclosed within national boundaries and trade patterns reflected the respective country specializations. Inputs for most products were sourced within national borders. In addition to a large imbalance in the structure of production and exports, there was a dramatic imbalance in living standards and political power as well.", "From the 1950s to the mid-1990s, these imbalances began to reverse gradually. By 1995, for example, the advanced countries' share of manufacturing output had fallen to 80%. But the narrowing of the great 20 th century divide between advanced and developing countries accelerated rapidly over the past two decades with traditional production, trade, and finance patterns being replaced by new and more balanced configurations. ", "Spurred by the information technology (IT) revolution, trade liberalization and other economic reforms, the entry of an estimated 2 billion people into the labor force as a result of the breakdown of the Soviet bloc and the opening of China, and the freer movement of capital and technology from developed countries to developing countries, the size of the global economy doubled over the decade preceding the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, increasing from $31 trillion in 1999 to $62 trillion in 2008. While the growth reached practically every region of the world and encompassed dozens of developing countries, a handful of large developing countries\u2014led by China, India, and Brazil\u2014accounted for a major share of the global growth. Other emerging economies with large populations, such as Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and Vietnam, also grew at a rapid pace. This faster growth has enabled developing countries to expand their share of global GDP, rising from around one-fifth of global GDP in 2000 to more than one-third of world output today, fueling speculation that the world's economic balance of power is rapidly shifting away from the United States and Europe toward rising powers in Asia and Latin America. ", "In addition to altering global GDP rankings, the changes in the global economy have affected the centers of economic growth, the location of manufacturing, and international trade patterns. Buttressed by their exporting success and rising incomes, developing countries are also becoming more important players in the international financial system. If current trends persist, the shifts in wealth and power could become more pronounced over the next several decades.", "With important responsibilities for the formulation of U.S. international trade and financial policies, Congress has an interest in understanding how these shifts of wealth and power are affecting U.S. economic interests. This report addresses these concerns in two parts by (1) describing and analyzing trends that are transforming the global economy, and (2) highlighting varied policy challenges raised by the new global economy for congressional consideration.", "Discussion and analysis of these trends has intensified over the past few years. International institutions, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); private research institutions, such as the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; and private sector research entities, such as Goldman Sachs and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, have all issued analyses of the changing global economy.

The biggest change involves a long-term shift in economic power from advanced to a handful of large developing countries that have grown twice as fast as advanced countries for more than a decade. These rising economic powers have become increasingly important generators of world economic growth. Their share of global trade has increased significantly, with trade and investment between developing countries (South-South trade and investment) becoming an important new force in the global economy. These countries now export a diversified range of manufactured products and are actively upgrading their ability to produce more sophisticated and higher value-added products.", "These trends have been accompanied by a major shift in the location of manufacturing from advanced to developing countries, particularly to Asia. Often referred to as \"Factory Asia,\" this development has been driven by the proliferation of global supply chains that rely on significant amounts of goods and services inputs from different countries, including from the United States. In this new environment, countries no longer specialize exclusively in producing finished products, but rather in specific stages of the production process. ", "The rising economic powers have also increased their financial holdings and wealth and are becoming more important players in international financial markets. While a dominant share of financial assets, financial centers, and financial regulatory power remains concentrated in the United States and Europe, these emerging economies have accumulated large volumes of foreign exchange reserves, established sovereign wealth funds, borrowed capital from international financial markets, attracted foreign direct investment, and begun investing some of their assets abroad. Corporations based in these countries are playing an increasingly prominent role in global business and cross-border investment, often competing with U.S. and European multinationals for natural resources, technology, and investment in other developing countries. Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai are growing in importance as financial centers and will perhaps rank someday with the traditional hubs of New York, London, Frankfurt, and Tokyo. As their role in international trade and investment increases, demand for emerging market currencies is also likely to grow over time, perhaps paving the way for an international monetary system with more than one key reserve currency. ", "As a result of these changes, the long-standing division between advanced and developing countries has eroded, particularly for the handful of rising economic powers. The advanced or developed countries may still be the richest countries in terms of per capita incomes, but their economies may no longer be the largest, the fastest-growing, or the most dynamic.

According to OECD estimates ( Figure 2 ), developing- and developed-country shares of global GDP will be about equal by 2012; however, the developing countries' share is projected to rise to 57% and the developed countries' share is projected to drop to 43% by 2030.", "On a more disaggregated basis, as shown in Figure 3 , the United States remains the largest economy in the world, although its share dropped nine percentage points, from 33% of the world economy between 1960 and 1972 to 24% in 2008-2009. The share of the G-7 (an economic and political grouping of developed countries consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the EU-15 (the initial group that comprised the European Union until 2004) fell by even more. On the other hand, the three largest emerging economies\u2014China, Brazil, and India\u2014saw their shares of world GDP rise from 6% between 1960 and 1972 to 23% in 2008-2009, a gain of 17 percentage points.

In the often-cited report Dreaming with BRICs: The Path to 2050 , Goldman projected that the economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China taken together could be larger than the G-6 (the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy) by 2039. Goldman also projected that among the G-6, only the United States and Japan would be among the top six largest economies in the world by 2050, and that only two European powers, the United Kingdom and Germany, would be in the top 10 (ninth and tenth place, respectively).", "Among the BRICs, it is clear that China is in a class of its own. According to IMF data presented in Table 1 , China's weight in the world economy has more than quadrupled between 1995 and 2010, but the other three BRICs have also seen their shares grow. ", "In 2009 (see Figure 4 below), China's economic output of $3.3 trillion (based on market exchange rates) was one-fourth the size of U.S. GDP ($13.2 trillion). But according to a projection by Carnegie Endowment researchers, China's GDP may be almost 20% larger than the U.S. GDP by 2050 ($46.3 trillion for China versus $37.6 trillion for the United States). In purchasing power parity terms, China now ranks as the second-largest economy in the world and is projected by the Carnegie researchers to be almost twice the size of the U.S. economy by 2050.

Past projections that Russia and Japan would surpass the U.S. GDP, for example, proved far off the mark.

", "Each of the rising economic powers faces internal challenges or obstacles that could easily derail the long-term growth projections. China and India, the two largest and most important of the rising economic powers, stand in a class all by themselves both in terms of their potential impact on the global economy and the obstacles that could derail their growth over the next 40 years. ", "In the case of China, rising income inequality, a rapidly aging population, potential social unrest, territorial disputes, fuel scarcity, water shortages, environmental pollution, corruption, and an underdeveloped banking system are obstacles commonly cited. Whether China's leadership will prove capable of dealing with these challenges, any of which could lead to political instability, remains to be seen.", "India's internal challenges are no less daunting. To achieve its long-term growth potential, India may have to make progress on a wide range of economic and political reforms. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, India needs to improve its governance, raise its educational standards, control inflation, liberalize financial markets and increase trade with its neighbors, boost agricultural productivity, and improve its infrastructure. Delivery of all of these changes will not be easy.", "It should also be emphasized that these projections foresee only a relative decline in the size of the G-7 economies. In absolute and real terms, all the studies project real increases in GDP for the advanced countries. So despite rapid growth in the emerging powerhouses, their populations will remain significantly poorer than those in advanced countries. By 2050, six of the largest developing countries will have per capita incomes far below Japan, the United States, and much of Europe. U.S. per capita income will be nearly three times that of China and eight times that of India, influencing the U.S. role in a global economy. Therefore, the advanced countries that have dominated the global economy for the past 50 years will continue to maintain the highest living standards, but their leadership role may be increasingly contested by a varied group of rising economic powers.

As illustrated by the production of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (see Figure 6 ), parts for major capital and consumer products are increasingly sourced on a global basis. What the diagram does not show, however, is that the growing tendency of companies to contract out to other companies for the production of components and services can run into problems. In the case of the Dreamliner , Boeing's decision in 2003 to contract out or outsource substantial production proved problematic. Many parts did not fit together and dozens of sub-contractors failed to deliver their parts on time, resulting in cost over-runs and a three-year production delay.", "China, as the hub of \"Factory Asia,\" has become competitive not only because of its lower labor costs, but also because it is a huge importer of sophisticated components from other East Asian countries for assembly and re-export to Western markets.

These kinds of far-reaching changes entail significant economic costs and could take decades to occur."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Functioning of the Global Economy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The United States was a prime mover in the creation of the so-called Bretton Woods international economic institutions, including the IMF, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization) more than a half-century ago. These institutions, premised on the values of open markets, trade liberalization, financial stability, and the rule of law, were designed to promote post-war reconstruction and a prosperous and stable global economy. ", "The current shift in economic and political power has occasioned a debate on the reform of these institutions, as well as on the very foundation of the post-World War II open global international economic system. Many rising developing countries want more power and influence in setting the rules and institutional arrangements of the world economy. They see existing arrangements as preserving the status quo and maintaining U.S. and, particularly, European power at the expense of developing countries. Although the IMF and World Bank have taken some steps to increase representation to reflect the shift in economic power toward developing countries, many rising powers remain unsatisfied.", "U.S. and European policymakers perceive that the rising powers are reluctant to take on more responsibility for the maintenance of the system based on a recognition of how much they benefit from open trade. They are also skeptical that the rising powers fully accept the norms and values of these institutions. For example, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, authoritarian states such as China took delight in lecturing Americans about the shortcomings of their economic model and the value of free markets. Instead of free markets, deregulation, and the encouragement of capital and investment flows, leaders from the rising powers touted the value of state-led development. With their large populations and low per capita incomes, Western policymakers also see the emerging powers as less willing to commit to international standards or agreements to limit their ability to achieve national objectives.", "It remains to be seen whether and how the governance and functioning of these institutions for international cooperation can be reformed to become more representative of the new global landscape while retaining Western norms and values. The establishment of the G-20 as the principal forum of international policy coordination is deemed by many observers as the most promising recognition of the problem and institutional response to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of the G-20", "paragraphs": ["Established initially in 1999 to facilitate discussions among finance ministers, the G-20 started meeting at the leader level (Summits) in September 2009 in response to the global financial crisis. The crisis starkly illustrated the need for fiscally strapped advanced economies to rely on increases in government spending from cash-rich developing countries to keep the global economy from entering into a depression. Representing two-thirds of the world's population, 90% of world GDP, and 80% of world trade, the G-20 has come to symbolize the growing diffusion of economic power and the fact that the advanced countries do not have the capacity to manage global economic problems alone.", "With much broader representation than its predecessor coordinating groups (the G-7 and the G-8), the G-20 has the potential to fill a large gap in global economic governance by creating coalitions that cut across advanced and developing country lines. Working groups on issues such as global imbalances are co-chaired by representatives from both camps, thereby giving each side opportunities to develop reforms and establish buy-in among their respective constituencies. In addition, the G-20 has pushed other international institutions to increase the representation of developing countries. To strengthen international standards of global finance, the G-20 replaced the Financial Stability Forum, which included only G-7 members, with the Financial Stability Board, which included developing countries. And the G-20 has worked to ensure that developing countries gain greater representation at the IMF and World Bank and that the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations be brought to a successful conclusion.", "While the G-20 has received high marks for its response to the global economic crisis through its decisions regarding fiscal stimulus, regulatory reform, and a tripling IMF's resources, it is uncertain that such a diverse grouping of leaders will be able to reach agreements on global economic issues that tend to be viewed in \"win-lose\" terms. It is also unclear how the G-20, by including only the large rising economic powers, can support multilateralism. Moreover, given that the G-20 lacks enforcement powers and a permanent institutionalized bureaucracy, commitments agreed to at summits can easily be ignored or remain unimplemented. To wit, despite several G-20 declarations urging a rapid conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations, the stalemate endures.

Shifts in global shares of production and trade from advanced nations to a small group of developing countries, many located in Asia, have been pronounced and dramatic. Shifts in financial holdings and assets are also occurring, but at a slower rate. As a result of these changes, the global economy has seen the rise of more countries that can contribute to global growth and that have the resources to be important regional and global actors. Whether these trends will continue over the next few decades remains unknown. ", "Most projections of the shift in global economic power are based on some assumptions about the future rates of growth of developed and developing countries. Fiscally constrained developed countries are predicted by a number of economic forecasters to grow at rates that are three to five percentage points lower than developing countries. Much could happen that would narrow this gap in growth rates, thus offsetting predicted outcomes. ", "In the case of advanced countries, successful efforts at consolidation and reduction of public debt levels could instill investor confidence and unleash growth-creating, entrepreneurial activity that leads to higher than projected growth rates. In the case of developing countries, whose growth has been facilitated by access to export markets, capital, and technology, a rise in world-wide trade barriers could adversely affect their growth rates. Most rising economic powers, which have grown by borrowing and adapting existing technology, may also have to become more successful at innovation if they are to continue on a rapid growth trajectory. Moreover, many of these countries face formidable internal obstacles to growth, such as an aging work force, corruption, and political stability, that could easily alter projections for growth.", "Regardless of future trends, the rise of many heavily populated developing countries to date has posed significant opportunities and challenges for U.S. economic interests. On the one hand, most economists view the transition of developing countries from low to higher levels of production and wealth as being a \"win-win\" situation and mutually advantageous. This view is that a larger world economic pie, combined with hundreds of millions of people in developing countries escaping poverty, is good for everyone via dramatic increases in world production and consumption. On the other hand, the rising economies have affected U.S. employment opportunities and incomes differentially, with more favorable impacts for highly educated workers. Because many of these countries' governments play a large role in guiding market developments and corporate growth, there is also concern that the distribution of the benefits that are derived from international trade and investment flows may be distorted. Shifts in relative economic power positions also raise broader questions concerning possible impacts on U.S. influence and leadership of the global economy. Nevertheless, under either scenario, Congress, the executive branch, and the private sector will be pressed to find new ways of partnering and cooperating with these rising powers in order to maximize benefits and minimize costs for American companies and workers.
