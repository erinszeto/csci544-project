Conditions on assistance to Pakistan and Afghanistan . The apparently deteriorating security situation in Pakistan was the focus of extensive discussion in congressional hearings with Administration witnesses on the supplemental appropriations request. Administration officials strongly objected to legislated benchmarks on the performance of the Pakistani government, arguing that conditions on aid would not improve U.S. leverage but would more likely foster resistance to U.S. efforts. Instead of setting benchmarks tied to funding, the House Appropriations Committee bill included a requirement that the President submit a report to Congress no later than February 2010, when the FY2011 budget would be submitted, evaluating the conduct and commitment of the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The report was to include assessments of each nation's level of political commitment to confront security challenges; level of corruption and efforts to counter it; performance of security forces in counterinsurgency operations and in establishing population security; intelligence cooperation with the United States; and the ability to effectively control its territories. House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey said that the White House did not object to the House provision. Closure of the Guantanamo Bay Prison .

The $12 million NADR program would bolster the capacities of the Afghan Presidential Protective Service.", "The State, Foreign Operations portion of the request also included $261.5 million in State Department Diplomatic and Consular Program account funds, most of which would support operational expenses of the proposed civilian staff surge from multiple agencies that would bring staff levels in Kabul up from 394 to 567 and expand PRT staff by 110 temporary posts. Similarly, there was a $140 million request for USAID Operating Expenses, most of which is meant to increase USAID staff in the PRTs. In addition, $101.5 million would go to security protection for U.S. facilities and personnel, and $87 million would go to embassy physical expansion to provide room for new housing.

The bill provided the requested amount for the CERP and the ASFF, but did not cancel and re-appropriate the $125 million in FY2009 \"bridge\" funds sought by the Administration.", "The Senate bill provided $308.6 million for State D&CP staff operating expenses (vs. $261.5 million request) and $100 million for USAID operating expenses (vs. $140 million request). It matched the $7.2 million request for the SIGAR.", "The Enacted FY2009 Supplemental", "The FY2009 Supplemental, as passed by Congress ( P.L. 111-32 ), closely follows the Administration request levels for most accounts with regard to Afghanistan assistance. It provides $861 million in ESF\u2014$22 million above the request; $133 million in INCLE\u2014$4 million above the request; and $3.6 billion for the ASFF and $453 million for the CERP (to be shared with Iraq), matching those requests. Afghanistan funding levels for NADR and MRA accounts were not specified in the conference report, but are likely to be allocated funds at the requested levels. ", "Of special note, the act provides not less than $150 million of ESF and INCLE be used for programs addressing the needs of women and girls. It requires that 10% of INCLE funds be withheld until the Secretary of State reports that the Afghan government is taking steps to remove officials engaged in narcotics or human rights crimes. It provides $70 million for the National Solidarity Program.", "The enacted supplemental provides $413.2 million in State Diplomatic and Consular Program operating expenses vs. the $363 million requested. Half of the additional amount is an early response to the FY2010 budget request for air transport needs of the Embassy. The Embassy Security account, however, is allocated $67 million less than the request, due to concerns regarding the plan to acquire land adjacent to the Embassy to meet civilian expansion needs. The USAID Operating Expense account request of $140 million is met by the legislation.", "Appendix C. FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations for Assistance to Pakistan", "The President's request for supplemental FY2009 appropriations included a total of more than $900 million in proposed spending directly related to Pakistan, and another $1 billion in Coalition Support Funds (CSF), much of which is likely to be used to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S. military operations in the region. The Administration argued that $497 million in new foreign operations assistance was urgently needed \"to help stem the rapidly deteriorating security and economic conditions confronting\" Pakistan, and it emphasized that \"failure to address these conditions could lead to a further opening for extremists\" there. It further argued that ongoing CSF reimbursements are \"critical to maintaining the viability\" of U.S.-led military coalition efforts, and that establishment of a new Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was necessary to bolster that country's security forces and make it a more effective partner in U.S. efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan and the region.", "The DOD assistance request would continue CSF payments to reimburse Pakistan for its ongoing operational and logistical support of U.S. efforts in the region. Such funds have accounted for the bulk of U.S. financial transfers to Pakistan since 2001, and they have come under scrutiny as concerns grew in Congress and among independent analysts that standard accounting oversight procedures were not being employed. Pakistan has received approximately 80% of appropriated CSF funds since 2001 at an average rate of nearly $80 million per month. This ratio suggests that Pakistan could received approximately $800 million in supplemental CSF in FY2009 in addition to the $200 million already disbursed through the FY2009 \"bridge\" supplemental. Requested counterdrug funds in the DOD budget totaled $25.8 million. Moreover, the proposed PCCF funds would be used to 1) fund an existing, multi-year Security Development Plan for Pakistan; 2) assist Pakistani security forces to organize, train, equip, and operate as a counterinsurgency-capable force; and 3) provide humanitarian relief in post-combat/conflict areas. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has favored funding the PCCF with up to $3 billion over a five-year period and folding into this single account many sometimes disparate Pentagon-funded security programs for Pakistan. There was debate in Congress about whether the PCCF should come under the authority of the Department of Defense or the Department of State.", "The $497 million foreign operations request broke down as follows: $430 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF), $65.5 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), and $2 million in Narcotics, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) funds. Within these accounts, the largest amounts ($400 million) are requested for ESF programs that would help address Pakistan's economic crisis and balance of payment deficit by supplementing Islamabad's $7.65 billion Standby Agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Another $21.5 million in ESF would be used to expand USAID's Community Rehabilitation Infrastructure Support Program (CRISP) in ongoing efforts to stimulate economic activity, create jobs and improve service delivery in Pakistan. Humanitarian assistance for persons internally displaced by instability in Pakistan's western border regions would total $8 million. These amounts would add to the \"bridge\" FY2009 supplemental providing $150 million and a base FY2009 request of $453 million, bringing the FY2009 ESF total for Pakistan to about $1.03 billion, a huge increase as compared to previous years. Requested INCLE funds include $35 million to continue train and equip programs for elite police forces and other law enforcement agencies in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and $22.5 million to expand the air wing of the paramilitary Frontier Corps to improve tactical counternarcotics, law enforcement, and border security capacities. The $2 million requested for NADR would fund four additional Crisis Response Team training courses for Pakistan's Federal Investigative Agency's anti-terrorist team, said to be a high priority of the Interior Ministry.", "State Department and USAID operations costs to be funded under the supplemental request include $806.2 million for security, construction and maintenance of several U.S. posts in Pakistan, the bulk of which would fund renovation or replacement of the existing chancery and construction of a new annex at the Islamabad post. Moreover, $45.6 million requested for costs related to diplomatic and consular activities of the U.S. Mission in Pakistan broke down as follows: $30.9 million to enhance U.S. public diplomacy efforts there; $9.1 million to provide increased security for U.S. facilities; and $5.5 million to fund a staffing surge. For USAID, $7.6 million to support significant increases in USAID staffing levels in Pakistan. These funds would pay for salaries, benefits, and related expenses for 81 approved new positions, including 16 new U.S. Direct-Hires.", "In a conference report on FY09 supplemental appropriations ( H.Rept. 111-151 ) subsequently approved by both chambers in mid-June ( P.L. 111-32 ), conferees resolved differences between the House and Senate versions and authorized the following: $1 billion for coalition support fund reimbursements to \"key cooperating nations (Pakistan since 2001 has received roughly 80% of such funds); $896 million for embassy security, construction, and maintenance; $539 million in ESF; $65.5 million for INCLE; no less than $55 million for International Disaster Assistance for Pakistani IDPs; $45.6 million for diplomatic and consular activities; $10 million for public diplomacy broadcasting activities near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border; $10 million for Pentagon counterdrug activities; $7.6 million for USAID operating costs; and $3.5 million for Inspector General oversight of programs (in both Afghanistan and Pakistan).", "Congress also established two new funds to build Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. The first, a Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF), will receive $400 million for such purposes though FY2010. These funds will be overseen by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. The second, a Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) will receive $700 million for such purposes beginning on the final day of FY2009 and available through FY2011. These funds will be overseen by the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense. In their report, the conferees expressed concern about providing the Pentagon with oversight of an assistance program that would traditionally fall under the purview of the State Department and so directed the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to jointly develop a plan for transitioning the PCF from Defense to State by FY2010, fully executed by FY2011 ( H.Rept. 111-151 ).", "Appendix D. FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations for Other Humanitarian Assistance", "Although proposed aid packages for specific countries anticipate and identify some humanitarian needs, the Administration also seeks funding for what it describes as new FY2009 humanitarian requirements that stem from events unfolding in late 2008 and early 2009 that were not anticipated in the FY2009 regular budget request.", "Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA)", "The Administration's FY2009 emergency supplemental request initially asked for $293 million for the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account for anticipated and unanticipated refugee and migration emergencies, of which: $108 million was requested for humanitarian assistance to Iraqi refugees, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and conflict victims; $125 million was requested for the emergency needs of Palestinian refugees in West Bank and Gaza and $25 million for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon; $7 million was requested to support the work of international organizations in South Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan; $15 million was requested to assist with massive displacement and the provision of humanitarian assistance in several interconnected conflicts in Africa\u2014in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda; $10 million was requested for the global protection/emergency response requirements/food assistance worldwide, but primarily in Africa; and $3 million was requested for Burmese refugees in camps along the Thai-Burma border.

", "In explanatory language of its report, the Committee referred to ongoing concerns about whether the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is operating with sufficient transparency and is doing all that is possible to prevent the inappropriate use of funds in the form of supporting terrorists and other extremists, specifically in the West Bank and Gaza. Section 21004 of the bill focuses on accountability measures for humanitarian and project assistance to the West Bank and Gaza: Section 21004(a) would limit the funds appropriated under MRA that may be made available to UNRWA to $119 million. Section 21004(b) would require the Secretary of State to submit to the Committees on Appropriations an accountability report assessing the status on eight accountability measures. Section 21004(c) would transfer $1,000,000 from funds made available under the Economic Support Fund (ESF) to the Inspector General of the Department of State and Broadcasting Board of Governors to conduct oversight of funding made available to the West Bank and Gaza and the region.", "Senate Action", "The Senate Committee on Appropriations provided $345 million for the MRA account (which would have increased the Administration's initial request by $52 million and its revised request by $12 million) to assist refugees and IDPs.

FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations for Support of the International Monetary Fund", "On May 12, 2009, the White House formally requested that Congress consider increasing the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) based on commitments made by the U.S. government at an April G-20 meeting in London, England. G-20 nations agreed that the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), a supplemental fund to bolster IMF resources, should be increased by up to $500 billion from its present level of $50 billion. The Obama Administration has proposed a U.S. contribution of up to $100 billion. Pledges totaling $255 billion have been received from several countries and others are considering additional contributions. The G-20 also agreed that the IMF should create new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to a value of $250 billion and to allocate them to its members through its SDR Department. These new resources would expand world foreign exchange reserves by about 4% and provide needed resources to countries in crisis.", "Already pending at the time of the G-20 meeting was a proposal for a new increase in IMF quota resources. Negotiations on a package of reforms and a new quota increase had been completed in April 2008 and submitted to the House and Senate by the Bush Administration last November. The U.S. share, measured in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) pegged to a number of currencies, would be SDR 4.97 billion (about $8 billion). The package includes reforms in the IMF governance process, finances, and procedures. It also includes a proposal that the IMF sell 403 metric tons of gold to create a facility that would cover the costs of its country and global surveillance, technical assistance, research, and other non-lending operations. Also pending in 2008 was a proposed Fourth Amendment to the IMF Articles, originally proposed in 1997, that would create a new allocation of about SDR 21.4 billion.", "Some elements of the above require congressional approval and some do not. U.S. participation in the new IMF quota increase and a U.S. subscription of $100 billion for the NAB would require congressional approval. Likewise, amendments to the IMF Articles\u2014including the prospective Fourth Amendment for a new SDR allocation\u2014would require congressional approval. On the other hand, the proposed $250 billion allocation of SDRs (which is being made under a different provision of the IMF Articles) is too small to trigger the legal requirement that Congress give its assent. ", "Any contributions to the IMF, to fund increases in the U.S. quota or to subscribe new resources to the NAB, must be authorized by Congress. In 1967, a Presidential Commission on Budget Concepts recommended that U.S. payments to the IMF should not be treated as budget outlay but rather they should be counted as an exchange of assets which is matched by transfers of equivalent value to the United States from the IMF. Since that time, payments to the IMF have been deemed to have no impact on the Federal budget or on the Federal budget deficit.", "In the spring of 2009, however, there was concern that the procedural aspects of the budget process may have an impact on congressional consideration of the proposed new U.S. subscriptions to the IMF. Some are concerned that Members of Congress may vote against providing budget authority for the proposed $100 billion line of credit to the IMF through the NAB on account of \"bailout fatigue,\" even though the payment would have no outlay effect under then-existing congressional budget scorekeeping procedures. ", "Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was quoted in April 2009 as saying that he cannot see \"any analytical rationale for why something would score zero as an outlay but then score as something in budget authority.\" He reportedly urged the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the House and Senate Budget Committees to use an alternative \"exchange of assets\" procedure (like that use for IMF payments in 1976 and 1977) in which no appropriations would be required to put the $100 billion line of credit through the NAB and U.S. participation in the IMF quota increase into effect. Others have been concerned, though, that changing the existing budgetary procedure for IMF subscriptions at the present moment might weaken their support because it might be seen as an effort to change the rules in the face of controversy or a signal that the Administration fears that it may not have the votes to approve the measure through the established process. By contrast, critics of the current scorekeeping system say that it would be unfortunate if bookkeeping procedures hindered Congress from considering the IMF proposals on their merits.", "On May 12, the White House and Congress reached an agreement to treat the U.S. subscription to the IMF as a line of credit for budgetary purposes, after which, the President made the formal request to include authorization and appropriations for the IMF in the defense supplemental. Reminiscent of the method used for the 1966 quota increase, Congress has been asked by the Administration to authorize the United States to extend a line of credit to the IMF for the NAB and quota subscriptions that total $108 billion. Unlike IMF quota increases since 1967 that were treated as an exchange of assets with no budgetary impact, under the new agreed framework, the U.S. contribution would be scored as a loan for budgetary purposes under the existing credit reform legislation. This legislation says that Congress need not appropriate the full face value but only the expected amount of loss for any loans made by the United States Government. When U.S. contributions to the IMF were treated as an exchange, there was considered to be no risk of default by the IMF in its obligations to the United States. Under credit reform, a small fraction of the total would be appropriated to cover possible losses. CBO has determined that the U.S. contributions to the IMF would require $5 billion to be appropriated. This re-calculation of the cost is expected by many to ease the prospects for enacting this legislation.", "Once agreement was reached between the budget committees and the Administration on how to account for U.S. contributions in the federal budget, Senate leadership agreed to include the Administration's IMF request in the defense supplemental. The final enacted supplemental ( P.L. 111-32 ) contains the IMF funding.", "Appendix F. FY2008 and FY2009 Defense Funding, Detail Table", "Appendix G.
