However, in each of 2008 through 2015, the teen birth rate dropped below the 2006 teen birth rate, reversing the two-year upward trend. Although the birth rate for U.S. teens has dropped in 22 of the past 24 years, it remains higher than the teen birth rate of most industrialized nations.

From 1998 to 2009, federal teen pregnancy prevention efforts in the AFL program and in general relied heavily on using abstinence-only education as their primary tool.

Research indicates that teens who give birth are less likely to complete high school and go on to college, thereby reducing their potential for economic self-sufficiency. The research also indicates that the children of teens are more likely than children of older parents to experience problems in school and drop out of high school, and as adults are more likely to repeat the cycle of teenage pregnancy and poverty.

But lack of sensitive, confidential, low-cost contraceptive services and the denial of accurate and frank information about sex, are equally to blame.\" Other commentators argue that ", "teen childbearing is so high in the United States because of underlying social and economic problems.

Recently released data from the National Survey of Family Growth, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), have shown increased use of contraception at first initiation of sex and use of dual methods of contraception (that is, condoms and hormonal methods) among sexually active female and male teenagers. These trends may have contributed to the recent birth rate declines.", "According to several commentators, several factors have been discussed among researchers as reasons underlying the falling teen birth rate during the period since 2007. Some of these factors include (1) the recession that started in late 2007 and ended in the middle of 2009; (2) the slight increase in IUD use; (3) the popular MTV show that deglamorized teen pregnancy; (4) the use of the Plan B \"morning after\" pill; and (5) increased use of the Internet via iPhones which allow teenagers immediate access to information they may have been too embarrassed to ask parents or other adults.

The other group claims a comprehensive approach to sex education provides today's youth with the information and decisionmaking skills needed to make realistic, practical decisions about whether to engage in sexual activities. They contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence, gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure, and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Given that 47.4% (2011 data) of high school students have experienced sexual intercourse, advocates argue that abstinence-only messages provide no protection against the risks of pregnancy and disease for these youth. They further point out that according to one study, teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such a promise. In addition, the high number of females under age 25 with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has re-energized efforts to persuade girls and young women to abstain from sexual activity or to use condoms (along with other forms of contraceptives) to prevent or reduce pregnancy and reduce their risk of getting STIs.", "A nationally representative survey conducted in 2012 found that (1) 93% of adults and 87% of teens agree that young people should get a strong message that they should not have sex until they are at least out of high school, and (2) a majority of adults (74%) and many teens (49%) want teens to get more information about both abstinence and contraception. Specifically with regard to federally funded programs, 62% of parents of teens indicated that teens should be provided with information about both postponing sex and about birth control or protection.

They argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinence-only message.

The Obama Administration is supportive of using rigorous evaluation (i.e., a scientific method using experimental and control groups) to determine whether untested innovative programs are effective. As discussed later, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has compiled a list of 37 evidence-based program models that it has found to be effective in delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraception use for sexually active youth, or reducing teen pregnancy. This list includes many programs designed to educate youth on both abstinence and contraception for the purpose of preventing teen pregnancy. It also includes a couple of programs that many would consider abstinence-only education programs. The evidence-based approach to teen pregnancy prevention holds the view that whatever services or program components that are proven to be effective should be replicated or expanded upon by entities seeking federal dollars to prevent pregnancy among young people.", "Evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs are varied and approach the problem from different frameworks. Some teen pregnancy prevention programs seek to delay the first time teens have sex. Others have an underlying goal of trying to decipher the root reasons behind teen pregnancy and childbearing. Is it loneliness or trying to find love or a sense of family? Is it carelessness (not bothering with birth control or using it improperly), or shame (not wanting to go to the doctor to ask about birth control or not wanting to be seen in a pharmacy purchasing birth control)? Is it a need to meet the sexual expectations of a partner? Is it trying to find individual independence or is it defiance (a mentality of \"you can't boss me or control me\u2014I'm grown\")? Is it trying to validate and/or provide purpose to one's life? Is it realistically facing the probability that the entry-level job she can get at the age of 18 is the same or similar to the one she will likely have when she is 30, thus why should she wait to have a child?", "In addition, the purpose of several teen pregnancy prevention programs is to prevent second or additional births to teens. The more successful of such programs recognize that a different approach is often needed to prevent secondary births as compared to first births.
