Other major appropriation legislation includes the defenseappropriations bill, which provides funds for all non-construction military activities of theDepartment of Defense and constitutes more than 90% of national security-related spending, and theenergy and water development appropriations bill, which provides funding for atomic energy defenseactivities of the Department of Energy and for civil projects carried out by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers. Two other appropriations bills, VA-HUD-Independent Agencies andCommerce-Justice-State, also include small amounts for national defense.

Twoseparate defense appropriations bills are written annually, a \"Military Construction AppropriationsAct\" dedicated to military construction, and a \"National Defense Appropriations Act\" covering allother defense appropriations. (7) Normally only one\"National Defense Authorization Act\" is passedeach year to authorize both of these appropriations.

Traditionally, military construction was funded through annual defense or supplemental appropriations bills. However, the Korean War prompted a surge of military construction, followed by a steady increasein military construction appropriations. Given the strong and enduring security threat posed by theSoviet Union, a relatively high level of spending on military infrastructure appeared likely tocontinue. The appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees andcreated a separate military construction bill. The first stand-alone military construction bill waswritten for FY1959 (P.L. 85-852).", "Military construction appropriations are not the sole source of funds available to defense agencies for facility investment.
