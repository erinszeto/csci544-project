The act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") and an Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, to whom the Secretary of Labor has delegated his enforcement rights and obligations under the act. The act also established the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\"OSHRC\"), an adjudicatory agency independent of the Department of Labor, and therefore OSHA, that is tasked with reviewing enforcement actions.

Additionally, work-related injuries disabled approximately 2.2 million Americans each year. Congress therefore found existing health and safety standards inadequate at protecting workers and passed the OSH Act, whereby it sought a \"comprehensive, nationwide approach\" to occupational health and safety.

For example, Section 4(b)(1) of the act provides that the act does not apply \"to working conditions of employees with respect to which other federal agencies \u2026 exercise statutory authority\" over occupational safety and health regulations and standards. Congress apparently intended this language to prevent regulatory inefficiency by precluding OSHA from duplicating worker safety efforts in areas already regulated by other agencies. To that end, health and safety regulations of other agencies that apply to a workplace hazard preempt OSHA's regulations regarding that hazard. The OSH Act further expressly limits its applicability by allowing states to control occupational safety and health regulation through state plans. If OSHA approves of a state plan, which requires, among other things, that the plan provide health and safety protection that is at least as adequate as the protections provided by OSHA, then the state plan requirements, and not OSHA's standards and regulations, will apply. Finally, the OSH Act applies only to employment performed in U.S. states and territories, generally does not apply to federal, state, or local government employment, and only applies to employers with employees (i.e., it does not apply to self-employed people)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standards", "paragraphs": ["The OSH Act contains two primary enforcement provisions, each of which furnishes a unique obligation upon employers. First, Section 5(a)(1) of the act, the so-called \"General Duty Clause,\" requires all employers, regardless of industry, to provide workplaces that are free of potentially harmful hazards. Second, the act mandates employer compliance with OSHA's workplace safety standards, some of which are industry specific. The General Duty Clause and OSHA's workplace safety standards are treated the same for purposes of complaints, inspections, and citations. That is, employers are equally bound to comply with the General Duty Clause and applicable OSHA standards and both are similarly enforced through complaints, inspections, and citations. OSHA bears the burden of showing that an employer has violated the General Duty Clause or an OSHA standard by a preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, employers cannot be held liable for violations of the General Duty Clause or an OSHA standard unless they had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation's existence. Thus, after establishing that an employer has violated the General Duty Clause or an OSHA standard by a preponderance of the evidence, OSHA bears the added burden of proving that the employer did so with actual or constructive knowledge."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Duty Clause", "paragraphs": ["Under the General Duty Clause, employers must provide employees with \"employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\" Apparently recognizing the impracticality of having OSHA issue safety standards for every type of employer and employment, Congress intended the General Duty Clause to be a catchall provision establishing a broad employer duty to protect worker health and safety in the absence of applicable OSHA-created standards. To that end, when an OSHA-created standard applies to a hazard, an employer's compliance with the standard can be deemed to satisfy, and thereby preempt, the General Duty Clause. However, this preemption occurs only when the employer successfully proves, as an affirmative defense, that the OSHA standard adequately addresses the hazard or, if the standard inadequately addresses the hazard, that the employer did not know of the inadequacy of the standard. Thus, if an employer knows that a safety standard inadequately protects employees against a hazard, the employer must still comply with the General Duty Clause regarding that hazard. ", "To successfully prove a violation of the General Duty Clause, OSHA must show that (1) a workplace condition poses a hazard to an employee; (2) the employer constructively or actually recognizes that the workplace condition is a hazard; (3) the hazard is causing, or is likely to cause, serious physical harm or death; and (4) feasible means exist to materially reduce or eliminate the hazard.

This does not require actual harm to an employee; the ability of a workplace condition to harm an employee can render it a hazard. Additionally, OSHRC has recognized that a workplace condition can be a hazard absent a significant chance that the condition will injure an employee. On the other hand, for a condition to be a hazard, it must occur in \"other than a freakish or utterly implausible concurrence of circumstances.\" Accordingly, for a workplace condition to be a hazard, it must be more than \"utterly implausible\" that the condition will injure or kill an employee, but there need not be a significant chance that it will injure or kill an employee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Recognized\" Hazard", "paragraphs": ["If a workplace condition is a hazard, OSHA must establish that it is a \"recognized\" hazard to prove a violation of the General Duty Clause. A recognized hazard is a workplace condition that is either recognized as hazardous by the employer's industry, or that the employer actually knows to be hazardous. In determining that an industry recognizes a hazard, OSHRC has found persuasive evidence showing that, for example, accepted industry standards or industry publications acknowledge the hazard. Similarly, OSHA can establish an employer's actual knowledge of a hazardous condition by putting forth various types of evidence, including evidence showing that there were numerous previous accidents or injuries or employee complaints. An employer's actual knowledge of a hazardous condition can sustain a General Duty Clause violation even if the employer's industry has not recognized the condition as hazardous."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Serious Harm or Death", "paragraphs": ["If OSHA successfully establishes that a workplace condition is a recognized hazard, it must prove that the hazard is causing, or is likely to cause, serious physical injury or death to an employee. OSHRC has held that the probability that physical harm or death will occur, which it considers when determining whether a hazard exists as discussed above, is irrelevant in determining whether a recognized hazard is causing, or is likely to cause, serious physical harm or death to employees. Rather, OSHRC considers the level of physical harm that an employee would face if an accident were to happen, no matter how slight the chance an accident would happen in the first place. For example, in Waldon Health Care Center , a hazardous workplace condition presented only a small chance that employees would catch Hepatitis B, a virus from which, OSHRC noted, most people fully recover. Even so, OSHRC found serious physical harm or death likely because a small percentage of people that catch Hepatitis B die or do not fully recover from it, and the hazardous condition therefore had the chance, though apparently slight, of seriously injuring or killing employees. Previous incidents wherein the recognized hazard caused serious physical harm or death are not necessary to establish that the hazard is causing, or is likely to cause, injury or death. However, it appears that previous injuries or deaths are sufficient , unless rebutted, to establish that the hazard is causing, or is likely to cause, serious physical injury or death. Reviewing courts generally defer to OSHRC determinations that a recognized hazard is likely to cause serious injury or death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Feasible Means Exist to Reduce or Eliminate Hazard", "paragraphs": ["Courts and the OSHRC generally agree that Congress did not intend the General Duty Clause to protect employees against all conceivable workplace hazards. Rather, Congress intended the clause to protect employees against only hazards that are preventable . Accordingly, if OSHA successfully establishes that a workplace condition poses a recognized hazard that is likely to cause serious physical harm or death to an employee, OSHA must then prove that the hazard is preventable; that is, feasible means of materially reducing the hazard exist. In practice, litigation of whether feasible means of reducing a recognized hazard exist appears to unfold in two steps. First, because OSHA bears the burden of establishing that a feasible means of abatement exists, OSHA must initially show that an employer could feasibly take specific actions that would materially reduce a risk to employees. Next, the employer often responds by arguing that OSHA's suggested actions are infeasible.", "OSHA bears the burden of showing that a feasible means of materially reducing a hazard exists, which requires it to show that specific abatement actions by an employer would feasibly and materially reduce the hazard. These abatement actions generally appear to fall into two categories: physical means of abatement and abatement by implementing new or additional procedures. When proposing an abatement action, OSHA can show its feasibility through evidence showing, for example, that similar employers in the industry have successfully implemented the means of abatement or industry standards recommend the means of abatement. If an employer does not rebut OSHA's evidence by putting forth his own evidence showing that the suggested means of abatement would be infeasible or ineffective at reducing the hazard, OSHA has successfully met its burden of establishing that a feasible means exists to reduce or eliminate a hazard.", "Employers often attempt to rebut OSHA's evidence by showing that OSHA's suggested means of abatement is infeasible or ineffective. They may do so by, among other things, proving that the suggested means of abatement is cost prohibitive or, though possible to implement and its implementation would significantly and materially reduce the cited hazard, the suggested means of abatement causes some greater harm. For example, in Cargill, Inc. , OSHA suggested that a grain elevator and feed mill operator upwardly extend sheet casings at the top of a vertical conveyor through the roof of a building so that, in the event of a grain dust explosion, air could escape and prevent secondary explosions and fires. In response, the employer presented evidence that extending the casings would pierce structural beams which support the roof, thereby seriously weakening the roof, and OSHA did not challenge the employer's evidence on this point. OSHRC, accepting the employer's evidence, found OSHA's suggested means of abatement infeasible because, while it may have reduced the risks of secondary grain dust explosions, it would have created a new risk by weakening the roof such that the roof could collapse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actual or Constructive Knowledge", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the four elements discussed above, to successfully hold an employer in violation of the General Duty Clause, OSHA must prove that an employer had actual or constructive knowledge of the condition that violated the OSH Act. This requirement of actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the employer also applies to violations of OSHA-created standards, discussed below. OSHRC has held that OSHA does not have to prove that an employer knew the requirements of the act or knew that a condition violated the act to establish an employer's knowledge. Rather, OSHA must show that the employer knew of the physical conditions giving rise to the violation.", "Proving actual knowledge is generally as straightforward as it sounds: OSHA can do so through evidence showing that the employer knew that the violating condition existed. Conversely, demonstrating an employer's constructive knowledge of a violating condition is less straightforward. This requires OSHA to prove that, though the employer did not know the condition existed, the employer could have known about the condition through the exercise of reasonable diligence. OSHA can prove constructive knowledge by showing, for example, that the employer did not have an adequate safety program for promoting compliance with safety standards or that the condition was in plain view. The amount of time that a violating condition existed is relevant to determining whether it could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence; the longer a condition existed, the more likely courts and OSHRC are to find that the condition could have been discovered through reasonable diligence. For example, in R.P. Carbone Construction Co. , a construction company allegedly failed to exercise reasonable diligence to protect its employees from potential falls while building a steel structure. OSHRC found, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld, that because employees' lack of fall protection was plainly observable throughout the construction site and existed for approximately two weeks, the exercise of reasonable diligence could have informed the employer that the employees lacked fall protection.", "A supervisory employee's actual or constructive knowledge of a condition can generally be imputed to the supervisor's employer. A supervisory employee is one to whom an employer has delegated authority over other employees, even if only temporarily. In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (\"Fifth Circuit\"), however, if a supervisor's own conduct caused a condition that violates the act, the supervisor's knowledge of the condition cannot be imputed to his employer unless his conduct was foreseeable. The Fifth Circuit has held that a supervisor's violative conduct is not foreseeable, and therefore a supervisor's knowledge of his own violative conduct cannot be imputed onto an employer, if an employer has sufficient safety policies, training, and disciplinary procedures in place."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSHA-Created Standards", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the obligations under the General Duty Clause, employers must \"comply with occupational safety and health standards\" that OSHA promulgates pursuant to Section 5(a)(2) of the OSH Act. The OSH Act defines occupational safety and health standards as standards requiring \"conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\" OSHA-created standards generally take two forms: specific standards and general standards. Specific standards narrowly apply to specified industries or activities (e.g., a standard applicable to logging). General standards apply to classes of hazards that may be found throughout a number of industries (e.g., fire prevention standards). In order to establish that an employer violated an OSHA-created standard, OSHA bears the burden of proving that (1) the standard applies to the cited workplace condition; (2) the employer did not comply with the terms of the standard; and (3) employees had access to the cited workplace condition. Additionally, as is also necessary to establish a violation of the General Duty Clause as discussed above, for OSHA to prove a violation of OSHA-created standards it must prove that the employer had actual or constructive knowledge of the cited condition. More specifically, OSHA must establish that the employer knew, or could have known through reasonable diligence, of the existence of the cited condition. ", "In determining whether a standard applies to an employer's conduct, OSHRC generally considers the activity that the employer was engaged in when the citation arose. For example, in Pico Industries , OSHRC observed that when an employer was \"engaged in steel erection activity,\" a standard applicable to steel erection applied. Under OSHA regulations, if multiple standards apply to an activity or hazard, the most specific standard preempts more general standard(s). The reverse is also true: general standards apply when there is no applicable specific industry standard.", "OSHA standards include, for example, those found in Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Title 29 Parts 1910 (general standards), 1915 (shipyard standards), 1917 (marine terminal standards), 1918 (longshoring standards), 1926 (construction standards), and 1928 (agriculture standards). Employers are responsible for determining which standards apply to them and following the requirements of applicable standards even in the absence of any action by OSHA.

In other words, variances excuse only failure to comply with OSHA standards occurring after OSHA grants a variance; they do not retroactively remedy violations of standards.

First, the employer must show that he cannot comply with a standard by its effective date because professional or technical personnel, materials, or equipment needed to comply with the standard are unavailable, or because the employer cannot finish necessary facility alterations or construction by the effective date. Second, the employer must show that he is protecting his employees against the hazard covered by the standard despite not following the standard. Third, the employer must show that a program is in place for complying with the standard as quickly as practicably possible. OSHA cannot grant a temporary variance unless the employer's employees are first given notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, a hearing on the variance.

In granting a permanent variance, OSHA must determine, on the record after the opportunity for inspection and, where appropriate, hearing, that the employer has successfully met his burden. Additionally, before OSHA can grant a permanent variance, affected employees must receive notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, a hearing on the application for a permanent variance.", "Permanent variances are permanent in the sense that they generally do not contain an expiration date.

The act authorizes OSHA to promulgate regulations requiring employers to maintain records of, and report, non-minor injuries, deaths, and illnesses that are work-related. Under this authority, OSHA has passed generally applicable regulations requiring certain employers to maintain workplace injury and illness records and submit such records to OSHA. OSHA's recordkeeping requirements for workplace injuries and illnesses are perhaps best considered by reference to two questions. First, as a threshold matter, to what employers do OSHA's recordkeeping regulations for workplace injuries and illnesses apply? Second, if OSHA's recordkeeping regulations apply to an employer, what workplace injuries and illnesses must be recorded and reported?", "OSHA's recordkeeping requirements for workplace injuries and illnesses generally apply to all employers within the OSH Act's scope, subject to two broad exceptions. First, the recordkeeping requirements do not apply to employers that had a total of 10 or fewer employees at all times during the last calendar year. Second, the recordkeeping requirements do not apply to employers falling within one of the \"low hazard retail, service, finance, insurance, or real estate\" employer groups listed in the relevant OSHA regulations. This list of exempted employer groups is extensive and specific; it includes, for example, hardware stores, gasoline service stations, used car dealers, and apparel and accessory stores. ", "The recordkeeping regulations require employers operating multiple establishments, or physical locations where business is conducted, to distinguish between exempted and non-exempted establishments for recordkeeping purposes. For example, if an employer owns a factory that produces clothes (i.e., an establishment that is not on the list of exempt employer groups) and an apparel store that sells the clothes (i.e., an establishment that is on the list of exempt employer groups), the employer would have to maintain workplace injury and illness records for the factory but not the apparel store, provided that the employer has a total of 11 or more employees. Even if an employer qualifies for an exception from recordkeeping requirements, he must still maintain records if selected to participate in OSHA's annual employer survey, discussed below in the context of reporting requirements, or asked to do so by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). ", "If an employer is required to keep workplace injury and illness records, he does not need to keep records on all workplace injuries and illnesses. Rather, the employer is only required to keep records on injuries and illnesses that are (1) \"work-related,\" (2) \"new case[s],\" and (3) qualify as injuries and illnesses as defined in the relevant regulations. An injury or illness is work-related if an event in the workplace caused, contributed to, or significantly aggravated the injury or illness. If an injury or illness results from workplace events, it is generally presumed to be a work-related injury. Additionally, covered employers are only required to keep records of \"new cases,\" meaning the employee has not had a previous injury or illness recorded of the same type affecting the same body part or, if the employee has, he recovered completely in the interim between the previous injury or illness and the current one. An employee has recovered completely if all signs or symptoms have disappeared.

Such serious work-related injuries include those resulting in: (1) deaths of employees; (2) hospitalizations that lead to any employee receiving in-patient treatment; or (3) an employee's amputations or loss of an eye. Employers must report work-related deaths to OSHA within eight hours of their occurrence, but have 24 hours to report work-related in-patient hospitalizations, amputations, or eye losses. Reports of serious injuries must be made to OSHA via telephone, or through electronic submission at OSHA.gov.", "The second instance wherein employers must report workplace injury and illness data to OSHA outside of the context of an inspection occurs when OSHA selects an employer to participate in its annual survey. OSHA regulations require the randomly selected employers in certain industries that receive OSHA's annual survey form to complete the form and send it back to OSHA. The form generally requires employers to submit information from their injury and illness records. However, as discussed earlier in this report, not all employers are required to keep injury and illness records under OSHA regulations. If OSHA sends an annual survey form to an employer that is exempted from the injury and illness recordkeeping requirements, the employer is required to keep such records for the following year and subsequently return the survey form to OSHA.", "In November 2013, OSHA proposed a rule that would eliminate OSHA's annual survey of employers, but heighten employers' obligations to report injury and illness data to OSHA. Under the rule, employers that are already required to keep injury and illness records would have to submit information from these records to OSHA electronically. The rule thus does not appear to impose additional recordkeeping obligations on employers. The frequency of the compulsory submissions required by the rule would vary based on the size of the employer. Employers that had 250 or more employees in the previous calendar year would be required to submit injury and illness information four times per year. Employers that had 20 or more employees in the previous calendar year and are in certain designated industries would have to submit the required data every year. Additionally, all employers, regardless of their size, would have to submit injury and illness information to OSHA if OSHA informs them that they must do so.

First, any OSHA entrance into, and inspection of, a worksite must be \"reasonable.\" More specifically, OSHA can only enter and inspect workplaces at \"reasonable times\" such as during work hours, \"within reasonable limits,\" and \"in a reasonable manner.\" Second, the Supreme Court has held that OSHA inspections are subject to the Fourth Amendment, and thus OSHA needs a warrant to inspect worksites without employer permission.", "Inspection unreasonableness is an affirmative defense to a citation resulting from that inspection that must be raised and proven by an employer. To succeed, an employer must point toward unreasonable OSHA conduct in violation of the OSH Act. The employer must also show that OSHA's unreasonable conduct prejudiced the employer. The inquiry into whether an OSHA inspection was unreasonable is factual, varying from case-to-case. For example, OSHRC has found an OSHA inspection unreasonable when a city building inspector gave an employer 10 days to correct violations of building codes and forwarded the employer's building code violations to OSHA, which then conducted an inspection before the 10 day correction period expired. After inspection, OSHA cited the employer for the same hazards as the city building inspector, which OSHRC deemed \"inherently unfair and unreasonable.\" If an employer succeeds in establishing that an inspection was unreasonable in violation of the OSH Act, any evidence obtained through that inspection cannot be used against the employer.", "In addition to being limited by the OSH Act reasonableness restrictions, the Supreme Court held in Sec'y of Labor v. Barlow's that OSHA inspections are limited by the Fourth Amendment, and OSHA therefore needs a warrant to inspect an employer's worksite over the employer's objections. In Barlow's , when an OSHA inspector went to the defendant's electrical and plumbing installation business to conduct an inspection, the defendant refused the inspector entry citing his Fourth Amendment rights. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable governmental searches applies to both homes and workplaces. The court observed that, generally, warrantless governmental searches are presumptively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, despite noting that nothing in the language of the OSH Act appears to require a warrant or any other process before an OSHA inspection, OSHA inspectors generally cannot conduct an inspection without first obtaining a warrant. However, this warrant requirement does not apply to OSHA inspections that are conducted with an employer's consent.", "If proper authority for an inspection exists (i.e., the inspection is reasonable under the OSH Act and complies with the warrant requirement if the employer objects to inspection), OSHA can conduct both programmed and unprogrammed inspections.

The act requires that any such employee request for an inspection be in writing, detail the grounds for the inspection with \"reasonable particularity,\" and be signed by the employee or employee's representative. Once an employee requests an OSHA inspection, OSHA determines whether there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the alleged imminent danger or violation exists. If OSHA determines that such reasonable grounds are present, OSHA must conduct an inspection. If OSHA determines, however, that reasonable grounds do not exist, it must inform the requesting employee of such and is not obligated to conduct an inspection. Though not addressed in the OSH Act, OSHA regulations allow an employee to internally appeal OSHA's determination that no reasonable grounds for an inspection exist. If, on review, OSHA again finds inspection unwarranted, such a finding is \"final and not subject to further review.\" OSHA similarly conducts inspections based on referrals, which are distinguished from employee complaints because they generally originate from third parties.

OSHA may also conduct inspections in response to reports by other federal, state, or local government agencies. ", "Unprogrammed OSHA inspections can also result from the reports of serious injuries that employers are required to make to OSHA. As discussed earlier in this report, all employers subject to the OSH Act must report to OSHA any workplace accidents resulting in an employee's death, in-patient hospitalization, or amputation or loss of an eye.

OSHA regulations clarify when advance notice of an inspection is authorized, and thus can be given without violating the act. Under these regulations, advance notice is only permitted when (1) there is an imminent danger, so that the employer can attempt to remedy the danger immediately; (2) an inspection would be best conducted after normal business hours or other special preparations must be completed before an inspection; (3) it is necessary to ensure that parties who must be allowed to accompany an inspector can be present; and (4) OSHA determines advance notice would better effectuate inspection.", "OSHA is authorized to set the time for an inspection, subject to the reasonableness restrictions discussed earlier in this report. Even so, OSHA generally conducts inspections during regular working hours unless \"special circumstances indicate otherwise.\" When an OSHA inspector arrives at a worksite for an inspection, he must present his credentials to the employer and \"explain the nature and purpose of the inspection.\" Further, if the employer must keep injury and illness records, the OSHA inspector can ask for copies of such records, which the employer must provide within four hours. At the onset of the inspection, the OSHA inspector must inform the employer of what records he wants to review.", "The OSH Act allows both employers and employees to have a representative accompany an OSHA inspector during an inspection. OSHA regulations further allow additional employer or employee representatives to accompany OSHA inspectors when inspectors find that additional representatives will assist inspection. Employees' representatives must generally also be employees of the employer. However, inspectors have the discretion to permit third parties to serve as employee representatives if an inspector determines that such representation is \"reasonably necessary\" to conducting an \"effective and thorough\" worksite inspection. Additionally, inspectors can deny any representative from accompanying them during inspections when the representative's accompaniment would inhibit the inspection.", "During a worksite inspection, OSHA inspectors can collect environmental samples, take pictures or videos, or use any other reasonable investigation methods. OSHA inspectors may also consult with employees regarding potential health and safety concerns, and employees must be given the opportunity to inform the inspector of any OSH Act violations that they believe exist at the worksite. If an inspector uncovers an imminent danger that could immediately cause death or serious injury, he must inform affected employees and employers. The inspector will then encourage the employer to remedy the danger. If the employer refuses to or cannot remedy the danger, the OSH Act grants federal district courts jurisdiction to restrain any workplace conditions or practices posing such imminent dangers. ", "A regulatory requirement that inspections not unreasonably disrupt workplace operations constrains OSHA inspector conduct during an inspection. Additionally, the OSH Act generally requires inspectors to keep confidential any information obtained during an inspection containing, or with the potential to reveal, trade secrets. However, inspectors can disclose such information in two circumstances: (1) when needed to effectuate enforcement of the act, they can disclose such information to officers and employees and (2) they can disclose such information in proceedings under the act. When an inspector discloses information containing trade secrets during a proceeding, the entity hearing the proceeding (i.e., OSHA, the OSHRC, or a court) issues any orders that are appropriate to protect the information from further disclosure.", "At the end of an inspection, the OSHA inspector conducts a closing conference with the employer and employee representatives. This conference can occur jointly\u2014with both representatives\u2014or separately, on-site or via telephone.

If, after reviewing the inspection report, OSHA believes that an employer has violated the OSH Act or an OSHA standard, the act requires OSHA to issue a citation to the employer. OSHA must issue this citation \"with reasonable promptness\" no more than six months after the OSH Act or OSHA standard violation.

Additionally, a notice of proposed penalty must inform the employer that the proposed penalties will become final unless the employer seeks their appeal within 15 working days of receiving the notification. Under the act, penalties vary depending on the seriousness and type of violation that occurred.

De minimis violations do not result in citations; if an employer commits a de minimis violation, OSHA issues the employer a notice instead of a citation.

An employer intentionally disregards the requirements of the act when he actually knows what the act requires yet fails to comply with the act. Even if an employer does not actually know of the requirements of the act, he can be found to have willfully violated the act if his behavior shows plain indifference toward employee safety, which requires OSHA to show that the employer's state of mind was such that even if he were aware of the violation, he would not care. Employers have not willfully violated the act if they reasonably, and in good faith, believed their conduct was not in violation of the act. Additionally, it is generally harder for OSHA to prove a willful violation of the General Duty Clause than a willful violation of an OSHA standard because it is more difficult to prove that an employer intentionally disregarded, or was plainly indifferent to, \"the broad duty to 'furnish a place of employment free from recognized hazards.'\"", "An employer that willfully violates the OSH Act faces a mandatory penalty of between $5,000 and $70,000.

If OSHA successfully meets its burden, an employer can potentially raise a number of defenses. For example, the employer can argue that the original citation did not particularly describe the violation such that he lacked notice of what was needed to abate the hazard, or that the original cited hazard, which became final due to operation of law rather than adjudication, did not violate the OSH Act.

To meet its burden of establishing that the latter violation is substantially similar to the prior violation, OSHA can show that both citations result from the employer's failure to comply with the same standard. The burden then shifts to the employer to show that the two violations are not substantially similar by, for example, showing that they involve different conditions or hazards. Violations of the same specific standards, rather than general standards, make two violations more likely to be substantially similar because the violations are more likely to involve the same conditions and hazards.

Circuit. Additionally, OSHA can seek appeal of an OSHRC order. Petition for review of an OSHRC order, whether by an adversely affected party or OSHA, must be filed within 60 days of the OSHRC order. Filing a petition for review of an OSHRC order does not stay the order; the order remains in effect until a court of appeals vacates it. On review, the courts of appeal find OSHRC's findings of facts conclusive if the facts are supported by substantial evidence. "], "subsections": []}]}}
