More specifically, concern has focused on whether and how potential environmental issues related to this GM salmon might be addressed. In response to these concerns, several bills were introduced in the 112th Congress seeking to declare GM fish unsafe and thus prevent FDA approval of this salmon for human consumption or to require that GM fish be specifically labeled. No final action was taken on these bills by the 112th Congress.", "Genetic engineering techniques allow the manipulation of inherited traits to modify and improve organisms. Several GM fish and seafood products are currently under development and offer potential benefits such as increasing aquaculture productivity and improving human health. However, some are concerned that, in this rapidly evolving field, current technological and regulatory safeguards are inadequate to protect the environment and ensure public acceptance that these products are safe for consumption. (The safety of GM foods for human consumption is not addressed in this report.)", "In the early 2000s, several efforts began to develop GM fish and seafood products, with a GM AquAdvantage salmon developed by AquaBounty, Inc., in the forefront of efforts to produce a new product for human consumption. By September 2010, requested data had been provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by AquaBounty, and FDA's Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee held public hearings on the approval of AquAdvantage salmon for human consumption. The public comment period on FDA approval closed on November 22, 2010.", "Environmental concerns related to the development of GM fish include the potential for detrimental competition with wild fish, and possible interbreeding with wild fish so as to allow the modified genetic material to escape into the wild fish population. Sterilization and bioconfinement have been proposed as means of isolating GM fish to minimize harm to wild fish populations. To address these concerns, AquaBounty proposed producing salmon eggs (all sterile females) in Canada, shipping these eggs to Panama, growing and processing fish in Panama, and shipping table-ready, processed fish to the United States for retail sale.", "On December 20, 2012, FDA announced the availability for public comment of (1) a draft environmental assessment of the proposed conditions specified by AquaBounty and (2) FDA's preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for AquaBounty's conditions. A 60-day public comment period initially ran through February 25, 2013, but was extended through April 26, 2013. If significant new information or challenges arise in the public comments, FDA must decide whether or not a full environmental impact statement is required prior to approval of AquaBounty's application. If approved, AquAdvantage salmon would be the first GM animal approved for human consumption."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Farmers and scientists have a history of modifying animals to maximize desirable traits. Genetic modification is one of the current approaches for modifying animals to increase their beneficial traits. In the broadest sense, genetic modification refers to changes in an organism's genetic makeup not occurring in nature, including the production of conventional hybrids. With the advent of modern biotechnology (e.g., genetic engineering or bioengineering), it is now possible to take the gene (or genes) for a specific trait either from an organism of the same species or from an entirely different one and transfer it to create an organism having a unique genetic code. This technique can add both speed and efficiency to the development of new foods and products. Genetically engineered plant varieties, such as herbicide-resistant corn and soybeans, have already been widely adopted by U.S. farmers, and some advocate using similar techniques to produce genetically engineered fish or seafood for the aquaculture industry.", "A number of environmental concerns have been raised related to the development of genetically modified (GM) fish, including the potential for detrimental competition with wild fish, and possible interbreeding with wild fish so as to allow the modified genetic material to escape into the wild fish population.

Fish are being modified to improve the production of human food, to produce pharmaceuticals, to test water contamination, and for other uses.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates GM fish under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) provisions on new animal drugs (21 U.S.C. \u00a7321). Under these provisions, FDA must keep all information about a pending drug application confidential, with the exception of information publicly disclosed by the manufacturer. This approach limits the opportunity for public comment before approval. Some critics are calling for more transparency in this process and for more authority to be given to environmental and wildlife agencies.", "One GM fish has been marketed to date. Glofish\u2122, a genetically altered version of the popular aquaria zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), fluoresce after the insertion of a sea anemone gene into the zebrafish egg. This fish is currently legal to be sold in all states except California. Since Glofish\u2122 are not meant for human consumption, FDA determined that the Glofish\u2122 was not under its jurisdiction.", "Another private research company has taken genetic information from Chinook salmon and ocean pout (an eel-like, edible fish) and inserted this material into Atlantic salmon to create a fish that grows to market size twice as fast as its non-GM counterparts. This company, AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., is currently seeking regulatory approval from the FDA to sell its AquAdvantage salmon for human consumption in the United States and received a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture for work on transgenic tilapia. Other examples of GM fish that have been developed, but for which regulatory approval has not yet been sought, include fish that would produce a blood-clotting factor to treat individuals with hemophilia and disease-resistant channel catfish.

One study postulated a \"Trojan gene hypothesis\" after observing that GM Japanese medaka, a fish commonly used as an experimental model, were able to out-compete nonaltered fish for mates in a laboratory environment. However, the resulting offspring of this mating between GM fish and wild fish were less fit, lacking certain physical or behavioral attributes that resulted in the eventual demise of the modified population.", "The ecological risks of stocking GM shellfish in the wild have not yet been thoroughly examined, since confining and isolating these organisms is more difficult than confinement of many fish species, due to their methods of reproduction and dispersal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competition with Wild Fish", "paragraphs": ["Even if fast-growing GM fish do not spread their genes among their wild counterparts, critics fear GM fish could disrupt the ecology of streams by competing with native fish for scarce resources. Escaped transgenic fish could harm wild fish through increased competition or predation. In addition, some argue that transgenic fish, especially if modified to improve their ability to withstand wider ranges of salinity or temperature, could be difficult or impossible to eradicate, similar to an invasive species. The consequences of such competition would depend on many factors, including the health of the wild population, the number and specific genetic strain of the escaped fish, and local environmental conditions. Critics maintain that an indication of the magnitude of this potential problem may be noted where non-GM Atlantic salmon from nearshore net pens in the northwest United States and British Columbia have escaped and entered streams, in some cases outnumbering their wild Pacific salmon counterparts.", "However, it is not known whether GM fish could survive in the wild in sufficient numbers to inflict permanent population damage. One study indicated that, when food supplies were low, GM fish might have the ability to harm a wild population, although the authors caution that laboratory experiments may not reflect what would happen in the wild.

Fertilized fish eggs that are subjected to a heat or pressure shock retain an extra set of chromosomes. The resulting triploid fish do not develop normal sexual characteristics and, in general, the degree of sterility in triploid females is greater than males. Thus, all-female lines of triploid fish are considered to be one of the best current methods to insure nonbreeding populations of GM fish. Nonetheless, there are batch-to-batch variations, and it is uncertain whether this method could be effective for all species; it has not been successful for shrimp, for example. Also, critics question whether escaped triploid fish, which in some species have sufficient sex hormone levels to enable normal courtship behavior, could mate with wild individuals, lowering reproductive success of the wild population.", "Other sterilization methods are currently under study, and it is likely that research in this area will increase options.

Because scientists are able to directly select traits they wish to create or amplify, the desired change can be achieved in very few generations, making it faster and lower in cost than traditional methods, which may require many generations of selective breeding. Genetic modification techniques allow scientists to precisely select traits for improvement, enabling them to create an organism that is not just larger and faster-growing, but potentially improved, for example, by increasing nutritional content. Proponents claim that faster-growing fish could make fish farming more productive, increasing yields while reducing the amount of feed needed, which in turn could reduce waste. With intense exploitation of wild fish stocks, GM fish and seafood could be important means to meet increasing human nutrition needs and address food security concerns.", "Shellfish and finfish, genetically modified to improve disease resistance, could reduce the use of antibiotics. Increased cold resistance in fish could lead to the ability to grow seafood in previously inhospitable environments, allowing aquaculture to expand into previously unsuitable areas. Research efforts are also under way to improve human health by genetically modifying fish to produce human drugs like a blood clotting factor and to create shellfish that will not provoke allergic reactions. Biotechnology proponents claim that these advantages could translate into a number of potential benefits, such as reduced costs to producers, lower prices for consumers for edible fish and pharmaceuticals, and environmental benefits, such as reduced water pollution from wastes. Food scientists and the aquaculture industry may support the introduction of genetic engineering, provided that issues of product safety, environmental concerns, ethics, and information are satisfactorily addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disadvantages", "paragraphs": ["On the other hand, while the majority of consumers in the United States appear to have generally accepted GM food and feed crops, it is uncertain whether consumers will be as accepting of GM fish. Although such fish may taste the same and are expected, like their traditionally bred counterparts, to be less expensive than wild-caught fish, ethical concerns over the appropriate use of animals, in addition to environmental concerns, may affect public acceptance of GM fish as food. Ongoing campaigns by environmental and consumer groups have asked grocers, restaurants, and distributors to sign a pledge to not sell GM fish products, even if they are approved by FDA.", "In addition, the commercial fishing industry says that it has successfully educated the public to discriminate among fish from different sources, such as wild and farmed salmon. It is possible that a publicized escape of GM fish could lead to reduced public acceptance of their wild product. Environmental and consumer groups are asking that genetically engineered products be specially labeled. However, industry groups are concerned that such labeling might lead consumers to believe that their products are unsafe for consumption.

Since genetic engineering can introduce new protein into a food product, there are concerns that this technique could introduce a previously unknown allergen into the food supply or could introduce a known allergen into a \"new\" food. Within FDA, the Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates transgenic animals intended for human consumption under the same authority it uses to regulate new animal drugs. In addition, GM fish must adhere to the same standards of safety under the FFDCA and the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition that apply to conventionally bred fish. Under the adulteration provisions in Section 402(a)(1) of the FFDCA, FDA has the power to remove a food from the market or sanction those marketing the food if that food poses a risk to public health.

The approval debate has focused on whether GM animals should be allowed, and if so, whether they should be labeled as such. The question of how to label the food derived from the AquAdvantage salmon is separate from the decision about whether to approve the new animal drug application. If the Commissioner determines that the new animal drug meets the approval standard, she \"shall issue an order approving the application.\" Issues related to the question of whether a food from the AquAdvantage salmon is misbranded, based on its labeling, are separate. Although FDA is not required to address these issues prior to the food being marketed, FDA is considering these two issues simultaneously.", "The AquAdvantage salmon, all sterile females, are proposed to be grown only in isolated contained facilities, not in ocean pens that have a higher risk of escape into the wild. More specifically, AquaBounty has proposed producing eggs on Prince Edward Island, Canada, shipping these eggs to Panama, growing and processing the fish in Panama, and shipping table-ready, processed fish to the United States for retail sale. If approved, it could take two to three years for the AquAdvantage salmon to reach supermarkets. As a first step in the approval process, FDA held public hearings on AquAdvantage salmon by its Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee on September 19-21, 2010. Although the public comment period on FDA approval was open through November 22, 2010, there was no deadline for FDA's decision on AquaBounty's application. Meanwhile, critics claimed the convoluted 16-year FDA review process was scientifically unjustified, and threatened to rob society of both environmental and economic benefits.", "In an effort to broaden the evaluation of the AquaBounty application, a coalition of environmental groups called on FDA to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on this action and to consult with federal agencies about possible threats to endangered wild Atlantic salmon. Subsequently, on May 25, 2011, these groups filed a formal citizen petition urging FDA to withhold approval until an EIS has been completed. Some scientists also expressed concern for a broader evaluation, including pointing out that potential price decreases from technological innovation in producing GM fish could promote health benefits from increased consumption. Concern has also increased in Canada over the possible effects of producing these GM fish.
