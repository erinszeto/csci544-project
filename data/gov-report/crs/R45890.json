WSRs may be located on federal lands, nonfederal lands, or a combination of both. Some WSRs on nonfederal land are referred to as partnership wild and scenic rivers (or partnership WSRs). The WSRA does not define this term; it is an umbrella term used to describe WSRs with generally similar characteristics, such as nonfederal management and land ownership, but partnership WSRs can vary. WSRs on nonfederal land also may be added to the NWSRS through an administrative process, wherein states may apply to the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion of a state-protected river. Rivers added to the system through state nomination, or rivers designated by Congress that run through both federal and nonfederal lands, generally are not referred to as partnership WSRs.", "In the case of congressionally designated rivers, Congress may first direct in legislation that a study be conducted to determine whether the river area is suitable for wild and scenic designation. Congress generally specifies in the designating legislation that either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior administer the WSR. If the designated WSR contains federal land, the Secretary then manages the river through the federal land management agency of jurisdiction\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service (NPS), or the Fish and Wildlife Service within the Department of the Interior or the Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The agency, or the relevant local jurisdiction for WSRs on nonfederal land, prepares a comprehensive resource management plan (CRMP) to guide management. The WSRA prohibits federally licensed or assisted water resources projects that would have a \"direct and adverse\" effect on the values for which a river was established and prohibits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from licensing projects on or directly affecting a designated river segment. The agency of jurisdiction enforces this provision; on partnership WSRs and state-nominated WSRs, NPS enforces this provision. In addition to the provisions of the WSRA, management of WSRs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency's lands. Each federal land management agency specifies policies regarding river management at varying levels of detail. Agencies typically provide the most protection to wild rivers.", "For congressionally designated rivers on federal lands, Congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual appropriations for the relevant agencies. Agencies sometimes provide funding separately for individual rivers or provide funding through broader budget activities, not specific to an individual river. Rivers added to the NWSRS through state nomination typically do not receive federal funding. However, partnership WSRs receive funding through NPS. The WSRA authorizes federal agencies to provide technical assistance to states and their political subdivisions (such as counties, townships, and others), landowners, organizations, or individuals in planning, protecting, and managing WSRs.", "Designation of wild and scenic rivers has been controversial in some cases, especially for WSRs containing nonfederal lands.

Over the past 20 years, Congress has designated or authorized for study an increasing number of partnership WSRs. Opinions regarding the balance of federal and local control over partnership WSRs have varied. Some have observed that Congress intended the state nomination authority to be the primary means for rivers on nonfederal lands to be included in the system, but this designation method has not been used in recent years.

The WSRA established three classes of WSRs, reflecting the characteristics of a river at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of development that may be allowed afterward: ", "W ild rivers are free from impoundments (dams, diversions, and so forth) and generally inaccessible except by trail. The watersheds are primitive, and the shorelines are essentially undeveloped. Scenic rivers are free from impoundments and in generally undeveloped areas but are accessible in places by roads. Recreational rivers are readily accessible by road, with some shoreline development, and may have been subject to some impoundment or diversion in the past.", "At the passage of the WSRA in 1968, Congress initially designated 789 miles in eight rivers as part of the NWSRS and began to expand the system in 1972; since then, every Congress has added rivers.

The agency's role depends on the ownership of the land through which the river flows. If the river flows through federal lands (wholly or in part), the agency of jurisdiction manages the river as part of its overall land management activities. The National Park Service (NPS) acts as the federal administrator for rivers entirely on nonfederal lands. For these rivers, NPS may provide technical and financial assistance to relevant jurisdictions; it also ensures compliance with Section 7 of the WSRA, which prohibits certain water resources projects that would adversely affect the values for which the rivers were established (see \" Water Resources Projects: Section 7 ,\" below). The WSRA authorizes or prohibits certain activities for all WSRs. However, management of WSRs differs based on the lands where individual rivers lie and other factors.", "Various federal agencies administer rivers in the NWSRS designated by Congress. Typically, Congress specifies that either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior administer newly designated WSRs. The designated Secretary then administers the river through one of the four federal land management agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), NPS, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior or the Forest Service (FS) within the Department of Agriculture. Unless otherwise specified by Congress, rivers administered by the Secretary of the Interior and managed by NPS become part of the National Park System, and those managed by FWS become part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

By law, CRMPs must address", "resource protection, development of lands and facilities, user capacities, and other management practices necessary or desirable to achieve the purposes of the WSRA.", "Agencies sometimes provide more specific direction regarding CRMP components. For example, in addition to the components listed, BLM specifies that CRMPs should describe existing resource conditions, including detailed descriptions of ORVs; define the goals for protecting river values and the desired condition of the river; address water quality and instream flow; identify resources requiring compliance with other authorities; identify regulatory authorities of other agencies that relate to river values; and describe a river monitoring strategy.", "CRMPs generally are to be completed within three fiscal years after the date of a river's designation. There is no statutory requirement that CRMPs be updated. In some river study authorizations, Congress has required the study agency to develop a CRMP in concert with the study process. In some cases, Congress has adopted these CRMPs in the legislation designating the river. Agencies have sometimes developed elements of the CRMP while studying the river, even if not directed by Congress to do so.", "The agency determines the boundaries of areas along the designated river. The land area included may not exceed an average of 320 acres per mile of river designated (an average quarter-mile-wide corridor of land on each side of the river) or 640 acres per mile in Alaska (an average half-mile-wide corridor of land on each side of the river)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Management", "paragraphs": ["Rivers are administered to protect and enhance the values for which the rivers were included in the NWSRS (usually interpreted as being the rivers' ORVs).
