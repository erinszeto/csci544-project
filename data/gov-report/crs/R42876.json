In some cases, particularly in China, government investment and other incentives, along with backing from national airlines, have spurred rapid expansion of the foreign aircraft maintenance industry over the past decade. While airline maintenance work outsourced to foreign repair facilities has increased considerably over the past decade, there are no conclusive data indicating that this has directly resulted in the loss of U.S. jobs. Despite increased maintenance outsourcing, the United States continues to maintain a positive trade balance for airline maintenance work, a trend that likely reflects the United States' advanced capabilities on high-value engine and aircraft component work.", "While investigative reports and labor union sponsored studies of airline outsourcing practices have been critical of foreign repair facilities, more detailed statistical analysis does not support conclusions that maintenance outsourcing or offshoring has had measurable negative impact on safety, quality control, or reliability. Although some experts believe that safety is being compromised and the regulation and oversight of foreign repair stations needs to be improved, analyses of recent trends do not provide obvious evidence that maintenance outsourcing has adversely affected airline safety.", "Specific concerns have been raised regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) limited resources to oversee foreign repair stations, and FAA's extensive reliance on foreign regulators and the airlines to monitor these facilities. Additional concerns have been raised over worker training and qualifications at foreign facilities, the relatively low numbers of workers at these facilities with FAA certification, and the lack of English language skills necessary to read and comprehend maintenance manuals and instructions.", "Congress also has been concerned about the adequacy of drug and alcohol testing programs at foreign repair stations that work on U.S. aircraft. In the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-95), it mandated drug and alcohol testing at those locations in a manner consistent with existing bilateral aviation safety agreements and the laws of countries where the repair stations are located. Additionally, the act directed FAA to ensure that foreign repair stations are subject to appropriate inspections consistent with existing U.S. requirements and bilateral air safety agreements; inspect foreign repair stations annually; and carry out independent inspections when warranted by safety concerns.", "The United States has continued to maintain a positive trade balance with respect to airline maintenance work. However, future foreign investment in advanced training and technical capabilities related to high-value engine and component repair and overhaul could lead to more direct foreign competition in these areas. While available data do not indicate that offshoring of maintenance work has negatively impacted safety, specific areas for potential improvement include the allocation of FAA inspectors and resources focused on the oversight of foreign repair stations; FAA certification and qualification standards for individuals assigned to supervisory roles at foreign repair stations; and standards or guidelines for English language proficiency and comprehension of written technical materials among foreign repair station mechanics."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The passenger airline industry in the United States has gone through significant changes since deregulation in 1978.

At the same time, price competition has forced airlines to contain costs. One of the practices aimed at keeping costs competitive is the outsourcing of aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), either domestically or to foreign countries.", "The practice of outsourcing aircraft maintenance is not restricted to U.S. passenger airlines. Many foreign airlines and cargo carriers also send maintenance work to outside service providers.

Typically, the engine is disassembled and inspected; parts are repaired or replaced as necessary; and the engine is reassembled and tested. Engine MRO requires considerable technological sophistication. Component MRO . Repair and overhaul of components that provide the basic functionality for air flight, including aircraft control and navigation, communications, cabin air conditioning, electrical power, and braking.

Over the same period, total employment at U.S. airlines fell from 679,723 to 538,300 (see Figure 4 ). The rate of maintenance employee reduction appears to be in tandem with the decrease in total airline employee count, suggesting that airline maintenance workforce reduction seems to reflect the overall employment trend in the passenger airline industry.", "Another contributing factor could be that the U.S. commercial air carriers are reducing their fleet size and replacing older and less efficient aircraft with more technologically advanced ones, in the face of uncertain economic conditions and rising fuel prices. The mainline carrier fleet, passenger and cargo aircraft combined, stood at 3,739 aircraft at the end of 2011, 16.7% fewer than in 2000. Meanwhile, the regional carriers continue to reduce their fleet of 50-seat and smaller aircraft. In 2011, the regional carrier fleet was reduced by 46 units to 2,567 units, its lowest level since 2003.", "From 1990 to 2011, airline maintenance workers accounted for about 10% of the total workforce in the passenger airline industry, in a fairly consistent fashion. During the recession in 2009, total airline workforce as well as airlines' MRO employment dropped to the lowest points in many years.", "Given the increased use of outsourcing, it seems likely that new jobs at maintenance companies unaffiliated with airlines have made up for at least some of the decline in airlines' employment of maintenance workers. Neither BTS nor the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) compiles data on employment at third-party providers of maintenance for passenger airlines.

In 2008, starting pay at Aeroman [an MRO provider in El Salvador] was approximately $4,500 per year with veterans earning approximately $15,000. That compares to the U.S. average of $52,000.... Narrow body HMV work tends to stay in the Western Hemisphere, with MRO providers in Central America playing a significant role; lower labor costs and shorter ferry flights contribute to cost savings.", "Hiring out MRO enables airlines to avoid significant capital investment in facilities, equipment, and inventories of parts and components. For example, Aeroman has four hangars to accommodate 11 production lines for narrow-body aircraft.

In 2011, U.S. airlines operated a total of 830,600 international flights, carrying 92.5 million travelers. The expansion of route networks around the globe made aircraft MRO in foreign countries simpler and less expensive by making it convenient for airlines to use foreign maintenance bases without incurring additional costs for ferrying aircraft.

Furthermore, there appears to be a significant knowledge and experience gap in existing MRO employees, many of whom are relatively young with inadequate work experience. In addition, there is a serious shortage in inspectors overseeing their work and ensuring work quality.

Moreover, airlines and aircraft repair service providers assert that the high economic value placed on safety in the airline industry is by itself sufficient incentive to promote high-quality performance among foreign repair stations that maintain U.S. air carrier aircraft. Airlines for America, the advocacy organization for major U.S. air carriers, cited NTSB data showing that, as U.S. airlines have increased their maintenance outsourcing to global providers, \"maintenance as a probable cause [of accidents] declined from 0.05 per 100,000 departures to absolute zero in recent years. The industry's safety record remains unmatched; no evidence indicates that offshore MRO services are unsafe or insecure.\" The group has released data showing that maintenance-related accidents have declined since 1997 despite increased outsourcing of maintenance (see Figure 5 ). This position is supported by a comprehensive research study that failed to find any relationship between airline maintenance outsourcing rates and aircraft accident and incident rates from 1996 to 2008, although the study did not specifically differentiate between domestic outsourcing and offshoring.", "However, some safety experts caution that the absence of a link between outsourced maintenance and safety is not conclusive evidence that offshoring maintenance work does not have safety implications. Experts point out that FAA does not track in detail where airline aircraft are maintained and exercises limited oversight of foreign repair stations. Former NTSB board member John Goglia, a long-time critic of cost cutting in airline maintenance, recently expressed particular concern that much critical maintenance work continues to be performed with little FAA review, particularly unannounced inspector review, and this is especially the case at foreign repair facilities.", "Statistical analysis of the relationship between airline service reliability and maintenance outsourcing also is inconclusive. In 2007, Consumer Reports magazine reported a steady increase in both outsourced maintenance and the number of airline flight cancellations from 2002 through 2004, but did not specifically differentiate between domestic outsourcing and offshoring. The report also provided data pointing toward a correlation between outsourced maintenance and airline-caused delays among 14 major U.S. air carriers in 2005. Based on these data alone, it is not possible to assess whether maintenance outsourcing was a direct cause of cancellations and delays, as airlines may have implemented other cost-cutting measures, such as reducing ground crews, which also may have contributed to delays.", "In contrast, Airlines for America points to Boeing data showing that U.S. airlines' operations utilizing Boeing commercial jets have improved their mechanical dispatch reliability, an indicator of the effectiveness of airline maintenance programs, from about 98.1% in 1991, to between 98.9% and 99.0% in 2008 and 2009 (see Figure 6 ). While the data show relatively consistent improvement in airline maintenance reliability over the past three decades, the exact relationship between outsourcing practices and maintenance dispatch reliability over time is unclear because of cyclical fluctuations in the data that are most likely attributable to the aging of the fleet and the somewhat periodic or cyclical nature of airline fleet replacement programs.

In 2008, the DOT OIG found that FAA's system for determining where to target inspections was inadequate, relying too heavily on incomplete voluntary air carrier reporting of maintenance outsourcing and air carrier audits that varied considerably in their quality and completeness. In particular, the DOT OIG found that FAA was over-reliant on air carriers' initial audits of repair stations to approve substantial maintenance providers for use by air carriers. The DOT OIG found that, in some cases, more than five years passed from the time a facility was first approved for air carrier use until inspectors responsible for overseeing a specific carrier's maintenance programs conducted an inspection.", "With regard to maintenance work sent to foreign repair stations, the DOT OIG also raised concerns regarding logistical challenges and procedural and cultural barriers that may limit the effectiveness of FAA inspector oversight activities in foreign countries.

However, in 2008 the DOT OIG found that two of nine major air carriers did not document their spot inspections of repairs and had no method for ensuring corrective actions were taken or tracking trends in repair station errors. Presence of air carrier on-site personnel on the hangar floor observing contract repair operations ranged from 35% to 70% of the time. The number of personnel also varied considerably, ranging from 3 on-site monitors from one carrier to 22 from another at repair stations examined in the DOT OIG audit.

Recently, manufacturers have taken a more direct role in MRO by establishing global MRO networks. ", "For example, Airbus has established a worldwide MRO network that includes 18 repair stations in Europe, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The network currently includes many foreign repair stations that contract to U.S. air carriers including Aeroman in El Salvador, as well as Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (HAECO), TIMCO Aviation Services in the United States, Lufthansa Technik AG, and Mexicana MRO Services. Boeing is a joint venture partner in Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services, mentioned above, and is currently developing a similar joint venture with Air India in Nagpur, India, that is scheduled to open in 2013; it is unclear whether this facility will service U.S. air carrier aircraft. Similarly, Boeing is working with both U.S. carriers and foreign airlines to adopt its \"GoldCare\" and \"Boeing Edge\" lifecycle management and maintenance programs using Boeing-selected MROs.", "Similar trends are taking place among engine manufacturers. For example, Lufthansa Technik and GE Aviation announced a long-term material service agreement in October 2012. GE already maintains an extensive MRO network overseas, with an extensive presence in Asia and Europe. Similarly, in 2010, Pratt & Whitney and Turkish Technic launched Turkish Engine Center (TEC) in Istanbul as a joint venture for engine MRO. ", "The larger role played by airframe and engine manufacturers in MRO around the world may eventually lead to the emergence of large specialty centers for MRO and greater standardization of global services. This could have broad implications for U.S. air carrier maintenance, including the potential for increased offshoring if maintenance practices and quality of service become increasingly standardized throughout the world. Some independent MROs are expressing concern that manufacturers' forays into maintenance operations are making it increasingly difficult for MROs that are not partnering with the manufacturers to access technical data and parts for aircraft that they service. ", "These ongoing changes in the MRO industry on a global scale will likely have important implications for the role of regulators. For example, FAA now focuses on airlines' maintenance activities in conjunction with its oversight of their air carrier certificates. If airlines continue to outsource both maintenance and now the management of that maintenance, the focus of FAA's oversight on airline practices may not be the most appropriate model moving forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Issues", "paragraphs": ["Considerable concern has been raised in the media regarding pay rates for foreign repair station workers, particularly those located in Latin America. For example, it has been reported that at Aeroman in El Salvador new workers start at about $4,500 annually and experienced mechanics make about $15,000 per year. However, another source indicates that hourly rates charged for skilled mechanics across Central America are considerably higher, averaging $36 per hour, but still considerably below comparable wages in the United States of $53 per hour. Moreover, comparing these figures to U.S. salaries is misleading without additional consideration of the relative purchasing power of these wages. In 2010, per capita gross domestic product in El Salvador, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), was around $7,500, compared to $47,800 in the United States.", "In other foreign hubs for MRO activity, wages for aircraft maintenance workers are higher, but do not appear to fully compensate for higher living costs. For example, in Singapore, the median annual wage for aircraft engine mechanics was roughly $31,600 in 2010. However, PPP adjusted per capita GDP in Singapore was $57,900, considerably higher than the United States.", "While wage imbalances pose significant challenges for U.S. workers competing in a global marketplace for skilled work as airline mechanics, jobs at foreign repair stations would appear to be sufficiently high paying on a comparative basis to attract considerable competition in local and regional job markets, particularly in Latin American countries. This may not, however, always hold true in high-growth Asian countries, such as Singapore, where advanced technical skills are in high demand in other fields that may compete for top talent and offer higher wages.", "From a safety standpoint, the skill and experience of maintenance and repair workers at foreign MROs is a greater concern. In at least some countries, significant growth in MRO employment has been supported by the availability of technical training to develop a skilled labor force. For example, in El Salvador, the Universidad Don Bosco began offering a certificate program in aviation maintenance approved by El Salvador's Civil Aviation Authority in 2005. However, Aeroman workers told investigative reporters that much of the hard labor is done by young workers with minimal education and that some jobs go to unqualified members of politically connected families. The workers also commented that they personally could do a better job if the company allowed them to get certified.", "Some aspects of aircraft maintenance, notably engine maintenance, require comparatively advanced technical and engineering skills. These appear to be in shorter supply in some other countries than in the United States. While airlines in many countries appear to be offshoring routine maintenance and overhaul to foreign countries where labor is comparatively cheap, the United States appears to enjoy an advantage in advanced maintenance capabilities in the globalized MRO marketplace. This advantage could erode in the future if offshore maintenance centers in Asia and Central America begin to invest more heavily in advanced technical training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Supervision", "paragraphs": ["Although mechanics that are not certificated by the FAA can work on U.S. civil aircraft, only FAA-certificated mechanics can oversee, approve, and certify the work before an aircraft can be returned to service. FAA-certificated mechanics thus represent a form of front-line supervision, particularly at large full-service foreign repair stations, where fewer mechanics have FAA certification. Many smaller foreign repair stations have no certificated mechanics, as this is not a requisite for obtaining an FAA repair station certificate. These smaller facilities often work on aircraft components, and their work can be certified by airline mechanics or mechanics at larger facilities for which they perform subcontracted work.", "Labor unions in the United States have raised significant concerns regarding the ratio of FAA-certificated mechanics to non-certificated mechanics at foreign repair facilities. A 2011 report by the Transportation Workers Union of America, which represents American Airlines mechanics, asserted that, at larger foreign repair stations, \"the ratio of FAA licensed to unlicensed mechanics is mind boggling.\" Table 2 provides data on the numbers FAA-certificated and non-certificated mechanics at selected FAA-certified Part 145 repair stations.", "This analysis largely confirms the ratios cited by the Transportation Workers Union in its report. Two important considerations for making meaningful comparisons between domestic and foreign repair stations are not apparent in these data. First, workers at foreign locations may be certificated by foreign regulators, and the requirements for such certification may or may not be comparable to those imposed by FAA. Second, foreign repair stations may work on aircraft from many countries, and a small number of FAA-certificated mechanics may simply reflect that the repair station does relatively little work on U.S. aircraft. This may explain why facilities in El Salvador have relatively more FAA-certificated mechanics than those in China.

As part of its certification testing, applicants are required to demonstrate they can read, speak, write, and comprehend spoken English language. Applicants are required to read from and provide a written interpretation of a technical manual, such as an aircraft maintenance manual. These requirements apply to mechanics and repairmen seeking certification at foreign as well as domestic repair stations. Repair stations are required to ensure that supervisors and inspection personnel who review repairs and maintenance understand, read, and write English, but there is no formal requirement that these workers have any specific English-language skills.", "However, as previously noted, FAA certification is not required to work at a repair station, and FAA has no formal regulations regarding the number of certificated personnel at foreign repair stations. Lack of English proficiency may be one reason only a relatively small percentage of foreign repair station workers obtain FAA certification. Language may be a greater barrier to certification in developing countries like El Salvador, where many workers may lack English proficiency, than in Europe, where schoolchildren routinely learn English.", "English has become the international standard language for aviation, particularly with respect to air traffic control communications. Increasingly, it is becoming the standard language for aircraft maintenance as well, with maintenance manuals issued by airframe and engine manufacturers worldwide being published solely in English and fewer airlines customizing maintenance documents or translating them into other languages. Increasingly, computerized aircraft systems with English-only interfaces, including maintenance interfaces, require a working knowledge of technical English to diagnose and repair advanced avionics. Thus, technological advancement is also driving the need for English language proficiency to some degree. That said, aircraft maintenance also involves many less technical tasks, such as interior refurbishing and airframe painting, which may not require English-language skills. It is often these less skilled jobs for which foreign repair stations offer the greatest cost savings compared to domestic repair stations. Consequently, limited English language skill among workers at these facilities may not, by itself, be cause for significant concern.", "The level of language proficiency among skilled maintenance workers at these foreign repair stations has not been systematically studied.

ICAO has been working with countries around the world to achieve greater harmonization with respect to the administration of drug and alcohol testing programs throughout the aviation industry. ICAO has also published guidance materials to aid countries in developing policies to prevent substance abuse in the aviation workplace.

Increasing competition in this field coupled with growing opportunities for advanced technical training overseas may reduce this advantage in the future. At the same time, however, the trend of maintenance offshoring may be offset to some degree by rising labor costs in developing countries that could diminish their comparative cost advantage. In this regard, improved data reporting and collection by FAA and BTS would assist in analyzing MRO outsourcing and understanding the movements and trends.", "Although policymakers often raise the prospect of restrictive safety measures and additional inspections as a means to curtail the loss of American jobs to offshoring, applying such approaches to the aviation MRO industry could lead to reciprocal actions that could affect both maintenance work performed on foreign aircraft within the United States and U.S. companies that operate or have a stake in MRO facilities outside the United States. ARSA noted that many U.S. companies have repair stations internationally, estimating that about 80 foreign repair stations are either wholly or partly owned by U.S. firms. Additionally, ARSA points out that several international companies have MRO facilities within the United States. Thus, globalization of the MRO industry makes it increasingly difficult to apply effective trade actions as a means to protect U.S. jobs.", "No solid evidence exists that the use of foreign repair stations to maintain U.S. air carrier aircraft has eroded airline safety.

This may involve selecting and assigning FAA inspectors based on proficiency in specific foreign languages and familiarity with foreign cultures.
