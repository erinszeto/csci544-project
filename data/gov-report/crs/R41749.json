Although their work is relatively limited in scope, it is of interest to U.S. policy-makers because of the deep isolation of the regime in Pyongyang. Several American and international NGOs have provided assistance to North Korea in humanitarian relief, development, health, informal diplomacy, science, communication and education. A relatively recent trend is that a growing number of NGOs, particularly in South Korea, are run by or have North Korean defectors on staff.", "Non-governmental organizations' activities in North Korea have stirred some controversy. Some observers believe that NGOs' projects represent one of the few ways to improve the lives of ordinary North Koreans, and that their work provides first-hand accounts about social conditions in North Korea. Some NGOs have a comparative advantage in dealing with North Korea, with over a decade's experience working with North Korean officials and institutions. However, others argue that NGOs' programs aid North Korea's regime, and that given the lack of transparency and tight restrictions imposed on them by the regime, their funds are vulnerable to diversion by North Korean officials.", "Two issues bear consideration: Have NGOs contributed to improving the lives of ordinary North Korean citizens in sustainable ways? Can NGOs evaluate the impact of their operations and take steps to minimize diversion of the resources they deliver to North Koreans? In short, are they effective, and should the United States welcome their work in spite of the North Korean regime's treatment of its citizens? This paper will address some of the publicly disclosed activities that NGOs have undertaken in North Korea.", "The role of NGOs in North Korea may re-emerge as a congressional interest, as the Obama Administration has expressed interest in restarting humanitarian assistance to North Korea. During the Bush Administration, five large U.S. NGOs were part of a food delivery program that enjoyed some success. Some believed they were more effective than international organizations at navigating the North Korean system to get aid where it was needed. But some organizations opted to cease their operations when North Korean restrictions became too onerous."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The NGO Dilemma1", "paragraphs": ["Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been active in North Korea since the 1990s. Their work has raised debates about what role NGOs should play in countries ruled by repressive regimes like North Korea's. NGOs and other providers of aid face an ethical dilemma in such countries: How does one provide assistance to a population without inadvertently supplying aid to groups such as the North Korean military or others who will try to profit from it? In the North Korean case, NGOs have been viewed by many as providing aid, technical advice, and resources at little or no cost to a despotic regime. Many NGOs as well as other relief and development providers believe that aid should go to those in the greatest need and should be non-political. At the same time, the NGOs insisted on transparent delivery of aid. North Korean officials have failed to comply with requirements for transparency and have diverted significant amounts of humanitarian aid. ", "On the other hand, there is evidence that several NGOs have had successes, albeit limited, in a wide range of activities, from providing food aid to sponsoring informal diplomacy. By the late 1990s, several NGOs had set up programs geared toward enhancing capacity and boosting agricultural production in North Korea. Relief agencies offered projects that ranged from alternative types of farming including wider use of greenhouses and hydroponics, hospital renovations, mobile diagnostic clinics, water and sanitation projects, to disaster management training. In food assistance programs, according to several sources, in spite of initial North Korean efforts to hamper NGOs by limiting movements by their staff and refusing to allow Korean speakers to accompany them, over time some NGOs have obtained as good or better access and monitoring than much larger international organizations. Many NGOs felt this gave them some assurance that aid was reaching the right recipients. ", "Congress may wish to consider the role of NGOs in North Korea as part of its oversight of the U.S.-North Korean relationship, and also because of their potential role in delivering humanitarian assistance. Recently, the Obama Administration has been considering whether to restart an earlier aid program begun under the Bush Administration in 2008. The South Korean and U.S. governments have received several requests from North Korea for large-scale food aid since late 2010. In February 2011, the spokesperson for the Department of State stated that future food aid would depend on a needs assessment, and whether the U.S. government could ensure that the program would be effectively managed to ensure that no aid would be diverted from its targets. In March, the U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, also noted that the United States would \"provide food aid when we see a perceived need and in a situation in which we can monitor.\" It is possible that the Administration could use NGOs for aid delivery, as the Bush Administration did from 2008 to 2009.", "Some have argued that through the implementation of their work NGOs may have promoted at least some degree of transparency and a measure of accountability for the aid recipients. It is, however, difficult to assess such effects, given North Korea's isolation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Status of NGO Humanitarian and Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["As of 2010, a few NGOs have remained active in North Korea, most from European aid agencies. Other active but non-resident NGOs include the Mennonite Central Committee (Canada), First Steps (Canada), the Eugene Bell Foundation (United States/South Korea), Christian Friends of Korea (United States), the Canadian Food Grains Bank, and the Hanns Seidel and the Friedrich Naumann Foundations (Germany). Several European NGOs can expect consular protection from embassies based in Pyongyang, except for Canada, France, and Ireland which have embassies in Seoul. U.S. NGOs rely on the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang.", "South Korea has cut off nearly all bilateral food and fertilizer aid and curbed South Korean NGO contacts with North Korea since the election of President Lee Myung-bak in December 2007. The South Korean government imposed especially tight restrictions after sinking of the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan in March 2010 and North Korea's shelling of a South Korean island in November 2010. Both incidents resulted in the loss of South Korean lives. Many South Korean NGOs criticized the Lee government's restrictions. Several NGOs, among them the Korean Sharing Movement and Good Friends, asked the government to allow them send food to North Korea. These offers were rejected. ", "In 2010, the South Korean and U.S. governments made small donations of aid, some of which NGOs distributed. In January 2010, South Korea donated 10,000 tons of food through the South Korean Red Cross. In March 2010, South Korea sent 20 tons of milk powder. In September 2010, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) made $600,000 available to fund flood assistance via Samaritan's Purse, Global Resource Services and Mercy Corps."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background on Humanitarian Aid and Development NGOs", "paragraphs": ["The North Korean government has tightly controlled and monitored NGO activities. Its officials have frequently resisted NGO demands to monitor the distribution of aid. North Korean officials initially blocked NGO efforts to visit the northeast provinces of Chagang, South Hamgyong, North Hamgyong, and Ryanggang, as well as portions of Kangwon, South Hwanghae, and North and South Pyongan (see map at Figure 1 ). ", "Officials also tried to curb NGOs' ability to monitor by excluding Korean speakers from their groups. International organizations and NGOs were not permitted to conduct random site visits. Finally, DPRK officials insisted that NGOs use the government's Public Distribution System to transmit aid. The Public Distribution System is the primary means by which the state allocates food according to the social importance of groups. Between 1998-2000, citing these restrictions on monitoring, some NGOs, notably Doctors without Borders and Oxfam, withdrew from North Korea. Two U.S.-based NGOs, CARE and Catholic Relief Services, left for similar reasons. By 2005, restrictions on NGO travel had dropped substantially but still included smaller portions of the northeast provinces, North and South Pyongan, and Kangwon. North Korean officials ruled out visits to these areas citing security reasons.", "The North Korean government has assigned government contacts to NGOs, to serve as a conduit for their aid and provide the regime with buffers between the organizations and the public. These were assigned on the basis of national origin or residency, and have shifted frequently over the years that NGOs have worked in the country. Some NGOs have sought to strengthen their hand by coordinating their own work through these North Korean government entities, with varying degrees of success. ", "Beginning in 1995, U.S. NGOs, some European NGOs, and international groups such as the World Food Programme fell under North Korea's Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee's (FDRC) purview. A few U.S. NGOs, the American Friends Service Committee and World Vision International, as well as all South Korean NGOs were assigned to the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (APPC). In 2005, North Korean officials reassigned the U.S. NGOs to the Korean American Private Exchange Society (KAPES). One European NGO noted that the new North Korean arrangements under KAPES effectively reduced the number of NGOs on the ground and reassigned them with new contacts. The FDRC/KAPES staff are drawn from the North Korean Foreign Ministry or local authorities. The APPC reports to the central committee of the Korean Worker's Party. The APPC also has responsibility for Asian-Pacific states that lack diplomatic relations with North Korea. Generally speaking, North Korean officials refused to grant U.S. or South Korean NGOs residency in order to limit their range of movement in North Korea.", "In 1996, InterAction, a U.S. NGO consortium comprising more than 150 U.S. NGOs, initiated a process of facilitating and coordinating humanitarian relief with its members in North Korea. Participating NGOs in InterAction also formed the North Korea Working Group to advocate for assistance to North Korea. To facilitate work further, InterAction recommended the establishment of the Food Aid Liaison Unit (FALU), which operated from WFP's office in Pyongyang. WFP and NGOs worked within the system of national food rationing mentioned earlier, referred to as the Public Distribution System.", "A year later, other non-resident NGOs created the Private Voluntary Organization Consortium (PVOC), which included Amigos Internacionales, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps, and World Vision. The aim of PVOC was to monitor distribution of over 150,000 MT of U.S. government food aid and ensure delivery to workers in cities where factories were closed or idle. Analysts describe the formation of the PVOC as a period of close cooperation between U.S. agencies and NGOs. USAID and United States Department of Agriculture funded the PVOC group's food assistance programs. This permitted some NGOs to move beyond the original food assistance programs and towards development-oriented programs. In 2000, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) reported that the initiative yielded \"mixed results.\" The Consortium reported that the North Korean government's restrictions made it difficult to adequately monitor the distribution of the food. The PVOC withdrew from North Korea shortly after June 2000 after difficulties in its seed potato project. ", "North Korean officials also began granting several European NGOs residency, among them Doctors Without Borders. European NGOs negotiated residency in North Korea as a condition for their assistance. Some argue that this newly formed community of active and inquiring resident NGOs promoted a new dynamic in North Korean society. North Korean officials encountered NGO representatives who operated on the basis of transparency, and had diverse experiences operating in other countries. As a result, North Korean officials and aid recipients had to adapt to each other. ", "Responding to the U.N. World Food Programme and the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) calls for aid to North Korea in 2008, the United States pledged to donate 500,000 MT of food aid to North Korea for one year. The Bush Administration declared at the time that North Korea had made substantial concessions in monitoring and access which would permit confirmation of aid to the intended targets. The U.S. government arranged to send a portion of that aid, 100,000 MT, through five U.S. NGOs. The U.S. Department of State selected World Vision, Mercy Corps, Samaritan's Purse, Global Resource Services, and Christian Friends of Korea to distribute this aid. The NGO aid consortium operated in two northwest provinces until the North Korea government ordered them to leave the country in March 2009. North Korea offered no explanation for the dismissal. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "South Korean NGOs", "paragraphs": ["Many South Korean NGOs participating in North Korean assistance programs are faith-based, privately run charities. They emphasize confidence-building through frequent contacts. Feelings of patriotism and a desire for national reconciliation motivate many of them. Prominent among these NGOs are Good Friends South Korea/Peace Foundation and the Korean Sharing Movement. ", "Until 1999, the South Korean government had South Korean NGOs contribute through its Red Cross organization. South Koreans also had to obtain the approval of the Ministry of Unification to travel to North Korea. To expedite deliveries, some South Korean NGOs delivered aid through their affiliates. The NGO World Vision Korea, for instance, shipped rice via World Vision International. The U.S. NGO Eugene Bell Foundation shipped aid on behalf of several South Korean Christian NGOs. Other NGOs took advantage of the porous North Korea-China border. Some NGOs ran small cooperative farms in Chinese border states to deliver food to their recipients. Under the \"sunshine\" policy of engaging North Korea, the administrations of President Kim Dae Jung (1998-2003) and President Roh Moo-hyun (2003-2007) lifted many of these restrictions on NGOs. After the June 2000 inter-Korean summit, the South Korean government's aid programs grew substantially. While other NGOs pressed for strict monitoring to minimize the possibility of diversion of aid, the South Korean government delivered large quantities of aid, with less stringent monitoring and fewer follow-up reporting requirements. With the election of President Lee Myung-bak, the South Korean government withheld most bilateral aid and restricted private visits to North Korea.", "During the \"sunshine policy era,\" South Korean NGOs set up a variety of food security programs to plant high-yield corn, provide fertilizer, propagate seed potatoes, develop goat milk production, and sponsor greater use of greenhouses and alternative growing techniques. These programs were introduced to offer sustainable food sources. Some NGOs also began programs to supplement nutrition or curb disease, such as providing vitamins, tuberculosis controls, pest control, and developing pharmaceutical firms. By 2000, the South Korean Ministry of Unification supported NGOs whose programs included aid to flood survivors, children, and the elderly. NGOs also initiated programs in medicine and hygiene programs, and aid in natural disaster prevention.

Researchers at Syracuse and Kim Chaek Universities identified the necessary standards to catalog information and develop software from open sources. The sponsors' contact in North Korea was the FDRC. The program relied on private grants from the Korea Society, the Henry Luce Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and Syracuse University. Kim Chaek University bore the cost of constructing the library facility. The digital library opened in 2006. In 2008, journalists accompanying the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on its visit to Pyongyang said they visited the digital library and had accessed their Facebook accounts there. In 2005, as an offshoot of the digital library project, the partners agreed to develop twin integrated information technology laboratories (\"the Twin Labs project\") as well as support exchanges of Syracuse and Kim Chaek Universities' junior faculty.

The digital library project has been ongoing for almost ten years. In May 2007, several university and NGO representatives met to examine participants' experiences with respect to scientific collaboration with North Korea. This resulted in the formation of the Consortium, which has since sent a Nobel Laureate science delegation to Pyongyang in 2009 and hosted a DPRK State Academy of Sciences (SAOS) delegation in Atlanta in February 2011 where scientists from Emory, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Georgia, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Syracuse University, and the University of Missouri attended.
