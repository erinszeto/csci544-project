For example, commercial aircraft cannot carry outsized cargo, conduct special missions such as airdrop, or support special operations forces. Also, commercial aircraft tend to congest airfields because of longer ground times resulting from a lack of roll on/roll off capability and reduced ramp maneuverability. Further, potential hostile fire effectively deters civilian crews from entering combat zones. However, commercial aircraft typically have longer range, and are optimized to efficiently transport passengers and cargo pallets. GAO references the use of CRAF during Operation Desert Storm to illustrate CRAF's cost advantages:", "The use of CRAF aircraft during an activation is not free\u2014DOD pays rates based on weighted average carrier costs\u2014but the cost is minimal in comparison to the costs of acquiring and supporting aircraft, paying and training aircrew, and other expenses of maintaining standby military airlift capability. AMC paid the carriers about $1.5 billion for using their aircraft during the operation. Purchasing additional military aircraft to provide similar capability would cost from $15 to $50 billion, according to Air Force officials, depending on assumptions used for aircraft replacement cost.", "A RAND study ( Finding the Right Mix of Military and Civil Airlift, Issues and Implications ) also includes a discussion of the cost-effectiveness of CRAF:", "For a very small cost, the DOD has had on call a very substantial airlift capacity. Replacing CRAF's 1992 Stage II capability with military-style transports would have cost the DOD about $1 billion annually (1992 dollars) over the past several decades. Replacing the Stage III capability would have cost about $3 billion annually.", "The RAND analysis points out that to have adequate airlift for a major crisis, DOD maintains a military airlift fleet with a total capacity four to five times greater than the average daily use. Costs associated with acquiring and maintaining this excess airlift capability must be routinely incurred, even if the full capacity is rarely used.", "As DOD's procurement and operations and maintenance accounts come under increasing pressure, it may appear attractive to increase the size of CRAF in lieu of procuring and operating a certain fraction of the Air Force strategic airlift fleet. Recent events may suggest that a growing use of commercial aircraft for every-day DOD needs is already in evidence. In January 2005, for example, it was reported that commercial airlines moved twice as many U.S. troops overseas as they moved in January 2004.", "Contracting with air carriers to commit their aircraft to wartime needs is cheaper, in a sense, than purchasing and operating additional Air Force cargo aircraft. However, CRAF is not free, and it costs more once activated. RAND points out that:", "Although holding reserve capacity in the CRAF is far more cost effective than holding the reserve in the military airlift fleet, the government has a financial incentive to use its own resources (for which it has already committed funds) in a crisis to the extent that they are conveniently available, rather than give additional business to CRAF carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Government / Commercial Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["CRAF is not the only means by which DOD transports troops by civil aircraft.

Federal employees, including DOD civilian and military personnel, traveling on government business are obliged to fly with these contracted airlines at the official government rate. DOD also charters commercial aircraft to satisfy peacetime mobility needs.", "In July 2006 the U.S. Central Command had initiated a pilot program\u2014\"Commercial and Government Air Program\"\u2014to enlist commercial air cargo carriers to deliver military supplies into Afghanistan and Iraq. The pilot program is hoped to deliver up to 20% of DOD cargo to the region and to save DOD approximately $9 million per month.

DOD's most recent air mobility requirements study, Mobility Capability Study (MCS), was completed in December 2005. However, during congressional testimony, General Arthur L. Lichte, Commander of the Air Force's Air Mobility Command, pointed to changes that have occurred since the MCS was completed that include the increase of 92,000 ground forces, the repositioning of DOD force structure overseas, and the growth of the Army's Future Combat System. Further, DOD has reduced the number of C-5 Galaxies planned for upgrade with new engines and other enhancements that were expected to bolster capability of the C-5 fleet to levels required by MCS-2005. As a result, General Lichte stated that the current program of record for the Air Force's strategic airlift fleet of C-5s and C-17s falls short of the organic strategic airlift capability of 33.95 million ton miles day (MTM/D) requirement.", "The MCS called for the same level of CRAF contribution to total airlift capabilities (20.5 million ton miles per day of the overall 54.5 million ton miles per day objective) as required in the prior study. However, DOD's projected use of CRAF to fulfill total airlift needs has increased from roughly 12 MTM/D in the late 1980s to roughly 20 MTM/D in 2005. Further, this increase in capacity has occurred gradually, and many view DOD's requirement for CRAF as being stable over this 19-year span. As Figure 1 indicates, commercial aircraft committed to CRAF exceed DOD requirements. Thus, any foreseeable increases in CRAF requirements are unlikely to result in shortfalls of commercial aircraft committed to CRAF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential C-17 Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["Some favor acquisition of additional C-17s to meet potential current and future strategic airlift requirement shortfalls.

Further, the Air Force's FY2009 Unfunded Priority List contained a request for 15 additional C-17s. In contrast, the Administration's FY2009 budget request did not contain funding for new C-17s, nor did it request funding to close the C-17 production line. However, during congressional testimony, Gen. Schwartz cautioned that too large of an organic airlift fleet could potentially hurt the CRAF program in the future when he stated,", "One of the things that you hold me accountable for is sort of maintaining the balance between the organic fleet and the commercial capability. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I caution about overbuilding the organic fleet; because if that occurs, it can competes in peace time with that preference cargo, the incentives that we offer our commercial partners.

In May of 2007, Boeing's C-17 Program Manager, Dave Bowman, stated, \"we have several customers with money that have given us requests for proposals.\" Some industry studies suggest that a commercial market for up to 10 C-17s may exist for use in heavy industry, mining, or similar endeavors, while Boeing believes there is market potential of \"upwards of 100 aircraft.\" On the other hand, at present, there are no orders for a commercial variant of the C-17."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "KC-X Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["Acquisition decisions regarding KC-X, the Air Force's next generation tanker program, may also affect future DOD CRAF needs and use.

Thus, as the Air Force's KC-X tanker fleet potentially grows, DOD's day-to-day need for commercial airlift that participants in the CRAF program provide could potentially be reduced. However, because most tankers could be needed to perform air refueling during a potential crisis, DOD would likely still rely on the CRAF program to meet surges in airlift demand.", "On February 29, 2008, the Air Force awarded the KC-X contract to Northrop Grumman.

As economic and financial conditions for commercial air carriers potentially worsen, the benefit of CRAF for the commercial sector has been increasingly discussed. It may be that if economic conditions remain difficult, pressure may build on DOD to use more commercial airlift, not necessarily to satisfy DOD needs, but to support the private sector.
