The law ended the cash assistance program for needy families with children, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. TANF is a broad-based block grant that helps fund state cash assistance programs for needy families with children, but it also funds a wide range of benefits and services addressing both the effects and root causes of child poverty.", "The cash assistance caseload declined particularly rapidly in the years immediately following enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law. In 1995, an estimated 17.6 million people received AFDC cash at some time during the year; by 2000, the number of people receiving cash assistance had declined to 7.9 million. The period from 1995 to 2000 also saw declines in child poverty and increased work among single mothers (who had headed most AFDC families). Following 2000, child poverty increased and work among single mothers declined somewhat. However, the cash assistance caseload continued to decline, reaching 5.7 million people in 2007 and increasing only slightly in response to the recent recession to 5.8 million people in 2012.", "The decline in the cash assistance caseload generally resulted from fewer eligible people taking up TANF benefits. In 1995, 82% of those eligible for AFDC received assistance. The share of those eligible for TANF who received it fell to 47% in 2000, 34% in 2007, and 28% in 2012. While there were almost 12 million fewer individuals who received TANF in 2012 than received AFDC in 1995, the size of the population estimated as eligible to receive TANF in 2012 was 1.4 million persons lower than the population eligible for AFDC in 1995 (20.2 million versus 21.6 million).", "Most of those eligible but not receiving AFDC or TANF were poor, with some in deep poverty (family incomes less than half the poverty threshold). Over the 1995 to 2012 period, an increasing number of adults who failed to take up benefits were non-workers and had no other workers in their families. The decline in the share of people eligible for cash assistance also meant that TANF had a smaller impact in ameliorating poverty\u2014particularly among children in deep poverty\u2014than did AFDC. In 2012, there were 3.1 million children in deep poverty that met TANF eligibility criteria but did not receive TANF assistance. The comparable number of children in deep poverty eligible for but not receiving AFDC in 1995 was 0.5 million. In 2012, TANF reduced the rate of deep poverty among children from 9.5% to 8.4%. In 1995, AFDC reduced the rate of deep poverty among children from 11.3% to 6.5%.", "This analysis raises several policy questions, the key one being whether caseload reduction per se is an indicator of the success of welfare reform. The drafters of the 1996 welfare reform law wanted TANF to be \"temporary and provisional.\" However, TANF assistance was increasingly forgone or otherwise not received by those eligible for it, even amongst the poorest of families. While low-income families receive other government benefits such as food assistance and (if they have earners) refundable tax credits, these benefits do not provide ongoing cash assistance to meet basic needs. TANF has a number of structural features that give states the incentive to have policies that seek to reduce caseloads. For example, its \"work participation standards\" can be met partially or wholly through caseload reduction rather than through engaging recipients in work or activities. TANF could be altered to lessen some of the incentives that states have to reduce caseloads. Policymakers might also look outside of TANF, to altering some existing programs or providing different forms of aid to provide ongoing support for needy families with children."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 welfare law (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996; P.L. 104-193 ) was enacted after decades of debate about the causes and effects of welfare receipt and concerns about \"welfare depen dency.\" It ended the cash assistance program Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant that funds a wide range of benefits and services to ameliorate the effects, and address the root causes, of childhood poverty.

One of the statutory goals of TANF is to \"end dependence of needy parents on government benefits through work, job preparation, and marriage.\" The reduction of the number of families with children receiving cash assistance since the mid-1990s is perhaps the signature indicator used to propose that the 1996 welfare reform law was successful in reducing welfare dependency. In 1995, an estimated 17.6 million people received AFDC cash benefits at some time during the year. In 2012, 5.6 million people received TANF at some point in the year.", "Receipt of assistance and dependency on it are not necessarily synonymous. However, growth of the cash assistance caseload has historically been seen as an indicator of a growing dependency, while the decline of the caseload has been seen as indicating reduced welfare dependency. On the other hand, continued declines in the number of families receiving cash assistance in the face of increasing child poverty since 2000 has led to concerns that TANF cash assistance programs are not meeting the needs of low-income families.", "This report provides information on the size of the cash assistance caseload. It examines the number of people receiving cash assistance relative to the number of people who meet these programs' eligibility criteria. It also estimates the impact of AFDC and TANF cash assistance on the child poverty rate and deep poverty rate. It is beyond the scope of this report to explain empirically the economic and policy factors that contributed to the caseload decline.

States define need, and there is a significant amount of variation among them in what dollar amount defines need and makes a family whose income falls below that threshold financially eligible.", "Most states require that family income be very low\u2014often well below the poverty threshold\u2014to come onto the benefit rolls. In July 2012, for a family headed by a single parent with two children, the maximum earnings that single parent could have ranged from $269 per month in Alabama to $1,740 per month in Hawaii. ", " Figure 1 maps the maximum earnings a single parent can have to enter the assistance rolls by state for July 2012. It expresses those eligibility thresholds as a percentage of the 2012 Federal Poverty Guidelines. This is done to facilitate comparison of the eligibility rules to the poverty level. There is no requirement in federal law that TANF eligibility thresholds have any relationship to poverty-level income. Additionally, most states set these thresholds without regard to the federal poverty level. The thresholds for initial eligibility were at or above the poverty level in only three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Wisconsin). On the other hand, 24 states and the District of Columbia had initial income eligibility thresholds below 50% of poverty level income.", "States generally do not adjust their TANF eligibility thresholds for price inflation. Because the federal poverty level is adjusted for inflation, over time the eligibility thresholds as a percentage of the poverty level have declined in most states. Note that this is not a result of the 1996 welfare reform law. There were some federal rules regarding financial eligibility under AFDC; however, states determined the income thresholds for defining whether a family was needy under AFDC as well. There was substantial variation in AFDC income thresholds, and they too were generally not adjusted for inflation and declined as a percentage of the federal poverty level.", "In addition to having a child and meeting federal financial eligibility rules, a family must also meet certain nonfinancial eligibility rules and comply with program requirements in order to be eligible for TANF assistance. For example, TANF federal funds may provide assistance to a family with an adult recipient for up to 60 months (five years). Thus, most states time-limit benefits for TANF families (though California and New York, the states with the two largest populations, provide benefits beyond five years). Under TANF, benefits may also be restricted for minor parents not living in adult-supervised settings and convicted drug felons. Additionally, those applying for or receiving benefits must comply with program requirements, such as applicant job search or work participation requirements.", "However, even if a family meets financial, nonfinancial, and program requirements, it does not mean that they receive benefits. Those who are eligible must apply for benefits before receiving them. Some of those who are eligible choose not to apply. There is some research on the factors that might cause an eligible individual to fail to apply for benefits. Economists tend to look at the costs of applying for benefits\u2014transportation to the welfare office and time spent in the office applying for benefits and meeting with caseworkers\u2014as factors that, if they outweigh the actual benefit, could cause an eligible person to fail to apply. There are also factors such as individuals' reluctance to divulge personal information and the social stigma attached to receiving assistance that might divert an eligible individual from applying.", "Further, work requirements could be seen as a deterrent to applying for benefits. Those eligible for assistance might determine that participating in an activity for 20 or 30 hours per week (the hour requirements for the federal TANF work participation standard) for a relatively small benefit is not worth it. The time commitment entailed by a work requirement may also deter eligible persons who are engaged in sporadic or off-the-books work from applying.", "The size of the TANF cash assistance caseload is determined by both the size of the population eligible for assistance and the rate at which families \"take up\" that assistance.

If TANF did not exist, people's behavior might be different (e.g., they might work more, leading to lower rates of pre-TANF poverty). Thus, when the \"effect\" or \"impact\" of TANF on poverty is discussed, it simply means how much the poverty rate changes if transfers are subtracted from total money income.

In 1995, the pre-AFDC income poverty rate was 21.6%, and the poverty rate when AFDC income was counted was 1.1% lower, at 20.5%. This is because in 1995 the AFDC benefit was usually insufficient to raise family money incomes above the poverty threshold. Since 1995, states generally have not raised benefits to compensate for inflation, thus the impact of TANF on the poverty rates has remained small.

First, receipt of the EITC has diminished over time among this group. This is the result of fewer families eligible for but not receiving cash assistance having earnings, as indicated on Table 2 . The second trend is the increasing rate at which food assistance is received via SNAP. In contrast, the rate of receipt of housing assistance changed little over the period.

", "The decline in the caseload was seen as an indicator that progress was being made toward the goal of ending dependence. President Clinton, speaking in December 2000, said:", "Today, I am pleased to announce that over the past 8 years we've cut welfare caseloads by more than 8 million people. Last year alone, 1.2 million parents on welfare went to work, determined to build better lives. Nationwide over the last 8 years, welfare rolls have dropped nearly 60 percent and now are to the lowest in more than 30 years.", "We've been able to sustain this progress year after year because Government, the private sector, and welfare recipients themselves all have done their parts. Together, we are finally breaking the cycle of dependence that has long crippled the hopes of too many families.", "From the vantage point of 2000, the caseloads had declined and so had child poverty. Employment among single mothers increased. It was generally known in that year that the caseload was declining faster than child poverty. However, it appeared that some of the caseload decline was attributable to the improved economic conditions among families with children. The number of children living in families with pre-assistance incomes of less than half the poverty threshold fell from 8 million in 1995 to 5 million in 2000.", "The environment after 2000 differed from that of the late 1990s. Child poverty increased, but the number of families receiving TANF cash assistance continued to decline. While much of the increasing need after 2000 was attributable to the 2007 to 2009 recession, increasing poverty and cash assistance reaching a smaller share of the poor was not a phenomenon limited to the recession. The number of children in deep poverty (before counting cash assistance) rose from 2000 to 2007, with a smaller share of these children assisted by TANF cash even before the onset of the recession. ", "The declines in the caseload following 2000 raise a question about whether a goal of TANF should be caseload reduction per se, regardless of whether or not the size of the population in need is growing. The drafters of the 1996 welfare reform law wanted TANF to be \"temporary and provisional.\" However, TANF assistance was increasingly forgone or otherwise not received by those eligible for it, even amongst the poorest of families.", "TANF has a number of structural features that give states the incentive to have policies that seek to reduce caseloads, including the following:", "Funding through a fixed block grant that provides each state a set amount of federal dollars each year, and the ability to use those funds on a wide range of benefits and services. Thus, states may use the savings from caseload reductions on other benefits and services for populations among families with children other than those eligible for and receiving cash assistance. A sole performance measure, the \"work participation standard,\" that may be met either partially or fully through caseload reduction. The TANF work participation standard sets a numerical goal of having 50% of families with a member either working or engaged in welfare-to-work activities, but it also provides credits that reduce the numerical goal for a state, including one for caseload reduction. For each decline in the TANF cash assistance caseload of 1%, the work participation standard's numerical goal is reduced by 1%.", "TANF also gives states the legal ability to reduce the caseloads. It ended an individual entitlement to benefits for people in needy families with children, potentially affecting the rights of individuals to receive legal redress if their benefits are reduced, denied, or ended by state actions. It allows states to end benefits for an entire family if its adult member refuses to comply with state work participation requirements.", "If policymakers conclude that there is unmet need for ongoing cash assistance for needy families with children, there are a number of policy options available. TANF could be altered to lessen some of the incentives that states have to reduce caseloads. For example, states could be required to meet work participation standards through engaging recipients in work or activities, rather than permitting states to meet their standard either partially or fully through caseload reduction. Policymakers might also look outside of TANF, to altering existing programs. For example, the child tax credit could be fully refundable and advance-payable. Alternatively, policymakers could look at different forms of aid, such as unconditional children's allowances or subsidized jobs, to provide ongoing support for needy families with children.
