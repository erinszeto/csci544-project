That section defines a refugee as a person who is persecuted or who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An alien who is physically present or arrives in the United States, regardless of the alien's immigration status, may apply for asylum. Although the burden of proof had not been explicitly described in the INA prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, regulations at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b) placed the burden of proof on the asylum applicant, as did previous statutory provisions. Also, case law had placed the burden of proof on the asylum applicant. The grant of asylum is discretionary, and even if an applicant meets the burden of proof for asylum eligibility, asylum may be denied on discretionary grounds.", "Prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, there had been no explicit standards in the INA for determining the credibility of an asylum applicant and the necessity for corroborating evidence of applicant testimony. In the absence of explicit statutory guidelines, standards for determining credibility and sufficiency of evidence evolved through the case law of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and federal courts. However, these standards were not necessarily consistent across federal appellate courts, arguably yielding different results in otherwise apparently similar cases. Generally, an asylum adjudicator could base an adverse credibility finding on factors such as the demeanor of the applicant or witness, inconsistencies both within a given testimony and between a given testimony and other testimony and evidence (which may include country conditions, news accounts, etc.), and a lack of detail or specificity in testimony. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) had held that an adjudicator must make explicit the reasons for an adverse credibility finding or the court will accept the applicant's testimony as credible.", "An adverse credibility finding could be based in part but not solely on an applicant's failure to provide corroboration. The Ninth Circuit had held that where there is reason for an adjudicator to question the applicant's credibility and the applicant fails to provide easily obtainable corroborating evidence with no explanation for such failure, an adverse credibility finding will withstand judicial review. With regard to sufficiency of the evidence, the BIA and the federal courts had agreed that credible testimony alone may suffice to sustain the applicant's burden of proof in some cases, but disagreed on when credible testimony alone meets the burden and when corroboration is needed. The BIA standard had been that where it would be reasonable to expect corroboration, it would have to be provided or an explanation for failure to provide it would have to be given. However, some circuits criticized the BIA for failing to articulate what corroboration it expected in particular cases and why. The Ninth Circuit had adopted a standard that an applicant's credible testimony alone always sufficed to sustain the burden of proof of eligibility where it was unrefuted, direct, and specific. One authority argued that the BIA's approach was contrary to international standards under which an asylum applicant should be given the benefit of the doubt, given the difficulties in obtaining corroborating evidence, although the applicant should try to provide any available corroborating evidence. On the other hand, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit asserted that the BIA standards were consistent with international standards because an applicant is supposed to try to provide corroboration for his or her claim or satisfactorily explain its absence.", "Prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, an alien who was inadmissible on certain terrorist grounds or who was removable for engaging or having engaged in terrorist activities was not eligible for asylum. Not foreclosed from relief was a person who was inadmissible as a member of a terrorist organization, the spouse or child of a person inadmissible on terrorist grounds, or a person who was a representative of a terrorist organization when the Attorney General determined that there were not reasonable grounds for regarding the representative as a danger to the security of the United States.

Neither \u00a7 208 nor \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A) of the INA, previously or as amended, nor the relevant regulations refer to or define the concept of a \"central reason,\" which appears to be a modification of established refugee/asylum laws, although possibly a slight one, since existing case precedents recognize similar standards. The conference report for the REAL ID Act noted that a past proposed change to asylum regulations would have required that a protected statutory ground be a central, not incidental or tangential, motive for persecution.", "Case law concerning asylum has addressed the concept of \"mixed motives\" for the persecution of an alien. Where there is more than one motive for persecution, a person may be granted asylum as long as one of the motives is a statutory ground of persecution. For example, a person may be economically persecuted, e.g., he may receive an extortion demand. If the extortion is motivated by both a desire to obtain money and by a desire to punish the person for a political opinion, or being a member of a race, religion, nationality, or particular social group, then that person may be granted asylum. However, a person may be denied asylum where economic persecution is motivated solely by the desire to obtain money rather than for the motives enumerated in the statute. The standard for the importance of the statutory motive in asylum cases has ranged from being one of the motives to being a meaningful motive to being a principal motive. Thus, the statutory establishment of a central reason standard appears to be a modification to the mixed motives standard in some case precedents, but consistent with the operative standard in others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corroboration and Credibility", "paragraphs": ["Subsection 101(a)(3) of the REAL ID Act attempts to bring some clarity and consistency to evidentiary determinations by codifying standards for sustaining the burden of proof, determining credibility of applicant testimony, and determining when corroborating evidence may be required.", "Under the REAL ID Act, the testimony of the applicant may suffice to sustain the applicant's burden without corroboration, but only if the adjudicator determines that it is credible, persuasive and refers to specific facts demonstrating refugee status.

If the adjudicator determines in his/her discretion that the applicant should provide corroborating evidence for otherwise credible testimony, such corroborating evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have it and cannot reasonably obtain it. Considering the totality of circumstances and all relevant factors, the adjudicator may base an applicant or witness credibility determination on, among other relevant factors, demeanor, candor, responsiveness, inherent plausibility of the account, consistency between the written and oral statements (regardless of when they were made, whether they were under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), internal consistency of a statement, consistency of statements with other evidence of record (including the Department of State reports on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy or falsehood goes to the heart of an applicant's claim. There is no presumption of credibility; however, if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness has a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.", "Given the flexibility afforded the adjudicator, it is not clear that the REAL ID Act represents either a significant departure from case law standards for credibility and corroboration or a clear resolution of inconsistencies among case precedents in different federal appellate courts and also the BIA. The INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(ii), as amended by the REAL ID Act, appears to permit an adjudicator to make an adverse credibility finding based on the applicant's failure to provide corroborating evidence for otherwise credible testimony, unless the applicant does not have it or cannot reasonably obtain it. This provision appears to be intended primarily to resolve the difference between the BIA and the Ninth Circuit with regard to credibility and sufficiency of evidence by adopting the BIA position with some modification (specifying what circumstances excuse an applicant's failure to provide corroboration). On the other hand, the amended version of INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) generally appears to be a codification of, but not a significant change from, existing case law permitting an asylum adjudicator to consider the totality of circumstances including relevant factors such as demeanor, inconsistencies, and the like in making credibility determinations, as long as they are not actually speculation or conjecture, rather than factual observation. However, the clause providing that an adjudicator may consider an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood regardless of whether it goes to the crux of an asylum claim appears intended to supersede Ninth Circuit precedent that inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods that do not go to the heart of a claim will not support an adverse credibility finding. But any such consideration would have to take into account the totality of circumstances and relevant factors, even with the passing of the REAL ID Act.

Although there are similarities between asylum and withholding of removal, there are also significant differences. Asylum is a discretionary form of relief, for which the standard is a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\" Withholding of removal is mandatory relief from removal for those who can satisfy the higher standard of a \"clear probability of persecution,\" also expressed as \"more likely than not\" that one would be persecuted. A person who has been granted asylum has been admitted into the United States, although the status is not a right to reside permanently in the United States. A person who is granted withholding has not been granted legal entry into the United States and may be more readily removed to his country when there is no longer any threat to his life or freedom. Withholding of removal is only specific to a particular country and therefore does not preclude removal to another country under INA \u00a7 241(b)(1)(C). An alien granted withholding of removal may not adjust to the status of a lawful permanent resident and the alien's family members are not eligible to come to the United States via the alien's status in the United States.

Additionally, under \u00a7 208(b)(3) of the INA the spouse and children of an alien granted asylum, if not otherwise eligible for asylum, may be granted asylum themselves if accompanying or following to join the alien.

Different eligibility conditions apply to each of these forms of relief. Cancellation of removal itself has different conditions applicable to permanent residents, nonpermanent residents, battered spouses and children, and beneficiaries of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). The evidentiary standards have generally not been specified in statutes. However, section 240A(b)(2)(D) of the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(D)) does provide that the Attorney General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to an application for cancellation of removal for a battered spouse or child and that the determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.", "Various regulations address burden of proof and evidentiary standards for some forms of removal relief. Generally, the applicant for removal relief has the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. If evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply. The burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding or deferral of removal under the Torture Convention to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. Evidence to be considered includes but is not limited to certain factors enumerated in the regulations. The burden of proof is on the applicant for removal relief under NACARA to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is eligible for such relief. In certain cases a presumption of extreme hardship applies, and in such cases, the burden of proof is on the government to establish that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were removed from the United States. In those cases where a presumption of extreme hardship applies, the burden of proof is on immigration authorities to establish that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from the United States. For temporary protected status, the applicant must provide supporting documentary evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own statements to meet his or her burden of proof. The applicant must submit documentary evidence required in the instructions and may be required to submit evidence of unsuccessful attempts to obtain required documents or alternative evidence.", "The BIA has ruled that the general standards developed in case law for suspension of deportation, the pre-IIRAIRA form of relief analogous to cancellation of removal, should be applied to the newer form of relief.

Moreover, states were required, pursuant to implementing regulations, to confiscate a driver's license or personal identification card if any of the above security components were compromised.", "The statute also required that the implementing regulations address how drivers' licenses and identification cards were issued by the states. Specifically, the regulations were required to include minimum standards for the documentation required by the applicant, the procedures utilized for verifying the documents used, and the standards for processing the applications. The regulations were, however, prohibited from not only infringing upon the \"State's power to set criteria concerning what categories of individuals are eligible to obtain a driver's license or personal identification card from that State,\" but also from requiring a state to take an action that \"conflicts with or otherwise interferes with the full enforcement of state criteria concerning the categories of individuals that were eligible to obtain a driver's license or personal identification card.\" In other words, it appeared that if a state granted a certain category of individuals (i.e., aliens, legal or illegal) permission to obtain a license, nothing in the implementing regulations were to infringe on that state's decision or its ability to enforce that decision. In addition, the regulations were also not to require a single uniform design, and were required to include procedures designed to protect the privacy rights of individual applicants.", "Finally, the law required the use of negotiated rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. This process was designed to bring together agency representatives and concerned interest groups to negotiate the text of a proposed rule. The rulemaking committee was required to include representatives from: (1) state and local offices that issue drivers' licenses and/or personal identification cards; (2) state elected officials; (3) Department of Homeland Security; and (4) interested parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Made by the REAL ID Act", "paragraphs": ["In general, while the REAL ID Act does not directly impose federal standards with respect to states' issuance of drivers' licenses and personal identification cards, states nevertheless appear to need to adopt such standards and modify any conflicting laws or regulations in order for such documents to be recognized by federal agencies for official purposes.", "As enacted version of the REAL ID Act contains a definition of the phrase \"official purpose.\" For purposes of the act, an \"official purpose\" is defined as including, but not limited to, \"accessing Federal facilities, boarding federally regulated commercial aircraft, entering nuclear power plants, and any other purposes that the Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall determine.\" In addition, the REAL ID Act contains a provision that specifically repeals the recently enacted \u00a7 7212 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which contained the preexisting law with respect to national standards for drivers' licenses and personal identification cards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimum Issuance Standards", "paragraphs": ["Section 202(c) of the REAL ID Act establishes minimum issuance standards for federal recognition requiring that before a state can issue a driver's license or photo identification card, a state will have to verify with the issuing agency, the issuance, validity and completeness of: (1) a photo identification document or a non-photo document containing both the individual's full legal name and date of birth; (2) date of birth; (3) proof of a social security number (SSN) or verification of the individual's ineligibility for a SSN; and (4) name and address of the individual's principal residence.

Moreover, the states are required to clearly state on the face of the document that it is not to be accepted for federal identification or for any official purpose.
