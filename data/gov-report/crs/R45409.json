Quantum science, generally, is the study of the smallest particles of matter and energy; QIS builds on quantum science principles to obtain and process information in ways that cannot be achieved based on classical physics principles. QIS is based on the premise that information science depends on quantum effects in physics.", "The advantages to using QIS in certain circumstances can be illustrated by the example of quantum computing. Quantum computing is not just \"faster\" than classical computing. It is not useful for many types of problems where a classical supercomputer would excel. However, there are certain tasks for which the power of quantum computing is unmatched, such as code breaking. This power is derived from quantum computing's use of \"qubits\" or \"quantum bits.\" ", "Whereas classical computing uses \"bits\" for data processing, quantum computing uses qubits. The practical difference between a bit and a qubit is that a bit can only exist in one of two states at a time, usually represented by a 1 and a 0, whereas a qubit can exist in both states at one time. This is a phenomenon called \"superposition\" and it is what allows the power of a quantum computer to grow exponentially with the addition of each bit. Two bits in a classical computer provides four possible combinations\u201400, 01, 11, and 10, but only one combination at a time. Two bits in a quantum computer provides for the same four possibilities, but, because of superposition, the qubits can represent all four states at the same time, making the quantum computer four times as powerful as the classical computer. So, adding a bit to a classical computer increases its power linearly, but adding a qubit to a quantum computer increases its power exponentially\u2014doubling power with the addition of each qubit.", "Quantum computing, for all its promise, is still a developing technology (along with other quantum applications). Assembling a working quantum computer is much more difficult than assembling a classical computer. The difficulty is caused by the narrow set of conditions that must exist for a quantum computer to work. For example, the temperature must be exactly 1/100 th of a degree above absolute zero. Also, the slightest vibration can cause a qubit to lose its superposition. Until systems can be developed to maintain the ideal conditions to maintain a qubit, many quantum systems will remain theoretical in nature."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "QIS Applications", "paragraphs": ["Although much of the press coverage of QIS has been devoted to quantum computing, there is more to QIS.
