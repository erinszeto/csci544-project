Rural Housing Vouchers are made available to residents to cover the difference between the tenant's rent contribution and the new rental rate. Tenants may use the voucher at their current property or any other rental unit that passes Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing quality standards, and where USDA vouchers are accepted. Use of the vouchers is prohibited at HUD Section 8 or other federally assisted public housing projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Funding Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multi-family Housing Preservation and Revitalization Program (MPR)", "paragraphs": ["In November 2004, USDA released a report on the Section 515 program. The purpose of the report was to assess the status of the Section 515 portfolio in terms of prepayment options and long-term rehabilitation needs. While few health and safety issues were found, the report found that no properties had adequate reserves or sufficient cash flow to do needed repairs and for adequate maintenance over time. The report concluded that the USDA portfolio of Section 515 projects represented a federal investment of nearly $12 billion; that the projects serve some of the poorest and most underserved families in rural communities; and that the location, physical condition, and tenant profile of the properties suggest that the public interest is best served by revitalizing most of the housing for long-term use by low- and moderate-income tenants. The report recommended a revitalization program for USDA multi-family housing.", "In response to the report, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, P.L. 109-97 , included a provision that created a demonstration program for the preservation and revitalization of multi-family rental housing properties. The program is referred to as the Multi-Family Housing Preservation and Revitalization (MPR) program. The purpose of the MPR program is to preserve Section 515 and Section 514/516 projects in order to provide safe and affordable housing for low-income residents. Expectations are that properties selected to participate will be able to be revitalized and extend affordable use without displacing or impacting tenants because of increased rents.", "Under MPR, the USDA has authority to use funds to restructure existing loans using such tools as reducing or eliminating interest; deferring loan payments; subordinating, reducing, or re-amortizing loan debt; and making loan advances.", "In its FY2011 Budget for USDA, the Administration proposed no funding for the MPR program. The Administration argues that the program has been operating since 2006, that the most cost-effective and justified repairs have been achieved, and that continued funding could be seen as over-subsidizing multi-family property owners. Instead, the Administration proposed an increase in funding for the Section 515 program to $95 million instead of the $70 million approved for FY2010.", "Title VIII of the Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act of 2010, H.R. 4868 , would authorize continuing finding for the MPR program. The bill was passed by the House Financial Services Committee but has not been considered in the full House. No companion bill was introduced in the Senate.", "Since no appropriations legislation was enacted before the beginning of FY2011, the 111 th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions (CR) to continue funding at the FY2010 level for most accounts in the federal budget (including all of the accounts in USDA's budget). The latest CR ( P.L. 111-322 ) is slated to expire at the earlier of March 4, 2011, or enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for Section 502 Guaranteed Home Loans", "paragraphs": ["Since the collapse of the mortgage market in 2007, prospective homebuyers have found that lenders typically require either a 20% downpayment or a 10% downpayment and the purchase of private mortgage insurance. This has resulted in an increased demand for loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the USDA, since these programs require smaller downpayments, and in the case of VA and USDA, no downpayments.", "The use of the Section 502 guaranteed loan program increased from 32,481 loans in FY2007 to 56,745 loans in FY2008, an increase of nearly 75%. In FY2009, there were 119,826 Section 502 guaranteed loans issued, an increase of more than 111%. The high demand for the program has continued, and on March 9, 2010, USDA sent a notice to USDA State Directors noting that the FY2010 funding for the Section 502 guaranteed loan program was expected to be exhausted by the end of April. This is not the first time that the USDA would have exhausted its loan authority prior to the end of the fiscal year. However, this year was the first time that the agency would be exhausting its funds with so much of the fiscal year remaining.", "On May 11, 2010, USDA provided guidance to lenders on how to proceed with loans when FY2010 funds for the Section 502 loan guarantee program were exhausted. In the guidance, USDA estimated that funds would be exhausted on May 12, 2010, or soon thereafter. Lenders could resume making Section 502 guaranteed loans but the USDA guarantee on the loans would be \"subject to the availability of funds and Congressional authority to charge a 3.5% guarantee fee for purchase loans and a 2.25% guarantee fee for refinance loans.\" Lenders would assume all loss default risk for the loans until funds are available for USDA to obligate and USDA issues the Loan Note Guarantees to lenders.", "As enacted on July 29, 2010, the 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act, P.L. 111-212 , provided additional appropriations for Section 502 guaranteed loans for the remainder of FY2010. The act also permits USDA to charge lenders a guarantee fee of up to 3.5% of the mortgage amount. In addition, lenders may be charged an annual fee of 0.5% of the mortgage balance for the life of the loan. These changes in the guarantee fees are intended to enable the Section 502 guaranteed home loan program to operate with little or no need for positive credit subsidies in FY2011 and beyond. ", "The latest continuing resolution, P.L. 111-322 , funds the program at the FY2010 level until the earlier of March 4, 2011, or enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation for USDA.
