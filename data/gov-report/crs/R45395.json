It condemns the robbery\u2014knowingly taking the property of another by force or threat\u2014of drug dealers, mom-and-pop markets, and multinational corporations.", "Attempted Hobbs Act robbery consists of an intent to rob, coupled with a substantial step toward that objective; conspiracy, a scheme of two or more to rob or extort; and accomplice liability, aiding and abetting a Hobbs Act violation of another.", "Hobbs Act robbery, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years, often occurs in confluence with the use of a firearm during and in furtherance of its commission, a fact that triggers the mandatory minimum sentences authorized in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The facts present in a Hobbs Act robbery case may also implicate violations of (1) the federal racketeering statute punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and (2) the federal money laundering statutes, likewise punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years.", "Hobbs Act extortion comes in two forms. One is akin to robbery, the other to bribery. Neither requires but a minimal impact on commerce. Both view individuals as well as organizations as potential defendants. As a robbery look-alike, it outlaws the wrongful use of force or fear to induce another to surrender property to which the aggressor has no lawful claim. As a bribery look-alike, it outlaws corrupt quid pro quos, i.e., a public official obtaining a payment, to which he is not entitled, in anticipation of the performance of an official act. The proscriptions also apply to attempt or conspiracy to commit either variety of Hobbs Act extortion and may implicate accomplice liability (aiding and abetting) as well.", "Hobbs Act extortion in either form is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years.

Except for an adjustment in the fine schedule, the statute has remained unchanged ever since. The Supreme Court has visited the Hobbs Act on several occasions to review the statute's related, but very distinct, crimes. One proscribes robbery and is sometimes used to prosecute street crimes.

The Hobbs Act, however, encompasses both robbery and attempted robbery. Thus, even though no robbery ever occurs, a defendant may be guilty of aiding and abetting a Hobbs Act violation if he assists someone else's attempt to commit a Hobbs Act robbery.", "\"To be convicted of an 'attempt,' a defendant must: (1) have the specific intent to engage in the criminal conduct with which he is charged with attempting; and (2) have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the offense that strongly corroborates his criminal intent.\" As a general rule, conviction does not require successful commiss ion of the attempted offense. \"Factual impossibility and mistake of fact are not defenses to an attempt\" to commit a Hobbs Act robbery as long as the defendant intended to commit the substantive offense and took a substantial step to the satisfaction of that intent acting on facts as he believed them to be.

In addition, a defendant whose violation involved a firearm may have committed a second, separate offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Section 924(c) outlaws the use of a firearm during and in furtherance of a crime of violence, and calls for imposition of one of a series of mandatory minimums based on the type of firearm, the circumstances of its use, and the defendant's earlier criminal conduct. Until recently, every federal appellate court to consider the issue had concluded that a Hobbs Act robbery constituted a crime of violence for purposes of section 924(c). The Supreme Court's April 2018 decision in Session s v. Dimaya initially raised questions as to the continued validity of that conclusion based on the definition in Dimaya of what constitutes a crime of violence. Section 924(c) defines the term \"crime of violence\" as a felony either (1) with an element of physical force (the \"elements clause\") or (2) that involves substantial risk of physical force (the \"risk clause\"). The Court in Dimaya held that a comparably worded risk clause in another statute, 18 U.S.C. 16(b), was unconstitutionally vague. Lower court cases after Dimaya have continued to recognize Hobbs Act robbery as a section 924(c) crime of violence either under the elements clause or under the theory that section 924(c)'s definition is subject to a different mode of analysis. Application of section 924(c) is subject to the same Sixth Amendment right to jury consideration and Fifth Amendment rights to grand jury indictment and due process (proof beyond a reasonable doubt) as any other federal felony.", "Hobbs Act robbery also qualifies as a racketeering predicate offense and thus as a money laundering predicate offense as well.

RICO violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years.", "Hobbs Act robbery, by virtue of its status as a RICO predicate offenses, stands as a money laundering predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957. Section 1956, among other things, proscribes engaging in a financial transaction involving the proceeds of a predicate offense in order to launder the proceeds or to promote further predicate offenses. Section 1957 proscribes engaging in a monetary transaction using more than $10,000 of the proceedings of a predicate offense. Thus, laundering Hobbs Act robbery proceeds or using the proceeds to facilitate subsequent robberies constitutes a violation of section 1956.

In Enmons , the Supreme Court explained that the word \"wrongful\" as used in the Hobbs Act extortion provision refers to the use of force, violence, or fear to obtain property to which the extortionist has no lawful claim. Thus, the Hobbs Act applies to personal payoffs or feather-bedding extorted by union officials, but it does not reach \"the use of violence to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services which the employer seeks.\" ", "The Court concluded that the use of force, violence, or fear in Enmons was not \"wrongful\" because the purpose for which violence was employed, legitimate labor objectives, was not wrongful. Outside of the labor context, however, the lower federal courts have held that the question of Hobbs Act coverage turns on whether the use or threatened use of force, violence, or fear, as a means of squeezing property from another, is \"wrongful.\" Legitimate labor objectives aside, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have decided that in the case of Hobbs Act extortion the use or threatened use of force or violence is \"inherently wrongful.\" As for the fear of economic harm, these courts have said that \"the use of legitimate economic threats to procure property is 'wrongful' under the Hobbs Act, only if the defendant has no claim of right to that property.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Color of Official Right", "paragraphs": ["Hobbs Act extortion under color of official right occurs when a \"public official has obtained a payment to which he is not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.\" It is the \"rough equivalent\" of bribery.

United States , the Supreme Court turned to the bribery statute's definition of \"official act\" in its summary of what constitutes an official act for purposes of Hobbs Act extortion:", "In sum, an \"official act\" is a decision or action on a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\" The \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\" must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee. It must also be something specific and focused that is \"pending\" or \"may by law be brought\" before the public official. To qualify as an 'official act,' the public official must make a decision or take an action on that \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\" Or agree to do so. That decision or action may include using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an \"official act,\" or to advise another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \"official act\" by another official.

Section 2 of the federal criminal code treats those who aid or abet the commission of a felony by another as if they had committed the underlying crime themselves. Here as elsewhere, \"[t]he crime of attempt consists of two elements. First, the government must prove culpable intent. In other words, the defendant must have been acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime that he is charged with attempting. The second element is conduct constituting a substantial step toward commission of the crime that strongly corroborates that intent.\" Factual impossibility is not a defense.

Yet, a predator and a \"victim\" may be guilty of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act extortion under color of official right without the participation of anyone else. Conspiracy requires that all conspirators embrace a common purpose, the commission of the underlying offense. Hobbs Act extortion requires the victim's \"consent\" to the surrender of his property to the extortionist, but \"the minimal 'consent' required to trigger \u00a7 1951 is insufficient to form a conspiratorial agreement.\" It helps to think of Hobbs Act extortion as akin to bribery. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. O casio , [\"t]he 'consent' required to pay a bribe does not necessarily create a conspiratorial agreement. In cases where the bribe payor is merely complying with an official demand, the payor lacks the mens rea necessary for a conspiracy.\" Imagine, for example, \"that a health inspector demands a bribe from a restaurant owner, threatening to close down the restaurant if the owner does not pay. If the owner reluctantly pays the bribe in order to keep the business open, the owner has 'consented' to the inspector's demand, but this mere acquiescence in the demand does not form a conspiracy.\" A unity of intent is also a component of aiding or abetting another to commit Hobbs Act extortion, which is complete when someone else commits the underlying offense.

Unlike Hobbs Act robbery, the government appears to have rarely prosecuted Hobbs Act extortion as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (carrying or using a firearm in furtherance of crime of violence). Hobbs Act extortion, however, qualifies as a predicate offense under RICO, the money laundering statutes, and the Travel Act. A RICO violation, for example, occurs whenever an individual conducts the affairs of a commercial enterprise through the patterned commission of a series of predicate offenses such as Hobbs Act extortion. The proceeds from Hobbs Act extortion may constitute an element of promotional money laundering. Proceeds of more than $10,000 generated by Hobbs Act extortion may supply an element in the offense of monetary transaction money laundering.
