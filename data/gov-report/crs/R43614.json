Membership is open to all \"peace-loving states\" that accept the obligations contained in the U.N.

Consequently, global and domestic politics play a primary role in many membership decisions.", "Each of the United Nations' 16 specialized agencies has its own constitution, rules, membership, governance, and financial resources. As such, the process and criteria for admitting new members vary depending on the organization. In 11 specialized agencies, U.N. membership gives a state access to membership in the agency without requiring its admission to be approved by the current membership. Of these 11 agencies, 3 also provide membership, without a vote, to any member of any other specialized agency. Two other specialized agencies require a separate voting process to admit new members.", "U.S. Role and Policy", "Decisions on U.N. membership are subject to veto by any of the P-5; thus, the United States plays a significant role in determining U.N. membership. The United States has a more limited role in U.N. specialized agencies because decisions to admit new members to these bodies are generally made by the entire membership and each member has one vote. U.S. membership decisions in both the United Nations and its specialized agencies lie primarily with the executive branch, which represents the United States in U.N. and other multilateral fora.", "Although Congress often does not play a large role in determining U.N. membership, Members have sought to influence U.S. policy on the issue through legislation advocating or opposing the membership of various countries and entities\u2014including Israel, Montenegro, Kosovo, South Africa, China/Taiwan, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Notably, in the mid-1990s, Congress enacted two separate laws that prohibit funding to U.N. entities that (1) admit the PLO as a member, and (2) grant full membership as a state to any organization or group that does not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood (see Section 410 of P.L. 103-236 and Section 414 of P.L. 101-246).

Some experts also suggest that U.N. membership could affect membership in other international organizations, such as the International Criminal Court. U.S. contributions to U.N. entities. Based on restrictions in U.S. law, Palestinian membership in U.N. bodies could have implications for U.S. funding of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. For example, when Palestine was admitted to UNESCO, it became eligible for membership, without a vote, in three specialized agencies\u2014the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). To date, Palestine has not joined any of these specialized agencies. The United States is a member of IFAD and WIPO, but not UNIDO. Political considerations in membership criteria and process. Many experts agree that each U.N. member state's decision to admit a new state is largely political.

", "The pace at which new members have been admitted to the United Nations has generally reflected the geo-political circumstances of the time. For example, Cold War tensions contributed to the limited number of new members admitted during the organization's first decade. Both Eastern and Western bloc countries were concerned that new members might strengthen the voting power of the other bloc; consequently, just nine states were admitted between 1945 and 1954 (see Figure 1 ). From the mid-1950s through the 1970s, U.N. membership more than doubled as former European colonies in Africa were admitted. Another wave of new members resulted from the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia in the 1990s and early 2000s. The four states most recently admitted as members were Switzerland (2002), Timor-Leste (2002), Montenegro (2006), and South Sudan (2011). ", "A key area of ongoing debate regarding U.N. membership is the organization's possible role in determining statehood. By international practice, a state is generally understood to be \"an entity that has a defined territory and a permanent population, under the control of its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other such entities.\" On the one hand, the United Nations\u2014as an organization of independent states\u2014does not recognize states; rather, states recognize states. As such, many experts and observers, including the United Nations itself, argue that the organization does not have the authority to recognize either a state or government.", "On the other hand, many analysts agree that U.N. membership is an acknowledgement by U.N. members that an entity has satisfied the requirements of statehood. It provides governments with legitimacy, not only internationally, but also domestically. For many countries, membership in the United Nations provides an equal voice in U.N. bodies like the General Assembly, an international platform to advocate and pursue national and foreign policy objectives, and the opportunity to receive or provide technical or development assistance through multilateral mechanisms. Consequently, obtaining U.N. membership is often a priority for new countries, territories, organizations, or entities (hereinafter referred to as \"entities\" for the purpose of this report) aiming to obtain statehood."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Paths to U.N. Membership: Criteria and Process", "paragraphs": ["The circumstances under which a state obtains U.N. membership can vary. The original 51 members of the organization include many of the Allied nations of World War II that had either signed the United Nations Declaration in 1942, or participated in the founding United Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945. The remaining 142 members were accepted for membership under the criteria and processes outlined in the Charter and the Rules of Procedure for both the General Assembly and the Security Council. Examples of circumstances under which these states obtained U.N. membership are described below, and in some cases may overlap. ", "Some members, sometimes referred to as existing states , were not among the original 51 U.N. members; they were, however, subsequently admitted to the organization. Examples include Barbados, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Tunisia, and Nigeria. Other members are or were divided states . Such states, which were divided because of the East-West conflict, have generally obtained U.N. membership after the claims of various sides had been determined in favor of either division or reunification. Examples include the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic (now Germany), North and South Korea, and the Republic of Vietnam and Democratic Republic of Vietnam (now Vietnam). Some members have been admitted after the secession or partition of a state that was already a U.N. member. In such cases, the seceding entity reapplied for membership. Examples include the partitions of Pakistan and India and Pakistan and Bangladesh, and the admission of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as new U.N. members after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In some cases, two existing member states have merged . In practice, the process for admitting such members has been flexible; the newly merged states did not have to reapply for membership. Examples include East and West Germany (Germany) and the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (Yemen). One state, Indonesia, withdrew and re-entered the United Nations in the mid-1960s. The General Assembly and Security Council treated the withdrawal as if it were a \"temporary 'inactive' membership\" that ended cooperation with the organization, rather than the country's membership.
