Piracy of the content created by movie, music, and software companies and sales of counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and consumer products negatively impact the American economy and can pose risks to the health and safety of U.S. citizens. Although rights holders and law enforcement agencies currently have some legal tools to pursue domestic infringers, they face difficult challenges in enforcing IP laws against actors located abroad. Many websites trafficking in pirated copyrighted content or counterfeit goods are registered and operate in foreign countries. These foreign \"rogue sites\" sell subject matter that infringes U.S. copyrights and trademarks to U.S. consumers, yet the website operators remain beyond the reach of U.S. courts and authorities.", "Some believe that legislation is necessary to address the jurisdictional problem of holding foreign websites accountable for piracy and counterfeiting. On May 12, 2011, Senator Leahy introduced S. 968, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP Act), that would allow the Attorney General to seek an injunction from a federal court against a domain name used by a foreign website that engages in, enables, or facilitates infringement; such court order may then be served on U.S.-based domain name servers, Internet advertisers, search engines, and financial transaction providers, which would be required to take actions such as preventing access to the website or suspending business services to the site. IP rights holders may also sue to obtain a cease and desist order against the operator of an Internet site dedicated to infringement (whether domestic or foreign) or the domain name itself.", "On October 26, 2011, Representative Lamar Smith introduced H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). SOPA is similar to the PROTECT IP Act yet is broader in scope by including several provisions not found in S. 968, such as those that increase the criminal penalties for online streaming of copyrighted content, create criminal penalties for trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and require the appointment of dedicated IP personnel in U.S. embassies.", "There has been considerable public debate about the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA. Critics claim these measures amount to \"Internet censorship\" and that they would impair free speech. There are also concerns that the legislation will disrupt the technical integrity of the Internet. Supporters of the bills argue that in order to reduce digital piracy and online counterfeiting, new enforcement mechanisms are vital for U.S. economic growth and needed to protect public health and safety. After intense lobbying against the legislation, Senator Reid on January 20, 2012, postponed a cloture vote that had been scheduled for the PROTECT IP Act, and Representative Smith announced that the House Judiciary Committee would similarly postpone consideration of SOPA, until a compromise could be reached between supporters and opponents of the legislation.", "An alternative to these bills is the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act; S. 2029, H.R. 3782) that would authorize the International Trade Commission (ITC) to investigate foreign websites that allegedly engage in willful IP infringement. The ITC may issue a cease and desist order against the infringing foreign website; such an order may be used by the rights holder to oblige financial transaction providers or Internet advertising services to stop doing business with the website. Unlike the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA, the OPEN Act does not apply to domestic websites and also would not require search engines or domain name servers to block access or disable links to foreign websites."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Internet has become a central part of the American economy, delivering innovative products while eliminating the need for inefficient middlemen.

The problem is significant; as much as 6% of the U.S. gross national product is generated by industries supported by intellectual property laws. A recent report contends that nearly 24% of all Internet traffic worldwide is infringing. Piracy of the content created by movie, music, and software companies, and the sale of counterfeit goods that include inauthentic clothing, pharmaceutical drugs, and consumer electronics, negatively impacts the American economy. Although the Government Accountability Office cautions that it is difficult to precisely quantify the economy-wide impacts of piracy, it is believed to be a serious problem.

Title II of the DMCA added a new Section 512 to the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the U.S. Code) in order to limit the liability of service providers against claims of copyright infringement relating to online materials. This \"safe harbor\" immunity is available only to parties that qualify as a \"service provider\" as defined by the DMCA, and only after the provider complies with certain eligibility requirements. In exchange for immunity from liability, the DMCA requires service providers to cooperate with copyright owners to address infringing activities conducted by the providers' customers. The DMCA's safe harbors greatly limit service providers' liability based on the specific functions they perform. The safe harbors correspond to four functional operations of a service provider that might otherwise constitute copyright infringement: (1) transitory digital network communications, (2) system caching, (3) storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users, and (4) information location tools. ", "One safe-harbor-qualifying condition common to three of the four categories is the requirement that upon proper notification by the copyright owner of online material being displayed or transmitted without authorization, a service provider must \"expeditiously\" remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material. This \"notice and takedown\" obligation does not apply when the service provider functions as a passive conduit of information under 17 U.S.C. Section 512(a) (offering transitory digital network communications), but is a condition that must be met to obtain shelter under the remaining three safe harbor provisions. As indicated by the eligibility conditions in each subsection of Section 512(b)-(d), the notice and takedown procedure varies slightly for each. To prevent abuse of the notice and take-down procedure, Section 512(f) provides damages, costs, and attorneys' fees to any service provider that is injured by a knowing, material misrepresentation that an item or activity is infringing. For example, any person who sends a \"cease and desist\" letter to a service provider, with the knowledge that the claims of copyright infringement are false, may be liable to the accused infringer for damages.", "As noted earlier, the DMCA's safe harbor provisions do not confer absolute immunity from legal liability for copyright infringement. Although they ensure that qualifying service providers are not liable for monetary relief, they may be liable for limited injunctive relief. For example, a service provider that provides \"transitory digital network communications\" may be subject to the following injunctive relief:", "an order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider's system or network who is using the provider's service to engage in infringing activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified in the order; an order restraining the service provider from providing access, by taking reasonable steps specified in the order to block access, to a specific, identified, online location outside the United States.", "In the case of service providers that provide either (1) system caching, (2) storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users, or (3) information location tools, the court may grant injunctive relief with respect to a service provider in one or more of the following forms:", "an order restraining the service provider from providing access to infringing material or activity residing at a particular online site on the provider's system or network; an order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider's system or network who is engaging in infringing activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified in the order; such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary to prevent or restrain infringement of copyrighted material specified in the order of the court at a particular online location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief comparably effective for that purpose.", "One public interest group has praised the importance of the DMCA's safe harbor provisions to the development of the Internet:", "Without these protections, the risk of potential copyright liability would prevent many online intermediaries from providing services such as hosting and transmitting user-generated content.

In order to obtain domain name seizure warrants, ICE agents present evidence of criminal trademark violations or criminal copyright infringement that is occurring on the website to a federal magistrate judge. In order to issue the warrant, the judge must determine, by a standard of probable cause, that the domain name is being used in violation of federal criminal laws. Due process protections are part of this process, as described by the ICE Director:", "As with all judicially authorized seizure warrants, the owners of the seized property have the opportunity to challenge the judge's determination through a petition. If a petition is filed, a hearing is held in a federal court to determine the validity of the affidavit supporting the seizure, at which point the government would have the burden of proof.\u2026 Under existing federal law, the website owner may also choose to demand return of the property through the law enforcement agency itself, by writing a letter to ICE.\u2026 Further, if the website owner determines he or she does not wish to pursue either of these avenues of due process, a challenge may be filed directly with the law enforcement agency conducting a forfeiture action under administrative processes.", "The assistant deputy director of ICE has explained that several factors are taken into account before the agency decides which domain name should be seized, including", "the popularity of the website, which often correlates with its profitability; whether the website is commercial in nature and earns a substantial amount of money\u2014those that run advertisements, sell subscriptions, or sell merchandise; and whether seizing a site will have a substantial impact on piracy.", "However, the global nature of the Internet presents problems to the civil forfeiture approach used by ICE.

In the view of SOPA's critics, this definition would mean that companies that host user-generated content websites (such as YouTube) and operators of cloud computing storage services (such as Dropbox) would need to monitor, filter, and otherwise police user behavior for infringing activities, in order to avoid being covered by the definition. In addition, while SOPA does not directly modify the DMCA safe harbor provisions, SOPA \"creates uncertainty about whether court orders issued against 'foreign infringing sites' and 'sites dedicated to theft' might disqualify an online service provider from the DMCA safe harbors.\" This \"legal uncertainty for Internet companies\" means that \"SOPA will significantly deter current and future Internet businesses from investing in new ventures.\"", "Others point out that although the \"notice and takedown\" provisions of the DMCA may be abused by content owners making erroneous claims, the consequence is the blocking or removal of such content, whereas under SOPA's notification process available to qualifying plaintiffs, the consequence for false claims is that the money to the website is stopped. They note that such funds (that the website may depend on to exist) may be cut off merely \"based on an allegation of harm that falls short of an allegation of infringement.\"", "Supporters of SOPA observe that while the DMCA has worked well for copyright holders and service providers to address online infringement, the DMCA's \"notice and takedown\" procedures are ineffective against foreign rogue sites; furthermore, the DMCA does not apply to trademark infringement and does not address the use of financial intermediaries such as payment processors and Internet advertising services. Other supporters contend that SOPA's notification process is less likely to be misused than the DMCA's \"notice and takedown\" procedure, because under the latter, a service provider has an incentive to remove infringing content in order to preserve its safe harbor from liability. In contrast, Internet advertisers and payment processors \"don't have business incentives to comply with bad faith notices under SOPA. Each site they are ordered to block is, presumably, a paying customer or revenue source.\" Thus, not many such companies would be willing to \"rubber-stamp any and every order that cuts into their bottom line without some way of making sure the site at issue is one that genuinely falls within the scope of\" SOPA.", "Other supporters disagree that SOPA will diminish investment in new technology ventures or stifle innovation.

The ITC would be empowered to make the determination as to whether there has been such a violation. The only websites that may be investigated by the ITC are ones that have a nondomestic domain name; if the ITC discovers that the accused domain name is a domestic one, the ITC is required to terminate or not initiate the investigation and then refer the matter to the Attorney General for further proceedings as the Attorney General determines is appropriate. In addition, the OPEN Act requires the ITC to terminate, or not initiate, an investigation of a domain name if the operator of the associated Internet site provides a legal notice on the site that states that the operator consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. district courts.

An owner of a copyright or trademark that is the subject of the infringing activity on a nondomestic website may file a complaint with the ITC alleging, under oath, that the Internet site dedicated to infringing activity is being operated or maintained in violation of section 337A. The OPEN Act requires the complainant to send a notice of the complaint to the registrant of the domain name at its postal and e-mail addresses, if they are reasonably available. In addition, the OPEN Act specifies that the complaint must identify (and notify) any financial transaction provider or Internet advertising company that may be required to take measures against the offending website, if the ITC determines that there has been a section 337A violation.

", "The Senate version of the OPEN Act also provides the President with an opportunity to disapprove of any ITC determination \"for policy reasons\" no later than 60 days after the determination is made; such presidential disapproval nullifies the determination.

The ITC may grant a temporary or preliminary cease and desist order against the Internet site if the complainant files with the ITC chairperson (or his designee) a petition requesting such order. The OPEN Act mandates that the ITC chairperson, prior to issuing a temporary or preliminary cease and desist order, must give the owner/operator of the Internet site an opportunity to be heard (which may include submitting information electronically). The ITC chairperson may issue such an order if he determines that \"there is reason to believe\" that an Internet site dedicated to infringing activity is operated or maintained in violation of section 337A. The OPEN Act specifies that the ITC chairperson follow the provisions of rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in deciding whether to issue the temporary or preliminary cease and desist order. If the complainant makes a showing of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the ITC chairperson may make a determination regarding the petition for a temporary cease and desist order on an expedited basis; otherwise, the ITC chairperson is required to make a determination within 30 days. The cease and desist order may last no longer than 14 days after its issuance, although the ITC chairperson may extend the order for additional periods of 14 days for good cause or with consent of the entity against which the order is issued. In order to discourage the filing of frivolous petitions for temporary or preliminary cease and desist orders, the ITC chairperson may require the complainant to post a bond; such bond may be forfeited to the owner of the Internet site if the ITC later determines that the Internet site was not in violation of section 337A. ", "If the ITC \"reasonably believes that a financial transaction provider or an Internet advertising service\" is supplying services to an Internet site that is subject to a cease and desist order, the ITC may allow the complainant to serve a copy of the order upon the financial transaction provider or Internet advertising service. Upon receipt of the order, financial transaction providers must take measures, as expeditiously as reasonable, to prevent or prohibit completion of payment transactions by the provider to the Internet site, and Internet advertising services must take technically feasible measures, as expeditiously as reasonable, to cease serving advertisements to the Internet site. The OPEN Act confers immunity from civil actions for these third parties that take any act reasonably designed to comply with these obligations (or that make a good faith effort to comply).

A defendant in such an action may assert an affirmative defense that the defendant lacks the technical means to comply with the order without incurring an unreasonable economic burden.

The OPEN Act also only applies to foreign websites, whereas the PROTECT IP Act (as reported) and SOPA (as introduced) could apply to domestic websites in certain circumstances.
