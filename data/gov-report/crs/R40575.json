Tyson Foods Inc. also reported a drop in domestic pork sales. As domestic sales fell, retail and wholesale hog prices fell sharply, along with hog and pork-belly futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This drop in prices coincided with seasonal fluctuations in the hog market that would normally have caused prices to be higher. Economists at Purdue University estimated that Indiana hog producers were losing about $5 a head on April 24, compared to estimated losses of about $20 immediately following reports of the initial outbreak in March. Stock analysts also reportedly downgraded the stock of Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc. and lowered annual earnings estimates for these companies.", "In late April, consumers were still confused by how humans can get the 2009 H1N1 flu. For example, a phone survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health on April 29 asked 1,067 consumers about the ways humans can get the 2009 H1N1 flu. Among listed choices, respondents were asked about whether each was a possible way of contracting the disease.

However, a survey conducted by the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) in September 2009 showed that \"nearly two-thirds of China's consumers stopped eating pork in the early stages of the H1N1 influenza outbreak this year, and more than one in five consumers in the world's largest pork market still believe that eating pork can result in catching the flu virus.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Did U.S. Trading Partners React to Reports of the Outbreak?", "paragraphs": ["Citing public health and safety concerns, several countries initiated or implemented steps to ban or restrict U.S. pork or pork products.

Other countries that imposed such restrictions included Croatia, Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. ", "Restrictions have varied by country. Some countries banned all pork products, whereas other countries restricted certain products only. For example, Russia announced it was restricting all livestock and meat products, including beef, pork, and poultry, from selected states, and was restricting all pork from several other selected states. Trade restrictions imposed by China were limited to uncooked pork and pork products, and applied to most U.S. states with confirmed H1N1 cases. Fresh/frozen and heat-treated pork and pork products were ineligible if derived from swine raised or slaughtered in most U.S. states. Hong Kong was not included in any portion of China's suspension. South Korea instituted a partial ban (which was subsequently lifted), suspending imports only of live swine, but not pork products.", "Within the weeks following initial reports of the outbreak, some countries announced that they would lift their import ban, while others announced that they would extend their bans to include all pork imports. Many of these countries imposed these same restrictions on Mexican and Canadian pork and pork products. Various conflicting media reports listed some countries as restricting pork imports that may not have imposed such trade restrictions.", "Of all the countries that imposed restrictions on U.S. swine and pork products, the two largest in terms of their overall importance to U.S. pork export markets\u2014China and Russia\u2014account for an estimated with 15% of the value of annual U.S. pork trade ( Table 1 ).

The bulk of this lost potential was the result of restricted trade from Russia and China. The other countries that restricted U.S. pork imports comprise a small overall share of annual U.S. pork trade. Japan, the largest U.S. market for U.S. pork, with more than one-third of the market in 2008, has repeatedly indicated that it will not restrict U.S. pork exports; also, Hong Kong, despite mainland China's trade restrictions, has indicated that it will not restrict trade.

These statements likely reference USMEF-reported data that include export statistics for both mainland China and Hong Kong. USMEF data typically report exports for Hong Kong and China as a single region because product is known to enter China through Hong Kong. Separately, however, Hong Kong is a larger market for U.S. swine and pork products, with a reported 9% of exports in 2008 compared to 6% for China.

Russia, for example, is not competitive on the global market in red meats and poultry, and its domestic production has not kept pace with consumption as incomes rise, even though government policies have attempted to encourage domestic production. In recent years, imports have accounted for a growing share of Russian pork consumption, and reached more than 50% of supplies in 2008. Russia periodically has imposed SPS measures that have impeded U.S. meat and poultry imports in recent years. In March 2002, Russia announced a ban on U.S. poultry imports over the possible presence of avian influenza in the United States. U.S. officials countered that the ban was not scientifically defensible and was discriminatory. China is among the world's largest pork markets and producers, and imports account for a negligible share of overall supplies. However, imports have grown in recent years and are important to exporting nations such as the United States, given the sheer size of China's market.", "In May 2009, the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said it expected current restrictions on U.S. pork exports to be temporary, particularly as international authorities continued to emphasize that the virus is transmitted through human contact and not through pork consumption. However, many producers were concerned that these initial trade restrictions would be difficult to remove, once fully instituted. For example, EU's livestock beef production has not returned to the level it maintained prior to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as \"mad cow disease.\" BSE also affected U.S. beef producers in 2003 when the first U.S. case was announced.

There were also fears that reduced demand for pork would have adverse ripple effects throughout the hog sector, resulting in production changes as producers respond to lower prices. Analysts predicted that feed prices would likely continue to be volatile, but difficult to anticipate. For example, grains prices have moved higher since their initial drop following early reports of the outbreak. In other livestock markets, wholesale beef and cattle futures prices were initially higher following reports of the outbreak.

", "Early estimates by analysts at the University of Missouri estimated that the U.S. pork industry could see losses of up to $400 million in the months following initial reports of the outbreak, given expected lower market prices. In its May 2009 outlook report, USDA revised its second-quarter hog prices downward to reflect lower prices in April due to the negative effects of H1N1 flu virus. In June 2009, USTR reported updated estimates by the University of Missouri, indicating that the U.S. pork industry could face losses of about $270 million in income in the second quarter of 2009 alone, based on market conditions in the first few days since the virus was identified. More recent estimates, however, indicate that the economic effect of the H1N1 virus has not been as negative as some analysts had predicted.", "Pork producers in the United States began to see a downturn in U.S. pork markets in late 2007. Following years of favorable returns in 2004-2006, the domestic industry began to expand and eventually pushed up slaughter rates to record levels in 2008. At the same time, pork prices started to decline while feed costs and other production input costs were rising. Starting in 2008, the worldwide economic downturn resulted in a decrease in meat demand. The H1N1 outbreak compounded this already worsening situation, and newly imposed trade restrictions in U.S. export markets, particularly in Russia and China, only further strained demand for U.S. pork products. At the same time, despite industry efforts to downsize and reduce sow numbers, increased herd productivity and efficiency gains\u2014given higher litter rates and also higher slaughter weights owing to favorable weather over the summer of 2009\u2014kept overall production volumes stable and put downward pressure on prices. In part because of the surplus situation, in May 2008 and March 2009, USDA announced that it would purchase $50 million and $25 million, respectively, in pork products for federal food and nutrition assistance programs. Subsequent USDA pork product purchases followed later in 2009.", "Following the H1N1 outbreak, USDA predicted that prices would recover and did not alter its outlook for hog prices during the second half of 2009, based on expectations that market disruptions from trade restrictions and consumer concerns would be short-lived. In mid-June, Smithfield Foods Company reported that, although it remained concerned about restrictions on international markets, the company believed that H1N1 had had \"only a short-term effect on U.S. fresh pork demand,\" with \"no significant effect on the quarter\" based on the company's consolidated income statement. In August, representatives for Smithfield reiterated that quarterly returns would be favorable despite existing hog market conditions that are expected to persist until may 2010. USDA also predicted pork prices would remain low through 2009. Market forecasts for 2010 indicate that U.S. hog producers should fare better and might at least break even during the year, as market prices are expected to be near or close to production costs.", "U.S. pork exports for May and June 2009 were reportedly 31%-36% lower, respectively, compared to the same period for 2008, which also coincided with a time of record high U.S. pork exports. USMEF reported that, overall, \"April pork exports were not down as much as had been predicted,\" particularly given the continued economic downturn. Preliminary estimates indicate that, overall, total 2009 pork export volumes were roughly 12% below that for 2008, which was a record year for U.S. pork exports. Nevertheless, at an October 2009 House Agriculture Subcommittee hearing on the economic conditions facing the U.S. pork industry, both Administration and industry officials acknowledged the economic effects on the sector from reduced exports and trade restrictions because of concerns about the H1N1 flu virus. Exports in 2010 are expected to be much higher, although slightly below 2008 record levels.", "Overall, analysts predicted that 2009 H1N1 would have less of an impact on the pork industry than BSE had on the beef industry in 2003 or avian influenza on the poultry industry in 2005-2006. Analysts with World Perspectives, Inc., noted that although pork prices have declined, supplies are also lower than last year, and it was unclear whether pork sales had actually decreased following the outbreak. In other markets, analysts at the University of Illinois highlighted that \"grains have had quite a rally in prices, after the market's initial 'knee-jerk' reaction,\" although pork prices continued to be lower. Among meat packers, analysts predicted that the trade restrictions would have less of an effect on larger diversified companies, such as Cargill Inc. and JBS S.A., but could affect single-product firms such as National Beef Packing Company and companies already operating under financial distress, such as Pilgrims Pride."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Type of Assistance Did the U.S. Pork Industry Receive?", "paragraphs": ["The ongoing economic crisis in the U.S. hog sector, coupled with potentially negative effects of the H1N1 virus, remains a concern to the sector.
