The S-K Act created a fund (known as the S-K fund) that is financed by a permanent appropriation of a portion of import duties on marine products. S-K funds are distributed by the Secretary of Commerce as grants and cooperative agreements to address needs of the U.S. fishing industry, including but not limited to harvesting, processing, marketing, and associated infrastructure. However, Congress allocates most funding to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to fund agency activities related to marine fisheries research and management. Some have questioned whether the allocation of S-K funds reflects the original intent of the S-K Act and whether the S-K Grant Program addresses the needs and priorities of the fishing industry.", "Since its creation, the S-K fund's authorizing language and priorities have evolved with changes to the fishing industry, new or amended federal laws governing fisheries management, and changing federal agency responsibilities. In 1980, the American Fisheries Promotion Act (AFPA) amended the S-K Act to authorize a competitive grant program, known as the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program (S-K Grant Program) and the National Program to support fishing industry research and development projects. Both programs are administered by NMFS, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In the 1980s, the S-K Grant Program focused on fisheries development, but in subsequent years, as U.S. fisheries became fully or overexploited, priorities generally shifted to resource conservation and management. The S-K Grant Program has supported a variety of different projects, such as gear technology research, seafood marketing, aquaculture, and others.", "The S-K Grant Program is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous calendar year's customs receipts from imports of fish and fish products. These funds are transferred into NOAA's Promote and Develop American Fisheries Products and Research Pertaining to American Fisheries Fund (P&D account). Transfers of revenue into the P&D account have grown steadily from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million in 2020. Congress subsequently transfers most funds into the Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) account within NOAA. Congress has directed NMFS to use funds allocated to the ORF account for specific activities including stock assessments, fishing information networks, survey and monitoring projects, cooperative research, and interjurisdictional fisheries. The remaining funds are available for supporting the annual competitive S-K Grant Program and in some cases the National Program.", "Since the early 1980s, Congress has transferred most P&D account funds into the ORF discretionary account, sometimes leaving little or no funding for the specified purposes of the S-K Act. Some critics have questioned whether funds from the P&D account could be used more effectively by targeting fishing industry needs, as Congress originally intended. For example, in the 112 th , 113 th , and 114 th Congresses, bills were introduced that would have used most S-K funds to establish a regional fisheries grant program. By contrast, some have expressed concerns that if significant funding is shifted away from NMFS fisheries management programs, additional funds would need to be appropriated or activities such as data collection and fish population assessments could be compromised. These NMFS activities provide information and analyses used to manage and conserve fish populations.", "Some also have questioned whether the S-K Grant Program could be modified to provide the fishing industry with more direct input into the S-K grant process. Currently, NMFS, in consultation with the fishing industry, identifies S-K Grant Program priorities and selects the recipients of S-K grants. Over the last several Congresses, bills have been introduced that would change the procedure for screening, evaluating, and awarding S-K grants. In the 116 th Congress, the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act ( H.R. 1218 and S. 494 ) would establish an industry advisory committee to identify the needs of the fishing industry, develop requests for proposals, review grant applications, and select grant applications for approval. S. 494 was reported on August 16, 2019, by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; on September 18, 2019, H.R. 1218 was ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Act of 1954 (15 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7713c-3) established a fund (known as the S-K fund) to support U.S. fisheries development and research. Funding originates from a transfer by the Secretary of Agriculture into the Promote and Develop American Fisheries Products and Research Pertaining to American Fisheries Fund (P&D account). The P&D account is administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce. Transfers of revenue into the P&D account have grown steadily from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million in 2020.

Congress is continuing to consider whether current funding from the P&D account meets the needs of U.S. fisheries and the U.S. fishing industry. Some have questioned whether the U.S. commercial fishing industry receives sufficient opportunities to provide input into the S-K competitive grant process. Due in part to what they perceive as a lack of industry input, some critics assert that NMFS has not distributed funding in accordance with the primary purposes of the S-K Act, such as supporting projects related to the marketing of fish. Another concern is the allocation of funds, and specifically whether there is a need for more financial support of S-K competitive grants than for funding NMFS fisheries science and management activities in the ORF account. However, if funding were reallocated to provide greater support of the S-K Grant Program, Congress may need to consider implications of the likely decrease in funds that would be transferred to ORF from the P&D account to support NMFS fishery research and management activities.

Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, provided a permanent appropriation equal to 30% of gross receipts from all duties collected under customs laws. The act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use these funds to support exports and domestic consumption of agricultural commodities. The Act of August 11, 1939, authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer up to $1.5 million from funds collected under Section 32 to support the fishing industry. Funds were transferred to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation to purchase and distribute surplus fishery products and to the Secretary of the Interior to promote markets for fishery products of domestic origin. Table 1 provides a history of legislative changes to the S-K Act.", "In 1954, the S-K Act amended the Act of August 11, 1939, to provide additional funding from Section 32 funds to support the U.S. fishing industry. The S-K Act authorized the transfer from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior, from the larger Section 32 account's funding, an amount equal to 30% of gross receipts from duties collected on fishery products. These funds were maintained in a separate account for use by the Secretary of the Interior to support the flow of fishery products in commerce, develop and increase markets for fishery products, and conduct research. Annual expenditures from the fund were limited to $3 million, and the balance of the fund was not allowed to exceed $5 million at the end of any year. In 1956, the S-K Act was amended to remove the limit on annual expenditures from the fund. The S-K Act also authorized the Secretary of the Interior to appoint a fishing industry advisory committee to provide guidance on the formulation of policy, rules, and regulations pertaining to requests for assistance, and other matters. ", "In 1976, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCMA; P.L. 94-265 ) established a 200-nautical mile fishery conservation zone (FCZ) and brought marine fisheries within the FCZ under domestic control. Foreign fishing was allowed to continue in the FCZ, but the domestic fishing industry was granted priority fishing rights under the FCMA. In the following years, U.S. policy emphasized development of domestic fisheries and replacement of foreign fishing with domestic fishing in the FCZ. According to the Government Accountability Office, until 1979, NMFS used nearly all S-K funds to support fisheries management and development activities; it granted only small amounts to the fishing industry for development projects. In 1979, likely because of growing industry support of domestic fisheries development, NMFS made available approximately $5.3 million of S-K funds to regional fisheries development foundations, universities, private industry, and state and local governments.", "In 1980, Congress formally authorized the current competitive S-K Grant Program in Section 210 of the American Fisheries Promotion Act (AFPA; P.L. 96-561 ). The AFPA directed the Secretary of Commerce to use at least 50% of S-K funds for the S-K Grant Program and the balance of funds for a National Program. Both programs supported research and development efforts to address areas such as harvesting, processing, marketing, and related infrastructures. By 1980, the transfer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had grown to $26.7 million ( Table A-1 ). The AFPA also formally transferred responsibility for administering the fund from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Commerce. The House committee report accompanying the AFPA noted that the definition of fishery includes recreational fishing and that recreational projects would be eligible for grants. The AFPA also removed a section that established the S-K fishing industry advisory committee; the advisory committee had been previously terminated pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (P.L. 92-463). ", "In subsequent years, Congress made additional changes to the allocation and use of the S-K fund ( Table 1 ). The Highway Improvement Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-424 ) increased the share of funds used for the competitive grant program from 50% to 60%. In the following years, potential uses of the fund were broadened to include the Fisheries Promotion Fund ( P.L. 99-659 ), the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Fisheries Reinvestment Fund ( P.L. 102-567 ), and the federal share of a fishing capacity reduction program ( P.L. 104-297 ).

Transfers from USDA to NOAA's P&D account have steadily increased from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million in 2020 ( Figure 2 ). In CY2017, approximately 77% of revenues were from duties collected on imports of nonedible marine products, including jewelry, ink, various chemicals, and skins.

The amount of remaining funding for the S-K Grant Program has varied considerably from year to year, ranging from no funding in FY2011 and FY2012, when Congress did not leave any remaining funding for S-K program, to its highest level of $29.5 million in FY2009 ( Table 2 ). The S-K Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to use no less than 60% of funds for fisheries research and development grants pursuant to subsection (c). The Secretary also is required to use the remaining funds to finance NMFS activities directly related to U.S. fisheries development, as outlined in subsection (d). Since 1982, S-K grant funding has been less than 30% of total transfers from USDA, and it has been significantly lower in most years.
