The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the government to broaden the focus to include renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over the 41-year period from the Department of Energy's (DOE's) inception at the beginning of FY1978 through FY2018, federal funding for renewable energy R&D amounted to about 18% of the energy R&D total, compared with 6% for electric systems, 16% for energy efficiency, 24% for fossil, and 37% for nuclear.

Another energy-related factor was the application of research and development (R&D) to the atomic bomb (Manhattan Project) and other military technologies. During the post-World War II era, the federal government began to apply R&D to the peacetime development of energy sources to support economic growth. At that time, the primary R&D focus was on fossil fuels and new forms of energy derived from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.", "The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which inherited all of the Manhattan Project's R&D activities and placed nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management under civilian control. A major focus of the AEC was research on \"atoms for peace,\" the use of nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. Prompted by the oil embargo declared by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973, the Federal Energy Administration was established in mid-1974. In early 1975, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was established, incorporating the AEC and several energy programs that had been operating under the Department of the Interior and other federal agencies.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) was established by law in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. All of the energy R&D programs\u2014fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency\u2014were brought under its administration. DOE also undertook a small program in energy storage and electricity system R&D that supports the four main energy technology programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Energy Technology R&D Funding", "paragraphs": ["From FY1948 through FY1977, the majority of federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies. Total spending on fossil energy technologies over that period amounted to about $17.1 billion, in constant FY2016 dollars. The federal government spent about $51.6 billion (in constant FY2016 dollars) during that period for nuclear energy R&D (in all the tables and figures in this report, the \"nuclear\" category includes both fission and fusion). ", "The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the federal government to expand its R&D programs to include renewable (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydro) energy and energy efficiency technologies. Comparatively modest efforts to support renewable energy and energy efficiency began during the early 1970s. Since FY1978, DOE has been the main supplier of energy R&D funding compared to other federal agencies. ", "In real (constant dollar) terms, funding support for all four of the main energy technologies skyrocketed during the 1970s to a combined peak in FY1979 at about $8.6 billion (2016 constant dollars). Funding then dropped steadily, to about $2.0 billion (2016 dollars) per year during the late 1990s. Since then, funding has increased gradually\u2014except that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided a one-year spike of $13 billion (2016 dollars) in FY2009.
