One aspect of this issue is the ongoing process (known as ocean acidification) whereby seawater becomes less alkaline as more CO2 dissolves in it, causing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater to increase. Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration could reduce growth or even cause death of shell-forming animals (e.g., corals, mollusks, and certain planktonic organisms) as well as disrupt marine food webs and the reproductive physiology of certain species. While not yet fully understood, the ecological and economic consequences of ocean acidification could be substantial.", "Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater could alter biogeochemical cycles, disrupt physiological processes of marine organisms, and damage marine ecosystems.

As increasing CO 2 from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater, seawater chemistry is altered. The prevailing pH (a measure of hydrogen ion concentration) of water near the ocean surface is around 8.1, or slightly alkaline. Ocean acidification is the name given to the ongoing process whereby pH decreases as seawater becomes less alkaline when increasing amounts of anthropogenic CO 2 from the atmosphere dissolve in seawater. When atmospheric CO 2 dissolves into the ocean, it forms carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ). Some of the carbonic acid dissociates in ocean waters, producing hydrogen ions (H + ). As the number of hydrogen ions increases, the pH of the ocean decreases, and the water becomes less alkaline.", "Scientists are concerned that this change in seawater pH could alter biogeochemical cycles, disrupt physiological processes of marine organisms, and damage marine ecosystems.

It has been estimated that a total of more than 530 billion tons of CO 2 have been absorbed by the ocean between 1800 and 1994, with the average pH of water near the ocean surface decreasing by almost 0.1 pH unit. That decrease sounds small, but it represents a 26% increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions, because the pH scale is logarithmic (i.e., water with a pH of 6 is 10 times less acidic than water with a pH of 5, and 100 times less acidic than water with a pH of 4). Open ocean observational records of declining pH are available from the Hawaiian Ocean Time-Series Station in the Pacific and the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Station in the Atlantic. Up to a point, as atmospheric CO 2 continues to increase, ocean pH will continue to decrease; one estimate suggests that the rate of CO 2 uptake by the oceans could stabilize at around 5 billion metric tons per year by 2100. One prediction suggests that continued burning of fossil fuels and future uptake of CO 2 by the ocean could reduce ocean pH by 0.3-0.5 units.", "All gases, such as CO 2 , are less soluble in water as temperature increases. Thus, marine waters near the poles have a much greater capacity for dissolving CO 2 than do ocean waters in the tropics. In addition, dissolved CO 2 is transported into ocean depths at these high latitudes (i.e., deep water formation mechanism) since the lower-temperature waters are of higher density, causing greater convection to occur than happens in the more stratified tropical oceans. If temperature were the only factor affecting the rate of ocean acidification and its impacts on physical and biological features, these impacts might be more likely to occur in marine waters nearer the poles. However, in addition to temperature, other factors modulate the impact of CO 2 on marine waters. Cellular respiration and organic decomposition add CO 2 to seawater, and photosynthesis removes it. Deep oceanic water is enriched in CO 2 due to respiration in the absence of photosynthesis and, when brought to the surface by equatorial currents (i.e., upwelling), can place CO 2 -enriched seawater in contact with the atmosphere where it can absorb even more CO 2 . Hence, the tropics, and most notably tropical coral reefs, are also vulnerable to near-term effects. An additional factor is the potential increase in storm activity at higher latitudes, as some climate models suggest. CO 2 and other acidic gasses such as nitrogen dioxide are also dissolved in rainwater. An increase in North Atlantic or western North Pacific storms could significantly accelerate the pH decrease of surface ocean waters in these regions.", "Key scientific questions concern which factors may affect the future rate at which seawater pH might decrease, especially whether the rate of decrease will remain constant in direct relationship to the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere or whether other factors, such as rising ocean temperatures diminishing CO 2 absorption, will decelerate the rate that pH changes. There is also the question of equilibrium\u2014that is, how long might it take the process whereby the pH of warming ocean waters is decreasing to come into equilibrium with the concentration of atmospheric CO 2, should the currently increasing atmospheric emission rate of CO 2 eventually stabilize or diminish? An adjunct to this question is how long might it take the rate of ocean acidification to slow (or even reverse) in response to increasing water temperatures and any measures that might be taken to slow, halt, or even reverse the increasing concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere? Additional questions relate to how ocean circulation, which partially controls the CO 2 uptake rate, might change in response to changes in the overlying climate as a result of greenhouse gas emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Some of the Potential Effects of Ocean Acidification?", "paragraphs": ["Since the marine environment is complex and some of the likely changes may be years in the future, the potential effects identified in this section, although many are supported by laboratory experimentation, are primarily conjecture and/or forecasts.

In addition to the lower pH, another consequence of the increased amount of dissolved CO 2 in the ocean is the production of more bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 1- ). As more CO 2 dissolves into the ocean, bicarbonate ions form at the expense of carbonate ions (CO 3 2- ), which scientists often describe by the following reaction:", "CO 2 + CO 3 2- + H 2 O = 2HCO 3 1-", "The abundance and availability of carbonate ions are critical to many shell-forming marine organisms. At current average ocean pH levels (about 8 or above), ocean waters near the surface have ample carbonate ions to support shell formation and coral growth. However, as increased amounts of carbonic acid form in the ocean as a result of higher atmospheric CO 2 levels, pH decreases and the amount of carbonate ions in the oceans declines, resulting in fewer carbonate ions available for making shells.", "Organisms make biogenic calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons by combining calcium ions (Ca 2+ )\u2014which are abundant in the oceans\u2014with carbonate ions to form solid calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Certain marine organisms (e.g., corals and pteropods) precipitate one mineral type of calcium carbonate called aragonite, and other marine organisms (e.g., foraminifera and coccolithophorids) use another type called calcite. A third type of calcium carbonate\u2014high magnesium calcite\u2014is precipitated by echinoderms (sea urchins and starfish) and some coralline algae (an encrusting form of red algae that forms calcareous crusts like coral). Under present conditions of ocean chemistry, these forms of calcium carbonate are relatively stable in waters near the ocean surface, except for certain areas of high upwelling activity.", "Water near the ocean surface currently is supersaturated (i.e., more concentrated than normally possible and therefore not in equilibrium) with calcite, high magnesium calcite, and aragonite, meaning that organisms easily can form shells from all of these mineral types. However, as more carbonic acid is formed in water near the ocean surface from higher levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere, the level of saturation decreases. If the ocean waters become undersaturated, then shells made from all of these minerals would tend to dissolve. Shells made from high magnesium calcite would tend to dissolve first, at lower concentrations of carbonic acid (and thus at higher pH values) than would shells made from aragonite. Shells made from calcite would dissolve at higher concentrations of carbonic acid than those made from aragonite. Thus, organisms that incorporate high magnesium calcite (i.e., echinoderms and some coralline algae) are likely to be the \"first responders\" to ocean acidification.", "Ocean waters at depths of thousands of feet are undersaturated with respect to all forms of biogenic calcite, which is why most of the shells from dead organisms that \"rain\" down from the ocean surface dissolve before reaching the ocean floor. Because of the combined effects of increased CO 2 and calcium carbonate solubility in cold water, some suggest that marine surface waters closer to the poles may become undersaturated within the next 50 years. Researchers at the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre have demonstrated significant reductions in shell mass and thickness of several Southern Ocean marine algae and animals that appear consistent with the projected effects of recent decreases in seawater pH."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response of Marine Life to Changing Ocean Chemistry", "paragraphs": ["Although there has been a great deal of work growing organisms under different pHs, most species have biochemical mechanisms to regulate internal pH and are able, within limits, to grow skeletons even when the external medium is less alkaline. A lower pH environment may cause these organisms to expend more energy, but overall they may be able to adapt in complex and species-specific ways. Understanding how marine life might respond to less alkaline conditions is more complicated than the simple claims that all will dissolve, which may ignore the actual physiology of these organisms.

Differences of opinion exist on the relative effects of climate change as expressed in increased CO 2 when compared to increased ocean temperature. Opinion has been expressed that, in marine systems, increased temperature may have detrimental effects comparable to or larger than those seen from increased CO 2 concentration, for corals and for phytoplankton. Although calcification rates in massive Porites coral were reported to have declined over a 16-year study period by approximately 21% in two regions on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, these findings were consistent with other studies of the synergistic effect of elevated seawater temperatures and CO 2 concentrations on coral calcification. Concerns have also been expressed for coral reefs in the eastern tropical Pacific. While ocean acidification may not appear currently to be killing corals, decreasing seawater pH is slowing development of coral larvae into juvenile colonies.", "Some project that, in coral reef ecosystems, coral calcification will be reduced by 30% on average by the end of the century. Calcareous algae, another contributor to building the reef frame, will recruit, grow, and calcify under lower pH. However, the dissolution of reef carbonate by boring microflora could increase by 50% under less alkaline conditions by the end of the century. The decrease in coral and crustose coralline algae combined with the increase of carbonate dissolution under less alkaline conditions has the potential to jeopardize the maintenance and resilience of coral reefs and their services to human populations (in terms of food and economic resources). ", "Emerging evidence for the variability in coral response to acidification as well as response to past climate change suggest greater heterogeneity in the pace and degree of reef degradation. In addition, shallow-water coral reefs with long water residence times may be able to mask the effects of ocean acidification in some downstream habitats. In support of the ability of certain corals to survive decreasing pH, stony and soft corals have been grown successfully in open systems with water from a saltwater well at a pH between 7.5 and 7.8 since the 1970s. However, given the high level of adaptation in corals to facilitate calcification via complex processes, at least some corals may be sensitive to changes in pH because of adaptation to invariant pH, with evidence coming primarily from the discovery that periods of high CO 2 in the geological past were often also periods of low aragonite-coral abundances and diversity. Others have found that certain species of coral survive in the laboratory at a pH of 7.3 to 7.6 after their calcified structure dissolves by functioning similar to sea anemones, and retaining the ability to recalcify when pH is increased. However, in the natural marine environment, predation could be a significant factor in limiting the viability of such \"naked\" corals, and it is unlikely that such organisms could form reefs and attract the diverse community that constitutes a coral reef.

Regarding the latter, however, some have suggested that several larger coccolithophore species may be able to increase their calcification in response to anthropogenic CO 2 release. Investigating 40,000 years of deposition in sediment core samples, others find a marked pattern of decreasing calcification of coccolithophores with increasing CO 2 and decreasing bicarbonate.", "There is also the concern that decreasing seawater pH may dissolve marine calcium carbonate sediments with potential harm to species and communities residing in and on these sediments. Since many of these organisms provide food or modify habitat for other organisms, the well-being of these carbonate-dependent species will affect other species. Because of these interrelationships, the potential indirect effects of decreased seawater pH on other marine organisms is not well understood.", "While some have raised concerns that ocean acidification, by harming calcifying plankton species, could shift ecological balances so as to increase populations of some noncalcifying species, there appears to be no significant relationship between jellyfish abundance and lower pH conditions, and any role of pH in structuring zooplankton communities is believed to be tenuous.", "There are also concerns that decreasing seawater pH could alter the ability of some invertebrate organisms to conduct essential biochemical and physiological processes. For example, scientists have found that, when exposed to water of pH 7.7, roughly equivalent to pH levels predicted for the year 2100, sea urchin sperm swam much more slowly. Overall, fertilization fell by 25%, and in almost 26% of cases where the eggs were fertilized, they did not survive long enough to develop into larvae. While marine invertebrates in general, and their early developmental stages in particular, are believed to be more sensitive to environmental disturbance, available data to assess their vulnerability to ocean acidification is contradictory. ", "In a controlled study at pH values anticipated in 2100, calcification was reduced 28% in the pteropod Limacina helicina . These animals continued to grow and produce their shells even under high CO 2, but at a slower rate. Many species, including Pacific salmon, mackerel, herring, cod, and baleen whales, feed upon pteropods. Effects, if any, on the food web are unknown, since\u00a0pteropod growth is strongly influenced by food availability and temperature, among other things. It is possible that higher temperatures could compensate for growth depression by CO 2 .", "Coastal areas with upwelling of deeper waters may be at risk from detrimental effects of ocean acidification much more quickly. Concerns have been expressed for benthic calcareous organisms living in the nearshore shelf along the North American west coast. More specifically, scientists in one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios have projected that mussel and oyster calcification, and thus shell strength, could decrease significantly by the end of the 21 st century. Recently, oyster growers in the Pacific Northwest have experienced severe larval mortalities resulting in multi-year reproductive failures which may be related to changing ocean chemistry.

The fossil record indicates that marine organisms may be quite sensitive to ocean acidification\u2014about 55 million years ago, a large injection of CO 2 into the deep ocean, presumably resulting from a massive methane release, was followed by the extinction of some species of benthic foraminifera. In addition, the extensive loss of marine biodiversity in the Late Triassic, about 200 million years ago, appears to coincide with increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration.

The less alkaline the ocean becomes, the less CO 2 will be dissolved. In addition, the warmer the seawater becomes, the less CO 2 will dissolve. Speculative questions exist about what might occur should the oceans reach a ceiling (i.e., equilibrium) in their ability to take up CO 2 , and atmospheric CO 2 levels continue to increase. Even with increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 , scientists predict that the oceans are not likely to reach pH values of less than 7 (neutral). ", "Our ability to reduce ocean acidification through artificial means is unproven. Proposals have suggested the addition of chemicals to the ocean, such as (1) using iron compounds to stimulate planktonic algae growth, whereby the increased photosynthesis might capture/remove dissolved CO 2 ; (2) using limestone to neutralize (i.e., buffer) the lower-pH streams and rivers near where they enter oceans and close to sources of limestone, or adding limestone powder directly to the ocean where deeper, lower-pH water upwells; or (3) pumping the calcium bicarbonate byproduct from limestone scrubbers at natural gas power plants into the ocean. Other measures might include habitat restoration/creation, such as planting seagrass. Unless a massive global effort is mounted, these techniques will at best be effective only on a very local scale. In addition, manipulation of ocean chemistry has the potential to damage or otherwise alter the marine environment and ecosystems in unforeseen ways. Reducing CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere and/or removing CO 2 from the atmosphere (i.e., carbon sequestration) currently appear to be the only practical ways to minimize the risk of large-scale and long-term changes to the pH of marine waters. Because of the continuing increase in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere, and its resident time there, decreasing pH of ocean waters will likely continue for decades.
