SEP projects are managed by state energy offices, not by DOE. ", "The decoupling problem involves efforts to encourage utilities to promote customer use of energy efficiency measures. An issue in promoting efficient use of electricity is that the profitability of electric utilities depends in large part on how much power they sell. Utility profits also increase with greater capital investment, such as in power plants. These utilities therefore have limited motivation to implement conservation programs that would slow or even reverse the growth of electricity demand. A solution to this problem is a regulatory approach called decoupling, under which utilities that meet energy conservation targets receive payments (funded by ratepayers) that compensate the utility for lost sales. The approach therefore decouples growth in sales from profitability. Decoupling has been implemented in varying forms in some states, probably most notably in California.", "Retail rate design, of which decoupling is a part, has historically been under exclusive state or local authority. ARRA follows this precedent by offering incentives, instead of creating mandates, for the implementation of decoupling by the states. Specifically, \u00a7410 of Division A authorizes DOE to make about $3.05 billion of energy efficiency and renewable energy funds available to states in excess of normal allocation methods if a state meets certain criteria. One criterion is that the governor of a state certifies in writing that the \"applicable state regulatory authority will seek to implement \" decoupling rules [emphasis added]; note that this is a guarantee of best efforts, not a guarantee that decoupling will be adopted. In contrast, to qualify for the additional funds the governor must, in addition to pursuing decoupling, also provide assurances that the state or its local governments \"will implement\" new, energy efficient building codes. In the case of the building code criteria best efforts is not enough; the regulatory change must actually be made by the state.", "The funds available for allocation to the states that meet these criteria (decoupling and building codes) are about $3.05 billion of the total of $3.1 billion, compared to the allocation of $1 million per state which, as cited by \u00a7410 of ARRA, is specified in section 365(f) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ( P.L. 94-163 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advanced Battery Manufacturing Grants18", "paragraphs": ["ARRA establishes a new program of $2.0 billion for facility funding grants to manufacturers of advanced battery and battery system components.
