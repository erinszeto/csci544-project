At issue for Congress is the extent to which the private sector has used these financial tools\u2014and whether they are the right tools\u2014to develop the technology needed for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil fuel power plants while continuing to use available domestic coal reserves for electricity generation. ", "Coal represents a major energy resource for the United States. Coal-fired power plants provided approximately 37% of U.S. generated electricity (about 1.5 billion megawatt-hours) in 2012, while consuming over 800 million tons of coal. Power plants that use coal are also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Coal-fired electricity generation emitted approximately 1.5 billion metric tons of CO 2 in 2012, approximately 28% of total U.S. CO 2 emissions. ", "The fraction of U.S. electricity generated by coal-fired plants declined from 2008 to 2012, as did the total coal consumption by coal-fired plants. Carbon dioxide emissions fell over the same period. The use of coal for electricity generation complicates policy efforts to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Congress has focused on two EPA regulatory proposals released in 2013 and 2014 that would limit greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants, respectively. Some believe the EPA efforts to regulate CO 2 emissions from coal may affect both the short- and long-term future for coal-fired electricity generation in the United States. In the past, others have linked the viability of the U.S. coal-fired electricity industry to its ability to capture and sequester CO 2 emissions from coal-burning plants (carbon capture and sequestration, or storage, referred to as CCS), and allowing the continued use of coal while mitigating its contribution to rising CO 2 levels in the atmosphere. ", "Mitigating CO 2 emissions has become the primary focus of U.S. Department of Energy efforts within the clean coal research and development program (now Coal R&D) within its Office of Fossil Energy. For example, the Coal R&D program accounted for $392 million of the total $562 million within Fossil Energy R&D at DOE in FY2014, or approximately two-thirds of the total. Moreover, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided $3.4 billion for CCS R&D efforts beginning in 2009. Combined with Recovery Act funding, Congress has appropriated approximately $6 billion for CCS R&D since 2008 at DOE. The appropriations, technology, and program activities are discussed in other CRS reports.", "For the purposes of this report, the term clean coal is used to describe activities supported by DOE that would reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions from coal combustion, such as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). DOE notes that its clean coal R&D efforts are focused on developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies for existing facilities and new fossil-fueled power plants by increasing overall system efficiencies and reducing capital costs. The term clean coal is used here for descriptive purposes only."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Guarantees", "paragraphs": ["Historically, loan guarantees have been used as a policy tool for many different purposes, including home ownership, university education, small business growth, international development, and others.

This estimated cost reflects what the government expects to pay and be paid over the course of the loan: payments by the government to cover defaults and delinquencies, interest subsidies, and other requirements; and payments to the government, including origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries. Without a specific appropriation, Section 1703 applicants are responsible for paying their own credit subsidy costs. For Section 1703 loan guarantees, Congress has not appropriated funds for credit subsidy costs, with one exception. ", "In addition to the credit subsidy costs, Section 1703 projects would need to cover certain administrative costs: an application fee, which covers the costs associated with DOE's financial and technical reviews of proposed projects; a facility fee, which covers DOE's administrative expenses of due diligence, negotiation, and documentation; and a maintenance fee, which covers DOE's expenses in servicing and monitoring the loan guarantee agreement over the life of the loan. ", "Also, EPACT05 stipulated that the face value of the debt guaranteed by DOE is limited to no more than 80% of the total project costs of the facility subject to the guarantee, as estimated by DOE, at the time the loan guarantee was issued. However, for purposes of calculating the loan guarantee credit subsidy costs, discussed above, the loan guarantee commitment is the full principal amount of the loan, not just the portion guaranteed by the federal government.

Yet, only two Section 1703 projects, both nuclear power-related, have received or are on the path to obtaining loan guarantees since enactment of EPACT05 nearly 10 years ago.", "It could be argued that a major distinction that encouraged projects under Section 1705\u2014renewable energy systems, electric power transmission systems, leading edge biofuel projects\u2014was the decision by Congress to provide appropriated funds to pay for some or all of the loan guarantee credit subsidy costs. DOE has not sought appropriations for Section 1703 projects although, notably, DOE deemed zero credit subsidy costs for both nuclear power related projects that are on track for the loan guarantees. Thus, a common characteristic among all projects that received loan guarantees or are on track to receive loan guarantees is the removal of any requirement by the loan guarantee recipient to self-pay the credit subsidy costs, either through congressional appropriations or within the current regulatory framework (or through higher interest rates on the loan).", "It is difficult to gauge the interest by industry in seeking guaranteed loans under Section 1703 without knowing how many applications for clean coal projects were submitted in response to the solicitations. Similarly, it is difficult to determine whether projects were not awarded loan guarantees because they failed to meet criteria required under the program, or were disqualified for some other reason. ", "An additional challenge for these projects is the requirement to employ new technology while at the same time achieving commercial viability. In addition, the EPA proposals to regulate CO 2 from new and existing coal-fired power plants have arguably introduced more uncertainty into the future of coal. Whether the 2013 and 2014 EPA proposals will create demand for loan guarantees, or have the opposite effect, is not clear.

One option is to maintain the status quo, which would essentially allow existing tax incentives to phase out. Since existing tax incentives have limited funds or are volume capped, these incentives will not be available for new investments or CO 2 sequestration once available funds have been fully allocated. ", "A second option is for Congress to authorize additional funding for investment tax credits under Sections 48A and 48B. However, several projects that were allocated credits under Sections 48A or 48B have been cancelled, and given the lack of new or proposed projects, it is not clear that additional funds for Sections 48A or 48B could be allocated in the near term. Given these developments, a question for Congress is whether there is an appetite for these investment credits. Further, are the tax credits considered an effective tool to further develop eligible technologies for clean coal?", "Some technical changes also have been cited as potential improvements to existing tax benefits. Modifications to the Section 45Q credit have been proposed in the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Deployment Act of 2014 ( S. 2287 ). Specifically, S. 2287 would change the current structure of Section 45Q. Credits would be allocated to applicants, so that applicants could be assured tax credits would be available before CO 2 is actually captured, with the goal of providing greater certainty to the industry. S. 2287 would also allow credits to be transferred, at the discretion of the tax credit recipient that captured the CO 2 , to the company storing the CO 2 . Both of these proposals were included in a 2012 recommendation by the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative. Regarding Sections 48A and 48B investment credits, there are unresolved issues related to reallocations for forfeited credits and recertification for projects that have not met placed-in-service deadlines. These issues may be addressed through Treasury guidance.", "Other changes in energy tax policy could also affect the outlook for clean coal and CCS technologies. For example, a tax on carbon emissions or regulations that otherwise increase the cost of carbon-intensive electricity production would make low-carbon coal options more competitive. Electricity produced at facilities equipped with CCS could also benefit from clean energy production and investment credits, such as those proposed by former Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus.", "Also at issue is whether tax incentives should be used to promote investment in clean coal, carbon capture and sequestration, or related technologies. Generally, an efficient tax system is one that is free from incentives, where markets dictate where investments are made. There are, however, a number of exceptions to this general case. Tax incentives that result in investments that reduce pollution or emissions, for example, can improve the allocation of resources in the economy. Tax incentives that lead to investment in emerging technologies with spillover benefits can also improve the economy-wide allocation of resources. There are concerns regarding the structure of the clean coal tax credits, particularly the investment tax credits, where recipients are selected for and credit amounts carved out for specified technologies. Another drawback to nearly any form of tax credits is the limited benefit provided to firms that do not pay taxes. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
