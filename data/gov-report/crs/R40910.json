Adaptation to climate change: Many countries, including the United States, wish to use bilateral and existing international institutions, with incremental financial assistance, targeted at the most vulnerable populations; many developing countries seek a fully financed, systemic, and country-determined effort to avoid damages of climate change, to which they have contributed little. Financial assistance to developing countries: Many wealthy countries, including the United States, propose private sector mechanisms, such as GHG trading, along with investment-friendly economies, as the main sources of financing, with a minor share from public funds; many developing countries argue for predictable flows of unconditioned public monies, with direct access to an international fund under the authority of the Conference of the Parties.

As the Copenhagen meeting opened, the United States had formally offered neither a GHG target nor specific amounts of financial assistance, although on the eve of the conference, the White House announced that President Obama intends to offer a \"provisional\" GHG target for the United States of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, ultimately to be brought \"in line\" with energy and climate legislation, if passed. China also announced a voluntary, domestic goal of reducing its carbon intensity (carbon dioxide emissions per unit of economic output) by 40%-45% below 2005 levels by 2020, which could hold emissions approximately to current levels. India followed suit with a domestic goal to reduce its emissions intensity by 20-25% below 2005 levels by 2020. Some stakeholders consider that neither the U.S. target nor the Chinese and Indian approach is sufficiently aggressive.

The first \"commitment period\" for meeting GHG emission targets runs from 2008 to 2012. It had been envisioned that GHG commitments for one or more subsequent periods would be made before 2008. But commitments beyond 2012 have been delayed, in part because the United States is neither a Party to the Kyoto Protocol nor has shown interest in engaging in future commitments under it, in part because of difficulty in gaining a mandate for negotiations among all UNFCCC Parties.

The Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period runs from 2008 to 2012, during which wealthier (\"Annex I\") countries agreed to reduce their GHG emissions to an average of 5% below 1990 levels. In 2007, Kyoto Protocol Parties (not the United States) began negotiating under the Kyoto Protocol on what commitments would ensue beyond 2012. This is the \"Kyoto Protocol\" track.", "However, because neither the United States nor developing (non-Annex I) countries are bound to measurable GHG reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, another negotiating mandate was established to include the United States and to address several broader commitment issues. Under the 2007 \"Bali Action Plan,\" all countries seek to reach agreement in Copenhagen on (1) a \"shared long-term vision\" (aggregate GHG targets for 2050); (2) GHG mitigation (GHG targets for each major Party for 2020 or earlier); (3) adaptation to climate change; (4) financial assistance; (5) technology cooperation; and (6) enhancing carbon sequestration in forests. This became the \"Long-Term Cooperative Agreement\" track. Each issue is described in later sections. One current dispute is whether the two negotiating tracks should result in two accords or converge into a single treaty.", "The European Union (EU) and other Annex I countries do not want to amend the Kyoto Protocol without including U.S. commitments, though the United States is unlikely to agree to join the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol Parties also do not wish to abandon their agreement and the progress they made in establishing implementing rules and procedures (e.g., reporting requirements and compliance reviews) under the Protocol. Nonetheless, the Annex I countries have all urged that these two tracks converge by Copenhagen into one agreement that includes commitments of all Parties.", "Most non-Annex I Parties believe certain advantages exist in maintaining the Kyoto Protocol and a separate agreement for them. They argue that the Kyoto Protocol is for quantified, enforceable GHG obligations for developed countries only. The G-77 and China have so far blocked even discussion of accession of current non-Annex I Parties to quantified GHG commitments under the Kyoto Protocol track. They maintain that non-Annex I commitments should be of a different form and legal nature, embodied in the Bali Action Plan track, and resist any disaggregation of non-Annex I Parties. They perceive any proposal to disaggregate \"developing\" countries into smaller sub-groupings, based on magnitude of emissions or financial capacity, as an effort to pull additional countries onto a track of quantifiable GHG commitments. Despite the stating of voluntary domestic emissions targets in some countries, the G-77 and China have, thus far, successfully blocked any formal discussion of how this could happen; some delegations walked out of the Bangkok negotiations in October 2009 after a proposal was articulated to merge the negotiations onto one track.", "In the UNFCCC, all Parties agreed to \"common but differentiated\" responsibilities, with differentiation based on a number of implied factors, including financial and technical capacity, and historical responsibility for climate change. The differentiation has been made primarily, though not exclusively, between Annex I (wealthier) and non-Annex I (less wealthy) countries, with quantified GHG reductions so far spelled out only for the Annex I Parties. The UNFCCC also spelled out that commitments from non-Annex I Parties would depend on leadership from the wealthiest (\"Annex II\") Parties to meet GHG and financial commitments. Circumstances have evolved since the UNFCCC was signed in 1992, especially with the growth of China and other large emerging economies. Recognition has crystallized that the objective to halt growth of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere requires slowing then reversing growth of GHG emissions by all major countries. Despite these facts, most countries argue that the Annex I countries have not fully met their UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol obligations to reduce GHG emissions and assist developing countries (with the United States especially criticized). Although non-Annex I Parties now discharge most of current GHG emissions, the Annex I Parties continue to be responsible for the majority of the increase since the Industrial Revolution of atmospheric GHG concentrations linked to climate change. Thus, most countries argue, the wealthiest countries continue to have the greatest historic responsibility to cut GHG emissions.", "As the Copenhagen meeting opens, it remains unclear whether the fundamental obstacle of the number and form of agreement(s) can be surmounted.

Others consider the 350 ppm target to be politically, and possibly economically, infeasible.", "The EU further proposes that Annex I countries should cut their GHG emissions by 80%-95% by 2050 to meet the 450 ppm vision, and that global emissions drop by 50% from 1990 levels. President Obama's policy is that the United States should reduce its emissions by 80%-83% from 2005 levels by 2050 and support the 50% global emission reduction. These have not been offered as legally binding commitments in the Copenhagen negotiations, however. In the recent Barcelona negotiations, the U.S. delegation called on China to halve its GHG emissions by 2050, which would allow modest growth for poorer countries. China, among others, has blocked an explicit long-term and global target, although it recently pledged a voluntary, domestic target.

Many non-Annex I countries complain that much financing is managed bilaterally or through the Multilateral Development Banks, particularly the World Bank, which some believe are not as responsive to the priorities of the recipient countries. These critics prefer financing to be managed by institutions created under the UNFCCC, in which they have \"one-country, one-vote,\" or at least equal regional representation as the industrialized nations. Also, while Annex I Parties generally prefer and promote means for the private sector to finance mitigation and adaptation investment, many non-Annex I countries prefer more \"predictable\" public sector flows.", "The four proposals in the current negotiating text contain the main alternatives for mechanisms for publicly provided financing: one or more funds managed by one or more Trustees of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP); a new fund under the authority and guidance of the COP but managed by an existing international institution; a new fund under the authority and guidance of the COP but managed by the existing financial mechanism of the UNFCCC (i.e., the GEF); and the use of existing financial institutions (i.e., no new mechanisms). On December 7, 2009, U.S. officials indicated that they would support a new fund, likely to operate under the World Bank, because of its existing expertise, operating standards, and internal oversight of financial operations. The fund would have its own governance structure, however. The fund would receive public financing and leverage private and other public sector investments in energy efficiency, regulate electricity, improve institutional capacity, and adaptation to climate change, and an array of other possible projects.

The bill also would provide funds internationally to help tropical deforestation prevention, capacity building, clean technology cooperation, and international adaptation. A parallel bill, S. 1733 and the Chair's Mark, contains similar provisions. Some Members of Congress and advocates have sought to increase allocation of allowances and/or appropriations, to $2 billion to $38 billion for international adaptation as well. A new U.S. coalition of religious organizations has called for at least $3.5 billion per year to help poor populations respond to potential floods, natural disasters and droughts associated with warming temperatures.", "The United States participates in the financing deliberations with impaired credibility, being almost $170 million in arrears for its assessed contribution to the Global Environment Facility (the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC and other treaties). The Bush Administration helped establish a new Clean Technology Fund under the World Bank, but the U.S. Congress declined to appropriate the first payment of $400 million requested for FY2009. Treasury requested $500 million for FY2010. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ) permitted up to $10 million for the Least Developed Countries Fund, under the UNFCCC, to support grants for climate change adaptation programs.

The United States and the EU agree that some public financing for technology is needed but that the private sector is better able to achieve the necessary advances and deployment. Many non-Annex I countries consider private investment too unreliable and not necessarily in their developmental interests. They want most funding to be public and managed by a new organization directed by the UNFCCC.", "After years of stalled talks regarding technology cooperation, Bangkok saw discussions open up on a wide range of issues including enhanced action on technology, capacity building and enabling environments; greater cooperation on research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D); technology innovation centers and other institutional arrangements; and financing. Divisions remain among Parties. Annex I Parties call for enhanced action among all Parties to implement the Convention's provisions. The European Union resists creation of any new institutions, calling for reliance on existing financial organizations. The United States proposes a new voluntary fund to which all Parties but the least developed would contribute, and from which all could draw. The G-77 countries and China propose creation of new institutional arrangements, funded by the wealthiest Parties for any of the non-Annex I Parties to use. Some convergence may be evolving around uses for RDD&D, capacity building, policy frameworks and enabling environments. Three components articulated as critical by some Parties are accelerated global openness to environmentally sound technologies; increased access to technology information and know-how; and high-quality technology roadmaps for low-carbon economic growth.", "In October 2009, the U.S. delegation proposed a \"hub and spokes\" framework (now \"hub and corps\") as a new mechanism to support technology cooperation. It would rely on regional centers of excellence, linked through a professional Climate Technology Corps, to a Climate Technology Hub. The U.S. delegation indicates this would increase availability, capacity, and information exchange related to technology. The Hub would be staffed by full-time clean technology experts who would develop and maintain critical analytic tools. The Corps would consist of modeling, policy, finance, system design, and workforce training experts drawn from national development agencies, Multilateral Development Banks, and academia, to assist country-driven programs. The proposal seemed to straddle the competing ambitions of various Parties by directly responding to the stated interest for new institutions while offering a possible way forward in negotiations.", "One remaining challenge is the handling of intellectual property rights (IPR).
