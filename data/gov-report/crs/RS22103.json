Establishing a new VXX program would provide an opportunity to review operational requirements for presidential helicopters, eliminating excessive requirements, and permit the use of competition between industry teams to identify the most cost-effective solution.

Continuing the VH-71 program and procuring Increment II aircraft is the option that offers the lowest technical and schedule risk for procuring new helicopters that fully meet the operational requirements in the VH-71 ORD. A new VXX program could cost as much, if not more, than continuing the VH-71 program, and new VXX helicopters would enter service later than Increment II (or additional Increment I) helicopters, requiring the 19 existing presidential helicopters, which do not meet requirements for future presidential helicopters, to be kept in service longer. The ability of the 19 existing presidential helicopters to accept future upgrades is not certain, since some of those upgrades are not yet fully defined, and there may be unknown technical risks associated with attempting to extend their service lives until they would be replaced by VXX aircraft. A past history of successful upgrades and service life extensions does not guarantee that additional upgrades and service life extensions would be feasible or cost effective. A review of operational requirements for presidential helicopters is unlikely to lead to major changes from operational requirements in the VH-71 ORD, meaning that a new VXX helicopter would be very similar to a VH-71, except that its IOC and FOC could occur years later. Increment I helicopters could be certified for substantial service lives if funding is provided for the necessary testing and certification, and while Increment I helicopters would not fully meet operational requirements in the VH-71 ORD, they could meet enough of them to represent a cost-effective compromise between desired performance and affordable procurement.

The Navy invested over $3.2 billion dollars, received nine test and pilot-production aircraft, yet was unable to successfully execute this program that ultimately was cancelled by Secretary Gates. I would like to understand what the plan is for the current aircraft assets that have already been delivered, what the plan is going forward, and how the mistakes of the original program will be prevented from happening in the next program?", "Question-and-Answer Portion", "During the question-and-answer portion of the hearing, the following exchanges took place regarding the VH-71 program:", "COURTNEY: ", "In Mr. Taylor's opening statement, he sort of walked through a number of issues that he was asking for some responses from the witnesses. I think the last item was on the presidential helicopter. You've referenced the fact, obviously, that Secretary Gates, on Friday, announced the cancellation of the program. And I was just following on his comments. I don't know which witness would be appropriate to respond. But what do you sort of see as the next steps in the way forward? Obviously, we need a new helicopter. ", "TRAUTMAN (?):", "Congressman Courtney, let me start and I'll turn it over to anyone else. You're correct. Secretary Gates did announce\u2014recommend cancellation. And his basis to that was the original $6 billion program which was headed towards $13 billion, six years overdue; does not meet the requirements of the White House. And (inaudible) in fact was the long way to meet that requirement. So this has been an extremely challenging requirement in this program, complicated and exacerbated by us trying to bring this program to meet a need earlier, when we hadn't really defined what we needed to do. There were mistakes that were made. We drove significant developmental efforts forward at time when we weren't certain what those impacts would be. And we grossly underestimated the cost and schedule required to deliver this. ", "As a result of that, Undersecretary Defense Carter directed the cancellation of the program to Mr. Stackley (ph). We are taking those initiatives now to cancel that program, and bring it to a resolution. the path forward is within 30 days, we will come forward with a high level plan of what we will\u2014how will we anticipate going forward in the future. That's not all the details that go with every facet of the program to understand, but it is a high level, if you will, plan of action, how we're going to go forward to meet the direction; also to have a program developed so we can do the presidential replacement helicopter program. ", "So in this case, I believe, what we need to do now is we need to meet the requirements. We need to understand what those requirements are going to be. Understand the impacts of those requirements. Begin with requirements, take them through to the impacts of that, and do the due rigor we needed to do\u2014we need to do an executable program, sir. And I'll turn it over for other comments. ", "ARCHITZEL:", "Well, then let add then, sir. Two things come to my mind. First is: Are the legacy VH-3s and VH-60s preserved and remain safe for carrying our president? And the answer to that is \"yes.\" And this budget includes requested dollars to make that a reality. The second is: These airplanes are going to need to be replaced. The VH-3 is 40 years old by 2017 even with the service life extension programs that we are assessing now. They are near the end of their life. I am very anxious to get back into the requirements generation process. Work with the White House military office to decide what requirements they will lay out, and then help move those requirements to the joint requirements oversight council into the acquisition community so that we can each start on a new replacement for the VH-3 and the VH-60. ", "COURTNEY: ", "I realize you said 30 days from now, you'll come out with a new position or a new plan. And I don't want to get ahead of that. But one argument that's been out there\u2014\"The New York Times\" had a column about it the other day\u2014about\u2014that we shouldn't cancel because there's so much sunk cost already into the VH-71. I guess\u2014I was wondering\u2014I was thinking that through. The Navy is not going to just sort of walk away from the research and the development and the investment that's already taken place. I mean, there's some ways to recoup some of what's already been paid for. I mean, is that a safe assumption to make so that the taxpayers won't feel like it was just completely thrown away? ", "TRAUTMAN (?): ", "Congressman Courtney, if I could, let me begin\u2014I know you want my colleagues to comment. But, first off, what I mentioned to you was a high level comeback, if you will, or a plan to go forward. But we have to\u2014simultaneous with that, we have another course of action we have to follow. Following the cancellation program, we have to bring about what we do with this program, and how we bring it to closure. So the first thing that was done was this, for example, this stop work due, which allows us to\u2014the contracting officer to issue actions, that then would result in us being able to\u2014as I said, bring the thing to closure. ", "That involves understanding all that we have invested, and where we are, and be able to close out the books; be able to make sure we understand where we are in funding, be it '09 or '10 funding, et cetera, and what we need to do to follow through that once the contracting officer takes actions on the termination. So understanding what we want to do in the future, obviously, we will take advantage of anything we can from a technology standpoint that would go into future helicopter programs or other programs of similar nature. ", "Again, as we start back in this program, we have to understand the requirements\u2014that to begin with requirements\u2014understand what they mean and what we have to meet those missions that are set in front of us. That was fundamental to it. Now, to your point: The investments that were made\u2014understanding the technology investments that were ongoing\u2014certainly, we'll take advantage of that going forward. ", "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ", "TAYLOR: ", "Chair thanks the gentleman. ", "Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Bartlett. ", "BARTLETT:", "Thank you very much. You know, you would think from the discussion we've been having that we hadn't spent $3.2 billion and a number of years building the 71. And the original requirements document for the VH-71 program, the Navy gave a litany of reasons why the legacy fleet was in urgent need of replacement\u2014so urgent that we were working around some of the usual procedures to get a plane more quickly so the president could have it. ", "They\u2014the planes, Navy said, was overweight. They lack all weather capability. They have extremely limited range, speed and payload. And I quote from the document, \"The legacy aircraft is no longer capable of implementing upgrades for mission requirements.\" ", "And now, we're told that the current fleet is OK. It can, indeed, be upgraded and the cost of doing so will likely\u2014might be enormous. We already spent $3.2 billion to produce the nine increment one helicopters. They neither exceed their performance requirement. They're always intended to fly the president. Why isn't it reasonable that Congress would expect the Navy to field these aircraft to meet the highly urgent need we have been briefed on for years? ", "But instead, congressmen are given a list of reasons why flying the 35-year-old legacy fleet for another decade is preferable to fielding a modern V8-71 [sic: VH-71] helicopters we have already paid to produce. ", "For instance, we're told that increment one only has a five year service life, even though the committee knows that it was designed for a minimum of 30 years that the Navy has not even performed a basic airframe fatigue testing to make a sound determination. We need real answers as we consider the budget request. ", "Frankly, Congress has been ignored for too long on this critical program. And I'm concerned that in the stop-work order, we're now being ignored. ", "The Navy said that we needed a new aircraft to fly the president. We bought that. We asked the Navy to build that aircraft and now, without coming back to Congress for consultation, the Navy has issued a stop work order. ", "This very limits our options because there will be costs involved with a stop work order. If we decide that we really ought to continue building these planes then there's additional cost involved in making the line hot again. ", "First, what is the estimated cost of extending and maintaining the current legacy fleet, if the VH-71 is terminated? How much will it cost to provide service life extension for the current fleet? What kind of new improvements will be made and at what cost? ", "We were previously told that we really couldn't make the necessary improvements, which is why we needed a plane so urgently that we were bypassing some of the usual procurement procedures. ", "And second, are you telling this committee the Increment 1 helicopters did not in fact provide a better overall capability than the current VH-3? General Trautman, you have flown the VH-71, would you not agree that on its own it represents a more capable, modern and safer aircraft? ", "TRAUTMAN: ", "Yes, sir, let me start\u2014I've flown the VH-3 and the VH-71 Increment 1 aircraft recently and there's no doubt that the VH- 71 increment three\u2014Increment 1 aircraft is a better aircraft then the VH-3. ", "The challenge has been, sir, that the VH-71 Increment 1 aircraft does not meet the requirements that were passed to us by the White House military office and the requirements... ", "BARTLETT: ", "General,... ", "(CROSSTALK) ", "BARTLETT: ", "...if you would let me comment for just a moment... ", "TRAUTMAN: ", "Yes, sir. ", "BARTLETT: ", "...we know that. We know that the Increment 1 was designed to provide what we were told was essential transportation for the president, while Increment 2 was being developed. ", "We know that Increment 1 is deficient in\u2014a little deficient in payload capability, in speed and in how far it can go, in range, but the essential reason we were told for moving away from the current fleet was to have better communication capabilities we understand the VH-71 provides, the Increment 1. ", "If the gentleman's got just a moment, I'd like to go through some numbers that I think are absolutely compelling that we ought to continue. ", "We've now invested $3.2 billion. If we now shut down, it's going to cost about half a billion in the industry to shut down. It's going to cost about a tenth of a billion in the Navy to shut down and for another $1.3 billion, we could make ready five of the nine planes so that the president could use them. ", "And I am told by the manufacturer that for roughly $100 million each, which comes well under the original figure of $6.8 billion, that they will enter into a firm, fixed price contract to deliver another 14, which would mean we would have a total fleet then of 19 planes. ", "You\u2014the additional cost to provide nineteen planes is small compared to the investment we've already made. Why isn't it in the taxpayers' and the president's best interest to go ahead and provide these extra planes? We'll have essentially nothing if we simply terminate and shut down. ", "TAYLOR: ", "If the General would answer the question, please. ", "TRAUTMAN: ", "Congressman Bartlett, if I could, the\u2014part of what your discussion is on the Increment 1. As I mentioned before, this VH-71 is an extremely challenging requirement. There are significant developmental efforts that were grossly underestimated. On top of that, we went to a two increment approach in an effort to deliver near-term as well as long-term solutions. ", "Sir, we are not delivering on the capability with Increment 1. The program does not meet the requirements, and that was what the recommendation for cancellation was for. ", "BARTLETT: ", "But, sir, if I might interrupt for just a moment. It was going to be sufficiently superior to the present fleet, that it was deemed desirable to spend the money to produce it and use it for five years while we produced Increment 2. Why isn't that analysis still valid? ", "TRAUTMAN: ", "Sir, the second estimate\u2014you're referring to numbers. In terms of operational use and, quite frankly, the VH-71 Increment 1, the additional weight was the\u2014that has to do with the aircraft itself would be a different aircraft than the one you're talking to, when you're talking 30 years aircraft life. ", "That's another factor in the Increment 1, in terms of its not being able to make more than approximately, estimates now, 1,500 hour life. But the overarching consideration was not making the requirements needed for the helicopter and the decision to cancel Increment 1 and 2 from Secretary Gates, sir. ", "BARTLETT: ", "Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I think that the original five year life was not what the plane was expected could do. It was just that, well, they only needed it for five years until they had Increment 2, but nobody doubts that this plane is built as well as other helicopters and it should have the usual 30, 35, 40 year life, should it not? ", "TRAUTMAN: ", "Our understanding is that systems command would have to inspect the airplane and go through a rigorous service life extension program seeking hot spots and areas of interest, similar to the discussion we had previously [at this hearing] about the F/A-18A through D [strike fighters]. That work has not been done yet."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
