However, there is currently little evidence that adoption tax benefits are an effective policy tool to increase adoptions. Instead, data suggest that adoption tax benefits are often a windfall to families that would have adopted in their absence. In addition, the vast majority of adoption tax benefits go to upper-income Americans, even though data indicate that a significant number of lower- and middle-income Americans adopt. Finally, recent evidence suggests that adoption tax benefits have been difficult for the IRS to administer in terms of keeping both erroneous benefit claims and taxpayer burden low.", "In light of these concerns with current adoption tax benefits, Congress may consider modifying the credit or the exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance to achieve certain policy goals. For example, Congress may move to replace these benefits with a direct spending program, especially if Congress views direct spending as more effective at encouraging adoptions. Alternatively, Congress could eliminate adoption tax benefits and direct any additional revenue to deficit reduction. Congress could also choose to make the adoption tax credit refundable, so that taxpayers with little or no tax liability could claim the entire value of the credit in a given year. Or Congress could modify adoption tax benefits in other ways, such as changing the maximum amount of the credit or the income level at which the credit phases out.

Nonr efundability /Carryforward : The taxpayer's tax liability is smaller than the amount of the credit the taxpayer can claim in a given year. Since the credit is nonrefundable, the amount of the credit actually claimed in a given year by definition cannot be greater than taxes owed. Hence, in cases where the calculated credit is greater than the taxpayer's tax liability, the actual credit he or she will be able to claim will be equal to their tax liability. For the purposes of the adoption tax credit, the value of the credit in excess of tax liability can be \"carried forward\" and claimed on future tax returns.", "Theoretically, both limitations may apply to the same taxpayer.

Relatively few taxpayers with AGIs of more than $200,000 claimed the credit as a result of the credit phase out.

", "The trends in adoption tax credit claims and the average credit amount per taxpayer illustrated in Figure 2 may have occurred for a variety of reasons. For example, these trends may be partly explained by legislative changes made to the credit. Some of the increase in claimants (and the average amount of the credit) between 2002 and 2009 in comparison to the period between 1997 and 2001 may be the result of legislative expansions of the credit. Under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16 ), the maximum amount of the credit was effectively doubled and the income level at which the credit phased out was also increased. The expanded phaseout range may have resulted in a larger average credit as well as more upper-income taxpayers being able to claim the credit. ", "Some trends\u2014like the decline in the number of claims of the credit between 2006 and 2009\u2014may also be explained by the decline in adoptions, especially of foreign children. Some data suggest that families that adopt foreign children are more likely to claim the adoption tax credit\u2014and claim more dollars of the credit\u2014than families that pursue other types of adoption, especially domestic public adoptions. Hence, the steep decline in foreign adoptions (see Figure 1 ), especially between 2006 and 2009, may have resulted in fewer taxpayers claiming the adoption tax credit in those years. ", "Some of the trends may also be a result of the \"carryforward provision\" of the credit. Up until 2010, the adoption tax credit was nonrefundable, but taxpayers could \"carry forward\" any unused credit for up to five years after initially claiming the credit. For example, if a taxpayer was eligible for a $12,000 adoption credit, but their tax liability was $2,000 every year, the taxpayer would claim $2,000 of the adoption credit initially and carry forward the remainder every year for five years. Indeed, as indicated in Figure 2 , up until 2010, taxpayers claimed on average less than half of the maximum value of the credit. If these taxpayers were eligible for the maximum amount of the credit, they would need to carry forward the tax credit to future tax returns to claim the entire value of the credit. This may have resulted in the number of returns claiming the adoption steadily increasing until 2010: every year taxpayers who claimed the adoption tax credit would include first-time claimants as well as claims for previous years.", "When the credit was made refundable in 2010, taxpayers could the claim entire amount of their 2010 credit and any carryover credit they had from previous years, virtually eliminating credits carried forward to 2011. This may explain the steep drop in the number of claimants in 2011, as compared to 2010, illustrated in Figure 2 . Indeed, the number of taxpayers claiming the adoption credit appears to be more closely linked with the structure of the credit than the actual number of adoptions. For example, between 2000 and 2006, the number of taxpayers claiming the adoption tax credit steadily rose as illustrated in Figure 2 , while the actual number of adoptions fell over the same time period, as illustrated in Figure 1 . After the credit became nonrefundable again in 2012, the number of claimants of the credit began to increase, even though there is no evidence that the number of adoptions increased.

", "Since the exclusion reduces income subject to taxation, it reduces taxes in proportion to the taxpayer's tax bracket. For example, if a taxpayer receives $2,000 of excludible employer-provided adoption assistance and is in the 10% tax bracket, the exclusion results in $200 of avoided income taxes. If a taxpayer is in the 35% tax bracket, the same $2,000 exclusion is worth $700 in tax savings. (By contrast, the tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. For example, if a taxpayer had $2,000 of qualifying adoption expenses and applied those expenses toward the adoption credit, he or she could receive a credit of $2,000, irrespective of the taxpayer's tax bracket.)", "Taxpayers can claim the exclusion and the credit concurrently for the same adoption, but cannot claim both tax benefits for the same expenses. Hence, for one adoption, a taxpayer is eligible for up to $13,810 in tax-free employer-provided adoption assistance and a $13,810 adoption credit.

In other words, if a taxpayer adopts a child with special needs and an employer has a qualified adoption assistance program, the taxpayer will be able to exclude up to $13,810 of income regardless of what the actual adoption expenses are and even if the taxpayer or the employer does not actually pay any qualified adoption expenses. The filing requirements for the exclusion are the same as for the credit. Finally, the same timing rules that apply to the adoption credit for domestic versus foreign adoption also apply to the exclusion.

Hence, many believe that adoption should be encouraged, including through federal policies like tax benefits. There is currently little evidence, however, that adoption tax benefits are an effective policy tool to increase adoptions. Although the amount of adoption tax benefits has increased over time ( Figure 2 ), the actual number of children adopted has not ( Figure 1 ). Current adoption tax benefits may simply be too small in comparison to the actual costs of adoption to encourage families to adopt, or a family's decision to adopt may not be heavily influenced by financial incentives, but instead may be influenced by more personal issues or beliefs. If adoption tax benefits do not lead to additional adoptions, they are considered economically inefficient by economists and are instead a windfall benefit to families that would have adopted even in the absence of these benefits. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Benefits from Adoption Tax Incentives?", "paragraphs": ["Given that there is little evidence that adoption tax benefits encourage adoption, the fairness of these benefits may be of particular interest. As previously discussed, the vast majority of adoption tax benefits go to upper-income Americans, even though data suggest that a significant number of lower- and middle-income Americans adopt. In 2015, while half (50.4%) of adoption tax credit claimants had income under $75,000, these taxpayers received one-fifth of adoption credit dollars (20.7%), as illustrated in Table 2 . The majority of adoption tax credit dollars (79.3%) went to taxpayers with income of $75,000 or more, with 60% of adoption tax credit dollars going to those with income between $100,000 and $200,000. While comparable data are not available for the exclusion of employer-provided adoption benefits, exclusions generally tend to provide the largest tax savings to those paying the highest marginal tax rates (i.e., upper-income taxpayers). ", "Under several economic definitions of \"fairness,\" adoption tax benefits would be considered unfair (or inequitable). For example, the principle of vertical equity implies that taxpayers with greater income, and hence more economic resources, should pay more in tax. The principal of vertical equity underpins the progressive nature of the federal income tax code, where those with more income pay a greater share of that income in taxes through higher tax rates. Under the definition of vertical equity, adoption tax benefits which primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers would lessen the progressivity of the federal income tax and hence be inequitable. ", "Adoption tax benefits may also be considered inequitable under the definition of \"horizontal equity.\" According to the principal of horizontal equity, similar taxpayers should pay a similar amount in taxes . Many economists consider taxpayers to be similar if they have similar levels of income. Hence, if two tax units earn $40,000 and both pay $8,000 in taxes, then the tax system is horizontally equitable. However, adoption tax benefits (like many tax preferences) can result in taxpayers with the same income paying different amounts in taxes, depending on their characteristics such as whether they own a home (the mortgage interest deduction), send a child to college (higher education tax benefits), or adopt (adoption tax benefits).

In 2012\u2014when the IRS was processing mostly 2011 income tax returns and the adoption tax credit was refundable\u2014they selected 69% of returns with adoption tax credit claims for audit. In most cases, these returns were selected because the IRS flagged the required adoption documentation as missing, invalid, or insufficient. However, after auditing these returns the IRS \"disallowed $11 million\u2014or one and one half percent\u2014in adoption credit claims.\" One reason the IRS may have flagged such a large proportion of returns for audit\u2014even when so few dollars of benefits were improperly claimed\u2014was the IRS's lack of familiarity with adoption documentation. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate (TAS) remarked,", "The documentation that certifies adoptions varies from state to state. A determination of whether a child is considered to have special needs is also a state-based decision. The result is a variety of documentation that may meet the requirements for the adoption credit. As we have seen with the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), when taxpayers are required to provide non-standardized documentation to establish eligibility, it often leads to problems for both taxpayer and the IRS.", "The recent IRS challenges with administering the refundable adoption credit highlight fundamental challenges with having the IRS\u2014which is focused on collecting revenue\u2014administer a social policy like an adoption incentive.

Alternatively, Congress could increase (or eliminate) the current statutory cap on the value of the benefits ($13,810 in 2018), so that the tax benefits were closer to the actual adoption costs. While this would increase the value of adoption tax benefits for many taxpayers, it is still unclear if it would encourage more adoptions. While there is some evidence that the type of adoption is influenced by cost (i.e., families may pursue a domestic foster care adoption due to cost versus a more expensive international adoption), there is little evidence of any effect of adoption tax benefits on the decision to adopt. In addition, increasing the size of adoption tax benefits will increase the total cost of adoption tax benefits. Data from the IRS indicate that on 2015 tax returns, about $251 million worth of adoption tax credits were claimed.

As previously discussed, under current law, the adoption tax credit is nonrefundable, meaning the value of the credit claimed in any year cannot exceed income taxes owed in that year. In effect, tax liability acts as a cap on the value of a nonrefundable tax credit. However, unlike other nonrefundable credits for individuals, the amount of the credit in excess of income taxes owed in a given year may be carried forward and claimed for up to five years after initially claimed. The adoption tax credit was temporarily refundable for two years\u20142010 and 2011\u2014which may provide some insights into the benefits and costs of making this credit refundable. ", "Policymakers interested in expanding eligibility for the adoption tax credit to low- and middle-income taxpayers may consider making the adoption tax credit refundable. This would promote equity among taxpayers at different income levels who are able to adopt. ", "Making the credit refundable may also reduce taxpayers' compliance burden in claiming the credit and result in current claimants receiving the full value of the credit sooner, instead of carrying the credit forward for up to five years. As previously discussed and illustrated in Figure 2 , when the adoption tax credit was nonrefundable, taxpayers on average claimed significantly less than the maximum amount of the credit. Given that adoption expenses tend to exceed the maximum credit amount, many of these taxpayers may have carried the adoption credit forward on subsequent tax returns. This would require diligent record keeping on the part of taxpayers until they had claimed the total credit amount or they had exhausted the five-year time limit of the carryforward, whichever came first. It would also mean that among those taxpayers who carried forward the credit, there could be a significant lag between when adoption expenses were incurred and when the credit for those expenses was actually claimed. For example, if a taxpayer incurred $10,000 in legal expenses in 2010 for a foreign adoption that was finalized in 2012, they could only begin claiming the credit on their 2012 income tax return, filed in early 2013. Depending on their tax liability, they could continue to carry forward the credit for those expenses until their 2017 tax return, a return filed generally in early 2018. ", "Finally, making the credit refundable could encourage the adoption of more children from the domestic foster care system, an often repeated goal of these tax benefits (see \" Legislative History of the Credit and Exclusion \"). Data indicate adoptions from foster care tend to account for a greater share of adoptions among low-income taxpayers\u2014who would likely not be eligible for a nonrefundable credit\u2014than higher-income taxpayers. One study found that \"foster care adoptions accounted for about 10 percent of the adoptions completed by filers with incomes over $100,000, compared with more than 25 percent of the adoptions completed by filers with incomes below $50,000.\" The same study found that foster care adoption accounted for 29% of adoptions among taxpayers with income under $25,000, while overall foster care adoptions accounted for 18% of adoptions among all tax filers.", "On the other hand, making the credit refundable could potentially increase compliance burdens on taxpayers claiming the credit as well as pose administrative challenges to the IRS. Insofar as policymakers remain concerned about the improper payments of refundable tax credits, they may seek ways to prevent taxpayers from either mistakenly or fraudulently claiming the adoption tax credit. Depending on the processes used to reduce improper payments, taxpayer burden could increase, as could administrative difficulties for the IRS. For example, when the adoption tax credit was temporarily refundable, the IRS required taxpayers claiming the credit to file a paper return (they could previously e-file), and include both IRS Form 8839 as well as specific adoption-related documentation, which varied based on whether the adoption was foreign or domestic, final or not final, and of a child with special needs or not. ", "Finally, making the adoption tax credit refundable could increase the budgetary cost of the credit if no other modifications to the credit were made (like reducing the maximum credit amount). As illustrated in Figure 3 , the total amount of the credit claimed in 2010 ($1.2 billion)\u2014the first year the credit was refundable\u2014and 2011 ($610 million) was nearly four times and two times, respectively, the average annual aggregate credit amount between 2002 and 2009 (approximately $325 million per year). Some of the increased cost in 2010 may have been a result of taxpayers with unused \"carried forward\" credit dollars claiming all of the remaining credit in 2010, as opposed to carrying it forward after 2010. Taken as a whole, the 2010 and 2011 data provide some indication as to the range of the cost of making the credit refundable with no alterations to the formula.

Insofar as this policy goal changes, Congress may modify adoption tax benefits to provide parity between different types of adoption. For example, if Congress was interested in encouraging more foreign adoptions, it could change the timing rules of foreign adoptions to be identical to domestic adoptions. Currently, taxpayers who adopt a child from abroad can only claim tax benefits once the adoption is finalized, unlike those who adopt domestically, who can claim benefits the year after expenses are incurred (see Table 1 ).

One potential solution that Congress may consider is allowing taxpayers to use a standard third-party affidavit that allows the relevant adoption intermediary, be they a state or private agency, to attest to the adoption.

The same formula for the credit and income phaseouts could apply. While this policy change might expand the availability of this benefit, it would also likely increase the cost of the provision and complexity for taxpayers, who could now claim both a credit and deduction for their expenses. In addition, the value of the deduction in terms of tax savings\u2014like the exclusion\u2014depends on the taxpayer's tax bracket.
