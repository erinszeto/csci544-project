In doing so, the report also briefly surveys current law on particular issues pertaining to small business contracting and subcontracting, including significant amendments to current law made by the 111 th and 112 th Congresses. The latter information is included because, in many cases, the legislation enacted or proposed in the 113 th Congress built upon changes made by its predecessors. Although the report cites numerous bills, it does not attempt to include all legislation related to small business contracting in the 113 th Congress. Nor does it discuss all provisions of bills that are included.

Congress amended Section 15(g) of the Small Business Act in 1978 to require that agency heads, in consultation with the SBA, set agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses each year. Ten years later, in 1988, Congress further amended Section 15(g) to require the President to set government-wide goals for the percentage of federal contract and/or subcontract dollars awarded annually to various categories of small businesses. These government-wide goals must equal or exceed certain percentages specified in statute (currently, 23% of federal contract dollars awarded to small businesses (of any type); 5% of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to women-owned small businesses; 5% to small businesses owned and controlled by \"socially and economically disadvantaged\" individuals and groups; 3% to HUBZone small businesses; and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses). Individual contracts may be counted toward multiple goals. For example, an award to a HUBZone small business counts toward both that goal and the overall small business goal. ", "The 1978 and 1988 amendments granted the executive branch considerable discretion in determining how the \"total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards\" for a fiscal year was to be calculated, and in deciding what steps should be taken to meet the government-wide and agency-specific goals. This discretion, coupled with persistent failures to meet the goals, prompted the 111 th and 112 th Congresses to make multiple changes to what is commonly known as the \"Small Business Goaling Program.\" Initially, the 111 th Congress required that senior procurement executives, senior program managers, and agency directors of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs) communicate to their subordinates the \"importance of achieving small business goals.\" Subsequently, the 112 th Congress reiterated this requirement, and made other amendments to Sections 15(g) and (h) of the Small Business Act with the intent of improving performance as to these goals. Among other things, the 112 th Congress directed the SBA to review its \"Goaling Guidelines\" to ensure that certain types of spending are not excluded when goals are set. It also imposed several requirements as to the establishment of agency-specific contracting goals, directed agencies to take specified steps to meet their goals, and increased reporting regarding goaling program performance. In addition, the 112 th Congress mandated an independent assessment of the goaling program and required that certain members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) be trained on contracting requirements under the Small Business Act.

One measure enacted by the 113 th Congress amended Section 15(h) to require that agency reports regarding performance in contracting and subcontracting with small businesses include a \"remediation plan with proposed new practices to better meet such goals, including analysis of factors leading to any failure to achieve such goals.\" Previously, such plans only had to address (1) the extent of small business participation in agency contracts and subcontracts, (2) whether the agency achieved its goals, and (3) justifications for any failures to attain goals. ", "Another measured enacted by the 113 th Congress amended Section 15(g) to permit the Department of Energy (DOE) to count first-tier subcontracts awarded by contractors managing and operating national laboratories toward the DOE and government-wide goals for prime contracts . This change arguably reflects the unique nature of the supplies and services the DOE purchases, a sizeable percentage of the total value of which is made up of contracts for the management and operation of laboratories that are generally seen as unsuitable for performance by small businesses. At earlier dates, the DOE had prime contract goals that were substantially lower than those of other agencies. However, the DOE could potentially have been said to have failed to comply with certain requirements imposed by the 112 th Congress\u2014particularly a requirement that agencies \"make a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in [agency] procurement contracts and subcontracts\" \u2014if it had reported this same low goal as to prime contracts year after year, without any increases. Counting certain subcontracts as if they were prime contracts arguably gives the DOE greater latitude for improvements in its performance as to its prime contracting goals. On the other hand, an argument could be made that treating subcontracts as if they were prime contracts minimizes the DOE's incentives to contract with small businesses. Those opposed to counting certain DOE subcontracts as prime contracts may also note that subcontractors do not enjoy the same protections as prime contractors under federal law, making it inappropriate to equate the two."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation Proposed in the 113th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Members of the 113 th Congress also introduced legislation that would have increased the government-wide goals for the percentage of contract and/or subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses, thereby also effectively increasing the agency-specific goals.

Some measures would also have increased the goals for the percentage of contract and subcontract dollars awarded to HUBZone small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses from 3% to 5%-6% each. Such measures responded to concerns that the goals\u2014which were set a decade or more ago\u2014are too low and do not adequately reflect the availability of minority-, women-, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in today's marketplace. Also, given recent reports that the federal government has met its goals for contracting and subcontracting with small businesses for the first time in seven years, an argument could be made that increasing the goals is necessary to ensure continued federal efforts and improvements in this area.", "Other measures introduced in the 113 th Congress would have clarified how particular contracts are to be counted for goaling purposes. Several of these measures sought to prevent \"double dipping,\" or counting a single contract toward multiple goals because, for example, it happens to be awarded to a firm that is owned by a service-disabled woman that is participating in the SBA's Minority Small Business Ownership and Capital Development Program (commonly known as the \"8(a) Program\"). These measures would have generally barred agencies from counting a small business in more than two categories (e.g., HUBZone, women-owned) when determining whether the agency has met its goals. Some measures would have also required agencies to count awards to small businesses participating in the 8(a) Program toward the goal for small disadvantaged businesses, as opposed to other goals. Other measures would have clarified how specific contracts (e.g., contracts with \"teaming arrangement entities\") are to be counted.

As amended, Section 8(d) generally requires agencies to incorporate terms addressing subcontracting with small businesses in contracts performed within the United States whose value exceeds a minimum threshold (currently, generally $150,000) . These terms (1) articulate that it is the \"policy of the United States\" that small businesses have the \"maximum practicable opportunity to participate\" in the performance of federal contracts, and (2) obligate the prime contractor to carry out this policy \"to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient performance of th[e] contract.\" In addition, \"larger\" contracts (currently those whose value exceeds $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction contracts)) that offer subcontracting possibilities must generally also incorporate so-called subcontracting plans with", "percentage goals for the amount of work to be subcontracted with various types of small businesses (e.g., HUBZone small businesses); descriptions of the efforts the contractor will take to ensure that small businesses have \"an equitable opportunity to compete\" for subcontracts; assurances that the contractor will \"flow down\" these requirements to all subcontractors (other than small businesses) with \"larger\" subcontracts (currently, those valued in excess of $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction contracts)); and recitations of the types of records the contractor will maintain to demonstrate the procedures it has adopted to comply with its subcontracting plan.", "Recent Congresses have, however, made a number of amendments to Section 8(d), in part, because of concerns about agencies' performance in meeting the government-wide and agency-specific goals for contracting and subcontracting with small businesses. Initially, the 111 th Congress amended Section 8(d) in an attempt to address \"bait-and-switch\" (i.e., prime contractors using subcontractors other than those whom they said in their bid or offer that they would use), and subcontractors' difficulties in obtaining payment from prime contractors. Among other things, the 111 th Congress required that subcontracting plans include terms obligating prime contractors to make \"good faith efforts\" to obtain supplies and services from the small businesses they \"used\" in preparing their bids and proposals, and provide the contracting officer a written explanation if they do not. It also required prime contractors to notify the contracting officer in writing if they pay a \"reduced price\" to a subcontractor for completed work, or if payment to a subcontractor for work for which the agency has paid the prime contractor is more than 90 days past due. ", "Subsequently, the 112 th Congress imposed additional requirements on the collection and reporting of data regarding prime contractors' performance of their subcontracting plans. It also provided statutory authority for contracting officers to consider prime contractors' performance in subcontracting with small businesses when evaluating their \"past performance\" for source-selection purposes. In addition, it established further protections for subcontractors by requiring that (1) offerors who intend to identify a particular small business as a potential subcontractor in their bid or proposal notify the small business prior to doing so, and (2) the SBA establish a mechanism whereby subcontractors can report \"fraudulent activity or bad faith\" by contractors with respect to subcontracting plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislation Enacted by the 113th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The 113 th Congress expanded on these requirements by enacting legislation that imposes certain obligations on prime contractors whose subcontractors are also required, through the \"flow down\" of contract requirements, to have subcontracting plans.

The 113 th Congress also required that subcontracting plans contain a recitation of all \"records\" that the prime contractor will maintain to demonstrate the procedures it has adopted to ensure that its subcontractors comply with their subcontracting plans. In addition, the 113 th Congress addressed when and how lower tier subcontracts may be counted toward prime contractors' subcontracting goals, as well as amended a subcontracting program unique to the Department of Defense, as discussed below.

One bill would, for example, have required the SBA to \"collaborate\" with contracting agencies to include contract terms that would provide contractors with \"additional consideration\"\u2014an apparent reference to payment\u2014if they meet their goals for subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses. Another bill would have required the Administrator of the SBA to consult with other agency heads to develop and implement \"standards\" whereby contracting officers may consider potential contractors' prior performance as to their subcontracting plans when making source-selection determinations. Currently, the Small Business Act authorizes consideration of this information, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) even requires it in certain circumstances.

When multiple requirements are grouped into a single contract, that contract may be difficult, or impossible, for small businesses to perform. For this reason, Congress has enacted progressively more stringent limitations upon the \"bundling\" and \"consolidation\" of requirements by federal agencies. First, in 1997, Congress amended the Small Business Act to define bundling as,", "consolidat[ing] 2 or more procurement requirements for goods or services previously provided or performed under separate smaller contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single contract that is likely to be unsuitable for award to a small business concern due to\u2014(A) the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of performance specified; (B) the aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award; (C) the geographical dispersion of the contract performance sites; or (D) any combination of the factors described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).", "It also required agencies to take certain steps to ensure that any bundling that they engage in is \"necessary and justified.\" Then, in 2003, Congress amended the Armed Services Procurement Act (ASPA) to prohibit defense agencies from executing any acquisition strategy that includes a \"consolidation\" of contract requirements valued in excess of $5 million (later adjusted for inflation to $6 million) without first (1) conducting market research, (2) identifying any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements, and (3) determining that the consolidation is \"necessary and justified.\" The 111 th Congress subsequently imposed similar requirements upon other agencies' contracts valued in excess of $2 million. It also required (1) the development of a government-wide policy regarding bundling, (2) listings of and justifications for bundled contracts, and (3) periodic reports on the performance of agency officials who are tasked with minimizing bundling and promoting contracting with small businesses.

This plan is to describe the roles of specified officials in improving the quality of data reported on bundled and consolidated contracts, among other things.

The former type of measure generally sought to amend the definition of bundling of contract requirements so that it would apply to requirements for construction (as the definition of consolidation of contract requirements currently does), as well as in situations where an agency adds a new requirement to requirements previously provided or performed under separate smaller contracts. These measures would also have generally altered\u2014and established a statutory basis for\u2014current regulatory and other procedures for resolving differences of opinion between the SBA and the procuring agency as to whether particular procurements are bundled.

The term \"strategic sourcing\" commonly describes the process of using analyses of an organization's spending to acquire frequently procured items more economically and efficiently. The General Services Administration (GSA) has recently promoted government-wide strategic sourcing as a way to save money. Individual agencies have also developed their own agency-specific strategic sourcing initiatives for the same purpose. On the other hand, small businesses have expressed concern that strategic sourcing could diminish opportunities for small businesses to obtain and perform federal contracts, since small businesses may not be able to supply the large quantities of supplies and services that are often required for discounted pricing. Several measures introduced in the 113 th Congress would have responded to these concerns by requiring the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop guidance on strategic sourcing that \"reflect[s] the requirements of the Small Business Act, including the provisions regarding contract bundling, contract consolidation, and the need to achieve the statutory small business prime contracting and subcontracting goals in section 15 of that Act.\" Other measures would have required the collection of data regarding strategic sourcing, or independent assessments of strategic sourcing's effects on small businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Set-Asides and Sole-Source Awards under the Small Business Act", "paragraphs": ["Competition is generally valued in federal contracting because it can result in the government paying lower prices, ensure some degree of transparency and accountability, and help prevent fraud. Because of this, Congress has generally required that agencies obtain \"full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures\" when awarding contracts, and defined full and open competition to mean that all responsible sources are permitted to submit bids or offers. However, in keeping with its declared policy of ensuring that small businesses obtain a \"fair proportion\" of federal procurement dollars, Congress has also enacted a number of statutes that require or authorize agencies to use other than full-and-open competition when contracting with small businesses. In particular, various provisions of the Small Business Act permit agencies to award contracts to small businesses on a set-aside or sole-source basis if certain requirements are met, as Table 1 illustrates. Key among these requirements is that the contracting officer reasonably expects bids or offers will be received from at least two small businesses, and the award can be made at a fair market price. This requirement is commonly known as the \"Rule of Two\" because of its focus upon receipt of bids or offers from at least two small businesses. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has separate statutory authority, beyond that provided in the Small Business Act, to make set-aside and sole-source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and other veteran-owned small businesses, as discussed below. ", "Because legislation pertaining to the so-called \"set-aside programs\" for different types of small businesses (e.g., HUBZone, women-owned) has historically been enacted separately, each program is discussed below under its own heading. However, there have been occasional measures that affect set-asides or sole-source awards for all types of small businesses. These latter measures are grouped together under the heading \"General.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General", "paragraphs": ["Although the various provisions of the Small Business Act requiring or authorizing set-asides or sole-source awards to small businesses each pertain to a particular type of small business (e.g., HUBZone, women-owned), in some cases, Congress has enacted or considered legislation that would affect the ability of all types of small businesses to obtain awards under these authorities. Perhaps the most notable example is legislation enacted by the 111 th Congress that expressly authorizes agencies to set aside all or part of \"multiple-award contracts\" for small businesses. A multiple-award contract is a single contract awarded to multiple vendors, each of which is generally entitled to a \"fair opportunity to be considered\" for orders valued in excess of $3,000. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 111-240 , the setting aside of multiple-award contracts for small businesses seems to have been an accepted practice. However, there was not express statutory authority for such set-asides. However, there was not express statutory authority for such set-asides. Even more significantly, some asserted that the setting aside of orders under multiple-award contracts was effectively barred because of provisions of federal law which generally require that all vendors holding a multiple-award contract have a \"fair opportunity to be considered\" for orders under the contract. The legislation enacted by the 111 th Congress vitiates this argument by expressly permitting set-asides of orders \"notwithstanding the fair opportunity requirements,\" as well as other set-asides and reservations of parts of multiple-award contracts. This legislation also defines multiple award contract in a way that apparently encompasses Federal Supply Schedules contracts. Previously, questions had been raised about the applicability of set-asides to Schedules contracts. ", "Several measures introduced by Members of the 113 th Congress would have similarly affected the ability of all types of small businesses to obtain set-aside contracts. For example, one measure would have provided that \"timely offers\" from Federal Prison Industries (FPI)\u2014a government-owned corporation that sells products manufactured by federal prisoners to federal agencies\u2014are not to be considered if the contract has been set-aside for small businesses under \"section 15(a) of the Small Business Act ... and its implementing regulations.\" Federal law currently requires that \"timely offers\" from FPI be considered whenever agencies use \"competitive procedures\" in procuring products for which FPI has a \"significant market share,\" and the GAO has found that small business set-asides constitute \"competitive procedures\" for purposes of this provision. The proposed legislation would have effectively overturned this GAO decision as to contracts awarded under the authority of Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act, ensuring that contracts set-aside for small businesses generally (i.e., not of a particular type) cannot be awarded to FPI.

Section 8(a) and related provisions of the act broadly define social disadvantage and designate certain racial and ethnic groups as socially disadvantaged, although they also grant the SBA authority to recognize additional groups as such. Section 8(a) also defines economic disadvantage , but it does not establish any specific monetary thresholds for determining whether individuals are economically disadvantaged. Instead, the SBA promulgated the current \"net worth\" standards\u2014of not more than $250,000 for initial entry into the program, and $750,000 for continuing eligibility\u2014through notice-and-comment rulemaking in 1989. The act further limits participation in the 8(a) Program to a single term of no more than nine years for firms and individual owners. However, it, along with other provisions of federal law, permits certain owner-groups\u2014namely, Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs)\u2014to participate in the 8(a) Program on somewhat different terms than individual owners. No significant amendments to Section 8(a) have been enacted in recent years, despite the introduction of multiple bills on the topic.

Some bills would have increased the SBA's \"net worth\" standard to $1.5 million for initial and continuing eligibility, and codified this standard. These measures would have also permitted firms to participate in the 8(a) Program for more than nine years if they have not \"completed\" a contract awarded under the authority of Section 8(a). These changes were apparently in response to concerns that the current net-worth thresholds are too low and have not been adjusted for inflation. There have also been concerns that the percentage of contract dollars awarded to individual 8(a) firms has decreased as the number of firms participating in the program has increased. ", "Another measure would have amended Section 8(a) to provide that, if an NHO establishes it is economically disadvantaged in connection with the application to the 8(a) Program of one firm it owns, it generally need not reestablish economic disadvantage when additional firms it owns apply to the program. Currently, Section 8(a) has two separate provisions regarding determinations of economic disadvantage, one addressing tribally owned firms, and the other addressing all other firms. Based, in part, on these provisions, the SBA has promulgated regulations which provide that Indian tribes generally need only demonstrate economic disadvantage one time to qualify firms for the 8(a) Program. In contrast, the regulations as to NHO-owned firms provide that: ", "For the first 8(a) applicant owned by a particular NHO, individual NHO members must meet the same initial eligibility economic disadvantage thresholds as individually-owned 8(a) applicants [i.e., $250,000].

As initially enacted, Section 8(m) only permitted set-asides of contracts whose value was below $3 million, or $5 million for manufacturing contracts (later adjusted to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts)). However, legislation enacted by the 112 th Congress removed these caps, permitting \"larger\" contracts to be set aside for women-owned small businesses.

The legislation permits sole-source awards to women-owned small businesses like those permitted to other types of small businesses. See Table 1 . The 113 th Congress also accelerated the deadline for the Executive to report on the industries in which women-owned small businesses are underrepresented, something which has been of concern to Congress ever since the Executive initially proposed regulations that identified only four such industries.", "Another measure proposed in the 113 th Congress, but not enacted, would have provided for women-owned small businesses to be certified by SBA.

Section 3 of the Small Business Act, in turn, defines a HUBZone to include \"qualified census tracts\" and \"qualified nonmetropolitan counties,\" the latter of which includes counties in which \"the median household income is less than 80 percent of the nonmetropolitan State median income, based on the most recent data available from the Bureau of the Census,\" among other things.

Release of 2010 census data, in particular, affected the grounds upon which a number of firms qualified as HUBZone small businesses, and prompted the 112 th Congress to enact legislation permitting certain \"base closure areas\" (i.e., military bases that have been closed) to continue to be treated as HUBZones for an additional period. Specifically, the legislation in the 112 th Congress permitted areas that were treated as HUBZones pursuant to Section 152(a)(2) of the Small Business Reauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004 to be treated as HUBZones for up to five years, provided that no area may be treated as a HUBZone for more than five years under the authority of this legislation and/or the 2004 act.

There is some overlap between the programs under these two acts, in that the Small Business Act relies upon the definitions of veteran and service-disabled veteran given in the Veterans Benefits Act. However, there are also a number of differences between the two programs. Perhaps most notably, firms and their owners must have their eligibility verified by the VA to be eligible for contracting preferences under the Veterans Benefits Act, while they may \"self-certify\" as to their eligibility for preferences under the Small Business Act.
