Some experts have maintained that the General Assembly budget decision process, by one nation, one vote, that commits a few member states to pay a major percentage of that budget, is unfair and that other principles should replace one nation, one vote on budget issues. When this issue came up between 1985 and 1988, the Assembly decided that every effort would be made to adopt the U.N. regular budget by consensus.

The 2006/2007 approved budget was $3.799 billion though it ultimately totaled $4.17 billion. The 2008/2009 projected budget of $4.8 billion represents a 15% increase over the 2006/2007 budget.", "The proposed regular budget with just the \"add ons\" already identified by the Secretary-General makes this budget the largest regular budget in the history of the U.N. This budget also represents the largest increase in the history of the U.N. on a dollar basis.

Accordingly, such a final budget is likely to represent an increase of 25% or more from the 2006/2007 budget. And let's remember what such an increase actually funds. As my colleagues from the G77 and China rightly point out in paragraph 30 of the Draft Resolution before us: \"approximately 75 percent of the budget resources are related to salaries and common staff cost.... \" The budget increase does not go directly to humanitarian or development aid but rather to increasing the size of the UN Secretariat bureaucracy.", "We all agree that the piecemeal, ad hoc approach of the current budget is inconsistent with sound budgeting practices.
