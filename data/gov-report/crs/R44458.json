Joining together in civic groups amplifies isolated voices and leverages their ability to influence governments\u2014to ensure that they build schools, secure access to health care, protect the environment, and take countless other steps to pursue a popular vision of the common good. ", "Moreover, civil society can also play an important role in global economic growth and development. According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, civil society space often reflects a positive business environment:", "The Special Rapporteur has found that the presence of a robust, vocal and critical civil society sector guarantees, almost without exception, that a State also possesses a good business environment (the converse does not hold: a good business environment does not guarantee a good civil society environment). The rule of law is stronger, transparency is greater and markets are less tainted by corruption.

A December 2006 Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report declared that \"support for democratic, grassroots organizations has become a centerpiece of America's international outreach.\"", "Restrictions on civil society not only impact the health of democracies abroad (and U.S. efforts to support them); they also resonate because of their potentially direct impacts on more immediate U.S. interests in crisis situations, as spelled out in an April 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies: ", "if Liberia or Guinea had adopted laws that made it difficult or impossible for NGOs to function or receive funding from foreign sources, how would these countries have coped with the Ebola virus? If Kenya adopts such laws, how will the country respond to another famine, and what will the next national election cycle there look like if the hundreds of organizations that helped create citizen demand for a nonviolent election in 2013 no longer exist? ", "Crackdowns on civil society groups abroad may also directly impact U.S. government-funded organizations (as in the July 2015 Russia ban on National Endowment for Democracy operations within its borders). In some cases, they can ensnare U.S. citizens who are affiliated with those organizations (for instance, when the Egyptian government cracked down on NGOs in 2011-2012, causing several U.S. citizens working with the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute to take shelter at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo; 16 Americans were among 43 workers later convicted in absentia of receiving foreign funding)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Scope of the Closing Space Challenge", "paragraphs": ["A senior Amnesty International official lamented the increasing restrictions on civil society work globally in a 2015 news article:", "There are new pieces of legislation almost every week\u2014on foreign funding, restrictions in registration or association, anti-protest laws, gagging laws. And, unquestionably, this is going to intensify in the coming two to three years. You can visibly watch the space shrinking.", "Groups tracking the increasingly restrictive environment for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have catalogued the problem using a number of different metrics: ", "CIVICUS, an international association of civil society groups, counted \"significant attacks on the fundamental civil society rights of free association, free assembly and free expression in 96 countries\" in 2014. Freedom House, an NGO focused on expanding democracy and freedom, noted the decline in space for civil society in its 2015 Freedom in the World report, saying, \" ... whereas the most successful authoritarian regimes previously tolerated a modest opposition press, some civil society activity, and a comparatively vibrant internet environment, they are now reducing or closing these remaining spaces for dissent and debate. \" The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) has pointed out that between January 2012 and August 2014, some 50 countries introduced or enacted laws designed to restrict the activity of civil society organizations or curtail funding for their work. ICNL also asserts that more than 120 laws constraining the freedoms of association or assembly have been proposed or enacted in 60 countries since 2012. Of these measures, those designed to restrict foreign funding to support the work of civil society groups have seen the fastest growth. Such restrictions may include requirements for prior government approval for the use of government-controlled bank accounts, laws demanding \"foreign agent\" disclosures, or caps on allowable foreign funding. The U.S. Agency for International Development produces a Civil Society Sustainability Index (CSOSI) for several regions of the world, tracking developments in this space on an annual basis. For example, the Agency's 2014 report on Africa found that \" ... in many countries in the region, CSOs\u2014particularly those focused on advocacy and human rights \u2014 are facing increasing restrictions or threats of restrictions on their work. \" ", "In many cases, the restrictions have targeted U.S.-funded organizations; for example, in July 2015, Russia banned the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) from operating within its borders. The NED thus became the first group to be subjected to a May 2015 law against \"undesirable\" NGOs. The law, which increased Russian authorities' ability to shutter such groups without a court order, followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's assertion to security officials in March that western intelligence agencies use NGOs to \"discredit the authorities and destabilize the internal situation in Russia.\" The impact goes beyond U.S. interests; other international donors, including governments, charities, churches, and private philanthropic groups and foundations also are affected. Nor is Russia alone in taking such actions; the Hungarian government, for example, has targeted NGOs that distributed funding from the Norwegian government, accusing them of serving foreign powers seeking to influence Hungarian internal politics. ", "Measures targeting foreign funding are potentially especially damaging, experts at the Carnegie Endowment suggest: ", "Although such support is rarely, if ever, a determinative factor in the political life of recipient countries, it often does have tangible effects on the institutions and processes that it reaches. This is especially true in the civil society domain, where external funding can be a lifeline for groups working on sensitive topics for which domestic funding is scarce, such as human rights advocacy, anticorruption work, or election monitoring. Limiting these organizations' access to external support weakens their capacity for action and often threatens their very existence.", "In addition, while crackdowns in authoritarian countries such as Russia or China appear to garner the lion's share of Western media attention, experts suggest that repressive measures are being taken against civil society around the world in a variety of political systems and across cultural and economic lines. ", "Restrictions can target not only groups doing what some would call 'political' or rights-focused work (such as human rights defenders and democracy advocates), but also humanitarian actors, civic coalitions, watchdog groups, economic cooperatives, or service providers, as well as other organizations that may receive foreign funding. Repressive regimes often apply different standards to NGOs based on their activities. For example, organizations working on human or political rights may face more restrictions or penalties than organizations providing humanitarian services. Experts assert that these differences are intended to create divisions that prevent civil society groups from responding collectively, though, in some cases, deep divisions already exist within civil society due to local political and social dynamics. ", "The geographic breadth of the problem is demonstrated by the following, nonexhaustive list of examples. ", "India has increased restrictions on foreign-funded organizations, including the Ford Foundation, Mercy Corps, and especially Greenpeace India; its government also revoked more than 10,000 NGO licenses in the first half of 2015 from civil society groups due to failures to detail foreign funding. Ethiopia adopted a law in 2009 restricting NGOs that receive more than 10% of their funding from foreign sources from engaging in human rights or advocacy activities. Angola 's president issued a decree that took effect in March 2015 that limits foreign funding of NGOs and imposes strict registration requirements. Bangladesh enacted a law in December 2014 that strictly limits foreign financing of NGOs, and the government is considering a Cyber Security Law that could stifle free expression online. Cambodia has placed strict new registration and \"neutrality\" requirements on NGOs since August 2015, despite an international campaign against the restrictions. The Egyptian government in 2014 mandated that all civil society groups must register with the Ministry of Social Solidarity; the penal code also was amended in the context of counterterrorism to mandate life imprisonment for anyone who receives funds from foreign entities. In 2011, the Egyptian government also brought legal cases against local and international NGOs for allegedly receiving illegal funding from abroad, resulting in the conviction and sentencing of 43 foreign and Egyptian NGO employees to prison terms in 2013. Hungary imposed measures against Norwegian-funded NGOs (including Transparency International Hungary) beginning in the spring of 2015. Uganda adopted a law in January 2016 that more strictly controls NGO registration and activity that is against \"the interests of Uganda\" or the \"dignity of Ugandans\"; in addition to limitations on political or human rights work, there is particular concern that the new law could target organizations working on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) issues. Pakistan expelled Save the Children in June 2015, as part of a broader crackdown on foreign-funded civil society groups, and announced a laborious regulatory policy requiring governmental approval to access foreign funds in October 2015. In Ecuador , a June 2013 decree placed time-consuming new regulations on NGOs, as part of broader restrictions leading to the 2014 cessation of USAID operations in the country. Sudan expelled 13 international NGOs and banned 3 Sudanese relief organizations in 2009 on allegations of collaborating with the International Criminal Court and unnamed \"foreign powers\" after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the country's president. Other NGO expulsions occurred in 2012 and 2014. South Sudan adopted a law in February 2016 that mandates NGO registration and government monitoring and criminalizes noncompliance with the law; humanitarian actors have voiced concern that the law will impede aid provision. Other countries considering legislation restricting NGO activities include (but are not limited to) Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Tajikistan, and Vietnam. ", "A geographic categorization of repressive measures as tracked by ICNL is provided as Figure 1 .", "Many experts assess that the closing space trend is likely to continue as authoritarian actors seek to grow their influence both at home and globally. Some experts and advocates warn that, even in already restrictive environments, civil society actors could face new or additional repressive action, particularly when civil society engages in politically charged or sensitive issues. Such actions could include intimidation, arrest and detention, criminal penalties under new NGO laws, physical attacks, extrajudicial killings, and harassment online. Civil society groups in Burundi, for instance, were harassed and jailed for opposing the president's efforts to extend his mandate in 2015, which has led to ongoing unrest and violence in the country. Impunity for acts of violence and repression, either by governmental or nongovernmental actors, may also cause civil society actors to self-censor or leave the country due fears of retaliation. For example, more than 101 environmental activists were killed in Honduras between 2010 and 2014, and some members of civil society engaged on land rights and environment have fled Honduras due concerns for their personal safety. These security concerns may affect the ability of donors\u2014including the United States government, private donors, foundations, and international allies\u2014to s afely work with CSOs abroad. This, in turn, could further impact the United States' ability to engage directly with local organizations and populations on the freedoms of assembly, association, and expression as well as U.S. efforts to work with local actors on security and development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Origins of the Closing Space Phenomenon", "paragraphs": ["While the origins of the closing space phenomenon are complex and in many cases country-specific, scholars suggest that several drivers have accelerated the problem. A 2014 publication by the Carnegie Endowment, Closing Space: Democracy and Human Rights Support Under Fire, explores the causes of the phenomenon and the context of democracy promotion writ large, and makes the following observations:", "As the cold war ended, western governments shifted away from providing humanitarian assistance largely through foreign governments towards funding nongovernmental organizations directly, including those working in more explicitly political areas. A number of events caused semi-authoritarian regimes to view the civil society sector increasingly warily: highly coordinated western support to anti-Milosevic nongovernmental forces in Serbia; the color revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan; the \"Arab Spring\" movements; and others. Russia and China have openly challenged the idea of the universality of liberal democratic political values, offering an alternative conception of the rights and responsibilities of citizens and models of governance. ", "The phenomenon's acceleration has been facilitated by the fact that governments seeking to inhibit civil society groups have learned from each other, for example by copying and implementing nearly identical restrictive legislative measures, analysts suggest. Russia and China maintain a driving role, not only in demonstrating restrictive behavior but also in publicly defending their actions as legitimate. Their example, along with that of India (notably the world's most populous democracy) and Ethiopia, has provided a lead for other countries to follow. ", "Finally, many observers suggest that another development has contributed to the closing of space for civil society: a post 9/11 focus on counterterrorism. Many experts recognize the legitimate threat terrorism poses to states and multilateral actors, and some point to civil society as partners in efforts combat terrorism, noting that the \"importance of involving civil society in a comprehensive and multidimensional response to the threat of terrorism has been stressed by various international documents.\" Nonetheless, according to the Carnegie report, \"Governments in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere have used the war on terror as an excuse to impose restrictions on freedoms of movement, association, and expression.\" Some observers point especially to the unique role of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental organization created in 1989 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. While FATF combats illicit funding flows, some experts suggest that its recommendations have been disproportionally hard-hitting on legitimate CSOs and philanthropic organizations. The organization's focus on counter-terrorism, critics argue, led to an uncompromising stance in which some governments that have eliminated civic space altogether are rated highly for preventing illicit funding flows. Notably, more than 120 nonprofit organizations have called on FATF to amend its approach to ensure that civil society doesn't face \"over-regulation of the sector,\" a recommendation supported by a United Nations Special Rapporteur.

Lifeline reports that, as of December 31, 2015, it has supported over 814 CSOs in 98 countries and territories with emergency assistance and rapid response advocacy grants since 2011. The fund is managed by DRL. The fund has received a total of $7.1 million in U.S. assistance, including $2 million dollars through the HRDF in FY2014. Grants from Lifeline typically provide small amounts of emergency grants to CSOs that are threatened for advancing human rights or for advocacy efforts that seek to push back against closure in civic space. These grants can address a range of specific emergency needs such as, security and protection, legal representation, temporary relocation, community mobilization, policy and legal advocacy, civil society coalition building, and strategic litigation.

", "The Administration reports that in FY2015, the most recent year for which complete data is available, $396 million was specifically allocated to promote civil society globally. This amounts to about 20% of the $2 billion allocated for programs under the \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" (GJD) foreign assistance objective and for the NED (which is not considered foreign assistance). Notably, other funding under NED and the broad GJD objective supports democracy promotion, good governance, human rights, and rule of law, which many experts consider essential for civil society's broader enabling environment.", "Funding for direct civil society assistance and broader GJD assistance declined between FY2012 and FY2014, and remained relatively flat for FY2015. For FY2016, however, the Administration requested more than $3 billion for these activities, a 46% increase over FY2015 funding. This also included $602 million for civil society, a nearly 65% increase over FY2015 funding. Congress responded by appropriating \"no less than\" $2.3 billion for \"democracy programs,\" resulting in a funding increase for GJD of at least 11%. It is unclear whether the higher FY2016 democracy funding will result in a higher allocation for civil society programs in FY2016. For FY2017, the Administration has requested $2.8 billion for GJD and NED, of which $652 million is allocated for civil society. Overall, funding for civil society accounted for 1% of U.S. foreign assistance in FY2015; GJD funding accounted for 5%.

", "The Obama administration is credited by many experts with having recognized the accelerated closing of civil society space and the need to respond. Practitioners and U.S. officials point to Stand with Civil Society and the Presidential Memorandum as important steps that formalized the Administration's commitments to civil society. They commend the Administration's leadership on rapid response assistance such as Lifeline, which was founded in 2011 to provide emergency assistance to CSOs in partnership with other governments and foundations. For example, an expert on civil society space has called Lifeline an \"important increase\" to quick-action financial assistance. ", "Experts also recognized a need to balance resources between longer term capacity building, addressing the enabling environment (i.e. legal and regulatory frameworks), and emergency response needs. Nonetheless, given the increase in restrictions on CSOs in recent years, many noted that reaching CSOs under threat with relatively small amounts of funding\u2014sometimes as little as $5,000 to $10,000\u2014could have a significant impact. ", "A comprehensive accounting of U.S. responses is complicated by the fact that some U.S. assistance (either diplomatic or financial), while valuable, may be less publicly visible or even unwanted. In conversations with CRS, Administration officials and practitioners privately underline that the public record of U.S. government support to civil society is necessarily incomplete due to concerns over retaliation and safety. Some interventions in support of persecuted civil society actors are best done quietly, they suggest. In other cases, non-U.S. actors may be the preferred interlocutor, as some CSOs are unwilling to accept U.S. aid\u2014be it financial or diplomatic\u2014due to concerns that it could undermine their credibility at home.", "While experts generally agree that the United States has demonstrated leadership in understanding and framing the problem of closing space, the policy response has been complicated by a number of factors, including various competing interests in the policy process, such as balancing support for civil society with U.S. willingness to confront important bilateral partners, possible impacts on other programs or objectives, and the availability of suitable tools or sufficient leverage. In conversations with CRS, former and current officials have privately voiced concern that civil society issues do not often rise to high-level decision-making, particularly when contrasted with decision points around traditional national security interests (e.g. foreign military sales or counterterrorism efforts) and/or development goals (e.g. health). Critics suggest that recent reductions in U.S. funding to promote democratic space and good governance\u2014coupled with increases in U.S. support to other sectors such as security\u2014may send a mixed message to host countries about U.S. priorities. Some also point to the decline in U.S. funding for democracy and governance (DG) since FY2012, particularly in countries like Egypt, Ethiopia or Sudan that have placed restrictions on NGO activity, as being perceived as rewarding bad behavior and abandoning civil society.", "More could be done to institutionalize the Administration's efforts to bolster civil society in U.S. foreign policy in the face of competing policy priorities, some experts suggest. For example, the SACSED position established by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a direct line to the Secretary and highlighted U.S. engagement with civil society as a key component of U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy. However, in discussions with CRS, many policymakers cautioned against using special envoys alone for this issue. The trade-offs inherent in policy decisions within the interagency process on civil society issues can make it more difficult for a special envoy to engage effectively in policymaking in multiple regions, especially when security threats are also a concern. Advocates suggest that enhanced institutional capacity related to this issue throughout the interagency, particularly through resourcing and staffing, might have a more sustainable impact. Advocates also recommend that all U.S. officials should elevate the focus on civil society, and that officials and programs should be evaluated, in part, on the basis of their engagement with civil society issues; some experts have also suggested the issuance of a Presidential Directive to this effect. ", "Some have also underlined the utility of legislation such as the Brownback amendment (see \" Legislative Action \" below), in protecting U.S. support for civil society, both within the interagency when faced with competing interests, and in ensuring that foreign governments (including key security partners) cannot undercut U.S. support for civil society in repressive environments. ", "The multilateral tools that the Administration has sought to bolster, including the CD and OGP, present new partnerships and opportunities that some experts hope will lead to concrete outcomes; however, some suggest that multilateral efforts may struggle because they also seek to include countries with mixed or restrictive records on civil society. Others question if these organizations can create good response mechanisms when members repress or restrict civil society. A test case is ongoing in the OGP with member state Azerbaijan, which is under review after international CSOs filed a complaint in March 2015. OGP reviewed and assessed the CSOs complaints to be credible. In an upcoming ministerial meeting in May 2016, OGP will review corrective actions by Azerbaijan and the status of its membership in the organization. Observers suggest this could be an opportunity to assess OGP's effectiveness in helping governments and civil society work cooperatively for transparent governance. ", "Observers have also questioned the effectiveness of the Administration's presentation of U.S. regulation of NGOs as an example for other governments. For example, some suggest that the United States has sent mixed signals about its support to CSOs when it comes to efforts to counter terrorism financing. While the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), of which the United States is a leading member, was created to combat illicit funding flows, activists suggest that its recommendations have had a disproportionate impact on legitimate CSOs and philanthropic organizations, especially when compared to regulation of the private sector. The organization's focus on counter-terrorism, critics argue, has led to an uncompromising stance in which despotic regimes that have eliminated civic space altogether are rated highly for preventing illicit funding flows. They suggest that U.S. policy and models, as well as institutions like the Treasury Department, should address fears that NGOs could be used as fronts for corruption or terrorist financing activities while also working to support civil society space and operations.", "Experts further caution that, though the United States has raised international attention to the issue, restrictions on civil society also impact other governments and donors\u2014both public and private. Some are calling for civil society and NGOs to develop membership models and/or a culture of philanthropy within their countries as possible alternatives to foreign funding. Experts also assess that the underlying issues, namely free expression, assembly, and association, are not merely a concern for civil society, NGOs, or human rights activists. Rather, they suggest that repressive actors could potentially benefit from separating concern over civil society space from broader attention on fundamental freedoms.
