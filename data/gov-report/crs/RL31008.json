It is also consideredpart of the discretionary budget. Funding for the DOT budget is derived from a number of sources.The majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds. The remainder of DOTfunding is from federal Treasury general funds. The transportation trust funds include: the highwaytrust fund, the transit account of the highway trust fund, the airport and airway trust fund, and theinland waterways trust fund. All of these accounts derive their respective funding from specificexcise and other taxes.", "In FY2002 trust funds accounted for well over two-thirds of total federal transportation spending. Together, highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of DOTappropriations. Most highway and the majority of transit programs are funded with contract authorityderived by the link to the highway trust fund. This is very significant from a budgeting standpoint. Contract authority is tantamount to, but does not actually involve, entering into a contract to pay fora project at some future date. Under this arrangement, specified in Title 23 U.S.C., authorized fundsare automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated withoutappropriations legislation; although appropriations are required to make outlays at some future dateto cover these obligations.", "Where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process, transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation. That is, the authority tospend for the largest programs under their control already exists, and the mechanism to obligatefunds for these programs also is in place. ", "Prior to the FY1999 DOT Appropriations Act, changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes inbudget/contract authority and by placing limitations on obligations. The principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds to congressional budgetagreements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Transportation Appropriations as a Result of TEA21", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 1999, TEA21 changed the transportation budgetary process in two ways. First, it created new budget categories; and, second, it set statutory limitations on obligations. TEA21amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create two new budgetcategories: highway and mass transit. TEA21 further amends the budget process by creating astatutory level for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from FY1999 to FY2003. ", "The net effect of the creation of these new budget categories is a predetermined minimum level of funding for core highway and transit programs, referred to in TEA21 as a \"discretionary spendingguarantee.\" The highway and mass transit categories are separated from the rest of the discretionarybudget in a way that prevents the funds assigned to these categories from being used for any otherpurpose. These so called \"firewalls\" are viewed, in the TEA21 context, as guaranteed and/orminimum levels of funding. Additional funds above the firewall level can be made available forhighway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process.", "In addition, TEA21 provides a mechanism to adjust the amounts in the highway account (but not the transit account) to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highway-generatedrevenues. This Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) redistributes to the various states, forobligational TEA21 highway programs (also known as core programs), the trust fund revenues thatare in excess of projected receipts. These additional revenues are allocated to the states using theformulas spelled out in the law. However, the FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 Administrationrequests proposed redirection of RABA funds from highway programs to other DOT initiatives. Inthe end, the FY2000 and FY2001 DOT appropriations acts did not adopt the proposed redirectionof RABA funds. In FY2002, however, the Administration request is honored in part. Moreimportantly, the FY2002 Act makes major redistributions of RABA funding outside of the coreprograms. These distributions will be discussed in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)section of this report.", "TEA21 changes the role of the House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The appropriationscommittees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations. In addition,it appears that the TEA21 precludes, at least in part, the House and Senate appropriations committeesfrom exercising what some Members view as their traditional option of changing spending levelsfor specific programs or projects. In the FY2000 appropriations act, the appropriators took sometentative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending. The FY2000 Act called forthe redistribution of some funds among programs and added two significant spending projects. Inthe FY2001 appropriations act, the appropriators continued in this vein by adding funds for largenumbers of earmarked projects. Further, the FY2001 Act called for redirection of a limited amountof funding between programs and includes significant additional funding for some TEA21 programs. This trend continues, and even accelerates, in the FY2002 Act as appropriators have made majorredistributions of RABA funds and, in some instances, have transferred RABA funds to agencies thatwould not be eligible for RABA funding from TEA21.", "As suggested earlier, the TEA21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process, because the committees can onlyadjust the DOT agency or program budgets outside the firewalls. Hence, any reduction in spendingfor function 400 must be allocated to agencies or programs other than highways or transit and, as willbe discussed in the next section, most aviation programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Transportation Appropriations as a Result of the Wendell H.

The guarantee for aviation spending, however, is significantly different from thatprovided by TEA21 to highway and transit programs. Instead of creating new budget categories, theFAIR21 guarantee rests on adoption of two point-of-order rules for the House and the Senate. Thefirst point-of-order rule prevents Congress from considering any appropriations legislation foraviation purposes that does not spend all of the \"total budget resources.\" As defined by FAIR21, totalbudget resources are essentially the revenues and interest accruing to the aviation trust fund. Thesecond point-of-order prevents any spending for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operationsand maintenance (O&M) or for research, engineering and development (RE&D), unless the AirportImprovement Program (AIP) and the facilities and equipment (F&E) portions of the FAA accountare funded at their fully authorized levels.", "Almost all observers view the FAIR21 guarantees as being somewhat weaker than those provided by TEA21 for highway and transit programs because Congress can, and sometimes does,waive points-of-order during consideration of legislation. In addition, there is a sense thatappropriators might still have some latitude to make significant changes to FAA O&M funding,which is dependent on both trust-fund and general-fund contributions. For FY2001 and FY2002,however, no point-of-order waivers were considered. ", "Supporters of FAIR21 believe the Act requires significant new spending on aviation programs. And, for at least the FY2001 appropriations cycle, this has been the case. Enactment of FAIR21means that transportation appropriators have total control over spending for only the Coast Guard;the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which includes Amtrak; and a number of smaller DOTagencies. All of these agencies were concerned about their funding prospects. However, the FY2001Act provided budget increases for all major DOT agencies, except for the FRA budget.", "Supporters of the Coast Guard are especially concerned about this new transportation appropriations environment. The Coast Guard is not funded by a trust fund and cannot claim auser-fee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls. The Coast Guard has a uniquestatus within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in national defense. Itis not unusual for the Coast Guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during theannual appropriations process. It is possible that the Coast Guard will seek additional funding fromthe military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds from transportationappropriations do not become available. In FY2001, however, the existence of a significant budgetsurplus abated these concerns. For FY2002, national security concerns have overridden the budgetaryissues, and the agency will receive a significant increase in funding.", " Table 1.

In proposing a Department ofTransportation (DOT) budget of roughly $59 billion the Administration wasproposing a roughly 1.5% increase over last years budget total. (1) The FY2001 budget,however, included slightly less than $2.8 billion of what the Administration referredto as \"one time projects\" that were added to the budget of the Federal HighwayAdministration (FHWA). If these are subtracted, the Administration's FY2002proposal could be seen as a 6.5% increase. The budget request was in conformancewith the basic outline of both the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 ST Century(TEA21; P.L. 105-178 ), which authorized spending on highways and transit, and theaviation funding authorized in the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and ReformAct of the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21; P.L. 106-181 ). Although there wasconsensus on funding the larger programs at or above their guaranteed levels, therewere still number of other issues that arose during the debate.", "The Conference Agreement (H.Rept. 107-308; P.L. 107-87). Three months after the House andSenate had passed their versions of H.R. 2299 , Congress agreed to theconference report on the bill that resolved differences between the two bills, not onlyon money and program matters, but also on the President's objections to provisionsin the House and Senate bills concerning the implementation of the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions on access of Mexican commercial trucksto the U.S. market. President Bush signed P.L. 107-87 on December 18, 2001.", "P.L. 107-87 provides $59.6 billion for DOT, roughly $600 million more than the President requested and $1.5 billion more than enacted for FY2001. Most DOTagencies, however, are funded at or near the Administration's request.", "Compared to FY2001, the FY2002 DOT appropriations act (hereafter referred to as the FY2002 Act) provides significant increases for most DOT agencies. TheFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) budget increases roughly 6% to $13.295billion; the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) budget increases 8% to $6.747billion; and the Coast Guard receives an increase of 12% to $5.031 billion. Twoagencies get slightly less than in FY2001: at $32.895 billion, the Federal HighwayAdministration (FHWA) receives slightly less than in FY 2001; the Federal RailroadAdministration (FRA) is funded at $734 million, $21 million less than enacted inFY2001. The FY2002 Act also provides $1.25 billion (to be offset by newlyauthorized user and airline fees) for the Transportation Security Administration,recently created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act ( P.L. 107-71 ).", "Transit Issues. The Administration's budget request had proposed to convert the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA)Bus and Bus Facilities Program and Job Access and Reverse Commute Program fromdiscretionary to formula programs. Both these programs have been subject toearmarking in the past. Formula programs are generally not available for earmarking. Both the House and Senate rejected these program changes.", "The Administration also proposed to reduce the maximum federal share under the FTA's New Starts Program from 80% to 50%, beginning in FY2004. There arealways many more transit project proposals than funds to support them. Supportersof this change see it as a way to fund more New Starts projects, and also argue thata 50% local share would assure that only projects supported by a strong localcommitment would get funded. On the other hand, some argue that the reducedfederal share could skew the awards process to favor projects in wealthier urban areasand make the provision of funding less needs based. The FY2002 Act directs FTAnot to sign any new full-funding grant agreements after September 30, 2002, thathave a maximum federal share higher than 60%.", "RABA Distribution and Congressional Earmarking. When the FY2002 DOT budget debate began,there were a number of reasons to expect that the treatment of RABA would be atissue. First, the Bush Administration's budget request proposed two RABAset-asides. One would have provided $56 million to support construction of state andfederal motor carrier inspection facilities along the U.S.-Mexico border. A secondset-aside, of $145 million, would have supported two pilot programs that make upthe Administration's proposed New Freedom Initiative. Of this amount, $45 millionwould have been used to promote innovative transportation solutions for thedisabled. The remaining $100 million would have been used to fund competitivematching grants to promote access to alternative transportation. Second, the ClintonAdministration had previously proposed RABA set-asides in its FY2000 and FY2001budgets. Congress, however, did not adopt the requested redirection of RABA fundsduring those years. Third, the FY2000 and FY2001 DOT Appropriations Acts didmake a modest change in the RABA distribution. Both years' Acts redirected theRABA funds from allocated (commonly referred to as discretionary) programs,which are under the aegis of the FHWA, to the core highway programs that aredistributed to the states by formula. Some observers thought this might happen againin FY2002. Finally, the large size of the FY2002 RABA, $4.543 billion, increasedthe attractiveness for using these funds for congressional initiatives or forearmarking.", "The FY2002 Act sets aside $56.3 million of RABA funds for U.S.-Mexico border infrastructure but no RABA funds are set aside for the President's NewFreedom Initiative.", "More controversial is FY2002 Act's redirection of $423 million of the RABA revenues that under TEA21 are added to the formula funds distributed to the states. Instead, the $423 million is added to the $574 million of FY2002 RABA, that, underTEA21, is distributed to the allocated (i.e. discretionary) programs. This made a totalof $997 million in RABA funding available for distribution to the FHWA's allocated programs. The conference report language, however, specifies the programs that areto be funded and provides the dollar amounts for each. Only programs provided withRABA set asides in the conference report receive any of the money; i.e., allocatedprograms that are not given set asides get no RABA funding. Most notable of theprograms that lose their RABA funds under FY2002 Act is the High Priority Projectprogram. Among the programs benefitting from these additional funds are: IndianReservation Roads ($35.6 million); Public Lands Highways ($31.8 million and $45.1million); Park Roads and Parkways ($21.3 million); ferry boats and ferry terminalfacilities ($25.6 million); the Corridors and Borders program ($352.3 million); theTransportation and Community and System Preservation pilot program($251.1million); the Interstate Maintenance Discretionary program ($76 million); theBridge Discretionary program ($62.5 million); and for border infrastructureimprovements ($56.3 million). Most of the money from these RABA set-asides isearmarked in conference report H.Rept. 107-308 . (2) Some members of Congress haveexpressed dissatisfaction with the degree to which these set asides are innonconformance with TEA21.", "Section 330 of the conference report also provides an appropriation of $144 million for surface transportation grants. The funds are earmarked in H.Rept.107-308 . The extent of earmarking, especially of RABA funds, continues to becontroversial.", "NAFTA Implementation and the Mexican Trucking Issue. The most contentious debate during both House andSenate consideration of the DOT appropriation involved the implementation of theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions regarding the operationof Mexican trucks throughout the U.S. NAFTA provisions prescribe a phased-inimplementation which was to be completed by January 1, 2000. Citing safetyconcerns, the Clinton Administration refused to allow Mexican trucks beyond theborder commercial zones. Mexico filed a complaint against the U.S. under NAFTAdispute resolution. Recently the arbitration panel held against the U.S. The BushAdministration announced its intention to implement the trucking access provisionsof NAFTA by the end of 2001. A provision added by amendment in the House to H.R. 2299 , prohibited the use of funds to process applications byMexico-based trucking firms for authority to operate beyond U.S. bordermunicipalities and commercial zones. Taking a different approach, the Senate billincluded a series of safety requirements and preconditions to be met before any fundsappropriated can be used to review or process an application by a Mexican motorcarrier to operate trucks beyond the border commercial zone. Among therequirements and preconditions required in the Senate bill were: full on-site safetycompliance review of Mexican motor carrier companies; equipping all U.S.-Mexicoborder stations with weigh-in-motion systems; proof of valid insurance with aU.S.-based insurance company; and requiring that Mexican commercial motorvehicles may not cross at a border crossing unless an inspector is on duty. After longand contentious debate, the Senate passed H.R. 2299 (as amended) withvirtually all of the Mexican trucking provisions intact. ", "The FY2002 ACT incorporates Senate provisions, some of which have been modified, regarding processes and measures to promote the safety of cross-bordertrucking between the United States and Mexico. The modifications were sufficientto overcome Bush Administration concerns that the Senate-passed version of the bill might violate NAFTA. The agreement provides for $25.866 million for salaries,expenses, and capital costs to implement these provisions. These funds are inaddition to funds provided in the appropriation for the Federal Motor Carrier SafetyAdministration (FMCSA) and the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program(MCSAP) that also are intended to enhance the ability of U.S. DOT and the states topromote the safety of Mexican trucks and buses entering the United States.

Additionalmonies are derived by zero funding a number of programs that would have beeneligible for RABA funding from TEA21.

For example, the Corridor and Border (CORBOR) program gets over $352million in RABA funding, in addition to its $140 million annual authorization. These funds are then earmarked to 124 specific projects. The provision of RABAfunds to programs outside FHWA (to the Motor Carrier Safety Administration) isalso somewhat controversial.", "As a result of these actions, the states lose significant amounts of core programfunding that they expected as part of the RABA distribution process.

Somediscretionary activities, i.e., the Transportation and Community and SystemPreservation Pilot Program, are now completely earmarked. The growth inearmarking is controversial. Opponents of earmarking contend that this processnegates the intent of authorizing legislation, in this case TEA21, that seeks to makesome of these funds available on a competitive basis. Appropriators, however,believe that they should have a role in determining when and where funds are spent. Further, they believe they are simply responding to the desires of Members ofCongress who have filed large numbers of earmarking requests with the Committee.
