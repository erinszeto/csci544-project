Of that number, an estimated 51,000 (or 91%) were noncitizens. Two years earlier, the Social Security Commissioner stated that SSA investigators had found evidence that some beneficiaries living abroad were faking marriages and adoptions and failing to report deaths in order to \"cheat the system.\" At the time, the Commissioner stated that such problems were particularly acute in Greece, Italy, Mexico and the Philippines, where large numbers of beneficiaries were residing. He stated further that, in some countries, \"there is a kind of industry built up of so-called claims-fixers who, for a percentage of the benefit, will work to ensure that somebody gets the maximum benefit they can possibly get out of the system.\"", "In 1996, Congress approved tighter restrictions on the payment of Social Security benefits to aliens residing in the United States. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) prohibited the payment of Social Security benefits to aliens in the United States who are not lawfully present, unless nonpayment would be contrary to a totalization agreement or Section 202(t) of the Social Security Act (the alien nonpayment provision). This provision became effective for applications filed on or after September 1, 1996. Subsequently, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 202(y) to the Social Security Act.
