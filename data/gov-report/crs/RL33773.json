Total harm refers to the damages incurred by all of society as a result of the defendant's conduct, as opposed to actual harm to the individual plaintiff before the court. Ruling in favor of Philip Morris, the Court rejected the total harm theory and found that the Due Process Clause does not permit a state \"to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties.\" ", "The court based its decision on three principles. First, the Court found that an individual cannot be punished by a state for an injury to a nonparty victim without \"an opportunity to present every available defense,\" such as showing that a nonparty victim \"knew that smoking was dangerous.\" Second, the Court found that allowing a defendant to be punished for harming a nonparty victim \"would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation\" because of unresolved questions about the nonparty victims . Third, the Court found no support for the concept of using punitive damages awards to punish a defendant for injuring nonparty victims. Despite these limitations, the Court stated:", "Evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible\u2014although counsel may argue in a particular case that conduct resulting in no harm to others nonetheless posed a grave risk to the public. ", "In other words, although harm to nonparties could be considered in assessing \"the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct,\" a jury could not directly punish a defendant for harm to others. The Court did not explain its basis for this distinction, noting only that, for the above three reasons, a jury could not \"go further than this and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly\" for alleged harm to nonparties.", "Finally, the Court held that states must provide constitutional protections that will prevent jurors from considering harm to nonparties when punishing a defendant. States must properly guide juries and limit their \"discretionary authority,\" according to the Court, or there is a risk of (1) arbitrariness; (2) deprivation of adequate notice to a defendant of the severity of a state's penalty; and (3) the imposition of one state's or one jury's policies upon other states.

The Court, relying on an interpretation of maritime law rather than invoking the Due Process Clause, rejected the notion that punitive damages could be used to address uncompensated harms and reduced the punitive damages award to $507.5 million.

Although the Court's analysis of challenges to punitive damages has been somewhat amorphous, the basic limitations on punitive damages under the Due Process clause are generally considered either procedural or substantive. However, because the Court has been hesitant to characterize the imposition of constitutional limits on punitive damages as an aspect of substantive due process, it can be difficult to clearly differentiate between substantive and procedural limitations.

In its first application of the Due Process Clause to punitive damages awards, the Court established that an adequate jury instruction must place a \"sufficiently definite and meaningful constraint on the discretion of jurors.\" These instructions generally seek to enlighten the jury as to the scope and purpose of punitive damages as compared to compensatory damages. A damage award will likely violate Due Process where a meaningful restraint is absent and jurors are free to exercise unbridled discretion or \"run wild\" in assessing punitive damages against a defendant. An effective jury instruction will clarify the purpose of awarding punitive damages as well as identify factors that cannot be considered in determining the size of the award. Prohibited motivations for imposing punitive damages include the wealth of the defendant, prejudice, bias, or a desire by the juror to compensate the plaintiff for previously uncompensated injuries.

A defendant cannot be punished for injury to a party without being provided the \"opportunity to present every available defense.\" Accordingly, the Supreme Court has expressly held that the Due Process Clause does not permit a state \"to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties.\" Harm to nonparties can be considered, however, in the substantive Due Process context for the limited purpose of determining the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct. Therefore, states must properly guide juries in their restricted consideration of harm to nonparties and not use procedures that \"create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk\" of a due process violation.

Although the Court has implied that substantive due process prohibits the imposition of excessive or arbitrary punitive damages, a majority opinion has never explicitly invoked substantive due process to invalidate a punitive damages award. Moreover, the Court has been unwilling to lay out a \"mathematical\" bright line rule on what constitutes an excessive award\u2014instead opting to establish an extensive analytical framework to be applied in making such a judgment. Most commentators, however, characterize the framework utilized in BMW and State Farm as based on the dictates of substantive due process. ", "The Court's current framework for determining whether a challenged punitive damages award is constitutional finds its source in the fundamental notion that a \"grossly excessive\" damage award violates the Due Process Clause. The definition of what constitutes a grossly excessive award, however, has evolved over time. Initially, the court relied on a case by case determination in which a decision on whether the award was \"grossly excessive\" was based on \"general concerns of reasonableness.\" The modern Court, however, has identified \"grossly excessive\" fines through the application of a three-part test, initially set out in Gore , but expanded in subsequent cases. These three \"guideposts\" include (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct; (2) the reasonableness of the ratio between punitive damages awarded and the actual harm inflicted; and (3) the degree of comparability between the punitive damages awarded and authorized civil and criminal penalties. Although no one factor is dispositive, the Court has consistently and decisively given the reprehensibility and ratio factors the greatest weight, while downplaying the importance of any similarity to civil or criminal penalties. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Degree of Reprehensibility", "paragraphs": ["The Court has identified a number of factors that contribute to an evaluation of the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct\u2013perhaps the most important aspect of the substantive due process analysis. These five key factors include: whether the harm caused was physical or economic; whether the victim was financially vulnerable; whether the conduct represented a reckless disregard for the health or safety of others; whether the conduct was repetitive or isolated; and whether the plaintiff's injury occurred as a result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit as opposed to mere negligence. Conduct that involves bad faith or fraud tends to suggest a high degree of \"reprehensibility\" as is evidenced by the Court's decision in TXO , which emphasized the \"character\" of the actions that led to plaintiff's injury in upholding a large 526:1 damages ratio. ", "The Court has also stated that a jury is free to consider potential harm to nonparties for the limited purpose of determining the degree of reprehensibility. However, any factor used by the courts in considering the degree of reprehensibility must be reasonably related to the specific conduct in question. That is, the Supreme Court has established a nexus requirement between the acts taken into consideration in assessing punitive damages and the underlying unlawful act. Acts independent of the conduct upon which liability is premised cannot contribute to the jury's evaluation of the overall degree of reprehensibility.

The Court has expressly stated that \"few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages\" will pass constitutional muster. This is not to say that there is a firm single-digit ratio cap on punitive damage awards. However, taken in conjunction with the Court's assertion in Exxon (a decision based on maritime law rather than the Due Process Clause) that a 1:1 ratio of compensatory to punitive damages is generally a \"fair upper limit,\" it becomes apparent that the Court will likely consider a double-digit ratio to be constitutionally suspect. In the past the Court has upheld ratios of 4:1 and 526:1, while striking down damage awards with ratios of 5:1, 500:1, 145:1, and 97:1. ", "The Court's decisions have also suggested a willingness to accept a greater disparity between compensatory and punitive damages where a \"particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.\" In such a case, the Court may be more likely to permit a damages ratio that exceeds single-digits. Accordingly, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages can only be relied upon as one factor in the larger substantive due process framework.

The comparable sanctions guidepost calls for a consideration of whether less drastic remedies could be anticipated to deter misconduct in the future, by giving \"substantial deference\" to legislative sanctions for similar misconduct.

Justice Ginsberg has also consistently disagreed with the majority on the extent to which the Constitution places limitations on punitive damages. The Justice considers the Court's attempts to place limits on punitive damages a subjective intrusion into an area of state concern. Justice Ginsberg also questions the Court's method for determining the point at which a punitive damages award becomes excessive, arguing: \"Too big is, in the end, the amount at which five Members of the court bridle.\" ", "Though initially supportive of due process limitations on punitive damages awards, Justice Stevens balked at the Court's latest decision to prohibit the consideration of harm to nonparties in assessing punitive damages. In Philip Morris , Stevens reiterated that he believed that the Court's prior cases announcing due process constraints on punitive damages \"were correctly decided.\" He disagreed, however, with the Court's additional imposition of a \"novel limit\" on the state's power to impose punishment, through punitive damages, in civil litigation. Contrary to the majority view, Stevens considered harm to nonparties a \"relevant factor\" in reviewing the validity of a punitive damages award. The exact import of this position, as well as the impact Justice Steven's position will have on future cases, remains uncertain. Although he disagreed with the due process constraints established in Philip Morris , Justice Stevens continued to conclude that the Due Process Clause \"imposes both substantive and procedural constraints on the power of the states to impose punitive damages on tortfeasors.\" At the very least, however, Justice Stevens seems to believe the Court went too far in excluding harm to nonparties as a consideration in assessing punitive damages, and may be reluctant to extend constraints in future cases.

Justices Ginsberg, Thomas, and Scalia have consistently opposed such limitations. This leaves Justices Stevens and Sotomayor as potential votes in either direction depending on the facts of the particular case. Justice Stevens historically has supported some procedural limitations on punitive damages awards, though his dissent in Philip Morris and his vote with the majority in TXO to uphold a 526:1 damages ratio seem to suggest that he differs with the current majority position as to the degree to which the Constitution limits the size and nature of punitive damage awards.", "Justice Sotomayor, the Court's newest justice, was not yet a member of the Court for either Philip Morris or Exxon . Moreover, commentators have generally been unable to \"pigeonhole\" Justice Stotomayor as either \"pro-business\" or \"pro-plaintiff.\" Many have referred to the new justice as a \"moderate\" who analyzes business issues on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict whether Justice Sotomayor, like the justice she replaced, will be a reliable vote in favor of limitations on punitive damages awards. In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2 nd Circuit, Judge Sotomayor encountered two constitutional challenges to punitive damages awards, upholding both awards as comporting with the Due Process Clause.
