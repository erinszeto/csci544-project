During the 1990s, however, shortfalls in state and local budgets\u2014coupled with increased responsibilities (i.e., counterterrorism) of local fire departments\u2014led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government.

Many in the fire-service community argued that notwithstanding the fire grant program, there remained a pressing need for an additional federal grant program to assist fire departments in the hiring of firefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. They asserted that without federal assistance, many local fire departments would continue to be unable to meet national consensus standards for minimum staffing levels, which specify at least four firefighters per responding fire vehicle (or five or six firefighters in hazardous or high-risk areas). Fire-service advocates also pointed to the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program as a compelling precedent of federal assistance for the hiring of local public safety personnel.", "In support of SAFER, fire-service advocates cited studies performed by the U.S. Fire Administration and the National Fire Protection Association, the Boston Globe , and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) which concluded that many fire departments fall below minimum standards for personnel levels. According to these studies, the result of this shortfall can lead to inadequate response to different types of emergency incidents, substandard response times, and an increased risk of firefighter fatalities.", "On the other hand, those opposed to SAFER grants have contended that funding for basic local government functions\u2014such as paying for firefighter salaries\u2014should not be assumed by the federal government, particularly at a time of high budget deficits.
