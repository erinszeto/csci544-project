Efficiency is greatest when the policy's marginal impact, the giving induced by the program, is large relative to the policy's inframarginal impact, the benefits given to those whose behavior was not directly caused by the tax policy. Using this framework, the HAITI Act is unlikely to be economically efficient. In general, tax benefits for charitable giving do not appear to significantly increase donations.

Like all tax benefits, the provision can be evaluated by assessing the impact on economic efficiency, equity, and complexity. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["The efficiency of the accelerated deduction depends on how much additional giving is induced by the provision, or the marginal impact of the program. The marginal impact of a tax break can be evaluated relative to the inframarginal impact. The inframarginal impact of a tax subsidy is the benefits given to individuals whose behavior is unchanged by the policy. In the case of the accelerated deduction, the inframarginal impact is the tax savings given to those who would have donated if the accelerated deduction had not been adopted. Efficient tax incentives are ones where the marginal impact is large relative to the inframarginal impact. ", "Since accelerated deductions reduce the price of charitable giving, empirical evidence on the price elasticity of charitable giving can provide insight regarding the expected marginal impacts. If charitable giving is price elastic, with a price elasticity greater than one, a $1 tax incentive would be expected to generate more than $1 in charitable giving. If charitable giving is price inelastic, a $1 tax incentive would be expected to generate less than $1 in charitable giving. Empirical evidence suggests that the price elasticity for charitable giving is considerably less than one. Since charitable contributions are relatively unresponsive to changes in the price of giving, the marginal impact of the accelerated deduction is likely to be small relative to the inframarginal impact. In general, theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest that tax benefits for charitable giving do not appear to significantly increase donations.", "There are also efficiency concerns surrounding the impact of accelerating the charitable deduction on the timing of giving. The provision is said to be efficient if it causes charitable giving to aid organizations to increase, without crowding-out donations to other charitable organizations. If charitable giving for disaster relief crowds-out other forms of charitable giving, altering the distribution of charitable giving across organizations or across time, the provision may not be efficient. Empirical evidence using individual-level data from the 2004 tsunami suggests that tsunami donations given in 2005 did crowd-out future charitable giving. Other evidence, discussed in the context of donor fatigue below, suggests that donations for disaster relief did not contemporaneously crowd-out charitable giving to other organizations.", "Evaluating the efficiency of accelerating the charitable donations deduction involves understanding both the timing and the nature of the contributions. From a timing perspective, the accelerated deduction is designed to encourage giving in early 2010, by allowing taxpayers to claim the charitable contributions on their 2009 tax returns. However, to the extent that these donations were made without an expectation of an accelerated deduction provision, they are inframarginal. In the 13 days following the earthquake in Haiti, $470 million was donated to U.S. nonprofits providing aid to victims (this compares to $580 million in the eight days following Hurricane Katrina and $163 million in the nine days following the Indian Ocean tsunami). Corporate giving in the 72 hours following the earthquake topped $43 million. This immediate outpouring of support was not likely the result of expected changes to the tax code. Nonetheless, itemizers who made deductions during this time will benefit from the accelerated deduction provision if enacted. ", "Donors making small donations to the victims of Haiti's earthquake may be enticed to donate by convenience, rather than by the tax code. Many text-message donors may also be non-itemizers. Approximately 17% of all donations made to the American Red Cross were made via text message in the 13 days following the earthquake. Even for text message donors that do itemize, the value of the accelerated deduction is relatively small (17 cents for a taxpayer in the 35% bracket), and it seems unlikely that the prospect of such a donation would be driving behavior.", "The \"Hope for Haiti\" celebrity telethon, broadcast on a number of major television networks, was also responsible for generating a large portion of the charitable contributions for Haiti relief efforts. The \"Hope for Haiti\" telethon, which aired on Friday, January 22, 2010, had raised $58 million by Saturday, January 23, 2010. A similar telethon following the 2004 tsunami raised $18.3 million. It seems unlikely that most individuals donating through the telethon were doing so in response to tax incentives.", "Congressional concern that hurricane-related giving may cause other forms of giving to fall (donor-fatigue) led to post-Katrina tax breaks for hurricane relief related charitable giving. The concept of donor fatigue rests on the notion that households set aside a fixed amount for charitable giving each year, and give until the funds are exhausted. Survey evidence following Hurricane Katrina suggests that donor fatigue did not cause donations to other charities to fall in 2005. Given that disaster related giving was a relatively small part of overall giving in 2005 (less than 3%), it is unlikely that donor fatigue, if present, was large. Nonetheless, it is possible that donor fatigue was mitigated by Congressional action enhancing incentives for charitable contributions.

First, only taxpayers who itemize deductions can take advantage of the accelerated deduction. Second, deductions violate vertical equity principles, as greater benefits accrue to higher income individuals.

Non-itemizing taxpayers claim the standard deduction ($5,700 for single filers in 2009). The logic behind the standard deduction is that it accounts for the tax-deductable activities of individuals choosing not to itemize deductions and simplifies tax compliance. As illustrated Table 4 , the proportion of taxpayers who itemize increases for higher income taxpayers. The benefits associated with the charitable contribution deduction are also skewed towards higher income taxpayers. Just over 13% of taxpayers have an AGI between $100,000 and $200,000. Of these taxpayers, 81% itemize deductions. Nearly 25% of tax expenditures associated with the charitable deduction go to the $100,000 to $200,000 AGI group.", "That charitable contributions violate vertical equity principles is a consequence of a progressive tax system. The value of a deduction to a taxpayer is based on their marginal tax rate. Take, for example, two taxpayers both donating $2,000 to victims of natural disasters. One taxpayer is in the 10% income tax bracket, while the other is in the 35% income tax bracket. Assuming both taxpayers itemize deductions, the value of the deduction to the first taxpayer is $200 while the value of the deduction to the second taxpayer is $700.

Since taxpayers would be allowed to claim earthquake related charitable contributions in either 2009 or 2010, there may be an increased monitoring burden on the IRS to ensure that deductions are only claimed in one year, and not both.
