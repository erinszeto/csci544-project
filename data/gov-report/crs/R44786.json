Among the concerns behind such an interest is what some view as inadequate growth in domestic high-paying jobs in a range of industries in recent years. Four possible pathways to accelerating growth in these jobs are (1) faster rates of entrepreneurial business formation, (2) increased business investment in domestic R&D, (3) greater domestic production of products and services derived from that research, and (4) increased employer spending on training workers to acquire the skills needed to earn higher-paying jobs.", "One way Congress can influence the rate of high-wage job creation is tax incentives for investment in innovation and worker training and education. Under current federal tax law, three provisions directly affect entrepreneurial business formation and business investment in R&D: (1) an expensing allowance for research expenditures under Section 174 of the tax code (which is scheduled to switch to a five-year amortization for that spending starting in 2022), (2) a non-refundable tax credit for increases in research expenditures above a base amount under Section 41, and (3) a full exclusion for capital gains from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held by the original investor for five or more years under Section 1202. There is no federal tax incentive for employer investment in worker training.", "The tax credit and expensing allowance encourage companies to invest more in qualified research than they otherwise would by lowering the cost of capital for that research and boosting cash flow. Still, some argue that the current credit's incentive effect is too weak to increase business R&D investment to what economists would deem optimal levels. In the view of critics, the credit's design has certain flaws that lead to uneven and arbitrary incentive effects and make it difficult for small startup companies to benefit from the credit in their early years, when they are likely to have net operating losses. The credit was permanently extended at the end of 2015, while the expensing allowance has been a permanent tax provision since 1954.", "Section 1202 allows a non-corporate investor to exclude 100% of any capital gain on qualified small business stock acquired after September 27, 2010, and held for at least five years. The exclusion is intended to boost equity investment in small startup firms in designated industries (including manufacturing) by reducing the tax burden on the returns to that investment relative to the tax burden on the returns from alternative investments.", "Recent research indicates that startup firms in business no more than five years account for most net U.S. job growth over time, but that access to financial capital remains a significant barrier to the formation and growth of such firms. It is unclear what share of U.S. high-paying jobs are accounted for by small firms, but small entrepreneurial firms that survive and grow into large, successful companies can be a prolific source of such jobs. Industries that intensively use intellectual property (IP) directly and indirectly (through supply chains) accounted for 30% of U.S. jobs in 2014, and workers in those industries had average weekly earnings that were 46% larger than the average weekly earnings of workers in non-IP intensive industries.", "The 115 th Congress passed legislation ( P.L. 115-97 ) in late 2017 that substantially cut the tax rates for corporate and non-corporate business income, beginning in 2018. The new law also modified or repealed a number of tax provisions affecting business after-tax profits. Some argue that the tax cuts alone should be sufficient to increase the number of high-paying domestic jobs in a range of industries. Others are skeptical that many large employers will invest the windfall gains from the tax cuts in expanding domestic production and boosting worker wages and training and education. In their view, many large companies (including U.S. multinational corporations) are more likely to use much of the tax savings to buy back stock and raise dividends. ", "One option for increasing the number of high-paying domestic jobs that was not included in P.L. 115-97 but that the 115 th Congress may examine is the creation of a tax incentive known as a patent or innovation box. Such an incentive lowers the tax burden on income earned from the commercial use of qualified intellectual property, such as trademarks or patents. Depending on its design, a patent box could give U.S. and foreign companies investing in innovation a stronger incentive to expand their investment in U.S. R&D and production activities. Potential drawbacks to such a subsidy include its budgetary cost and the difficulty of finding a sound economic justification for a tax subsidy that benefits companies that develop or purchase successful patented innovations only.", "A second option for spurring faster growth in domestic high-paying jobs that was also excluded from P.L. 115-97 is a tax incentive for employers to invest in worker training and education. Several bills have been introduced in the current Congress to promote employer investment in training programs such as apprenticeships and collaboration with community colleges to design courses of study that are based on the skill needs of employers. The U.S. economy benefits from high-paying jobs only if there are workers to fill them.

Pricing of GHG emissions would promote demand for more efficient and lower-emitting technologies, potentially driving innovation and market-based technological change. Emission fees could also be used in part to finance basic research in which the private sector tends to underinvest because of its risks and the difficulty of capturing all the benefits of successful R&D.

Counties in California used a commercial alerting system (versus IPAWS) that allowed officials to target alerts to county residents. However, the commercial system required residents to sign up for the service. With only a fraction of the residents subscribed, only a fraction received the wildfire alert. County officials considered issuing an alert through the federal IPAWS system, which would have alerted all residents in the area via television, radio, cell phone, social media, etc. However, county officials believed that the wireless emergency alerts (WEA)\u2014cell phone alerts\u2014that are issued through IPAWS could not be targeted to precise regions within the county. Officials feared that issuing a countywide alert would result in the unnecessary evacuation of some citizens, and congestion on evacuation routes. ", "In January 2018, the FCC adopted rules to improve geo-targeting of wireless emergency alerts (WEA). The rules require carriers that participate in the WEA program to deliver WEA alerts in a more geographically precise manner so that the alerts are targeted to the communities impacted by an emergency, as defined by the alert originator (e.g., state or local emergency manager). The FCC required participating providers to reach all of the devices in the target area with not more than a 0.1 mile overshoot. Smaller, rural carriers whose legacy networks may be technically incapable of matching the specified target area are required to deliver the WEA to an area that best approximates the target area.
