The exceptions, however, raise the possibility of Indian gaming proposals for locations presently unconnected with an Indian tribe. Among the exceptions are land (1) acquired after the SOI determines acquisition to be in the best interest of the tribe and not detrimental to the local community and the governor of the state concurs; (2) acquired for tribes that had no reservation on the date of enactment of IGRA; (3) acquired as part of a land claim settlement; (4) acquired as part of an initial reservation for a newly recognized tribe; and (5) acquired as part of the restoration of lands for a tribe restored to federal recognition.", "An implementing regulation was issued on May 20, 2009. It specifies the standards to be satisfied by tribes seeking to conduct gaming on lands acquired after October 17, 1988. The regulation includes limiting definitions of some of the statutory terms and considerable specificity in the documentation required for tribal applications. During the latter half of 2010, the Department of the Interior (DOI) conducted a series of consultation sessions with Indian tribes focusing on whether the implementing regulation should be revised. On June 13, 2011, DOI determined the regulation to be satisfactory and withdrew earlier departmental guidance, which had been issued before the regulation had become final. The guidance addressed how DOI handled tribal applications for off-reservation land acquisitions for gaming. It had elaborate requirements for a tribe to satisfy with respect to applications for gaming facilities not within commutable distances from the tribe's reservation.", "A June 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak , appears to have increased the possibility for challenges to secretarial decisions to take land into trust by (1) ruling that individuals who are potentially harmed by the proposed use of land taken into trust have standing under the Federal Administrative Procedure Act to bring suit, and (2) holding that suits to challenge the legality of a DOI decision to take land into trust that do not claim title to the land are not precluded by the Quiet Title Act, which contains a waiver of sovereign immunity for quiet title actions against the United States, except for suits involving Indian title.", "Since the Patchak decision, there have been two noteworthy developments. First, the Bureau of Indian Affairs revised the land acquisition regulations to specify that, once there is final agency action, land is to be taken into trust immediately without a 30-day waiting period. Second, a June 4, 2015, en banc decision of a federal appellate court, Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California , 789 F. 3d 947 (9 th Cir. 2015), held that a challenge to the validity of a trust acquisition must be brought within the Administrative Procedure Act's six-year statute of limitations.", "Nine laws have been enacted in recent Congresses with gaming prohibitions in connection with specific lands being taken into trust: (1) P.L. 114-69 , the Albuquerque Indian School Land Transfer Act, which provides for trust acquisitions for 19 Pueblos and specifies that class I, class II, or class III gaming may not take place on the acquired trust land; (2) P.L. 114-181 , which transfers in trust \"for non-gaming purposes\" certain federal Bureau of Land Management land in California for the benefit of the Susanville Indian Ranchera; (3) P.L. 113-179 , the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act, which ratified the DOI's May 15, 2005, trust acquisition of the land at issue in Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of-Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak , and required that any federal court action relating to that land should be dismissed; (4) P.L. 113-134 , which provides for the trust acquisition of certain federal land for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona; (5) P.L. 113-127 , which provides for taking certain Bureau of Land Management land into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians and prohibiting IGRA class II and class III gaming on the land; (6) P.L. 112-97 , which authorizes the acquisition of certain land for the Quileute Indian Tribe in the state of Washington; (7) P.L. 112-212 , which declares certain federal land to be held in trust for the Bridgeport Indian Colony; (8) Section 2601(h)(4)(A) of P.L. 111-11 , which prohibits class II and class III gaming on land that the provision transfers to be held in trust for the Washoe Tribe; and (9) P.L. 111-323 , which prohibits gaming on federal land transferred to the Hoh Tribe.", "Legislation proposed in the 114 h Congress includes two bills, S. 732 and H.R. 249 , which would amend the Indian Reorganization Act to make all federally recognized Indian tribes eligible for trust land acquisition.

One of the requirements for class II and class III gaming is that the gaming be \"located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization or entity.\" The federal courts have interpreted this to permit tribes to conduct types of gaming permitted in the state without state limits or conditions. For example, tribes in states that permit \"Las Vegas\" nights for charitable purposes may seek a tribal-state compact for class III casino gaming. On the other hand, the fact that state law permits some form of lottery or authorizes a state lottery is not, in itself, sufficient to permit a tribal-state compact allowing all forms of casino gaming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geographic Extent of IGRA Gaming", "paragraphs": ["A key concept of IGRA is its territorial component.

Determining the applicable boundaries of a reservation is a matter of congressional intent and may entail a detailed analysis of the language of statutes ceding tribal reservation land, and the circumstances surrounding their enactment as well the subsequent jurisdictional history of the land in question.", "The second alternative has two prongs: (a) the land must be in trust or restricted status, and (b)\u00a0the tribe must exercise governmental authority over it. Determining trust or restricted status involves Department of the Interior (DOI or department) records.

There are many statutes that require DOI to take land into trust for a tribe or an individual Indian. An array of statutes grant the Secretary of the Interior (SOI) the discretion to acquire land in trust for individual Indian tribes; principal among them is the Wheeler-Howard, or Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA). Although the IRA has been held by the Supreme Court to apply only to tribes \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934, a recent opinion of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior provides guidance on how tribes may be able to satisfy that requirement. Procedures for land acquisition are specified in 25 C.F.R., Part 151. By this process, Indian owners of fee land, that is, land owned outright and unencumbered by liens that impair marketability, may apply to have their fee title conveyed to the SOI to be held in trust for their benefit. Among the effects of this process are the removal of the land from state and local tax rolls and the inability of the Indian owners to sell the land or have it taken from them by legal process to collect on a debt or for foreclosure of a mortgage. In determining whether to approve an application to take land into trust under this statute, the SOI is required to consider a number of factors and to inform \"state and local governments having regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired,\" giving them \"30 days in which to provide written comments as to the acquisition's potential impacts on regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes and special assessments.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Taking Land into Trust", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v.

Patchak , there was an assumption that U.S. sovereign immunity under the Quiet Title Act barred challenges to any decision of the Secretary to take land into trust once title has passed to the United States. The Quiet Title Act authorizes the federal courts \"to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest,\" but not with respect to \"trust or restricted Indian lands.\" In State of South Dakota v. U.S. Department of the Interior , a federal circuit court made such an assumption, prompting DOI to issue a regulation requiring a 30-day waiting period between the date of the Secretary's final determination to take land into trust and the actual trust acquisition. ", "In Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Quiet Title Act's preservation of sovereign immunity for quiet title actions involving Indian trust lands did not extend to suits in which the plaintiff is not seeking to claim title, that is, to take over the land. Moreover, the Court held that the Federal Administrative Procedure Act's judicial review provision permitted suits within its six-year statute of limitations period. The decision also includes a broad interpretation of who may maintain standing under the main statute under which land is taken into trust, 25 U.S.C. Section 465, refusing to accept the arguments of DOI and the Indian tribe that standing should be limited to those, such as state and local governments who might lose tax revenues or nearby Indian tribes who might have competing claims to the land, who would be directly affected by the land acquisition. Instead, the Court determined that a plaintiff who owns nearby property and asserts that the planned use of the land as a gaming casino will harm his enjoyment of his property satisfies the standing requirements, placing his interests \"at least arguably ... 'within the zone ... protected or regulated by [25 U.S.C.\u00a7465].''' ", "In response to the decision, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) revised its Land Acquisition regulations, 25 C.F.R., Part 151, to eliminate the 30-day waiting period and specify how parties seeking judicial review of land-into-trust decisions may discern when final agency action occurs for the two kinds of decisions possible for land-into-trust applications. Decisions by the SOI or the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs (AS-IA) are final agency actions. When the SOI or the AS-IA issues a decision to take land into trust, the DOI must publish a notice of the decision \"promptly\" in the Federal Register and take the land into trust \"[i]immediately.\" In contrast, land-into-trust decisions by Bureau of Indian Affairs officials (BIA-level decisions) are not final agency action and do not require Federal Register notice. They require notice in \"a newspaper of general circulation serving the affected area of the decision\" as well as notice to state and local officials with \"regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired\" and to \"interested parties who have made themselves known, in writing, to the official prior to the decision.\" Land may not be taken into trust pursuant to BIA-level decisions \"until administrative remedies are exhausted ... or ... the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired and no administrative appeal has been filed.\" Once a BIA-level decision has become final, the land is to be acquired in trust \"[i]mmediately.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California: Challenge to Validity of Trust Acquisition for a Tribe Not Recognized in 1934 Is Not Subject to Collateral Attack Decades Later", "paragraphs": ["In a June 4, 2015, en banc decision, in Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a claim that land taken into trust for a tribe not recognized in 1934 may not be raised decades after the trust acquisition in a collateral attack on the trust acquisition. Instead, according to the decision, a challenge to the validity of a trust acquisition must be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and is, therefore, subject to a six-year statute of limitations. ", "The en banc court overturned an earlier opinion issued by a divided three-judge panel. The case involves a tract of land taken into trust in 1994 for the Big Lagoon Rancheria of California (Big Lagoon). Big Lagoon first appeared on the list of \"Indian Tribal Entities That Have a Government-to-Government Relationship With the United States\" in 1979. The dispute with California was precipitated by a breakdown in negotiations for a tribal-state gaming compact under IGRA when California objected to the site preferred by the Big Lagoon for its gaming operation. On the basis of the Supreme Court's Carcier i v. Salazar decision, the state claimed that the site had not been validly taken into trust because the tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction in 1934. It, therefore, asserted that the state was under no obligation to negotiate in good faith for tribal gaming on a tract of trust land that did not meet IGRA's definition of \"Indian lands,\" and, thus, was not eligible for IGRA gaming. ", "A majority of the Ninth Circuit three-judge panel agreed with California. It found that \"[t]here was no family or other group on what is now the Big Lagoon Rancheria in 1934\"; that Big Lagoon was not a tribe under federal jurisdiction in 1934; and, therefore, that the DOI had no authority under the IRA to take land into trust for Big Lagoon. According to the majority, Big Lagoon could not rely on the DOI's action in taking the particular land into trust to assert tribal jurisdiction over it for IGRA purposes. A dissenting opinion argued that the APA, which has a six-year statute of limitations, was the only avenue to challenge a land-into-trust decision. The majority, however, rejected this argument, and ruled that the APA covered only challenges involving procedural violations. Quoting from an earlier case, the court reasoned that \"'[t]he government should not be permitted to avoid all challenges to its action, even if ultra vires , simply because the agency took the action long before anyone discovered the true state of affairs.'\" It, therefore, held that the land was not \"Indian lands\" for IGRA purposes. According to the court, California could contest the validity of the trust acquisition as a defense to a claim that it was not negotiating in good faith because, with respect to \"contests [of] the substance of an agency decision as exceeding constitutional or statutory authority,\" a \"challenger may ... [raise such a challenge] later than six years following the decision by filing a complaint for review of the adverse application of the decision to the particular challenger.\"", "The en banc court rejected this approach. It quoted the statement by the Supreme Court in Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, that \"a challenge to the BIA's 'decision to take land into trust' is 'a garden-variety APA claim.'\" It contrasted the Big Lagoon fact situation\u2014\"a belated collateral attack\"\u2014from the timely challenge to a SOI decision to take land into trust that was at issue in Carcieri. Citing various Ninth Circuit precedents, the court stated that:", "[a]llowing California to attack collaterally the BIA's decision to take the eleven-acre parcel into trust outside the APA would constitute just the sort of end-run that we have previously refused to allow, and would cast a cloud of doubt over countless acres of land that have been taken into trust for tribes recognized by the Federal government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Secretarial Two-Part Determination Exception to IGRA's Prohibition of Gaming on Lands Acquired in Trust After Enactment of IGRA", "paragraphs": ["Lands acquired in trust after IGRA's enactment are generally not eligible for gaming if they are outside of and not contiguous to the boundaries of a tribe's reservation.

According to his analysis, the Guidance established a virtually inflexible approach that assumes that a distant casino will have a deleterious effect on tribal life. His final conclusion was that the existing regulation governing gaming on after-acquired lands provides \"comprehensive and rigorous standards that set forth the Department's authority and duties when considering applications for off-reservation gaming.... [and] adequately provide standards for evaluating such acquisitions....\" He characterized the regulation as offering \"strict and transparent standards for evaluating tribal applications to conduct off-reservation gaming.\" With respect to the general land acquisition regulation under 25 C.F.R., Part 151, the conclusion was that the Guidance was unnecessary and that it might \"unnecessarily constrain the Department's decision making process.\" Under the regulation, according to Assistant Secretary Echo Hawk's memorandum, the Secretary must weigh the impact of the trust acquisition on specified aspects of state and local jurisdiction in a manner that considers all the factors in the regulation, and, unlike the Guidance, the regulation does not mandate disapproval of an application on a single issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enacted and Proposed Legislation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Several bills proposed in the 111 th Congress providing federal recognition or authorizing the placement of land into federal trust status contained provisions aimed at precluding gaming.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Proposed Bills Addressing the Process", "paragraphs": ["S. 477 , the Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act, would have required tribes to satisfy new standards before newly acquired lands could be found to be eligible for IGRA gaming. It would have applied to three of the exceptions to IGRA's general prohibition of gaming on lands acquired after IGRA's enactment: land claim settlement, initial reservation for a newly acknowledged tribe, or restoration of lands for a newly restored tribe. Under this bill, for a tribe to rely on one of these exceptions for gaming on newly acquired trust land, before the land is taken into trust, the tribe must have \"received a written determination from the Secretary that the land is eligible for gaming\" that included findings that the tribe has \"a substantial, direct, modern connection to the land\" and \"a substantial, direct, aboriginal connection to the land.\"", "Under the bill, for a tribe with a reservation to establish a modern connection to the land, the tribe would be required to show both geographic and temporal connections to the land. The land would need to be within a 25-mile radius of either the tribal headquarters (for tribes with a reservation) or the residence of \"a significant number\" of tribal members (for tribes without a reservation). A tribe which has a reservation would have to show both modern and aboriginal connections to the land and wait five years after restoration or recognition to be eligible for one of these exceptions. A tribe without a reservation would need to show modern and aboriginal connections to the land, and (1) the land must be part of its first request for newly acquired land after being recognized or restored; (2) the application to take the land into trust would need to be received by the Secretary within five years of recognition or restoration; and (3) the tribe may not be conducting gaming on any other land. The modern connection to the land requirement means that any tribe seeking one of these exemptions would have to demonstrate \"a temporal connection to, or routine presence on, the land\" during the period from October 17, 1988, to the date of the Secretary's determination. To determine whether a tribe satisfies the requirement for an aboriginal connection to the land, the proposed legislation contains a list of factors which the Secretary may consider, including historical presence on the land; lineal descent or cultural affiliation of members based on 43 C.F.R. Section 10.14; whether the land is in an area where the tribe's language has been used; whether the land is near tribal \"culturally significant sites\"; whether the tribe was officially removed from the land; and other factors showing tribal presence on the land antedating the presence of \"nonnative individuals, the Federal Government, or any other sovereign entity.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Proposed Bills", "paragraphs": ["Other bills not enacted would have provided for federal recognition of tribal status or taking land into trust for a tribe along with explicit provisions relating to gaming.
