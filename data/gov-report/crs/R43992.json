The CRA was included as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), which was signed into law on March 29, 1996. The CRA requires agencies to report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provides Congress with a special set of procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules.", "Under the CRA, before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit a report to each house of Congress and the Comptroller General containing a copy of the rule; a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule. Upon receipt of the report in Congress, Members of Congress have specified time periods in which to submit and take action on a joint resolution of disapproval. If both houses pass the resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. If the President were to veto the resolution, Congress could vote to override the veto.", "If a joint resolution of disapproval is submitted within the CRA-specified deadline, passed by Congress, and signed by the President, the CRA states that the \"rule shall not take effect (or continue).\" That is, the rule would be deemed not to have had any effect at any time. Even provisions that had become effective would be retroactively negated.", "Furthermore, if a joint resolution of disapproval were enacted, the CRA provides that a rule may not be issued in \"substantially the same form\" as the disapproved rule unless it is specifically authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA does not define what would constitute a rule that is \"substantially the same\" as a nullified rule. Additionally, the CRA prohibits judicial review of any \"determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter.\"", "This report discusses the most frequently asked questions received by the Congressional Research Service about the CRA. It addresses questions relating to the applicability of the act; the submission requirements with which agencies must comply; the procedural requirements that must be met in order to file and act upon a CRA joint resolution of disapproval; and the legal effect of a successful CRA joint resolution of disapproval. This report also discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of using the CRA to disapprove rules, as well as other options available to Congress to conduct oversight of agency rulemaking.", "For further questions not addressed here, please contact one of the authors: [author name scrubbed] (questions regarding history of and agency compliance with the CRA); [author name scrubbed] (questions regarding congressional procedures and day counts under the CRA); or [author name scrubbed] (questions regarding legal issues under the CRA)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Congressional Review Act (CRA)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is the CRA?", "paragraphs": ["The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is an oversight tool that Congress may use to overturn a rule issued by a federal agency. When Congress passes a law, it often grants rulemaking authority to federal agencies to implement provisions in the law. That delegation of rulemaking authority, and the rules issued by federal agencies under this authority, is a crucial component of the policy process. Congress has an interest in ensuring that, when issuing rules, federal agencies are faithful to congressional intent. To conduct proper oversight of federal agency actions, Congress has a number of tools available, including the CRA.

Supporters cite two main advantages to these procedures over the regular legislative process. First, when a joint resolution of disapproval meets certain criteria, it cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Specifically, once 20 calendar days have passed after the receipt and publication of the final rule, the Senate committee to which a joint resolution disapproving the rule has been referred can be discharged of further consideration if 30 Senators sign and file a petition. Once the committee is discharged, any Senator can make a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the disapproval resolution. Should the Senate choose to consider the disapproval resolution, debate on it is limited and a final vote would be all but guaranteed. ", "The second advantage of the CRA process often cited by its supporters is that if a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, it not only invalidates the rule in question, but in most cases also bars the agency from issuing another rule in \"substantially the same form\" as the disapproved rule unless authorized to do so in a subsequent law. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Failure of a CRA Joint Resolution of Disapproval Could Make a Major Rule Take Effect Faster than Otherwise Allowed Under the CRA", "paragraphs": ["In the case of some major rules, use of the CRA mechanism may make the rule go into effect more quickly than it otherwise would. Under the requirements of the CRA, agencies must delay the effective date of major rules by at least 60 days. This is essentially an extension of the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) requirement that agencies delay the effective date of rules by at least 30 days. Should either chamber choose to consider a joint resolution disapproving a major rule and then vote to reject it, the rule in question may go into force immediately, notwithstanding any layover period in its effective date established by the CRA. No rule may go into effect, however, until the effective date set by the agency in the rule itself has been reached. This provision of the CRA could be viewed as an advantage for Members who support a particular major rule and want it to take effect as soon as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The CRA provides Congress with a method of conducting oversight of agency rulemaking. Not only can Congress use the CRA to overturn agency rules, but certain provisions of the CRA may help to increase congressional awareness of federal agency actions in general. The requirement for agencies to submit their rules to Congress, and the subsequent referral of each rule to the committee of jurisdiction, functions as a notification mechanism through which committees and Members can be made aware of rulemaking activity in which they may be interested. Although Members are likely to become aware of high-profile rules that are of broad interest and receive national media attention, the referral of each rule upon receipt in Congress provides an additional notification for rules that may be of a more localized or specialized interest to Members. ", "In addition, the threat of submission or passage of a disapproval resolution may provide a mechanism through which a Member can pressure an agency for a particular outcome, either on that particular rule or on another matter. On the other hand, however, the single successful use of the CRA to overturn an agency rule in 2001 (discussed in more detail below) suggests that agencies may not consider use of the CRA to be a credible threat, and Members of Congress may be best served by exploring other options to influence agency actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Oversight of Independent Regulatory Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As discussed more below (see \" Presidential Veto/De Facto Supermajority Requirement \"), the biggest obstacle to enactment of a CRA resolution is generally considered to be the likelihood that a President would veto a joint resolution disapproving a rule issued by his own Administration. It might be expected, however, that Presidents are more likely to sign a resolution disapproving a rule that has been issued by an independent regulatory agency, a type of agency over which the President has less control. ", "Congress created a number of federal agencies with certain characteristics to make them independent from the President, and, in some cases, from Congress itself. Those agencies are generally referred to as independent regulatory agencies or independent regulatory commissions. The President has limited ability to remove officials from those agencies, for example, and those agencies' budget requests may be submitted directly to Congress without modification by the President. In addition, some agencies may receive their funding outside the annual appropriations process. ", "Most notably for rulemaking purposes, the independent regulatory agencies do not submit their regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review, unlike executive agencies such as Cabinet departments. Therefore, the independent regulatory agencies' regulations are considered to be more removed from presidential control than executive agencies', because the President\u2014through OMB\u2014does not have a direct influence over the content of their rules. As such, the rules issued by those agencies are more likely to be incongruent with the President's policy preferences, so that he may be more likely to sign a resolution disapproving such a rule. As one scholar states, \"while still not representing much of a change from the Article I legislative process, the CRA may provide some real power in the case of political review of rulemaking by independent agencies.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drawing Attention to a Rule", "paragraphs": ["Another potential advantage of the CRA is that it provides a method for Members of Congress to draw attention to a particular rule or to make clear their position on a rule. The required language of a joint resolution of disapproval, which is stipulated in the CRA, provides for a relatively straightforward process through which a Member can make clear his or her opposition to a rule. In addition, the expedited procedures by which a resolution may reach the Senate floor provide an opportunity for a minority of the Senate to obtain floor consideration. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Transparency of Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["Another benefit of the CRA, for Members of Congress as well as for the public, is that it has increased opportunities for transparency in the federal rulemaking process, primarily through a database compiled by GAO. Since the CRA's enactment, GAO has posted the rules agencies submit to GAO under the CRA to a database on its website that is publicly available. The website can be used to search for final rules that have been published by agencies, by elements such as the title, issuing agency, date of publication, type of rule (major or non-major), and effective date. The website also contains GAO's reports on major rules that are required under the CRA and discussed more below.

Second, the CRA does not establish any \"fast track\" procedures for initial consideration of a disapproval resolution in the House of Representatives. As a result, unless the House majority party is willing to schedule the measure for consideration, it in all likelihood will not be considered. Third, unlike the regular legislative process, the CRA disapproval mechanism is available in the Senate only during certain specific time periods. Fourth, calculating the periods established by the CRA for submitting and acting on a disapproval resolution can be difficult, especially in cases where the act provides for additional submission and action periods in a subsequent session of Congress. Fifth, unlike regular legislation, each CRA disapproval resolution can only be aimed at a single agency final rule in its entirety; multiple disapproval resolutions cannot be \"bundled\" together and still maintain their privileged parliamentary status. Finally, as is noted above, if either chamber rejects a CRA disapproval resolution on a major rule, it could have the effect of putting a regulation in force sooner than would otherwise be the case. This provision of the CRA could be viewed as a disadvantage for Members who oppose a particular major rule and would prefer as long of a period as possible to elapse before the rule becomes effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disapproval of an Entire Rule", "paragraphs": ["Unlike under the regular legislative process, the CRA can only be used to invalidate an agency final rule in its entirety; it cannot be used to modify or restructure a rule in order to make it acceptable to Congress. ", "If Congress were to use the regular legislative process instead of the CRA, Congress could invalidate part of a rule or instruct the agency to amend or repeal part of a rule. However, regular legislation would not be eligible for the same expedited procedures in the Senate in the same way a CRA resolution would. It would not be assured of the opportunity for floor consideration and might be subject to filibuster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Presidential Veto/De Facto Supermajority Requirement", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most widely cited reason why the CRA has been used to overturn only one rule is that a President is generally expected to veto a joint resolution of disapproval attempting to overturn a rule proposed by his own Administration. A joint resolution of disapproval requires the signature of the President to become law\u2014a very unlikely prospect if his own Administration issued the rule. If the President were to veto the measure, Congress could attempt to override the veto. A two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress is required to override a President's veto; this creates a de facto supermajority requirement for a CRA joint resolution to be enacted. ", "During a transition following the inauguration of a new President, however, the CRA is more likely to be used successfully. Because of the structure of the periods during which Congress can take action under the CRA, there may be a period at the beginning of each new Administration during which rules issued near the end of the previous Administration would be eligible for consideration under the CRA. The one instance in which the CRA was used to overturn a rule took place during such a period\u2014the resolution was enacted in the early days of the George W.

Additionally, a proposed rule has no \"future effect,\" because a rule subject to a notice of proposed rulemaking may not go into effect until comments are received and considered by the agency and a final rule is published in the Federal Register .

", "Executive agencies, excluding independent regulatory agencies, are required to submit \"significant regulatory actions\" to OIRA for its review, in accordance with Executive Order 12866. As part of that review process, agencies and OIRA make a determination as to whether a rule is \"economically significant\" as defined under Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. The definitions for \"economically significant\" rule and major rule are not identical, but they are very similar. In most cases, a rule determined to be \"economically significant\" under the executive order will also be major under the CRA, and vice versa. ", "Independent regulatory agencies do not submit their rules to OIRA for review under Executive Order 12866. However, OIRA is still tasked with determining whether an independent regulatory agency's rule is major. Accordingly, it is not clear whether and how rules issued by the independent regulatory agencies should be designated as major under the CRA. Sally Katzen, who was the OIRA Administrator when the CRA was enacted, stated in testimony to Congress that,", "Because OIRA does not review the regulations issued by the independent regulatory agencies under Executive Order 12866, we had to design a process for us to determine whether the final rule of an independent regulatory agency is \"major\" within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, we invited regulatory contacts from the independent regulatory agencies... to a meeting on April 12, 1996, to discuss my April 2 memorandum [on the CRA] and how they could best coordinate with us on our determination of \"major.\" After this meeting, the independent regulatory agencies began sending OIRA summaries of their upcoming final regulations for us to decide whether or not these rules were \"major.\" Initially, there was a flurry of staff discussions; this process for the \"independents\" has now become routine. ", "More recent accounts suggest, however, that at least some of the independent regulatory agencies no longer appear to be acknowledging a role for OIRA in the determination of rules as major. Rather, these agencies appear to be making the determination themselves.

This automatic \"hookup\" provision guarantees that both chambers are acting on the same joint resolution, and as such, it can be sent directly to the President following second-chamber passage. The mechanism also ensures that there will be no need to resolve legislative differences between the chambers even in cases where the House and Senate disapproval resolutions have slightly different texts.

If the new session is the second session of the same Congress, a disapproval resolution submitted in the first session remains available for expedited action in the Senate during its new action period of 60 days of session.

Since the CRA does not define \"substantially the same,\" sameness could be determined by scope, penalty level, textual similarity, or administrative policy, among other factors. For example, if Congress objected to a specific section of language in a rule that was ultimately disapproved, would a rule that only removed that language be considered \"substantially the same\" as the original? If the agency reissued a rule in which it changed one standard listed in the original regulation, would that be substantially similar? If it changed the number of categories to which a standard applied would the rule still be \"substantially the same\"? These questions, for which no definitive answer is available, highlight the ambiguity in the meaning of \"substantially the same.\"", "The statute is also silent on the question of who would make the determination as to whether an amended rule or new rule is \"substantially the same\" as a disapproved rule. It appears that Congress could take action if it determined that a reissued or new rule was substantially the same as a disapproved rule, given that any reissued or new rule would also be subject to the CRA. Given that the statute precludes judicial review of any \"determination, finding, action, or omission\" under the CRA, one could argue that evaluating whether the \"substantially the same\" prohibition has been violated may be a matter for Congress alone to decide.

As explained above (see \" What Happens When a Rule Is Designated as Major? \"), the CRA extends that required period for major rules, providing that major rules \"shall take effect on the latest of\" three dates: ", "60 days after the date that the rule is published in the Federal Register or submitted to Congress, whichever is later; if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval and the President vetoes it, the date on which either house of Congress votes and fails to override the veto or 30 session days after the date Congress received the veto, whichever is earlier; or the date the rule would have otherwise taken effect, unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted.

One court, a federal district court, has reached the contrary conclusion, ruling that it could review a claim based on noncompliance with the CRA. ", "In the first case to consider the CRA's judicial review provision, a federal district court in Texas Savings & Community Bankers Association v. Federal Housing Finance Board rejected the plaintiff's argument that \"\u00a7 805 only forecloses review of any 'determination, finding, action, or omission' by Congress.\" Instead, it concluded that the \"[c]ourt must follow the plain English\" of the statute, which barred review of actions \"' under this chapter ' not ' by Congress under this chapter .'\" In the court's words, \"the language could not be plainer\" and the alleged failure to comply with the CRA \"is not subject to review by this [c]ourt.\" The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Montanans for Multiple Use v. Barbouletos , confronted a similar assertion that an agency action should be invalidated because of the agency's failure to comply with the submission requirements in the CRA. The court ruled that the CRA judicial review provision \"denies courts the power to void rules on the basis of agency noncompliance with the [CRA].\" Therefore, \"the language in \u00a7 805 is unequivocal and precludes review of this claim ... \"", "It appears that only one court, a federal district court in Indiana, has ruled that the Section 805 language is ambiguous and may allow a court to adjudicate claims arising from the CRA. In United States v. Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company , the court concluded that the statute could be reasonably interpreted two ways. First, the statute could prohibit any judicial review of an agency's compliance with the CRA. This interpretation was adopted in the cases discussed above. Second, the statute could \"preclude judicial review of Congress' own determinations, findings, actions, or omissions made under the CRA after a rule has been submitted to it for review.\" Under this interpretation, the bar on judicial review would not extend to claims challenging an agency's action, such as whether an agency should have submitted a rule to Congress under the CRA. Ultimately, the court rejected the first interpretation because it would allow agencies to \"evade the strictures of the CRA by simply not reporting new rules,\" which it argued was at odds with the statute's purpose to prevent agencies from \"essentially legislating without Congressional oversight.\" It adopted the second interpretation and concluded \"that it has jurisdiction to review whether an agency rule is in effect that should have been reported to Congress pursuant to the CRA.\" This conclusion appears to be a minority view among the federal courts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Questions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Other Tools Are Available To Congress for Conducting Oversight of Federal Regulations?", "paragraphs": ["Although the CRA offers a number of advantages to Congress, as discussed above, Congress also has a number of other tools available to conduct oversight of federal agency rulemaking. These tools include general legislative powers, oversight hearings, meetings with agency officials, and appropriations language. Each of these is briefly discussed below. ", "Every rule issued by a federal agency must be based upon a grant of authority given to that agency by Congress in statute, and it is Congress's prerogative to ensure that agencies issue rules in a manner consistent with congressional intent. As such, Congress can use its legislative power to oversee the issuance and implementation of rules, or even require that an agency repeal a rule. For example, Congress can make a change to the underlying statute authorizing a rule or enact legislation that simply overrides the rule. Such a change could remove or change the agency's authority to issue the rule, or it could prescribe more specifically in law what the rule should contain. The advantage of using the CRA is that the procedures it provides for, particularly in the Senate, can make it easier to pass a joint resolution of disapproval than to pass a regular bill. However, as discussed in detail below, Members must submit and act on a CRA resolution within a particular time period following issuance of a rule, whereas Congress can use its general legislative power to act on a rule at any time.", "Hearings are another method of conducting oversight of federal rules. Congressional committees can hold oversight hearings at any time that focus on the development or implementation of a particular rule or set of rules that fall under their jurisdiction. Oversight hearings can give Members a chance to ask agency officials questions about rules and communicate their views to agency officials. ", "A Member of Congress also can request a meeting with the rulemaking agency while a rule is under development to communicate his or her views to the agency. In addition, a Member can request to meet with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the entity within OMB that reviews most agency regulations prior to their publication. Such meetings are sometimes referred to as \"12866 meetings,\" a reference to Executive Order 12866, which governs OIRA review of agency rulemaking. During the review process, OIRA can play a significant role in the content of a proposed or final rule. Therefore, Members may want to make their views known to OIRA while the rule is under review.", "Finally, Congress has frequently used appropriations legislation to restrict an agency's use of funds to promulgate or implement particular regulations. However, unlike CRA joint resolutions of disapproval, provisions of this type do not nullify an existing regulation, nor do they remove the agency's underlying statutory authority to issue a regulation. Therefore, any final rule that has taken effect will continue to be binding law\u2014even if an appropriations restriction prohibits the agency from using funds to enforce the rule. In addition, restrictions on the use of funds in appropriations acts, unless otherwise specified, are binding only for the period of time covered by the measure (i.e., a fiscal year or a portion of a fiscal year). In these instances, any restriction that is not repeated in the next relevant appropriations act or enacted as part of another measure no longer binds the relevant agency or agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Has Legislation Been Proposed to Amend the CRA?", "paragraphs": ["The Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act ( H.R. 427 and S. 226 in the 114 th Congress) is one legislative proposal that would amend the CRA. The REINS Act would keep the current requirements of the CRA in place for non-major rules, but for any rule deemed to be major, it would require Congress to vote to approve the rule before it can take effect. As is currently the case under the CRA for a resolution of disapproval, the REINS Act provides a certain set of procedures under which a resolution of approval would be considered in each chamber. Earlier versions of the REINS Act passed the House in the 113 th and the 112 th Congresses ( H.R. 367 and H.R. 10 , respectively).

Currently, as described above, Congress can overturn a single final rule through enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval\u2014a disapproval resolution cannot be used to overturn more than one rule. In addition, if a rule is submitted late enough in a session of Congress, there may be additional time periods for consideration available in the next session.
