Should the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) grant the petition, it will preside over a trial-like proceeding before a panel with at least three members. These procedures include the use of witnesses, the opportunity for limited discovery, and an oral hearing prior to a decision on the merits. IPRs must ordinarily be completed within one year and may result in patent claims being upheld, invalidated, or confirmed as amended.", "IPR proceedings are arguably the most impactful of the numerous reforms made by the AIA. To many, their unexpected popularity suggests that Congress met its objectives in providing an expedient and cost-effective means for challenging patents that the USPTO erroneously issued. These proceedings potentially harness the technical expertise of the USPTO, improve patent quality, are less costly than litigation in the district courts, and can confirm the validity of patents that meet the statutory standards.", "Others are critical of these proceedings. Many members of the patent community view IPRs as being biased against patent owners and believe that they have significantly eroded the confidence of innovative industry in the U.S. patent system. They observe that most patents involved in IPRs are also subject to litigation in the federal courts, a development that increases the expense and complexity of patent enforcement. They also believe that the prompt pace of these proceedings, as well as the possibility of multiple IPR petitions being filed against a single patent, may challenge patent owners.", "Stakeholders have considered numerous possible reforms to the structure of IPR proceedings. In the 115th Congress, the STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 (S. 1390) would require the PTAB to give claim terms their ordinary meaning, in contrast to the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" in keeping with USPTO rules. S. 1390 would also require that patent challengers prove invalidity by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, in contrast to the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard that currently applies. And the bill would limit use of IPR proceedings to individuals and enterprises with a demonstrated adverse relationship to the challenged patent. S. 1390 was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary on June 21, 2017.", "Other aspects of IPR law and practice remain topics of debate. Some stakeholders assert that even though the AIA provides patent proprietors with the opportunity to amend their claims during an IPR, the PTAB rarely allows them to do so. Others observe that the PTAB often initiates IPRs on a smaller number of claims than are challenged. They believe that such a \"partial initiation\" can create confusion about claims that were not considered by the PTAB. Some commentators express concern that the increased number of appeals from the USPTO to the Federal Circuit may be frustrating the congressional goal of providing the court with a well-rounded caseload.

The Patent Act also requires that applicants draft at least one claim that particularly points out and distinctly claims the subject matter that they regard as their invention. The patent acquisition process is commonly known as \"prosecution.\"", "While reviewing a submitted application, the examiner will determine whether the claimed invention fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute. Two of the most important patentability criteria are novelty and nonobviousness. To be judged novel, the claimed invention must not be fully anticipated by a prior patent, publication, or other knowledge within the public domain. The sum of these earlier materials is termed the \"prior art.\" To meet the standard of nonobviousness, an invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan based upon the teachings of the prior art.", "If the USPTO allows the application to issue as a granted patent, the owner or owners of the patent obtain the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States the claimed invention. The term of the patent is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. Patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions, or license others to do so. The grant of a patent permits inventors to receive a return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery, often by charging a higher price than would prevail in a competitive market.

A request for a PGR must be filed within nine months of the date of patent grant. To initiate a PGR, the petitioner must present information that, if not rebutted, would demonstrate that more likely than not at least one of the claims is unpatentable. The USPTO charges $12,000 to consider a request for a PGR and another $18,000 if the procedure is initiated, with additional fees if a large number of claims are challenged.

The patent proprietor may move to amend the patent during the proceedings. A PGR must be completed within one year of its commencement, with an extension of six months possible for good cause shown. As well, the individual who commenced the proceeding, along with entities related to him, are barred in the future from raising issues that were \"raised or reasonably could have been raised\" during the PGR.", "IPRs operate similarly, but apply to all granted patents regardless of their filing date.

In broad outline, any person who is not the patent owner may file a petition requesting an IPR at least nine months after a patent issues or reissues, or the conclusion of any post-grant review, whichever occurs later. In contrast to a PGR, the basis for requesting an IPR is restricted to patents or printed publications.

The USPTO charges $9,000 to consider a request for an IPR and another $14,000 if the procedure is initiated, with additional fees if a large number of claims are challenged.

In addition, the petitioner and the patent proprietor may terminate these proceedings through settlement.", "When establishing PGRs and IPRs, Congress was aware that patents subject to these USPTO proceedings may also be the subject of litigation in federal court. The AIA therefore establishes rules that limit the ability of petitioners to request a PGR and IPR, and also call for stays of litigation in particular circumstances. With respect to PGRs, these proceedings may not be instituted if the petitioner previously commenced litigation challenging the validity of the patent. If the petitioner commences litigation challenging the validity of a patent after he files a PGR petition, that lawsuit is automatically stayed until either the patent owner moves the court to lift the stay, the patent owner asserts that the petitioner infringed the patent, or the petitioner moves the court to dismiss the case.

On the other hand, during patent acquisition, the USPTO accords claim terms their \"broadest reasonable interpretation.\" The agency does so, at least in part, because patent applicants may amend their claims during prosecution in order to achieve more precision and to eliminate ambiguities. In contrast, claims in issued patents may not be amended during litigation in the federal courts.", "The AIA did not specify which standard should apply during IPR proceedings. Pursuant to authority granted by the AIA, however, the USPTO promulgated a regulation stating that a \"claim in an unexpired patent shall be given its broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears.\" ", "In its 2016 decision in Cu ozz o Speed Technologies v. Lee , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the USPTO's decision to adopt the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standards in IPRs.

The Court acknowledged that under this bifurcated system, the courts and the USPTO could reach different constructions of the same claim term\u2014and hence reach different conclusions as to the validity of the claim. However, the Court recognized that this possibility had long been the case and reasoned that the agency had rationally employed its rulemaking authority.", "In the 115 th Congress, the STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 would require the PTAB, in IPR and PGR proceedings, to use the same claim construction standard as the federal courts\u2014that is to say, a construction in accordance with \"the ordinary and customary meaning of such claim as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.\" This legislation would also require the PTAB to consider a prior claim construction by a court in a civil action in which the patent owner was a party.", "Most observers agree that the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard makes invalidation of patents easier in the AIA-established administrative review proceedings than in the federal courts. Former USPTO Director David Kappos has observed that currently, \"the speed mandated for post-grant procedures is leading to greater interaction between court interpretations and USPTO interpretations of the same patent claims, and having the USPTO apply a different standard than the courts [for claim construction] is leading, and will continue to lead, to conflicting decisions.\" However, he notes that there are valid arguments for retaining the broader standard for post-grant proceedings, such as that the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard \"requires patentees to define their claims clearly over the prior art during proceedings\" before the USPTO.", "However, some groups oppose the inclusion of these changes to the IPR/PGR claim construction standard in the patent litigation reform bills, arguing that they \"will undermine post grant review procedures that have proven to be an effective and useful tool in weeding out the weak patents that are often asserted in the most abusive of patent cases.\" Technology companies have explained their opposition to the IPR/PGR amendments as follows:", "[T]he changes to the claim construction standard in IPR proceedings ... would eliminate a necessary and significant difference between the court system and USPTO standards for claim construction.

This concept is known as the \"standing\" doctrine.", "The \"case or controversy\" requirement significantly limits the ability of members of the public to challenge the USPTO's decision to grant a patent. Unless the patent proprietor becomes involved in an actual, continuing controversy with another person, that person cannot successfully request that a court determine whether the patent is valid or not. Reticent patent proprietors may therefore potentially create uncertainty in the marketplace. Manufacturers, researchers, investors, and others who question the validity of a patent, but possess no forum to address their concerns, may be unable to make informed decisions regarding the subject matter of that patent. Administrative review proceedings address this perceived gap by allowing any interested person to challenge any U.S. patent at the USPTO. Because IPRs and PGRs are administrative in nature, the constitutional \"case or controversy\" requirement does not apply to them.", "Some commentators believe that the absence of a standing requirement for IPRs and PGRs should be reconsidered.

Even after completing an IPR, a petitioner may still need to address claims that were challenged but not subject to the proceeding. As well, when some claims of a patent are challenged and invalidated via an IPR, but other similar claims were entirely unaddressed, there are concerns that the patent's owner may hold a legal instrument of dubious value. The cloud on that patent's title may make licensing or enforcement of the remaining claims uncertain. Another concern of some is that piecemeal institution decision may also not serve the congressional purpose of establishing an administrative substitute for litigation.", "On the other hand, the AIA charges the PTAB with administering IPRs within a one-year period.

This legislation established specialized pharmaceutical patent infringement litigation procedures between companies producing generic drugs and those producing brand-name drugs. In very broad outline, these procedures include the identification of relevant patents to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), publication of the patents in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the \"Orange Book\"), the opportunity for generic drug companies to state their views about the validity and scope of those patents, the ability of brand-name firms to sue generics that have done so, and an obligatory 30-month stay of marketing approval for the generic firm should the brand-name company do so.", "Another statute, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), established a distinct but equally elaborate patent dispute resolution procedure for \"biologics\"\u2014a category of medical preparations derived from a living organism.

Because IPR challenges arise outside these carefully designed legal regimes, they threaten to disrupt the delicate balance that has served patients so well.", "On the other hand, membership of the United States in the World Trade Organization (WTO) includes the obligation to ensure that \"patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the ... field of technology.... \" Exempting medical patents from IPR and related procedures may be deemed to violate this commitment.", "Commentators have also encouraged the consideration of IPRs as a possible forfeiture event with respect to the regulatory exclusivity period associated with generic drugs. As originally enacted, the Hatch-Waxman Act provided prospective manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals with a reward for challenging patents associated with a brand-name product. That reward, granted to the first generic firm to challenge a patent, consists of a 180-day exclusivity period that prevents other generic firms from entering the market.

Commentators have suggested that Congress should consider how IPRs should interact with the forfeiture events identified in the MMA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Patents derive their value from the rights they confer to exploit proprietary technologies. The increased focus on intellectual property in our information-based, knowledge-driven economy has arguably caused industry to raise its expectations with respect to the quality, timeliness, and efficiency of the granting of patents. As the USPTO currently employs approximately 8,000 patent examiners with varying degrees of experience, legal training, and technical education, maintaining consistency in patent grant determinations presents a challenging task for USPTO management.", "By recruiting members of the public to act as \"private patent examiners,\" post-grant proceedings allow the USPTO to confirm its earlier determinations regarding that subset of patents that prove to be of marketplace significance. In this respect, it should be noted that the validity of only a relatively small subset of issued patents is ever called into question. For example, one commentator estimated that about 5% of issued patents are litigated or licensed. Post-grant proceedings may therefore direct the attention of the USPTO to those patents that industry believes to be of particular significance and arguable validity.", "In addition, an administrative process for reassessing patentability determinations in a reliable, cost-effective, and timely manner could potentially allow members of the public to make commercial decisions with more certainty over the impact of patent rights. Reduction of litigation costs could also channel resources that innovative firms currently spend on defending their patent rights in the courts into further research and development.", "The perception of a high percentage of invalidity rulings at the PTAB may be due in part to the fact that, over the past decade, the Supreme Court has revisited a number of the requirements for patenting and made them more difficult to satisfy. Patents granted under earlier, more lenient requirements remain subject to the new, more stringent standards and may therefore be invalid. This trend may also be due to petitioners, at the outset, pursuing \"low-hanging fruit\" \u2014that is to say, weak patents that have been asserted via licensing demands or litigation.", "Another reason for the perception of a high invalidation percentage is that \"petitioners are choosing which patents to challenge fairly well.\" Although IPRs are significantly less expensive than litigation, they remain a costly venture. The average cost for one party to participate in an IPR has been estimated at approximately $200,000. Indeed, the cost of challenging an issued patent from the USPTO is usually much greater than the cost of obtaining one in the first place. Further, the possible penalty of a loss\u2014being barred from challenging the validity of the claims in the future\u2014could prove consequential. Most petitioners may therefore be cautious and selective in choosing patents to challenge via an IPR.", "Commentators have also lauded the PTAB for its expertise and thoroughness. Each PTAB member is an experienced patent practitioner. Further, the USPTO attempts to have at least one Administrative Patent Judge on the panel with relevant technical expertise. In contrast, most federal district judges and jurors have not received a technical patent-related education and possess little, if any, experience in the patent law. As explained by one practitioner, if \"you read PTAB decisions in IPRs, you'll find that they're typically very thorough and well-reasoned, much better reasoned than district court opinions.\"", "On the other hand, critics of IPRs assert that \"Congress erected a heavily slanted administrative regime that invalidates patents by design, even when those same patents would be upheld by district court.\" These features reportedly include a more capacious claim construction, which renders patents more susceptible to a validity attack; a lower burden of proof upon the patent challenger than would be the case in district court litigation; and the absence of a jury and a \"disinterested, life-appointed judge.\" They also note that the one-year deadline for completing an IPR may render patent proprietors \"ill-prepared for the speed of the fight,\" in contrast to the challenger who may \"methodically prepare a petition and set up a strategy for the proceedings\" in advance.", "In addition, some patents have been subject to multiple, serial IPR petitions on different grounds of patent validity. Some patent owners have been subject to dozens of IPR petitions since 2012. This possibility, which increases the cost and length of participation, may be exacerbated because current law permits one individual to file multiple IPR petitions against a single patent.", "Statistics with respect to IPRs also suggest that most patents in these proceedings have been subject to contemporaneous litigation. In one recent study, three legal academics recently identified each of the 24,162 patent cases filed between September 16, 2011, and June 30, 2015. As they explain:", "During this time, a total of 14,218 patents were either challenged in an IPR or CBM petition, asserted in litigation, or both. A subset of 13,557 patents [was] involved in litigation alone; 298 patents were involved in a USPTO proceeding alone; and 1,968 patents were involved in both. Accordingly, about 12.7% of litigated patents are also being challenged in the PTAB, and about 86.8% of IPR- or CBM-challenged patents are also being litigated in the federal courts.", "These statistics suggest that \"PTAB-only cases are relatively rare.... \" One could infer from this account that rather than serving as a low-cost litigation substitute, IPRs now form an additional, parallel track that potentially increases the expense and complexity of patent enforcement.", "Other observers have discerned that the PTAB grants few motions to amend claims; indeed, some assert that despite \"the statutory approval of amending claims in IPRs, in reality, Patent Owners' ability to amend claims has been virtually nonexistent so far.\" The relatively tight statutory deadlines to complete an IPR, as well as an unexpected demand for these proceedings, have been cited as contributing to the PTAB's reluctance to allow amended claims in view of newly cited prior art. Congress intended IPRs to improve patent quality. But, for some, IPRs appear to do so by invalidating individual patents altogether, rather than by allowing inventors to obtain appropriate claim scope in view of the prior art on a case-by-case basis.", "Critics of IPRs further observe that, due to the absence of a standing requirement, anyone may file an IPR petition. According to some observers, experience \"from only the first few years of IPR proceedings shows that they are frequently utilized by larger competitors to weaken smaller, more innovative ones, as well as by vultures seeking to extract nuisance settlements.\" In addition, the \"absence of a discrete set of potential petitioners\" reportedly \"makes it difficult for inventors and potential investors to adjust their behavior to avoid a potential IPR, as they might do to avoid litigation.\"", "Some observers believe that the creation of IPRs has had a significant deleterious impact upon the innovation environment of the United States. For some, these proceedings can increase the cost and uncertainty associated with patent ownership, \"measurably diminishing their utility as a durable asset on which new businesses, new industries\u2014and indeed, the entire American economy\u2014all depend.\" Lack of predictability and stability of patent rights might also discourage the injection of venture capital into start-ups and high-technology products. IPRs may work especially to the detriment of individual inventors and small firms that lack the resources enjoyed by incumbents.", "Critics and supporters of IPRs alike tend to agree that these proceedings have emerged as the most prominent component of the entire AIA. Detractors assert that IPRs have had a negative impact upon the U.S. patent system and innovation environment, while proponents believe that they have largely met the congressional goal of developing an effective mechanism for challenging suspect patents. As Congress potentially revisits IPR reform proposals, five years of experience with these proceedings may prove helpful to policymakers weighing these competing views."], "subsections": []}]}}
