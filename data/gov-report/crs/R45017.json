Early efforts focused on flood control and flood damage reduction using engineered structures such as dams and levees. In the late 20 th century, the approach shifted to flood risk reduction and mitigation , which expanded the measures employed to include buyouts, easements, elevation of structures, evacuation, and other life-saving and damage-reducing actions. More recently, the concept of flood resilience has become more prominent. This evolution in part derives from efforts to address the different components that contribute to flood risk. Risks associated with floods and other natural disasters often are expressed as a probabilistic function of", "a hazard, which is the local threat of an event (e.g., probability of a particular community experiencing a storm surge of a specific height); vulnerability, which is the pathway that allows a hazard to cause consequences (e.g., level of protection and performance of shore-protection measures); and consequences of an event (e.g., loss of life, property damage, economic loss, environmental damage, and social disruption).", "For managing flood risks, some stakeholders promote policies to reduce the hazard (e.g., climate change mitigation to reduce sea level rise ). Some stakeholders are interested in reducing vulnerability. These stakeholders may support construction of levees, dams, and shore-protection measures; they also may support protection of natural features that provide flood management benefits, like coastal wetlands and natural dunes and undeveloped floodplains. Some stakeholders support policies to reduce consequences through measures such as development restrictions, building codes, floodproofing of structures, buyouts of vulnerable properties, and improved evacuation routes. Efforts to improve flood resilience often combine trying to reduce consequences, vulnerabilities, and in some cases hazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Flood-Related Activities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flood Control", "paragraphs": ["Although U.S. local, state, and territorial entities and tribes maintain significant flood management responsibilities, the federal role has expanded over the decades in response to catastrophic and regional flood events. Some of the earliest federal involvement was construction of specific flood control works after significant flood disasters. Examples include construction by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) of levees and floodways as part of the Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) project, which Congress authorized in 1928, and drainage structures of the Central and Southern Florida project in and around the Florida Everglades, which Congress authorized in 1948. Since the early 1900s, the federal government has constructed many dams, levees, and other water resource projects to reduce riverine flood damages. Starting in the mid-1950s, the federal government also has participated in many cost-shared coastal flood risk reduction projects consisting of engineered coastal dunes and beaches, floodwalls, storm surge barriers, and levees. Nonfederal entities (e.g., municipalities, irrigation districts, county flood control entities) also make their own investments in flood control infrastructure. Although local governments often preferred structural measures to control flooding (and for their other benefits like recreation at engineered beaches), some stakeholders and groups opposed these measures because of concerns about their environmental impacts. Other interests raised concerns that flood control structures may encourage development in flood-prone areas, and that the residual risks behind levees and shore protections and downriver from dams were underappreciated.", "USACE is the principal federal agency engaged in construction of flood control measures (e.g., levees and engineered coastal dunes). When appropriations are available, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acquired floodplain easements and supported construction of small levees and dams in rural areas. Some flood control infrastructure owned by local and state entities also has received support from hazard mitigation assistance programs administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Congress established the NFIP in the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a74001 et seq.). The new program aimed to alter development in flood-prone areas identified as the 100-year floodplain; this floodplain also is referred to as the 1% annual-chance floodplain, or the floodplain for the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) for purposes of the NFIP. The NFIP's multipronged regulatory system consists of community flood risk assessment and mapping, purchase requirements for flood insurance for certain residential and commercial structures, and the adoption of minimum local requirements for land use and building codes for vulnerable areas. The NFIP allows for residential and commercial construction in known floodplains, with the proviso that construction must follow building-code regulations that reduce future flood damage and prevent new development from increasing flood risk.", "Although the federal government through the NFIP requires that participating communities adopt minimum land-use and building-code regulations, local and state governments maintain the dominant role in adopting building codes (and local governments in their enforcement), including those related to flood risk. A broader federal role in land use and building codes was discussed in the late 1960s. It largely was not adopted with a few exceptions for coastal land use (as discussed in the text box titled \"Land Use and Federal Statutes Related to Coastal Management\"). ", "In 1977, President Carter signed Executive Order (E.O.) 11988 (Floodplain Management), which requires that federal actions are to avoid supporting development in the 100-year floodplain if alternatives are available. Also, federal agencies responsible for real property are to design and construct structures and facilities consistent with NFIP regulations. In 2015, President Obama signed E.O. 13690; among other things, the order established a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) for federally funded projects, which required a higher level of flood resilience than E.O. 11988. On August 15, 2017, President Trump signed E.O. 13807 in an effort to streamline federal infrastructure approval. Among other actions, E.O. 13807 revoked E.O. 13690. By revoking E.O. 13690, E.O. 13807 appears to have eliminated the FFRMS and returned federal floodplain policy to the original text of E.O. 11988."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigation and Nonstructural and Green Infrastructure Approaches", "paragraphs": ["After extensive flooding in the Midwest in 1993, federal programs were created or adjusted to support a wider array of activities to reduce damage and prevent loss of life, such as moving flood-prone structures and developing evacuation plans. Nonstructural mitigation is now regularly used as part of flood management for new development and during repairs of damaged property and communities. Some local, state, and federal agencies and programs allow or support approaches that mimic nature or are \"nature-based\" (e.g., placement of oyster beds along coastlines to reduce erosion), especially if there are multiple benefits (e.g., erosion reduction, fish habitat, and water quality benefits from oyster beds). ", "Natural flood resilience can be reduced by development that degrades wetlands and ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, coral, and oyster reefs) and increases impervious surface in the watershed (e.g., reducing rainfall infiltration into absorbent prairie ecosystems). Department of the Interior agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service), NOAA, USACE, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are involved in ecosystem restoration and protection activities, as well as permitting and planning activities, which may restore or protect these natural features and their flood risk reduction benefits.", "Runoff from rainfall in urban areas is often referred to as stormwater. For decades local governments and public works officials constructed stormwater infrastructure to move rainwater rapidly away from developed areas. This was done largely through grey infrastructure using pipes, gutters, ditches, and storm sewers. Although these systems were able to collect and move water away, the stormwater discharged from these systems to surface waters often contained pollutants. In recent years, local governments and public works officials have both increasingly expressed interest in and adopted green infrastructure for stormwater as a way to manage rainfall to reduce flood losses and to prevent pollution. For stormwater, green infrastructure often consists of using or mimicking natural processes to infiltrate, encourage evapotranspiration, or reuse stormwater runoff on-site where it is generated; this helps to reduce or delay runoff that contributes to high water levels in streams and rivers, as well as manage the pollutants entering surface water. Other communities and water users are looking to use green infrastructure to recharge groundwater with urban stormwater and other types of floodwater. ", "Until recently, the major federal role in stormwater had been EPA regulations to reduce pollution from stormwater runoff pursuant to objectives and requirements in the Clean Water Act. That is, the federal government, if it participated financially in stormwater management, focused on the pollution prevention aspects. As a result of legislative and administrative changes by EPA and states administering the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), activities that \"manage, reduce, treat, or recapture stormwater\" are now eligible for financial support. Such activities may have flood mitigation as well as pollution prevention benefits.", " Figure 2 illustrates the suite of flood resilience and risk reduction improvements, including both structural and nonstructural measures, for coastal communities and states. A similar suite of options is available for communities along rivers. A flood risk management response may incorporate multiple types of improvements. For example, Figure 3 illustrates how levees can be set back from a river to allow for a larger floodplain and how other structural and nonstructural components can be combined to create a more comprehensive flood risk management system (e.g., a hybrid of grey and green infrastructure).

Also, the National Science Foundation supports research on related topics. Advancements in technologies have assisted in better understanding weather and climate, hydrology and hydraulics, and also mapping.

The NFIP has two main policy goals: (1) to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk of property owners to the federal government; and (2) to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodplain management standards. A longer-term objective of the NFIP is to reduce federal expenditure on disaster assistance after floods. As of March 2018, the NFIP had 5.025 million flood insurance policies providing nearly $1.28 trillion in coverage, with over 22,000 communities in 50 states and 6 other jurisdictions participating. As a public insurance program, the goals of the NFIP are very different from the goals of private-sector companies, as it encompasses social goals to provide flood insurance in flood-prone areas to property owners who otherwise would not be able to obtain it and reduce government's cost after floods. The NFIP also engages in many \"noninsurance\" activities in the public interest: it identifies and maps flood hazards, disseminates flood risk information through flood maps, requires community land-use and building-code standards, contributes to community resilience by providing a mechanism to fund rebuilding after a flood, and offers grants and incentive programs for household- and community-level investments in flood risk reduction. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flood Maps and State and Local Land-Use Control", "paragraphs": ["The NFIP accomplishes the goal of reducing comprehensive flood risk primarily by requiring participating communities to collaborate with FEMA to develop and adopt flood maps called Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and enact minimum floodplain standards based on those flood maps. The NFIP encourages communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations such as zoning codes, subdivision ordinances, building codes, and rebuilding restrictions. Internal FEMA studies have found that structures built to FEMA standards experience 73% less damage than structures not built to those standards. According to FEMA, the program saves the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the NFIP's building and floodplain management regulations, and FEMA expects this amount to increase over time as additional new construction is built to increasingly stronger standards.", "Communities that choose to participate in the NFIP are required to adopt land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions and to regulate development in the floodplain. As authorized in law, FEMA has developed a set of minimum floodplain management standards that are intended to ", "(1) constrict the development of land which is exposed to flood damage where appropriate, (2) guide the development of proposed construction away from locations which are threatened by flood hazards, (3) assist in reducing damage caused by floods, and (4) otherwise improve the long-range land management and use of flood-prone areas.", "FEMA has set forth the minimum standards it requires for participation in the NFIP in federal regulations. Though the standards appear in federal regulations, the standards have the force of law only because they are adopted and enforced by a state or local government. ", "FEMA's Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) program is a key part of flood risk reduction by providing information to identify flood hazards, assess flood risks, and partner with states and communities to provide flood hazard and risk data to guide mitigation actions. In order to do this, FEMA conducts Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) to produce FIRMs that depict a community's flood risk and floodplain. Flood Insurance Studies analyze the terrain and factors that affect flood hazards using specified models and the physical, hydrologic, and climate conditions in effect at the time the studies are conducted. FIRMs use the information from the FISs to delineate floodplain boundaries. FIRMs and FISs are a \"snapshot\" of flood risk at their time of creation, and therefore can become outdated as demographic, topographic, hydrologic, or climatic conditions change, or as engineering methods and models improve. Generally, flood maps may require updating when there have been significant new building developments in or near the flood zone, changes to flood protection systems, or environmental changes in the community, or when better data become available. An area of specific focus of the FIRM is the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The SFHA is intended to distinguish the flood risk zones that have a chance of flooding during a once-in-100-year flood, or a flood of greater frequency. This means that properties have a risk of flooding of at least 1% every year if in the SFHA. However, over 20% of NFIP claims are for properties outside SFHAs.

The Community Rating System, as authorized by law, is intended to incentivize the reduction of flood and erosion risk, as well as the adoption of more effective measures to protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions. FEMA awards points for measures that increase a community's \"class\" rating in the Community Rating System on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest ranking. Starting at Class 9, policyholders in the SFHA within a Community Rating System community receive a 5% discount on their Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) premiums, with increasing discounts of 5% per class until reaching Class 1. At that level, policyholders in the SFHA can receive a 45% discount on their flood insurance premiums. As of June 2017, 1,444 communities participated in the Community Rating System, with nearly 3.6 million policyholders. This represents about 5% of eligible NFIP communities that could participate in the Community Rating System program. However, these communities have a large number of flood policies, so more than 69% of all flood policies are written in communities participating in the Community Rating System program. The Community Rating System discount is cross-subsidized into the NFIP program, such that the discount for one community ends up being offset by increased premium rates in all communities across the NFIP. The Community Rating System provides an average discount of 11.4% on standard flood insurance policy premiums across the NFIP. Therefore, this average 11.4% discount for Community Rating System communities is cross-subsidized and shared across NFIP communities through a cost (or load) increase of 13.4% to overall premiums in communities not participating in the Community Rating System.", "The credits on premium rates for flood insurance coverage are based on the estimated reduction in flood and erosion damage risks resulting from the measures adopted by the community. Points are awarded for an array of improvements in how the community informs its public on flood risk, maps and regulates its floodplain, reduces possible flood damage, and provides immediate warnings and responds to flooding incidents.

Congress has capped the amount that can be paid for ICC coverage at $75 annually. The ICC policy has a separate rate premium structure: currently ICC premiums vary between $4 and $70. ICC coverage provides an amount up to $30,000 in payments for certain eligible expenses. ICC coverage is in addition to the building coverage provided by the standard flood insurance policy. However, the payment on the building claim plus the ICC claim cannot exceed the statutory maximum payment of $250,000 for residential structures or $500,000 for nonresidential structures.", "For example, when a building is determined by a community to be substantially damaged following a flood, floodplain management standards adopted by local communities can require the building to be rebuilt to meet current floodplain management requirements, even if the property previously did not need to do so. For instance, the new compliance standard may require the elevation of the rebuilt building to above the base flood elevation. An ICC claim may then be submitted by the policyholder to offset the cost of complying with the elevation standard. FEMA also makes ICC coverage available if a building has been declared a repetitive loss by a community's floodplain management regulations.", "ICC claims payments may also be used toward the costs of elevating, demolishing, relocating, or floodproofing nonresidential buildings, or any combination of these actions. According to ICC data, elevation is the most common form of mitigation. Approximately 61% of all ICC claims closed with payment are single-family residential claims involving compensation for elevation of a structure to or above the BFE. Although the cost of elevating a structure depends on the type of building and elevation requirement, the average cost of elevating an existing property has been estimated at $33,239 to $91,732, and suggestions have been made for years that the amount of ICC coverage should be raised.", "In addition, FEMA has not implemented ICC coverage for two conditions for which it is authorized to do so by law. These two conditions are for properties that have sustained flood damage on multiple occasions, if the administrator determines that it is cost-effective and in the best interests of the NFIP, and for properties for which an offer of mitigation assistance is made under various federal assistance programs.", "Since the ICC was introduced in 1997, the program has received over $1.4 billion in premiums and paid over $700 million in claims, with over $450 million in underwriting expenses and $50 million of claims-handling expenses. However, between $100 million and $200 million has yet to be paid on claims for prior years. For the years on which FEMA has data, 2007 to 2015, the NFIP has lost money on ICC on a cash flow basis.

As of January 31, 2018, there were 24,078 currently insured RL properties and 15,311 currently insured SRL properties. Repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss properties (which represent about 1-2% of the overall policies in the NFIP) have accounted for approximately $9 billion in claims, or approximately 16% of total claims over the history of the program.

In the populated areas of most interest to the NFIP, about 30% of these increases may be attributed to increased runoff caused by the increase in impermeable land surfaces caused by population growth/development, whereas the remaining 70% represents the influence of climate change. The implication of this is that, on a national basis, approximately 13.5% of the growth in the fluvial SHFA is likely to be due to population growth and would occur even without any climate change. For the coastal environment, the typical increase in the coastal SFHA is projected to be about 55% by 2100. Sea-level rise is not only a concern for the future; many areas are already experiencing \"nuisance flooding\" from minor tidal flooding or rainstorms. The frequency and duration of minor tidal flooding has increased dramatically in recent decades along many U.S. coastal areas. Although not catastrophic, such flooding can significantly disrupt normal commerce and activity, and the seemingly minor inconveniences and local economic losses from each event can have a cumulative effect that results in considerable hidden costs to residents and businesses. In addition, the NFIP will continue to face the risk of catastrophic losses: events like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Katrina, and Sandy are not outside the expected range of NFIP losses.

There exists some tension between the broader federal interest in reducing the federal government's exposure to costs for disaster response and recovery, and nonfederal (including private) roles in shaping how structures and facilities are built in coastal areas, floodplains, and elsewhere. Local and state governments in the United States have the primary responsibility for managing flood risk and resilience, including through guiding land use in floodplains, establishing and enforcing building codes and ordinances, and construction of public works to protect communities. At the same time, as discussed in this report, the federal government has elected to become involved in some aspects of flood resilience and risk reduction (e.g., NFIP) and disaster response and recovery.
