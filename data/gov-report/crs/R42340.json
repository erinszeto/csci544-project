The VHA's approach to suicide prevention is based on a public health framework, which has three major components: (1) surveillance, (2) risk and protective factors, and (3) interventions.", "Surveillance, or systematic collection of data on completed (i.e., fatal) suicides, is essential to define the scope of the problem (i.e., the suicide rate among veterans), identify characteristics associated with higher or lower risk of suicide, and track changes in the suicide rate. No nationwide surveillance system exists for suicide among all veterans. Information about deaths (including suicides) is collected in death certificates by state, territorial, and local governments. Death certificate data are aggregated into the National Death Index, which can be combined with data about who is a veteran to identify veteran suicides. The VHA collects detailed information about suicides among veterans that are known to VHA facilities; however, the majority of veterans are not enrolled in VHA health care, so other sources of information (e.g., Department of Defense data) are necessary to identify veterans.", "Information collected in surveillance is used to identify suicide risk factors (i.e., characteristics associated with higher rates of suicide) and protective factors (i.e., characteristics associated with lower rates of suicide). This is essential in order to design interventions that reduce risk factors and/or increase protective factors, thus lowering overall risk of suicide. Risk factors are also helpful in identifying at-risk groups or individuals so that interventions can be delivered to the people who need them most. Within the VHA, this research is supported by the Office of Research and Development; a Center of Excellence in suicide prevention; and a Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center on suicide prevention.", "The intervention cycle includes three stages: (1) design and test interventions, (2) implement interventions, and (3) evaluate interventions. The research components mentioned above have roles in small-scale pilot testing and large-scale evaluations of interventions. VHA suicide prevention interventions include easy access to care, screening and treatment, suicide prevention coordinators, suicide hotline, education and outreach, and limited access to lethal means.", "The VHA has received both praise and criticism for its suicide prevention efforts and mental health services more generally. A 2010 progress report on the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention describes the VHA as \"one of the most vibrant forces in the U.S. suicide prevention movement, implementing multiple levels of innovation and state of the art interventions, backed up by a robust evaluation and research capacity.\" In contrast, some have testified before Congress that VHA's suicide prevention efforts have inadequacies, such as barriers to accessing care and lack of evidence-based treatments for those who do access care. A 2011 evaluation of VHA mental health services captures both sides of the argument, finding that VHA mental health care is generally at least as good as that of other health care systems, but that it \"often does not meet implicit VA expectations.\" An independent evaluation of VA mental health services is underway.", "Potential issues for Congress and related recommendations by outside organizations fall into three categories: improving the timeliness and accuracy of surveillance data, building the evidence base, and increasing access to evidence-based mental health care.

This report, however, focuses on activities of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VHA's approach to suicide prevention is based in part on the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which involves multiple federal departments, including the VA, Defense (DOD), and Education (ED), as well as several agencies within Health and Human Services (HHS). While this CRS report focuses on suicide prevention efforts of the VHA, activities of other entities are discussed as they relate to VHA activities.

The three subsequent parts of the report correspond to the three major components of the public health framework: (1) suicide surveillance, (2) suicide risk factors and protective factors, and (3) suicide prevention interventions.

The public health approach intervenes with populations (e.g., distributing educational materials about mental illness and mental health services), whereas the clinical approach intervenes with individuals (e.g., prescribing antidepressant medication to a person diagnosed with depression). The individual focus of the clinical approach limits its reach to those who access the health care system; clinical interventions are necessary but not sufficient. The population-based public health approach is considered essential to address the broader problem of suicide among all veterans, including those who may not currently be in contact with the health care system. ", "Both the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the VHA's approach to suicide prevention are based on a public health framework. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the framework has three major components: (1) surveillance, (2) risk and protective factors, and (3) prevention interventions. Suicide surveillance involves collecting data on completed (i.e., fatal) suicides in order to define the scope of the problem. Data collected in surveillance can be used to identify risk factors (i.e., characteristics associated with higher suicide risk) and protective factors (i.e., characteristics associated with lower suicide risk). Suicide prevention interventions aim to reduce risk factors and/or enhance protective factors that have been identified; interventions may target high-risk groups or individuals, identified based on known risk factors.

Surveillance, or systematic collection of data on completed (i.e., fatal) suicides, is essential to define the scope of the problem (i.e., the suicide rate among veterans), to identify characteristics associated with higher or lower risk of suicide, and to track changes in the suicide rate and evaluate suicide prevention interventions. In order to evaluate interventions, suicide surveillance must measure the same thing, in the same way, repeatedly over time. In the case of veteran suicide, surveillance requires identifying both who is a veteran and who has died by suicide. ", "The VHA collects detailed information about suicides (and suicide attempts) among veterans that are known to VHA facilities through the Behavioral Health Autopsy Program (BHAP), which will eventually collect information in four phases. The VHA has already implemented the two phases: standardized chart reviews and interviews with family members. The third and fourth phases involve interviewing the last clinician to see the veteran and locating public records that might indicate stressors (e.g., bankruptcy or divorce). A Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluation found that some BHAP reports were not submitted, some included inaccurate information, and some were incomplete. VHA facilities had interpreted BHAP instructions differently, and no officials were reviewing BHAP reports for accuracy or completeness. ", "Resolving the problems the GAO identified with BHAP would result in better information about suicides among veterans that are known to VHA facilities; however, information collected solely by the VHA would still exclude suicides among other veterans (i.e., those who are not known to the VHA). Of more than 21 million veterans estimated to live in the United States, fewer than 10 million are enrolled to receive health care from the VHA. The VA also has records of veterans who receive other benefits (e.g., home loans), regardless of whether they are enrolled in VHA health care, but does not have records of all veterans. The VA is working with the DOD to identify suicides among all veterans, including those who do not interact with the VA. ", "Information about deaths\u2014including whether a death resulted from intentional self-harm (i.e., suicide)\u2014is collected in death certificates by state, territorial, and local governments. The resulting data may not be comparable across jurisdictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aggregates death certificate data into the National Death Index (NDI), which can then be combined with data about who is a veteran. The lag between a suicide event and identification of the decedent as a veteran may be years; this delays the availability of crucial information. Timely reporting of death certificates was identified as a core issue in a 2010 progress report on the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Research into Risk and Protective Factors", "paragraphs": ["The VHA conducts veteran-specific research that builds on research among the general population to identify characteristics associated with higher rates of suicide (i.e., risk factors) and lower rates of suicide (i.e., protective factors).

Knowing what the risk factors are also helps in identifying at-risk groups or individuals so that interventions can be delivered to the people who need them most. Table 1 provides examples of risk and protective factors among the general population. ", "Within HHS, both the CDC and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) disseminate research on suicide risk and protective factors within the general population. Also, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) collects data on suicide attempts and related behavior. It should be noted that risk factors for attempted suicide may differ from risk factors for completed suicide; for example, women have a higher rate of attempted suicide, but men have a higher rate of completed suicide. Despite a large number of risk and protective factors identified by researchers, it is not yet possible to predict who will attempt or complete suicide. The inability to identify individuals most in need of interventions is one of the reasons a public health approach\u2014with a focus on population-level interventions\u2014is necessary for effective suicide prevention. ", "Veteran-specific research on suicide risk and protective factors is necessary because the veteran population differs from the non-veteran population on a variety of characteristics (e.g., gender distribution), some of which may also be associated with suicide risk. Research has explored whether combat exposure is associated with risk of suicide (with mixed results). Veterans who are enrolled with the VHA may differ from non-enrolled veterans, as well.

The first stage is to develop and pilot test interventions on a small scale to ensure that they are safe, ethical, feasible, efficacious (i.e., they work under ideal conditions), and effective (i.e., they work under real-world conditions). If interventions are successful in the first stage, the second stage is to implement them on a larger scale. The third stage is to evaluate interventions that have been implemented on a larger scale, to verify their effectiveness and determine for whom they are most effective.

The extent to which these policies are implemented in practice has been questioned in congressional testimony, news media, and survey responses from both providers and patients.

The VHA provides information to help increase awareness of mental health care services, reduce the stigma associated with seeking care, and correct misconceptions about VHA care. Some mental health and substance use evaluation and treatment services have been integrated into other treatment settings, which both increases the convenience and reduces the stigma associated with seeking care.

Researchers based this finding on a review of medical records, which showed that prescriptions for medication were often not filled for as long as recommended and that psychotherapy, as documented, was often not delivered according to evidence-based guidelines.

Classification of a death as a suicide requires a determination that the death is both self-inflicted and intentional. Determining the decedent's intent is difficult, and coroners or medical examiners may feel pressure not to classify a death as suicide, due to the stigma associated with suicide. Suicides may be underreported when the manner of death is misclassified as \"undetermined\" or \"accidental\" (e.g., poisonings or single-vehicle crashes). Additionally, each jurisdiction (state, territory, or city) has its own requirements for investigating deaths, leading to variability across jurisdictions.
