Two characteristics of broadcast television and broadcast radio stations determine whether or not media ownership rules are triggered: (1) the geographic range of their signals, and (2) the boundaries of their media markets as determined by the Nielsen Company, a market research firm.", "After first adopting rules limiting common ownership of multiple local radio stations, multiple local television stations, and multiple national broadcast networks in the 1940s, the FCC continued to expand and modify media ownership rules. It began to limit cross-ownership of radio and television stations in 1970, and cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations in 1975. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to review these rules every four years and repeal or modify those it no longer deems to be in the public interest.", "Following its most recent review, the FCC retained its media ownership rules in 2016, and readopted rules counting broadcast stations that jointly sell advertising time as commonly owned. Pending approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the FCC will require independently owned broadcast television stations to include resource-sharing agreements in their online public inspection files. In addition, as directed by the U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, the FCC reviewed its broadcast ownership diversity policies. It concluded that it did not believe the 1996 Telecommunications Act nor the Communications Act of 1934 requires it to adopt race- or gender-conscious measures in order to promote ownership diversity. In order to increase broadcast ownership diversity, FCC also reinstated rules enabling certain small businesses to abide by less restrictive media ownership and attribution rules, and more flexible licensing policies, than their counterparts. The newly approved media ownership and diversity rules took effect on December 1, 2016.", "The FCC's 2016 review occurred against the background of sweeping changes in news consumption patterns. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center show 20% of respondents citing printed newspapers as a source they \"read yesterday\" or used regularly in 2016, down from 50% in 1996. While the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65% in 1996 to 46% in 2016, it still outranked other local news sources.

As a result, the FCC stated, it will be able to determine more accurately and precisely whether a proposed combination would have an adverse impact on viewpoint diversity in the relevant local market. Moreover, the FCC stated that ", "specifically allowing for a waiver of the NBCO Rule[s] in cases where applicants can demonstrate that the proposed combination will not unduly harm viewpoint diversity, we signal our recognition that there may be instances where enforcing the prohibition against ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station is not necessary to serve the rule's purpose of promoting viewpoint diversity in the local market. Indeed, it is our determination herein that the public interest would not be served by restricting specific combinations that do not unduly harm viewpoint diversity.", "To enable a timely public response to waiver requests, the FCC will require broadcast and radio station licensees to file their requests prior to a newspaper acquisition, and commission staff will place the waiver requests on public notice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grandfathering", "paragraphs": ["The FCC will grandfather, to the extent required, any existing newspaper-broadcast combinations that no longer comply with the NBCO rules as a result of the FCC's 2016 changes but will not allow licensees to transfer grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations, including those subject to permanent waivers. In addition, the FCC will continue to allow all combinations currently in existence that have been grandfathered or approved by permanent waiver to the extent that grandfathering/permanent waivers are still necessary to permit common ownership.", "The FCC stated that this policy is consistent with long-standing precedent of requiring transferees or assignees of properties to comply with FCC rules in effect at the time of the transaction. In addition, the FCC stated the policy will drive the broadcast industry toward compliance with current rules when owners voluntarily decide to sell their properties, while minimizing hardships on licensees who would otherwise be forced to sell properties as a result of the FCC's modifications.

Generally, the four broadcast networks covered by this definition are ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.", "The FCC first adopted this rule, which originally prohibited ownership of any two networks, with respect to radio in 1941, as part of the Chain Broadcasting Report . The FCC directed the rule at NBC, the only company at that time with two radio networks. The FCC found that the operation of two networks gave NBC excessive control over its affiliated broadcast radio stations, and an unfair competitive advantage over other broadcast radio networks. The FCC extended the dual network rule to television networks in 1946.

In 2001, the FCC revised the rule to permit one of the four major networks to jointly own one of those emerging networks, which have since merged into the CW network. Today, the CBS Corporation has a partial ownership interest in the CW broadcast network.

In addition, as described in \" Local Television Ownership Rules (Television Duopoly Rules) ,\" the FCC reasoned that the notification requirement would give minorities and women interested in purchasing a station an opportunity to bid. The commission reiterated that \"the [FCC] has made a number of efforts separate from this proceeding to address minority and female ownership issues, and we hope to take further steps in this area.\"", "In 2002, the FCC issued an order repealing and/or further relaxing several media ownership rules, including the failed station solicitation rule (FSSR), described in \" Local Television Ownership Rules (Television Duopoly Rules) ,\" arguing that \"the efficiencies associated with operation of two same-market stations, absent unusual circumstances, will always result in the buyer being the owner of another station in that market.\" The FCC deferred consideration of other proposals to advance minority and female ownership, stating that it would address them in a future rulemaking.
