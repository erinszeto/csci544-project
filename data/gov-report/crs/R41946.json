Legitimate \"ballot access\" rules and regulations, even though they may pose certain administrative requirements on federal candidates, have been upheld when they have been found to be within a state's constitutional authority to regulate the election process, to ensure orderly elections, and to prevent fraud and voter confusion. The states have been allowed to implement rules which, for example, prevent over-crowding and confusion on the ballot by requiring a minimum show of public support to appear on the ballot, by prohibiting such things as dual candidacies on the ballot, and by implementing \"sore loser\" laws that bar a candidate on the general election ballot from appearing as an independent if that candidate had lost a party primary. Such administrative requirements have not been deemed to be additional \"qualifications\" to run for office. However, requirements that are more than merely administrative and procedural or measures to protect ballot integrity have been found to be unconstitutional as additional qualifications for office. Examples include requirements for congressional candidates to live in the congressional district (and not just the state), durational residency requirements, ineligibility of convicted felons, and disqualification of incumbents (term limits).", "This report updates an earlier CRS report, and will be revised as decisions, rulings, and/or events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The qualifications required to hold the office of U.S. Senator or Representative to Congress are established and set out within the U.S. Constitution.

Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgment or disappoint the inclination of the people.

No power external to the House could decide them without an intrusion upon the question of its organization, which would be fatal to its freedom and independence. The right of the House, as a body, to determine upon the right of each member to a place in that body is so obvious that it needs no comment.

The court found that since the judging of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own Members is textually committed in the Constitution to Congress, the court \"simply lack[s] jurisdiction to proceed\": ", "It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of \"textually demonstrable constitutional commitment\" of an issue to another branch of government to the exclusion of the courts ... than the language of Article I, section 5, clause 1 that \"[e]ach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.\" The provision states not merely that each House \"may judge\" these matters, but that each House \"shall be the Judge\" (emphasis added). The exclusion of others \u2013 and in particular others who are judges \u2013 could not be more evident. Hence, without need to rely upon the amorphous and partly prudential doctrine of \"political questions,\" [citations omitted] we simply lack jurisdiction to proceed.

However, there is a general (legal) presumption within the American democratic tradition that the whole of the adult citizenry are eligible to serve in political office, and anyone challenging such presumption of eligibility has the burden of proof with respect to challenges and allegations regarding eligibility. As stated by former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge, and former Member of Congress (and chairman of the Committee on Elections), George W. McCrary, in his book, A Treatise on the American Law of Elections : ", "The presumption always is, that a person chosen to an office is qualified to fill it, and it is never incumbent upon him to prove his eligibility. The certificate of election does not add to this presumption, but simply leaves it where the law places it, and he who denies the eligibility of a person who is certified to be elected, must take the burthen of proving that he is not eligible.", "An early case in the House of Representatives demonstrated the issue of the burden of proof regarding challenges to eligibility. In this case, a petition signed by 125 individuals attested that an individual elected to Congress in 1905, Anthony Michalek, was not a citizen of the United States. The House Elections Committee, to which the protest was referred, noted that although there were affidavits, statements, and conclusions drawn by complainants, there was offered no actual proof in support of these claims of non-citizenship. The committee noted that the Member in question, who was born in Bohemia and brought to the United States as an infant by his parents, could be an American citizen if during minority his father or his mother (after the death of his father) had been naturalized as a U.S. citizen, or if the Member himself had been previously naturalized, and that in the Chicago area where he was from, such naturalization could have occurred in any of six different state or federal courts. Complainants forwarded records and registers from state courts in Cook County with regard to the Member's father, but not from federal courts, and no records or registers were forwarded regarding the Member's mother or the Member: \"No testimony was offered concerning the naturalization of Vaclav Michalek [the father] in the two federal courts and no testimony was offered as to the naturalization of Therese Michalek [the mother] or Anthony Michalek in any of the six courts.\" Since the complainants did not forward proof that there had not been a naturalization of the father from any of the federal courts, or for the mother or the Member in federal or state courts, the committee found that the complainants had not made out a prima facie case of non-citizenship that would shift the burden of proof to the Member of Congress, and that the Member of Congress, therefore, need not present any defense to have the matter dismissed: \"Your Committee is of the opinion that when charges affecting the eligibility of a Member of Congress to his seat are made, some proof should be offered in their support before putting the sitting Member to the expense and the burden of making a defense.\" The committee's resolution of the matter was approved by the House."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Result of Exclusion", "paragraphs": ["In judging congressional qualifications and elections, the practice and experience in the Senate and the House concerning the implications of finding a Member-elect or Member-designate disqualified or ineligible is clear, and is remarkably consistent given the great potential for partisan division on this issue when it arises with respect to a particular Member-elect. The overwhelming weight of authority in both the Senate and the House demonstrates that the ineligibility of the majority candidate in a congressional election, whether because of death, disqualification, disability, or other incapacity before or after the election, gives no title or right to the office to the runner-up candidate, but rather merely creates a \"vacancy\" in the office from that state. The Senate and the House thus both follow what is known as the \"American Rule\" (as opposed to the so-called \"British Rule\"), whereby the next highest qualified vote-getter in an election is not deemed to be entitled to the seat upon the disqualification of the person receiving the most votes. As noted in House precedents, \"If the House finds that a Member-elect has not met the qualifications for membership, or has failed to remove disqualifications, a new election must be held. An opposing candidate with the next highest number of votes cannot claim the right to the seat.\" Similarly, the \"American Rule\" followed in the Senate is noted: \"In election cases the ineligibility of a majority candidate, for a seat in the Congress gives no title to the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes.\"", "If there is such a finding by the House or the Senate that the majority candidate is disqualified (or is otherwise not \"duly elected\"), there is then created a \"vacancy\" in the office which must be filled according to the procedures established in the U.S. Constitution.

The Court noted that the House is \"without authority to exclude any person, duly elected by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution.\"", "An \"exclusion\" is not a disciplinary matter or proceeding. It is a proceeding pursuant to the authority of each house of Congress to judge the constitutional qualifications and the elections of its own Members. Judging the \"qualifications\" of Members-elect is thus not an exercise of judging a person's rectitude, character, or moral fitness to hold office, and is substantively and procedurally different from a disciplinary matter such as an \"expulsion.\" After Powell , it is clear that an \"exclusion\" by a mere majority vote can not be used by the House or the Senate to judge past \"misconduct\" or the \"fitness\" of a Member-elect in a decision to seat or not to seat such a person. As discussed in Deschler's Precedents ,", "The [Supreme Court's Powell ] decision apparently precludes the practice of the House or Senate, followed on numerous occasions during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, of excluding Members-elect for prior criminal, immoral, or disloyal conduct. The court upheld in Powell the interest of state voters in being represented by the person of their choice, regardless of congressional dislike for the Member's-elect moral, political, or religious activities. ", "Congressional precedents and cases prior to the Supreme Court's 1969 decision in Powell may, therefore, be of little precedential value as to the current practice regarding judging the \"qualifications\" of a Member-elect. The Court in deciding Powell , and limiting the authority of each house to judge only the qualifications set out in the Constitution, did note past actions and some early colonial precedent whereby the legislature found that a legislator-elect's \"character or past conduct rendered him unfit to serve.\" However, the Court discussed and recognized the influence on the framers of the British case of John Wilkes, where Wilkes had been expelled from Parliament for \"seditious libel\" against the Crown. In the special election to fill the vacancy, Wilkes was re-elected by the people, and then excluded by the House of Commons three consecutive times. Eventually, after returning from exile, Wilkes was elected to the next Parliament, and was successful in having his previous exclusions expunged from the record. The Court noted the influence on the framers at the Constitutional Convention of the resolution of the Wilkes case on the \"eve of the Convention\" (in 1782), characterized by the Court as ending the \"long and bitter struggle for the right of the British electorate to be represented by men of their own choice,\" and confirming the historical understanding that the framers intended the House or Senate to be without the authority to exclude (by majority vote) a person who has been duly elected by his or her constituents and who meets the qualifications established in the Constitution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contested Elections", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution also expressly delegates the authority to each house of Congress to judge the \"elections\" and \"returns\" of their Members, as well as \"qualifications.\" There may thus be \"election contests\" filed in either the House or the Senate, or a challenge raised by a Member-elect to the swearing in of another Member-elect, where the institution is asked not to judge the standing \"qualifications\" of a Member-elect, but rather to determine if the Member-elect presenting himself or herself for seating in the House or Senate was, in fact\u2014as noted by the Supreme Court\u2014\"duly elected\" (or, with respect to a Senator-designate, was duly chosen). It does not appear that a \"contested election\" procedure or complaint, at least as set out in the statutory provisions of the Federal Contested Election Act concerning elections to the House, is the proper vehicle to challenge the \"qualifications\" or eligibility of a Member-elect.

Colonel George Mason suggested in Convention, on June 22, 1787, to replace the proposed age qualification of 21 for membership in what was to be the House of Representatives, with 25 years of age, noting that his own \"political opinions at the age of 21 were too crude & erroneous to merit an influence on public measures.\" Other delegates at the Convention were \"agst. abridging the rights of election in any shape,\" and argued against the higher age eligibility which they believed could \"damp the efforts of genius, and of laudable ambition.\" The motion to establish the age qualification for the House at 25 was adopted by the delegates, and the higher age requirement of 30 years for Senators was later explained by James Madison in the Federalist Papers : ", "A Senator must be thirty years of age at least; as a representative must be twenty-five. ... The propriety of these distinctions is explained by nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages.... ", "The age eligibility requirement in the Constitution has been interpreted in precedents by both the House of Representatives and the Senate to be a qualification to hold the office, rather than as a qualification to run for the office. That is, the age qualification becomes relevant at the time when the Member-elect presents himself or herself to the House or the Senate to take the oath of office and to be seated. On occasion, both the House and the Senate have actually allowed a Member-elect to delay presenting credentials to the body at the opening of a session to allow that Member-elect to reach the required constitutional age. In the Senate, for example, in the case of Senator-elect Rush D. Holt, in 1935, the candidate receiving the most votes was not yet eligible to serve in the Senate at the time he was on the ballot for the general election, nor at the time of the beginning of the new congressional session, because he was only 29 years of age. The Senate found that since the issue of \"qualifications\" arises when the Member-elect presents his credentials to the Senate to take the oath of office and be seated, the Senate could, and did, allow the candidate/Member-elect to delay presenting his credentials until the time he was 30 years old, and thus qualified.", "The precedents in the House similarly indicate that the issue of qualifications of \"age\" would arise at the time a Member-elect presents his or her credentials for seating, generally at the commencement of the session, and that the Member-elect would have to meet that particular requirement at that time. The House of Representatives, for example, in 1859, apparently allowed a Member-elect, Mr. John Y. Brown of Kentucky, to defer taking the oath of office beyond the opening of Congress, until the beginning of the next session in December of 1860, at which time Mr. Brown met the constitutional age requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Citizenship", "paragraphs": ["The issue of a citizenship requirement for eligibility to be a Member of Congress garnered significant debate and attention by the framers at the Federal Convention of 1787. In stating concerns regarding the citizenship of congressional officeholders, and the required length of such citizenship, George Mason argued that although he \"was for opening a wide door for immigrants; ... [h]e did not chuse to let foreigners and adventurers make laws for us\"; nor would he want \"a rich foreign Nation, for example Great Britain, [to] send over her tools who might bribe their way\" into federal office for \"invidious purposes.\" These arguments were echoed later by delegates at the Convention who were concerned with \"admitting strangers into our public Councils,\" and who feared that \"foreigners without a long residency in the Country ... bring with them, not only attachments to other Countries; but ideas of Govt. so distinct from ours that in every point of view they are dangerous.\" Thus, citizenship requirements of seven years for Representatives and nine years for Senators were eventually adopted, although the Convention did not act upon the wishes of Mr. Gerry \"that in the future the eligibility might be confined to Natives.\" There was significant opinion at the Federal Convention that the length of citizenship required to participate in the national legislature should not be so great as to \"discourage the most desirable class of people from emigrating to the U.S.,\" and that the country should encourage the emigration of those \"who love liberty and wish to partake of its blessings.\"", "It is clear from the language and the debates on the adoption of this eligibility requirement that the citizenship requirement includes both native or \"natural born\" citizens (those who have the status of U.S. citizens at birth or by birth), as well as \"naturalized\" citizens (those who are born \"aliens\" and must go through the process of naturalization to be citizens of the U.S.). It is interesting to note that although Congress may not by legislation change the standing qualifications for office fixed in the Constitution, Congress is expressly authorized in the Constitution to \"establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.... \" By exercising this authority to change the statutory rules for citizenship, Congress can then adjust and affect what is required for naturalized citizenship (or add to the categories of those who are citizens \"at birth\" and need no naturalization\u2014see 8 U.S.C. \u00a71401), and thus indirectly affect what is required to meet the citizenship qualification requirement for Congress.", "There is an apparent split in the precedential authority in the House and Senate as to whether, similar to the age qualification, the citizenship eligibility requirement becomes relevant at the time a Member-elect presents his or her credentials and seeks to take the oath of office and be seated, or whether the requirement should be recognized and enforced at the time of election. The House has in the past allowed a Member-elect to defer taking the oath of office until the beginning of the second session of Congress (even though Congress was called into session earlier by a presidential proclamation), at which time the Member-elect had met the seven-year citizenship requirement, notwithstanding the fact that he was \"ineligible,\" that is, he was not a citizen for seven years at the time he was on the ballot and elected in the November congressional election, nor at the beginning of the first session of the new Congress. ", "In very early Senate precedents, however, the Senate eventually ruled ineligible and voided the selection of two Senators who had actually taken the oath of office, but at that time had not yet met the citizenship qualification. It was argued in a later Senate case regarding the age qualification, in 1935, that such early precedents in the 1700s and 1800s could be distinguished because the Members-elect had not specifically sought or requested a delay in taking the oath until they were qualified, but rather took the oath of office at a time when they were not yet citizens for nine years. It also appears, as noted by the Senate historians, that factionalism or partisanship (between the Federalists and the Republicans) played a major role in the decision respecting Albert Gallatin, (and between the Whigs and the Democrats) as well as in the case of James Shields, and thus the strength of the cases as precedent may be somewhat diminished.

Some delegates objected to any inhabitancy or residency requirement, believing that people would \"rarely chuse a nonresident,\" and noting that there were great disputes in some of the state colonial legislatures over technical and legal definitions of the term \"which were decided by the arbitrary will of the majority,\" or as noted by Madison, \"determined more according to the affection or dislike to the man, than any fixt interpretation of the word.\" George Mason, however, argued for some requirement of inhabitancy or residency, to preserve a knowledge and understanding of the state and to prevent wealthy interlopers from neighboring states: ", "If residence be not required, Rich men of neighbouring States, may employ with success means of corruption in some particular district and thereby get into the public Councils after having failed in their own State. This is the practice in the boroughs of England.", "The apparent constitutional concern of the framers who debated this provision was thus to craft a term that was not so overly technical that it could be applied in a strict, capricious fashion by a political majority to their advantage, but rather to express a requirement of an actual connection to the state as one's home. The mere absence of physical presence from the state for a particular duration, or a required presence for any period of continual duration, was obviously not to be the definitive or conclusive concept, since \"so strict an expression might be construed to exclude the members of the Legislature, who could not be said to be actual residents in their States whilst at the Seat of Genl.

There is no specific or implied \"durational\" residency requirement in the Constitution for U.S. Senators or Representatives requiring that one must reside in or be an \"inhabitant\" of a state for any particular period of time before one is eligible to be a U.S. Senator or Representative from that state. Such a durational requirement for Members of Congress was debated in the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, but durational requirements for \"residency\" or for being an \"inhabitant\" in a state for one year, three years, and seven years, were all rejected by the framers in favor of the final version of merely requiring one to be an \"inhabitant\" of the state \"when elected.\" The final word on the subject at the Constitutional Convention appears to be that of Mr. Williamson of North Carolina who argued against any specific required duration of residency or inhabitancy:", "He was agst (sic) requiring any period of previous residence.

The Senate found, in accordance with the findings of the Privileges and Elections Subcommittee of the Committee on Rules, however, that state law can not bind the Senate in determining the constitutional qualifications for office, and can not, therefore, add a \"durational\" residency requirement to the qualification for Senator set out in the Constitution, that is, to be an \"inhabitant\" of the state \"when elected.\"", "In addition to the fact that there is no \"durational\" residency requirement for Congress within the Constitution, there is explicitly no requirement that one own land or property in the state to be qualified to run for or hold the office. The framers explicitly rejected a property qualification for eligibility to Congress. In this regard there is also no continuing requirement of a Member of Congress to own property in the state one represents, nor is there necessarily any continuing obligation or requirement, other than what one may consider to be a \"political\" or practical necessity, to own property or even to reside in a state after election. That is, technically, the constitutional requirement is to be an inhabitant of the state from which chosen \"when elected.\" The reality of modern government in the United States is that Congress is now in session almost continuously throughout the year, and many Members find that it is more convenient, efficient, and conducive to stable family life to temporarily reside, with their families, in the Washington, DC, area during their tenure in Congress.

Sitting Members of Congress, particularly those contemplating running for re-election will, for many reasons, generally continue to maintain a home or place of abode in their home town, district, or state, which serves as their principal place of residence, their domicile, and from which they exercise their civic duties, such as voting and paying taxes, even while temporarily residing in the Washington area to attend Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Precedents", "paragraphs": ["Early congressional decisions on inhabitancy might have appeared, at first glance, to have borne out to some extent some of the framers' concerns about overly technical definitions, but upon examination show a more reasoned conclusion.

Even in this seemingly strict interpretation, however, the committee and the House noted that it was a voluntary action on the part of Bailey to \"abandon\" his domicile and establish residency in the District of Columbia; that he had lived \"exclusively\" in the District for a period of over six years; that he had in the District \"married a wife and established a family of his own, thereby leaving his natural or original domicile in his father's house\"; and that, significantly, \"Mr. Bailey had no domestic establishment or estate in Massachusetts.\" Noting that one \"may acquire inhabitancy in the District of Columbia in the same way as in any of the States,\" the House and Committee on Elections, as reported in Hinds' Precedents , specifically concluded,", "If the residence of Mr. Bailey here [the District of Columbia] had been transient and not uniform; had he left a dwelling house in Massachusetts in which his family resided a part of the year; had he left there any of the insignia of a household establishment; there would be indication that his domicile in Massachusetts had not been abandoned. It had been urged that the expressed intention to return to Massachusetts should govern. But the law ascertained intention in such a case by deducing from facts. ... The committee did not contend that a Member must be actually residing in a State at the time of his election.", "The concept of \"inhabitancy\" that evolved in congressional decision making and has traditionally been employed in congressional consideration, alluded to in the 1824 case of John Bailey, appears to be somewhat akin to the understanding of the legal term \"domicile,\" and thus would encompass not only actions taken which evidence the establishment of a physical and principal \"home\" in a state, such as the purchase or maintenance of a primary personal residence, but also intent, that is, the intent that a place be one's permanent home, the place where one intends to return after an absence, as such intent is \"deduc[ed] from the facts.\" Citing as support of the \"inhabitancy\" of a Member-elect, the Committee of Elections of the House in the case of Bayley v. Barbour , 47 th Congress, for example, noted that", "Mr. Barbour testifies that he was a native of the state of Virginia; had always been a citizen of said State; never claimed to have lived elsewhere in a permanent sense or to have exercised citizenship in any other State or Territory ... and that while he had a temporary winter residence in the city of Washington, he had taken a house in Alexandria with his family, in September 1880, [before the November 1880 election].", "The majority of the House Committee on Elections in 1926, in ruling on whether a Member-elect of the House elected from Pennsylvania was an \"inhabitant\" of that State when elected, provided a cogent explanation of the concepts and factors to be considered in determining \"inhabitancy\":", "To be an inhabitant within the Constitution, it seems clear that one must have, first, a place of abode, and, second, that this place of abode be intended by him as his headquarters; the place where his civic duties and responsibilities center; the place from which he will exercise his civic rights. We think that a fair reading of the debate on this paragraph of the Constitution discloses that it was not intended that the word \"inhabitant\" should be regarded in a captious, technical sense. ... We think that a fair interpretation of the letter and spirit of this paragraph with respect to the word \"inhabitant\" is that the framers intended that for a person to bring himself within the scope of its meaning he must have and occupy a place of abode within the particular State in which he claims inhabitancy, and that he must have openly and avowedly by act and word subjected himself to the duties and responsibilities of a member of the body politic of the particular State.", "Cases in the Senate with regard to the \"inhabitancy\" qualification demonstrate an application similar to that of the House of something somewhat akin to a \"domicile\" concept of \"inhabitancy.\" In 1809, in a challenge to the brief residency in Ohio of one selected to be a Senator from that state, the Senate accepted the declaration and certification of the governor of the state of Ohio that the individual selected was a \"citizen of said state\" since the \"term of residence\" was not \"defined either by the constitution or the laws.... \" In 1870, the credentials of Albert Ames to be selected as Senator from Mississippi were challenged based on the claim that he was not an \"inhabitant\" of the state of Mississippi when chosen. Mr. Ames, originally from Maine, was at the time of his selection stationed in Mississippi pursuant to military orders. It was argued by his opponents that he was not voluntarily in Mississippi, would merely have left and gone to another state upon other military orders, and had therefore not demonstrated nor expressed the requisite intent to make the state of Mississippi his permanent residence. It was argued that Mr. Ames did not declare his intention to resign his military commission and to make Mississippi his permanent home until after he was chosen as Senator, and therefore was not an \"inhabitant\" of the state at the time \"when elected.\" Although the Judiciary Committee reported disfavorably upon the credentials of Mr. Ames, the Senate, after a long debate, found that he was eligible to be a Member of the Senate and allowed him to take the oath of office. In affirming and recognizing Mr. Ames' stated intention to make Mississippi his permanent home, along with his presence there, as sufficient to establish his inhabitancy, the opinion of Chief Justice Shaw was cited:", "It is often a question of great difficulty, depending upon minute and complicated circumstances, leaving the question in so much doubt that a slight circumstance may turn the balance. In such a circumstance, the mere declaration of the party, made in good faith, of his election to make the one place rather than the other his home would be sufficient to turn the scale.", "In the 1899 Senate case of Nathan B. Scott, the challenge to Mr. Scott's qualifications as a Senator from West Virginia was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. The challenge was based in part on the fact that Mr. Scott was actually residing in the District of Columbia at the time of his election to the Senate, and not in West Virginia, and therefore, it was argued, was an inhabitant of the District of Columbia and not West Virginia. The committee found, however, that Mr. Scott moved to the District of Columbia after his appointment by the President as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue; that he had resided since a young man in West Virginia; and came to Washington \"with the intent to retain his residence, citizenship, inhabitancy, and domicile in Wheeling, W. Va.\"; and that \"he claims to be an inhabitant of Wheeling, W. Va. and that he remained in Washington in the discharge of his official functions with intent to return to his home in Wheeling when his duties of office here ended.\" The committee stated that the term \"inhabitant\" is \"a legal equivalent of the term 'resident,'\" and noting that Mr. Scott also voted in West Virginia, unanimously found that despite his temporary physical absence from the state, he was entitled to his seat.", "In judging whether one was actually an \"Inhabitant of the State for which he shall be chosen,\" both houses of Congress have thus employed several and varied considerations, depending on the questions before them that were to be determined. When an individual had lived in a state previously and then moved away, for example, considerations relevant to the question of whether one was an \"inhabitant\" of that first state might include whether one \"had left there any of the insignia of a household establishment,\" whether a home was owned or occupied in the first or the new state, and what type of home (i.e., a permanent home or merely a vacation home); whether one retained a license in the first state to practice a profession; one's intention to return to the state, both stated and \"deduc[ed] from facts\"; whether one continued to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship in the first state, such as voting and paying taxes; one's physical presence or absence in the first state at the time of election; and the legal definition and requirements of state law for \"residence\" or inhabitance. Whether someone who is in a new state for a short period of time should be considered an \"inhabitant\" of that state similarly would look at such factors as one's purchasing or renting an abode with the intent to make that new state one's permanent residence. The House and the Senate have thus looked to the totality of the circumstances to determine what might be characterized as one's true \"home,\" including where one's family resides, where one votes, the state in which one holds professional or business licenses and certifications, as well as considering the intent of the individual to return to and or to make a particular state his or her \"home,\" evidenced and deduced by statements and facts."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Disqualifications", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the three standing \"positive\" qualifications for congressional office in the U.S. Constitution\u2014age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected\u2014there are certain \"disqualifications\" that are based on constitutional provisions.

The text of the constitutional provision reads as follows:", "Section 3 . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice president, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a Member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

Although it was adopted in reference to the Civil War, the wording of the provision is clearly broad and general enough to reach other situations involving the acts of rebellion, insurrection, or of giving aid or comfort to the enemy. Congress has adopted legislation on several occasions lifting the disability regarding specified persons, and has twice adopted legislation by the requisite two-thirds majority to provide a general \"amnesty\" towards those who, up until the time of the adoption of that legislation, may have been disqualified for public office.", "It is not precisely clear from the constitutional provision all of the acts or conduct which would constitute \"insurrection or rebellion,\" or of giving \"aid or comfort\" to the enemy (as no applicable definitions are provided in the text of the Constitution), or what proofs of such conduct would be required to trigger the disqualification provision. Early congressional precedents indicate that, prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the House in 1867 considered challenges to the seating of Members-elect from Kentucky who presented credentials, but who had been charged with giving \"aid or countenance\" to the rebellion, and who therefore, it was argued, could not \"honestly and truly\" take the oath of office to support the Constitution. A majority of the committee report to the House, concerning Member-elect John D. Young, who was excluded by majority vote, offered the following conclusion as to the sufficiency of the acts involved to constitute actionable disloyalty during a period of active rebellion against the United States: ", "[W]hile mere want of active support of the Government or a passive sympathy with the rebellion are not sufficient to exclude a person regularly elected from taking his seat in the House, yet whenever it is shown by proof that the claimant has by act or speech given aid or countenance to the rebellion, he should not be permitted to take the oath, and such acts or speech need not be such as to constitute treason technically, but must have been so overt and public, and must have been done and said under such circumstances, as fairly to show that they were actually designed to, and in their nature tended to, forward the cause of the rebellion.", "Additionally, the mechanisms for enforcement or application of the provision are not specified in the Constitution, but it may be argued that for one already serving in the government, legislation applying the disability would have to be enacted by Congress to remove such officer based on disloyalty. For Members-elect, Congress would need to take such action to \"exclude\" upon a challenge with respect to a particular individual.", "In the one instance in Congress, other than the Civil War cases, where the constitutional disqualification provision has been applied to actually prevent the seating of a Member-elect (it was applied twice consecutively to this same individual), the House of Representatives formally voted to \"exclude\" Member-elect Victor Berger who had previously been convicted of a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917, but whose appeal was still pending. Victor L. Berger was a socialist and pacifist from Wisconsin who had been elected to the House of Representatives originally in November of 1910, but was defeated for re-election in 1912 (serving until the end of the term on March 4, 1913). Berger became a prominent member of the Socialist Party, and a newspaper editor who wrote and inveighed against the United States' entry into World War I, was a signatory to a socialist manifesto against the war, and wrote against the draft, urging resistance, during that time period. The indictment of Berger and four others (on February 2, 1918) under the Espionage Act was made public during the time that Berger ran for Congress as a member of the Socialist Party in 1918. Despite his indictment, Berger was elected, and certified by the state of Wisconsin as the winner of the November 1918 election to the House of Representatives from the fifth congressional district. By the time Berger presented himself for membership to the House of Representatives at the beginning in the 66 th Congress in May of 1919, he had been convicted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in Fort Leavenworth, but was out on bail pending appeal. Upon an objection by another Member, Berger was asked to stand aside during the taking of the oath of office by the rest of the Wisconsin delegation, and the question of whether he was entitled to the seat was referred to a special committee for recommendation. The special committee took cognizance of, but did not believe that it was bound by, the jury conviction of Berger under the Espionage Act (which at that time was on appeal), and made what it considered an independent finding, based on the facts revealed in that case, that under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 3, Berger was disqualified from the House for disloyalty and should not be seated. The vote in the House of Representatives to \"exclude\" Berger from membership, which required only a majority vote (because it was an \"exclusion\" of a Member-elect for lack of qualifications, or disqualifications, and not an \"expulsion\" of a sitting Member for misconduct), was adopted by a vote of 377-1. Pursuant to long-standing House precedent, the seat was declared vacant (the second-place vote getter was deemed not entitled to the seat under the \"American Rule\"), and a special election was called by the governor of Wisconsin, which was won again by Berger, who was then again \"excluded\" by the House of Representatives and not seated because of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 3, \"disloyalty\" disqualification, on January 10, 1920. No further special election was called by the governor for the remainder of that term, and Berger then lost the next regularly scheduled biennial election for Congress in November of 1920.", "It is interesting to note that in November of 1922, after Berger's conviction under the Espionage Act was overturned by the Supreme Court (in 1921) because of apparent bias of the lower court judge, Berger once again won election to Congress, and this time was seated by the House of Representatives without objection. Although the facts underlying the original conviction of Berger under the Espionage Act did not necessarily change in the overturning of his conviction on what might now be called a \"technicality,\" it is possible that the apparent distinction in the later Congress in seating Berger may have been the lack of a current conviction of the Member-elect for \"aiding or comforting\" the enemies of the United States, and the fact that the United States decided against pursuing the charges after the Supreme Court's reversal of the original conviction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Holding Other Federal Office", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution provides at Article I, Section 6, clause 2, that \"no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his continuance in Office.\" This provision is a classic prohibition on \"dual office holding,\" and informs and enforces the separation of powers scheme inherent in the Constitution.

Under the express constitutional authority of the states to regulate the \"Times, Places and Manner\" of elections, the states may promulgate regulatory and administrative provisions over the mechanics and procedures of elections for federal offices held within their states. This procedural and administrative authority extends to such things as the form of the ballots, voting procedures, counting votes and certifying winners, the nominating process, and may extend to reasonable requirements for a candidate's name to appear on the ballot, that is, so-called \"ballot access\" requirements for major party, new party, and independent candidates.", "Legitimate \"ballot access\" rules are generally promulgated by states to prevent the proliferation of frivolous candidates, ballot overcrowding and voter confusion, election fraud, and to facilitate generally proper election administration. Various \"ballot access\" procedures, including filing requirements, filing deadlines, a show of qualifying support by new or minor party or independent candidates, \"sore loser\" laws and other restrictions on cross-filing, have been found generally to be within the state's purview to \"regulate[ ] election procedures \" to serve the state interest of \"protecting the integrity and regularity of the election process ... ,\" and when they are found to be within the state's administrative authority over elections, they would be deemed to be not impermissible additional qualifications for federal office even though they create certain procedural hurdles or requirements which a candidate must overcome.", "The Supreme Court has generally distinguished impermissible additional qualifications for congressional office\u2014such as term limits or prohibitions on candidacy of convicted felons\u2014from permissible ballot access rules by the \"purpose\" and \"effect\" of such restrictions. For example, the Court noted that the purpose and effect of state-imposed term limits is \"to prevent the election of incumbents\" by barring them from the ballot. The \"purpose\" and \"effect\" of prohibited additional qualifications to office will thus often involve absolute barriers or significant disadvantages to a class of persons based on their status, as opposed to procedural hurdles or limitations which may involve either a legitimate showing of support by independent or new party candidates, or those which will require a choice made by and within the control of the candidate as an avenue to the general election ballot."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Signature, Petition Requirements", "paragraphs": ["States generally provide differing routes to the general election ballot for independent or new party candidates for Congress, as opposed to major party candidates nominated by the major political parties. Major party candidates who are nominated, for example, at a party convention or caucus might, under state law, be placed on the general election ballot \"automatically\" when certified as the nominee by that political party; while independent candidates must often meet petition requirements to be placed on the ballot involving the gathering of a particular number of signatures based on an absolute number required, or a percentage of the electorate or voting age population. Even when one is a candidate for the nomination of a major political party in a primary election, the state may routinely require that such candidate garner a particular number of signatures to appear on the primary ballot.", "The petition-signature requirements for congressional candidates to appear on the ballot in various states have been challenged on both First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. That there may be differing requirements for ballot access depending on whether one is the nominee of a major political party, a minor or new party, or an independent candidate, is not necessarily constitutionally impermissible under either the First or the Fourteenth Amendments as long as such methods do not \"unfairly or unnecessarily burden\" new, minor party, or independent candidates or their political supporters.

The laws in several states now prohibit one who has run and lost in a primary, from obtaining a place on the ballot in the general election as an independent or as a candidate of another party.", "In early state litigation, in 1902, a Minnesota statutory scheme preventing an unsuccessful congressional candidate at a primary election from having his name printed on the general election ballot as an independent for the same congressional office was upheld against a challenge that it created an additional qualification to office, as long as the candidate could run in a write-in campaign. Similarly, in 1934, a Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that a candidate who was defeated in the primary election for the office of governor could not by petition have his name printed on the general election ballot even for another office (that of U.S. Senator), finding that the statutory scheme preventing those defeated at the primary from being on the ballot in the general election did not create an additional qualification for congressional office. In the only case found voiding a \"sore loser\" law's application to a congressional candidate, the North Dakota Supreme Court in 1942 ruled that the state statute was inapplicable to congressional candidates on the basis that it impermissibly created an additional qualification for congressional office.", "The clear trend in litigation in federal courts has been favorable to state \"sore loser\" laws as a species of \"ballot access\" provisions that help states maintain the integrity of the nominating and election process by preventing \"interparty raiding,\" carrying \"intraparty feuds\" into the general election, limiting \"unrestrained factionalism,\" ballot clutter, and voter confusion. In Williams v. Tucker , a three-judge federal district court upheld the provisions of the Pennsylvania election code which worked to require a candidate to choose between a primary nomination or an independent petition route to the general election, and which barred both state and federal candidates who lost in the primary election from running again in the general election as independent candidates. The court in Williams v. Tucker relied significantly on the Supreme Court decision and reasoning in Storer v. Brown , in justifying certain state regulations on the nomination, ballot, and general election procedures. The court there found that the laws in question, \"which have the combined effect of preventing a candidate defeated in the primary from obtaining a position on the general election ballot as the candidate of a political body, do not for this reason violate the first amendment or the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.\" The reasoning of the courts in upholding the \"sore loser\" laws against First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges would appear to be similar reasoning that would apply in upholding such ballot access regulations in challenges based on \"additional qualifications\" arguments, that is, in the words of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6 th Circuit, that the \"sore loser statute ... was a 'reasonable, nondiscriminatory restriction justified by ...

It functions to winnow out and finally reject all but the chosen candidates. The state's general policy is to have contending forces within the party employ the primary campaign and primary election to finally settle their differences. The general election ballot is reserved for major struggles; it is not a forum for continuing intraparty feuds. The provision against defeated primary candidates running as independents effectuates this aim, the visible result being to prevent the losers from continuing the struggle and to limit the names on the ballot to those who have won the primaries and those independents who have properly qualified. The people, it is hoped, are presented with understandable choices and the winner in the general election with sufficient support to govern effectively.", "Section 6830(d)(Supp. 1974) carries very similar credentials. It protects the direct primary process by refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot. It works against independent candidates prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel. It is also a substantial barrier to a party fielding an \"independent\" candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party.", "...

In a case dealing with the federal Hatch Act's restriction on current postal workers running for congressional office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found in 2003 that the law did not add an additional qualification to congressional office:", "The Act allows a citizen a choice.

", "No case law has been found which has struck down any of the numerous state provisions barring dual candidacy on the ground that it adds an additional qualification for federal office. Rather, when a state provision barring multiple candidacies was upheld (against First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment challenges), the court found that the provision was a reasonable \"ballot access\" limitation which sought to prevent voter confusion, helped to eliminate ballot overcrowding, and promoted restrictions and prohibitions on dual office holding. The court's justification for upholding the statute against First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges may be relevant to potential challenges based on \"additional qualification\" arguments, since the public policy reasons cited by the court to uphold the ballot restriction are consonant with, and nearly identical to, those in cases upholding certain state restrictions and limitations as legitimate, administrative \"ballot access\" provisions as opposed to impermissible additional qualifications for office.", "Since (under dual office holding prohibitions) an individual could generally not hold two elected offices simultaneously, such a ballot restriction would diminish the need for and expense of a future \"special election\" to fill a vacancy if the individual's candidacies were successful for both offices.

In a somewhat similar manner as the \"sore loser\" laws, \"disaffiliation\" rules, and the resign-to-run laws, the dual candidacy prohibition, rather than having the purpose or effect of excluding an entire category of candidates because of their status (that is, because of some characteristic that was \"inherent in the candidate\" ), would appear to have the effect of requiring a candidate to make a choice within the candidate's control to effectuate the state's legitimate public policy purposes."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
