These programs are funded mainly by appropriations that have varied considerably from year to year. Over time the amounts are substantial. Since 2012, the Highway ER Program has received $5.4 billion; FTA's ER program has received $10.7 billion, all but $330 million of which was in response to Hurricane Sandy.", "Roads and bridges that are federal-aid highways or are public-use roads on federal lands are eligible for assistance under FHWA's ER Program. Following natural disasters (such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, which damaged highways in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), or catastrophic failures (such as the 2013 collapse of the Skagit River Bridge in Washington State), ER funds are made available for both emergency repairs and restoration of eligible facilities to conditions comparable to those before the disaster.", "Although emergency relief for highways is a federal program, the decision to seek ER funding is made by a state government or by a federal land management agency. Local governments are not eligible to apply. The program is funded by a permanent annual authorization of $100 million from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) along with general fund appropriations provided by Congress on a \"such sums as necessary\" basis. Appropriated ER funds have averaged roughly $730 million annually since FY2009. FHWA pays 100% of the cost of emergency repairs done to minimize the extent of damage, to protect remaining facilities, and to restore essential traffic during or immediately after a disaster. Emergency repairs must be completed within 180 days of the disaster event. Permanent repairs go beyond the restoration of essential traffic and are intended to restore damaged bridges and roads to conditions and capabilities comparable to those before the event. The federal share for permanent repairs is generally 80% for non-Interstate roads and 90% for Interstate Highways.", "All ER funding is distributed through state departments of transportation or federal land management agencies such as the National Park Service. Certain \"quick release\" funds are allocated to help with initial emergency repair costs and may be released prior to completion of detailed damage inspections and cost estimates. Other allocations to the states follow a more deliberate process of completing detailed damage reports, developing cost estimates, and processing competitive bids.", "Unlike the long-standing ER program in highways, the Public Transportation ER Program dates to 2012. The Public Transportation ER program provides federal funding on a reimbursement basis to public transportation agencies, states, and other government authorities for damage to public transportation facilities or operations as a result of a natural disaster or other emergency and to protect assets from future damage. The Public Transportation ER program provides federal support for both capital and operating expenses. Unlike the FHWA's ER program, FTA's ER program does not have a permanent annual authorization. All funds are authorized on a \"such sums as necessary\" basis and are available only pursuant to an appropriation from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. In the absence of an appropriation, transit agencies must rely on funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Since its creation in 2012, there have been two appropriations to the Public Transportation ER program. More than $10 billion was appropriated in 2013 to respond to Hurricane Sandy and $330 million was appropriated in 2018 to respond to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.", "Two recurring issues drawing congressional attention are funding levels and funding of activities that go beyond restoring transportation facilities to predisaster conditions, such as making damaged highways more resilient to natural disasters. FTA's ER program has fewer limits and more flexibility than the emergency relief programs administered by FEMA and FHWA; thus it too faces questions about expenditures that go beyond repairing damage from a disaster. The lack of a permanent annual authorization for FTA means FTA cannot provide funding immediately after a disaster or emergency, and transit agencies must rely on FEMA for a quick response."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Disaster-damaged roads and public transportation systems are eligible for federal assistance under two U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, the Emergency Relief (ER) Program administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Public Transportation ER Program administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

From 1956 through 1978, funding for the program was drawn 40% from the Treasury's general fund revenues and 60% from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The HTF is supported primarily by taxes paid by highway users, mainly on gasoline and diesel fuel. Starting in 1979, the ER program was funded 100% from the HTF. In 1998 Congress made the annual $100 million HTF authorization permanent. However, beginning in 2005, while Congress continued the $100 million permanent authorization from the HTF, it authorized supplemental appropriations from the general fund. On December 4, 2015, the ER program was reauthorized through FY2020 in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94 ).", "ER funds may be used for the repair and reconstruction of federal-aid highways and roads on federally owned lands that have suffered serious damage as a result of either (1) a natural disaster over a wide area, such as a flood, hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake, tornado, severe storm, or landslide; or (2) a catastrophic failure from any external cause (for example, the collapse of a bridge that is struck by a barge). Historically, however, the vast majority of ER funds have gone for repair and reconstruction following natural disasters.", "As is true with most other FHWA programs, the ER program is administered through state departments of transportation in close coordination with FHWA's division offices in each state. The decision to seek financial assistance under the program is made by state departments of transportation, not by the federal government. Local officials who wish to seek ER funding must do so through their state departments of transportation; they do not deal directly with FHWA.

This program addresses disaster damage to facilities such as National Park Service roads, U.S. Forest Service roads, and tribal transportation facilities. FHWA dispenses these funds through the various federal land management agencies, not the states. Aid is restricted to facilities that are open to the general public for use with a standard passenger vehicle. FHWA pays 100% of the cost of approved repairs, but the program is designed to pay for unusually heavy expenses and to supplement the agencies' repair programs, not to cover all repair costs.

These funds are not subject to the annual obligation limitation placed on most highway funding by appropriators, which generally means the entire $100 million is available each year, although the funding could be subject to sequester. Because the costs of road repair and reconstruction following disasters typically exceed the $100 million annual authorization, the FAST Act authorizes the appropriation of additional funds on a \"such sums as may be necessary\" basis, generally accomplished in either annual or emergency supplemental appropriations legislation. For a listing of ER appropriations since 1998, see the Appendix . These funds are available until expended.", "As is true with other FHWA programs, ER is a reimbursable program. A state receives payment only after making repairs and submitting vouchers to FHWA for reimbursement of the federal share. However, once the state's eligibility for ER funds has been confirmed by FHWA, it can incur obligations knowing that it will receive reimbursement.", "The ER funding structure of having a modest annual authorization supplemented by appropriations addressed the fact that small disaster events occur every year but large disasters do not. However, the $100 million annual authorization has not changed since 1972. To equal the current purchasing power of $100 million in FY1972 would require an authorization in the neighborhood of $500 million to $600 million. Because the value of the $100 million permanent authorization has diminished over time, the program has become increasingly dependent on supplemental appropriations. Over the last 10 fiscal years, $7.3 billion in supplemental appropriations have been provided in six appropriations acts. Roughly 12% of the total amount made available was provided by the permanent annual authorization; the other 88% was provided in appropriations acts. Consequently, an issue for Congress in the upcoming reauthorization of the FAST Act, which expires in FY2020, is whether to raise the permanent annual authorization to account for its loss of value since 1972 or to continue to rely heavily on supplemental appropriations to fund emergency repairs to highways."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Share", "paragraphs": ["Emergency repairs to restore essential travel, minimize the extent of damage, or protect remaining facilities, if accomplished within 180 days after the disaster, may be reimbursed with a 100% federal share.

For Interstate System highways the federal share would be 90%, and for most other highways, including Federal Lands Access Program facilities, the share would be 80%. If the total expenses a state incurs to deal with disaster-damaged roads in a fiscal year exceed the state's total federal-aid highway formula funds for that year, the share becomes \"up to 90%\" for any federal-aid road. The requirement that the state provide a share of the funding for permanent repairs applies whether or not the repairs are completed during the first 180 days after the disaster.", "Congress has on occasion authorized FHWA to pay 100% of ER program expenses for repair and reconstruction projects related to particular disasters.

Only repairs on federal-aid highways or federally owned roads and bridges that have suffered damage during a declared disaster or catastrophic failure are eligible for ER assistance. The intent of ER assistance is to restore highway facilities to conditions comparable to those before the disaster, not to increase capacity or fix non-disaster-related deficiencies. However, current law broadly defines \"comparable facility\" as one that \"meets the current geometric and construction standards required for the types and volume of traffic that the facility will carry over its design life.\" Thus, for example, ER funds could be used to rebuild an older disaster-damaged road or bridge that had narrow lanes with wider lanes that meet current FHWA guidelines.", "FHWA's ER handbook also directs that \"design and construction of repairs should consider the long-term resilience of the facility.\" FHWA defines resilience as the \"capability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment.\"", "In regard to bridges, ER funds are not to be used if the construction phase of a replacement structure has already been included in the state's approved transportation improvement program at the time of the disaster or if the bridge had been permanently closed to vehicular traffic prior to the disaster.", "Contracts supported by ER funding must meet all conditions required by 23 C.F.R.

This means that emergency repairs are normally classified as categorical exclusions under 23 C.F.R. Section 771.117 (c)(9), as are projects to permanently restore an existing facility \"in kind\" to its predisaster condition. \"Betterments\" (e.g., added protective features, added lanes, added access control) may, in some cases, require NEPA review.", "States must apply and provide a comprehensive list of all eligible project sites and repair costs within two years of the disaster or catastrophic event."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Emergency Repairs", "paragraphs": ["State and local transportation agencies can begin emergency repairs during or immediately following a disaster to meet the program goals to \"restore essential traffic, to minimize the extent of damage, or to protect the remaining facilities.\" Prior approval from FHWA is not required.

To be eligible for a 100% federal share, emergency repair work must be completed within 180 days of the disaster, although FHWA may extend this time period if there is a delay in access to the damaged areas, for example due to flooding. Examples of emergency repairs are regrading roads, removal of landslides, construction of temporary road detours, erection of temporary detour bridges, and use of ferries as an interim substitute for highway or bridge service. Debris removal is generally the responsibility of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Debris removal from tribal transportation facilities, federal land transportation facilities, and on other federally owned roads open to public travel is eligible for funding under the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads program. The emergency repair provisions in the ER program are designed to permit work to start immediately, ahead of a finding of eligibility and programming of a project.

If a bridge is destroyed or repair is not feasible, then ER funds may participate in building a new, comparable bridge to current design standards and to accommodate traffic volume projected over its design life. In some cases betterments may be eligible, but they must be shown to be economically justified based on a cost/benefit analysis of the future savings in recurring repair costs.", "Permanent repair and reconstruction contracts not classified as emergency repairs must meet competitive bidding requirements. A number of techniques are available to accelerate projects, including design-build contracting, abbreviated plans, shortened advertisement periods for bids, and cost-plus-time (A+B) bidding that includes monetary incentive/disincentive clauses designed to encourage contractors to complete projects ahead of time.

A broader issue, which may influence the states' reluctance to agree with the withdrawal of unused allocations, is the \"available until expended\" nature of the ER funding. Federal-Aid Highway formula funds are generally available for obligation for only four years. This difference could encourage some states to commit their limited matching state funds to non-ER projects first for fear of having their Federal-Aid Highway funding expire.

Congress could consider placing a time limit on the availability of ER funds for obligation to encourage states to prioritize the obligation of funds to ER projects.", "Since the release of the reports, legal and procedural changes have mitigated some of GAO's concerns.

GAO found that some Hurricane Sandy funding awards were for projects that were probably outside the scope of the program. Consequently, GAO recommended a better alignment of program purposes with project evaluation and selection, and an examination of funded projects for duplication with other efforts to improve resilience."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
