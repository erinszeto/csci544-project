Agriculture uses energy directly as fuel or electricity to operate machinery and equipment, to heat or cool buildings, and for lighting on the farm, and indirectly in the fertilizers and chemicals produced off the farm. In 2002, the U.S. agricultural sector used an estimated 1.7 quadrillion Btu of energy from both direct (1.1 quadrillion Btu) and indirect (0.6 quadrillion Btu) sources. However, agriculture's total use of energy is low relative to other U.S. producing sectors. In 2002, agriculture's share of total U.S. direct energy consumption was about 1%. Agriculture's shares of nitrogen and pesticide use\u2014two of the major indirect agricultural uses identified by the U.S. Dept of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014are significantly higher at about 56% and 67%, respectively.", "U.S. farm production\u2014whether for crop or animal products\u2014has become increasingly mechanized and requires timely energy supplies at particular stages of the production cycle to achieve optimum yields. Energy's share of agricultural production expenses varies widely by activity, production practice, and locality. Since the late 1970s, total agricultural use of energy has fallen by about 28%, as a result of efficiency gains related to improved machinery, equipment, and production practices. Despite these efficiency gains, total energy costs of $28.8 billion in 2003 represented 14.4% (5.2% direct and 9.3% indirect) of annual production expenses of $198.9 billion. As a result, unexpected changes in energy prices or availability can substantially alter farm net revenues, particularly for major field crop production.", "High fuel and fertilizer prices in 2004, and increasing energy import dependence for petroleum fuels and nitrogen fertilizers has led to concerns about the impact this would have on agriculture. High natural gas prices have already contributed to a substantial reduction in U.S. nitrogen fertilizer production capacity\u2014over a 23% decline from 1998 through 2003. In the short run, price- or supply-related disruptions to agriculture's energy supplies could result in unanticipated shifts in the production of major crop and livestock products, with subsequent effects on farm incomes and rural economies. In the long run, a sustained rise in energy prices may have serious consequences on energy-intensive industries like agriculture by reducing profitability and driving resources away from the sector.", "This report provides information relevant to the U.S. agricultural sector on energy use, emerging issues, and related legislation.

First, most natural gas is transported via pipeline. Lack of pipeline access limits the viability of offshore natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, where supplies are relatively abundant. Additionally, the pipeline requirement limits access to international supplies other than from neighboring Canada and Mexico. Second, the alternative to pipeline transport of natural gas is liquefication into liquefied natural gas (LNG), where transportation is more feasible.

As mentioned earlier, natural gas accounts for a substantial portion (75% to 90%) of nitrogen fertilizer production costs, either directly as a feedstock or indirectly as a fuel to generate the electricity needed in production. U.S. fertilizer manufacturers are at a competitive disadvantage when domestic natural gas prices rise. Natural gas prices in foreign countries with major nitrogen production capabilities tend to be well below U.S. prices. For example, in early 2001, when U.S. prices for natural gas were about $5 per million Btu, the price of gas in the Middle East was 60\u00a2 per million Btu; 40\u00a2 in North Africa; 70\u00a2 in Russia; and 50\u00a2 in Venezuela.", "As with natural gas, the federal government does not set or control prices for nitrogen fertilizer. Furthermore, nitrogen fertilizer products imported from other countries are generally not subject to U.S. trade restrictions such as quotas or tariffs.", "U.S. fertilizer manufacturers can respond to periodic natural gas price spikes by closing plants temporarily, and resuming production when prices drop again. But higher prices sustained over the long run likely result in permanent loss of domestic production capacity. In recent years, high domestic natural gas prices have resulted in the idling and/or closing of a significant share of U.S. nitrogen production capacity. In 1998, U.S. ammonia plant production capacity was 21.4 million tons. From 1998/99 to 2003/04, 3.5 million tons of ammonia plant production capacity was closed and another 1.5 million tons was idled, leaving 16.3 million tons (76.5%) of active production capacity.

They suggest that increased access to federal lands that are currently off-limits to drilling and greater tax incentives for drilling could bolster domestic natural gas production. Alternately, they contend that relaxing environmental restrictions on coal plants, extending or expediting nuclear and hydro licenses, promoting use of clean coal technology, and prohibiting or taxing the use of natural gas as a fuel in power generating permits could all reduce domestic demand for natural gas as an energy source for power generation. However, a broad range of environmentalist organizations, renewable energy advocates, and urban pollution control groups decry these suggestions.", "In September 2003, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) produced a report, Balancing Natural Gas Policy , that examined the policy options to address the problem of high natural gas prices.

Because individual farmers are \"price-takers\" and lack the capacity to quickly pass on higher costs through the food marketing chain, net farm income likely would be reduced in the short term by the equivalent amount of any rise in production expenses. Assuming composite fuel (natural gas, gasoline, diesel, etc.) and electricity prices are 21% higher, fertilizer prices are about 10% higher, and pesticide prices are unchanged (in accordance with the USDA PPI), then total energy costs would be about $3.6 billion (or 8.4%) higher in 2004 than originally projected. Assuming roughly similar energy usage rates, this would represent a direct reduction from net cash income. However, the higher fuel costs would likely ripple through several other production expenditure categories such as marketing costs and custom services, further cutting into the agricultural sector's net returns. The bottom line is that the agricultural sector will likely feel the pinch of higher energy prices directly in the form of substantially lower net cash income than originally projected in 2004.

However, in the short run (within a single growing season), once crops have been planted and major inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, and fuels) have been purchased, a producer's response to energy and fertilizer cost increases may be fairly limited.", "If an energy price change is perceived as permanent, a producer is more likely to adjust the farm's activity mix and production practices from one season to the next to compensate for the new revenue-cost structure.", "Economic studies have attempted to measure year-to-year producer responsiveness to changes in prices. In the aggregate, studies suggest that a 10% rise in fuel prices is associated with about a 6% decline in use. Fertilizer and pesticide use are also negatively related to changes in their prices. A 10% rise in prices induces a 6.6% decrease in fertilizer use and a 5.3% decline in pesticide use. As with energy use, changes in fertilizer and pesticide use may be obtained by switching to less intensive production methods, or to crops that use fewer inputs. However, the ability for a producer to implement such changes is greatly diminished once a crop is planted and the production strategy has been set in motion. Instead, producers tend to respond to input price changes by altering their crop and activity mix from season to season.
