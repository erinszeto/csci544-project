Other key food assistance programs\u2014costing a total of over $20 billion in FY2009\u2014include The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), child nutrition programs (like the school meal programs), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program).

SNAP participation jumped from 31.1 million persons in 14.0 million households in November 2008 to 38.2 million persons in 17.5 million households in November 2009 (the most recent available figures). Monthly spending on SNAP benefits (entirely funded with federal dollars) also rose dramatically from $3.6 billion in November 2008 to $5.1 billion in November 2009. For FY2010, the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate that total SNAP spending (including benefits and the federal share of administrative costs) will be at least $69 billion, with average monthly participation of almost 41 million persons\u2014up from $53.8 billion and 33.7 million persons in FY2009. ", "TEFAP supplies emergency feeding organizations (such as food banks and soup kitchens) with food commodities acquired by the USDA; these USDA donations typically make up 20%-25% of the food distributed by these organizations. It also provides cash payments to help states and feeding organizations with their distribution costs. Direct information as to recent increases in the number of persons served by recipient organizations supported by the TEFAP commodity donations is not available. However, Feeding America, an organization serving over 200 food banks, reported a 21% increase in the amount of food distributed between June 2008 and June 2009 and anticipates continued increases. In FY2009, TEFAP provided some $710 million worth of commodities and $89 million in distribution cost assistance, up from a total of $420 million in FY2008. In FY2010, TEFAP support may drop with the expiration of extra funding supplied by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (discussed later in this report), unless \"bonus\" commodities donated from USDA stocks acquired for farm support purposes make up the difference. ", "The two main child nutrition programs\u2014the School Lunch program and the School Breakfast program\u2014give schools cash subsidies and USDA-acquired commodities that help them cover the cost of providing school meals. Participating schools must provide free or reduced-price meals to children from low-income families. Between November 2008 and November 2009, the number of children receiving free lunches went up by 6.4% (to 17.2 million) and the number of children eating free breakfasts climbed by nearly 7% (to 8.7 million)\u2014substantially outpacing the increase in total school enrollment. In FY2009, school meal programs and other child nutrition efforts cost some $15.4 billion, up from $14.7 billion in FY2008.

At the time the ARRA was enacted, the CBO estimated that the cost of these changes would be $10.8 billion in the first two years (FY2009 and FY2010). However, because SNAP participation is rising faster than the CBO projected, FY2009-FY2010 (and possibly future) costs will very likely be greater.", "SNAP benefits were increased significantly, time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents were suspended, and states received extra federal funding for administrative costs. ", "Monthly SNAP allotments are based on the estimated cost of a minimally adequate diet. This means that the benefit for any recipient household equals the inflation-indexed cost of USDA's \"Thrifty Food Plan\" (the maximum benefit), varied by household size and adjusted for household income. In recognition of the possibility of unanticipated food-price inflation and the other needs of recipient households, the ARRA provided an across-the-board increase in SNAP benefits (effective in April 2009). This add-on was accomplished through raising, by 13.6%, the base Thrifty Food Plan amounts normally used to calculate benefits. It effectively boosted each recipient household's monthly benefit by an amount equal to 13.6% of the maximum benefit for its size. For a one-person household, the added benefit was $24 a month; for two persons, $44 a month; for three persons (the typical household), $63 a month; for four persons $80 a month; and for larger households, higher amounts. As a result, monthly average household benefits were increased by nearly 20% (about $20 a person). In FY2009, ARRA-provided SNAP benefits accounted for $4.3 billion in spending (about 15% of all benefit costs). In November 2009, ARRA-provided benefits totaled over $800 million (16% of benefit costs). For FY2010 and FY2011, the Administration estimates that ARRA-provided benefits will total $10.5 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively\u2014reflecting both the ARRA add-on and increased participation. SNAP law limits eligibility for most able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least half-time to 3 months out of every 36 months (without regard to their financial status). Reacting to high unemployment rates, the ARRA effectively suspends this requirement for those who cannot find a job through FY2010. While SNAP benefit costs are entirely a federal responsibility, states operating the SNAP share administrative costs with the federal government. Approximately half of administrative costs are picked up by states\u2014some $3 billion a year. As noted above, participation in the SNAP is rising dramatically, leading to higher administrative costs, which states are having difficulty meeting.

To date, 27 states and two territories have taken advantage of this option, to one degree or another. The Food and Nutrition Service has the authority to grant states waivers of the requirement that households have a face-to-face interview when their initial eligibility is determined and when they are up for recertification of eligibility.
