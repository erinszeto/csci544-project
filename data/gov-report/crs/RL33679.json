", "Section 3771 is the product of a long effort to afford greater deference to victims in the criminal justice process. It is akin to the victims' bill of rights provisions found in the laws of the various states and augments a fairly wide variety of preexisting federal victims' rights legislation. Its enactment followed closely on the heels of discontinued efforts to pass a victims' rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Section 3371 borrows extensively from the language in the federal restitution statutes, which seems appropriate since, in the case of restitution, it simply serves as a reminder of the rights they supply, that is, \"the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\"", "The statute has remained but with few changes since its enactment in 2004. Soon thereafter, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 clarified its application in habeas corpus proceedings. More recently, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 added the two new rights which appear in italics above. It also resolved a split among the lower federal appellate courts over the mandamus standard of review to be applied when victims seek to vindicate on appeal a denial of their rights. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Legal reform in the name of the victims of crime began to appear in state and federal law in the 1960s. It can be seen in victim restitution and compensation laws; in the reform of rape laws, drunk driving statutes, and bail laws; and in provisions for victim impact statements at sentencing, to name a few. Over time in many jurisdictions, these specific victim provisions were joined by a more general, more comprehensive victims' bills of rights. Thus, by the close of the 20 th century, 33 states had added a victims' rights amendment to their state constitutions, and each of the states had a general statutory declaration of victims' rights.", "In the meantime, Congress had enacted a series of individual victims' rights provisions as well as a general aspirational federal statute directed to the performance of federal officials. Section 10606 was accompanied by a statement of the sense of Congress encouraging similar action by the states and by specific directions to the heads of the various federal law enforcement departments and agencies for implementation, both of which remain in effect.", "In addition, beginning in the 104 th Congress, both houses regularly considered victims' rights amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Unable to reach the consensus necessary for passage, sponsors opted for a statutory substitute, which unlike the \"best-efforts\" preexisting statute, included enforcement mechanisms. The legislation, S. 2329 \u2014the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Right Act\u2014was introduced in the Senate on April 21, 2004, and passed the following day. The House merged an amended version of S. 2329 with DNA proposals in H.R. 5107 , the Justice for All Act, which it passed on October 6, 2004. The Senate passed H.R. 5107 unamended three days later, and the President signed it on October 30, 2004. The implementing amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including Rule 60 (victims' rights), became effective on December 1, 2008.

In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under this chapter, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such guardian or representative.", "The definition of \"victim,\" the question of deciding who should be afforded rights and who should not be, was one of the issues that over the years fired debate during consideration of proposals to amend the U.S. Constitution. The amendment proposals in the 108 th Congress ( S.J.Res. 1 / H.J.Res. 48 ) opted not to include a specific definition of victim, but referred to the rights as those of the \"victims of violent crimes.\" In doing so, they excluded the victims of fraud, regardless of how extensive or devastating the crime, a result some Members considered unsatisfactory. ", "Section 3771 suffers no such limitation. Instead, it borrowed language from the federal restitution statutes, 18 U.S.C. 3663 and 18 U.S.C. 3663A, which, then as now, define a victim as \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\" Section 3771 adopted the restitution provisions' representational language as well. However, it has nothing comparable to the explicit provision for schemes or conspiracies found in the restitution statutes. Section 3771 is otherwise explicitly more expansive. It encompasses all federal crimes and those of the District of Columbia. The restitution statutes, on the other hand, are more limited. These differences notwithstanding, the courts have consulted their experience under the restitution statutes when construing the definition of victim for purposes of the victims' rights statute. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Persons", "paragraphs": ["Section 3771 and the restitution statutes speak of victims who are \"persons\" (\"'crime victim' means a person\"). Although in common parlance, this might be thought to restrict the class of victims to human beings, general usage within the United States Code is to the contrary. Unless the context suggests another intent, the word \"person\" as used in the United States Code is understood to \"include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies as well as individuals.\"", "Earlier restitution cases rejected arguments that only human beings could be \"victims.\" Perhaps because the question is considered settled, the argument has disappeared, and later courts have regularly found restitution appropriate for legal entities without commenting upon their want of human status. Section 3771's coverage of legal entities seems to have been generally assumed and with little explicit discussion. ", "The universal definition of person in 1 U.S.C. 1 does not mention governmental entities, but they too have been found qualified for restitution under the appropriate circumstances. The 2011 AG Guidelines take the position that governmental entities are not eligible for \"court enforceable rights,\" but may be entitled to restitution. Section 3771's limited available case law indicates that a governmental entity is not a person entitled to victim's rights under the statute.

United States . The implication might have been that restitution was appropriate where the loss would not have occurred but for the offense conviction. Subsequent amendments both expanded and contracted on that implication. Not all persons who suffer a loss as the direct result of an offense are considered victims for purposes of the restitution statutes. The loss must be directly and proximately caused by the offense. This means: ", "[f]irst: [r]estitution should not be ordered in respect to a loss which would not have occurred regardless of the defendant's conduct [i.e., losses that are not direct]. Second: Even if but for causation is acceptable theory, limitless but for causation is not. Restitution should not lie if the conduct underlying the offense of conviction is too far removed, either factually or temporally, from the loss [i.e., if the offense is not proximate to the loss]. ", "A loss caused in part by intervening circumstances cannot be said to have been directly and proximately caused by the offense of conviction, unless the intervening cause is related to or a foreseeable consequence of that offense of conviction. But the restitution statutes enlarge the victim definition by including those directly harmed by an offense one of whose elements is a \"scheme, conspiracy or pattern.\" Section 3771 features the restitution statutes' \"direct and proximate\" cause language, without the \"scheme, conspiracy, or pattern\" component.", "Section 3771's use of the phrase \"directly and proximately harmed\" nevertheless \"encompasses the traditional 'but for' and proximate cause analyses.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crime Charged", "paragraphs": ["Under the restitution statutes, restitution is available only for harm caused by the crime of conviction. With the exception of victims of crimes committed in furtherance of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern conviction, victims of offenses, other than the crime of conviction, are not entitled to restitution even if they were victims of offenses that were initially charged with the crime of conviction or are indisputably related to the crime of conviction.", "The same cannot be said of the victims' rights statute. Section 3771 is focused on the activities and proceedings involving the victimizing offense before and after conviction; the restitution sections are focused on the victimizing offense of conviction. Section 3771 and the restitution statutes are similar, however, in that persons\u2014harmed by crimes other than those of conviction in the case of the restitution statutes or other than those which are the subject of a particular proceeding in the case of the victims' rights statute\u2014are unlikely to be able to claim the benefits of a victim. In particular in both instances, individuals may lose or never acquire the benefit of victim status during the course of criminal proceedings, if charges covering the crimes of which they are the victim are dropped, dismissed, or never filed, even though related crimes are or continue to be prosecuted. ", "The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel believes that \"the CVRA is best read as providing that the rights identified in section 3771(a) are guaranteed from the time that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, information, or indictment) and cease to be available if all charges are dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the Government declines to bring formal charges after the filing of a complaint).\" The 2011 AG Guidelines make the same point: \"[T]he particular charges filed in a case will define the group of individuals with CVRA rights.... Absent a conviction, a victim's CVRA rights cease when charges pertaining to that victim are dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits, or if the government declines to bring formal charges after filing a complaint.\"", "Congress responded to the OLC opinion with a 2015 amendment which assures victims of the right to notification of plea and deferred prosecution agreements.

It implies that one of the parents and other relatives of an adult homicide victim may assume the victim's rights, but otherwise they are entitled to none of the rights found in the statute. This is not the case. Family members do not lose their status as victims by virtue of the possible appointment of a representative of the incapacitated or deceased victim.", "The 2011 AG Guidelines simply paraphrase the statutory language and thus do not weigh in on the issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crimes Under What Law", "paragraphs": ["Various past proposed constitutional amendments would have covered the victims of crimes committed in violation of state law, the United States Code , the Code of Military Justice, the District of Columbia Code, and/or U.S. territorial codes. Section 3771 is more modest. It applies to the victims harmed as a result of \"the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.\" It clearly does not apply to the victims of state crimes. Section 3771 should probably not be read to extend rights to the victims of the crimes proscribed in any of the territorial codes and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The courts are likely to conclude that Congress did not intend to cover victims of offenses under these codes, since they had been expressly included in earlier proposed victims' rights amendments to the Constitution; since these codes frequently have a victims' rights provision; and since the victims of DC crimes are specifically mentioned. ", "Section 3771 apparently does cover victims of juvenile delinquency with respect to misconduct that in the case of an adult offender would have been a violation of federal or DC law. Section 3771 rights with respect to juvenile proceedings, however, may depend upon whether the juvenile proceedings are open or closed.

", "A corporation or other legal entity may incur criminal liability by virtue of the misconduct of a rogue officer or employee.

Section 3771's components can be traced to a comparable provision in the 108 th Congress-proposed constitutional amendments in most instances. This one is a little different. The constitutional amendment proposals spoke of a right to have judicial decisions made with an eye to victim safety. The previous language focused on \"adjudicative decisions\"; the new language has no such limitation. The earlier language seemed to impose an obligation to guard against threats to victim safety, from whatever source; the new language establishes a right to the victim to be protected against the accused. Use of the term \"accused\" and portions of the scant legislative history might be read to imply that the right expires with the conviction of the accused, at which point he would ordinarily be referred to as the offender. Nevertheless, the colloquy on the floor between two of the principal Senate sponsors ended with the comment that they considered the term \"accused\" to mean \"convicted\" as well. But earlier in their discussion, they summarized the right simply using a trial protection example.", "The clause appears to have been the subject of little judicial construction. One court understood the term \"accused\" to mean that the right does not attach until a person has been \"accused by criminal complaint, information or indictment.\" A second court observed that \"[r]egardless of what this right might entail outside the bail context, it appears to add no new substance to the protection of crime victims afforded by the Bail Reform Act, which already allows a court to order reasonable conditions of release or the detention of an accused defendant to 'assure ... the safety of any other person.'\" (18 U.S.C. 3142(c)(1)). As will be noted below, victims elsewhere in Section 3771 are entitled to notice and to be heard with respect to the release of an accused. Moreover, the protection clause provided the stimulus for an amendment to Rules 12.1 and 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the disclosure of the addresses and telephone numbers of government witnesses and to subpoenas for personal or confidential information about victims, respectively.

Section 3771's notification rights are subject to several limitations, some explicit, some implicit. The section explicitly excuses a failure to notify victims of the release of an accused when to do so might be dangerous, and it permits the courts to seek reasonable accommodations when the number of victims in a given case precludes strict compliance with the section's demands.", "The implicit limitation is constitutional. Under some circumstances, the manner in which notice is provided may intrude upon the rights of the accused to an impartial jury trial or other constitutional rights of the accused. Under such circumstances, the statutory rights of the victim must yield.", "There is also an omission. Section 3771 does not give victims the right to notification of their rights; it merely imposes an obligation upon government officials to \"make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified\" of them.", "This notification of the rights was a component of the early constitutional amendment proposals, which followed the lead of several state constitutions and statutes. It was originally seen as a victim's counterpart to the Miranda warnings enjoyed by an accused and as a prerequisite if the proposed amendments were to function effectively. There were objections, however, that the warnings were out of character with the other rights conveyed by the Constitution and might pose implementation problems\u2014objections that apparently ultimately prevailed, since the provision was not included in later proposals.", "Section 3771(a)(2)'s notice clause, in this respect and others, is essentially the same as its forerunner in the 108 th Congress resolutions to amend the Constitution. It differs slightly in that it makes special provisions for parole proceedings and insists that notice be \"accurate\" as well as \"reasonable and timely.\" Moreover, unlike its predecessors, the clause is accompanied by language that imposes an obligation on the government to advise victims of their rights under the section and to inform them that they may consult an attorney concerning those rights.", "The notice clause has several distinctive features:", "the notice rights apply only with respect to public court proceedings and parole proceedings ; the rights attach to those proceedings involving the crime but not necessarily to all those related to the crime; victims are entitled to reasonable, accurate and timely notice; and victims are entitled to notice of the release or escape only of the accused."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Proceedings", "paragraphs": ["The public proceedings limitation has been a feature of the victims' rights proposals for some time.

Some proceedings, such as grand jury investigations, are not open to the public and accordingly would not be open to the victim. Other proceedings, while generally open, may be closed in some circumstances. For example, while plea proceedings are generally open to the public, a court might decide to close a proceeding in which an organized crime underling would plead guilty and agree to testify against his bosses. See 28 C.F.R. 50.9. Another example is provided by certain national security cases in which access to some proceedings can be restricted. See 'The Classified Information Procedures Act' 18 U.S.C. App.3. A victim would have no special right to attend.

The phrase clearly contemplates more than trial. Pretrial and post-trial hearings involving motions to dismiss, to suppress evidence, to change venue, to grant a new trial, and any of the host of similar proceedings that flow to or from a criminal trial seem to come within the meaning of the term. The Senate reports' discussion of proceedings \" related to the crime\" in earlier versions, for instance, specifically mentioned appellate proceedings.", "The same reports indicate that at least at one time covered release proceedings were understood to include those involving \"a release [from custody] of a defendant found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity and then hospitalized in custody for further treatment,\" Crime relatedness, understood in such terms, would presumably carry victim notice rights to a fairly wide range of civil and quasi-civil proceedings (e.g., habeas and civil forfeiture proceedings, and extradition hearings, to name but a few).", "Historical proposals, which speak in terms of \"proceedings related to the crime,\" were thought to perhaps embody notice rights for the victims of a defendant's past crimes, and victims of charges that had been dropped or dismissed, as well as victims of charges that had resulted in acquittal.

Under pre-addition proposals it was unclear whether reasonableness was to be judged by the level of official effort or by the effectiveness of the effort. The Senate reports noted that heroic efforts were not expected but due diligence was. But the obvious purpose for the right to notice was to provide a gateway to the amendment's other rights. Even without the addition of the clarifying \"timely\" requirement, what was reasonable might have been judged by whether the efforts were calculated to permit meaningful exercise of the amendment's other rights.", "The Senate reports, however, explained that in rare circumstances notice by publication might be reasonable, although if judged by existing due process standards such notice might not have been adequate in ordinary circumstances. Notice given after a proceeding was conducted might have seemed unreasonable because the want of timely notice might constitute an effective exclusion from the proceedings or might defeat the right to make a victim impact statement. The addition of a timeliness requirement seems to reduce the possibility of \"reasonable\" but untimely notification. The same might be said for the new demand that notice be \"accurate.\" It might seem difficult to imagine how notice could be considered either timely or reasonable, if for want of accuracy it effectively defeated a victim's opportunity to exercise his or her rights.

The section grants both a right to consideration of the victim's safety and a right to reasonable notice, attendance, and comment. Under earlier circumstances it might not be unusual for an accused to be released on recognizance or bail before authorities could reasonably be expected to provide victims with timely notice. It may be that the section contemplates postponement of the accused's initial judicial appearance until after victims can be notified and can be given a reasonable period of time to prepare and present their views.", "Early constitutional amendment proposals seemed to explicitly anticipate that a failure of timely notice in a bail context could be rectified by recourse to the provision in the amendment that permitted the bail decision to be revisited at the behest of a victim.

In other federal criminal cases, victims may be excluded from trial only as constitutionally required.", "Section 3771(a)(3) is more limited than the constitutional amendment proposals, which with early exceptions afforded a general right not to be excluded. It was suggested that the phrase \"not to be excluded\" in the amendment proposals was used to avoid the claims that the proposal would entitle victims to transportation to relevant proceedings or to have proceedings scheduled for their convenience or to free them from imprisonment to attend proceedings. In this it would be unlike a defendant's right to attend.

Nor do I think the use of the term 'reasonably to be heard' would alter that interpretation; instead, I believe courts would likely reconcile the two changes by interpreting \"reasonably\" to mean that a victim's oral statement could be subjected to reasonable time and subject matter restrictions.

Because the difference between the previous and current versions of the Amendment suggest that a victim must be allowed specifically to be \"heard\" rather than simply to \"submit a statement\", a victim might persuade a court that the \"reasonable opportunity to be heard\" guaranteed by the current version of the Amendment carries with it an implicit guarantee that the government will take affirmative steps, if necessary, to provide such a reasonable opportunity. This undermines the intent of the Amendment's careful use of negative phrasing with respect to the right not to be excluded from public proceedings\u2014a formulation designed to avoid a government obligation to provide funding, to schedule the timing of a particular proceeding according to a victim's wishes, or otherwise assert affirmative effort to make it possible for a victim to attend proceedings.

Later versions simply conveyed a right to be heard at public release proceedings. The clear implication was that under the later proposals victims had no right to be heard at closed parole hearings, regardless of whether the inmate had a right to be heard. On the other hand, the new formulation seemed to open a wider range of proceedings to victim allocution.", "There was always some ambiguity over whether conditional release proceedings meant proceedings where release might be granted if certain conditions were met before release, like acquittal at trial, or proceedings where release bound the accused or convicted offender to honor certain conditions after release, like bail, or both. In any event, in bygone proposals the Senate Judiciary Committee read \"conditional\" in the phrase \" conditional release from custody ,\" as a word of limitation:", "The amendment extends the right to be heard to proceedings determining a \"conditional release\" from custody. This phrase encompasses, for example, hearings to determine any pretrial or post trial release (including comparable releases during or after an appeal) on bail, personal recognizance, to the custody of a third person, or under any other conditions, including pretrial diversion programs. Other examples of conditional release include work release and home detention. It also includes parole hearings or their functional equivalent, both because parole hearings have some discretion in releasing offenders and because releases from prison are typically subject to various conditions such as continued good behavior. It would also include a release from a secure mental facility for a criminal defendant or one acquitted on the grounds of insanity. A victim would not have a right to speak, by virtue of this amendment, at a hearing to determine \"unconditional\" release. For example, a victim could not claim a right to be heard at a hearing to determine the jurisdiction of the court or compliance with the governing statute of limitations, even though a finding in favor of the defendant on these points might indirectly and ultimately lead to the \"release\" of the defendant. Similarly, there is no right to be heard when a prisoner is released after serving the statutory maximum penalty, or the full term of his sentence. There would be proceeding to \"determine\" a release in such situations and the release would also be without condition if the court's authority over the prisoner had expired. ", "Thus, by removing the words \"conditional\" and \"from custody,\" the proposals and consequently Section 3771 perhaps should be understood to allow victims the right to be heard on most pretrial motions as well as most post-trial, pre-appellate petitions, or at least any that might result in a release of the accused or the convicted offender from jeopardy. For example, it might support an argument that the section gives victims the right be heard at trial by the trier of fact (judge or jury) on whether the defendant should or should not be convicted on any of the charges at issue (i.e., at least limited trial participation, although the committee report denied any such intent).", "It may seem more logical to suggest that proceedings to which the right attaches are only those where the issue of whether the defendant should be released is squarely addressed\u2014bail proceedings and habeas proceedings under 28 U.S.C. 2255\u2014and not proceedings where the issues addressed may be resolved in a manner that leads to the defendant's release. Yet at least one commentator has suggested that the right to be heard in release proceedings includes the right to be heard upon motions to dismiss charges. The comment comes in a discussion of the changes in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure appropriate to implement the section. Under one such proposed change, the court would be required to consider the views of the victim before it ruled on a motion to dismiss charges, a \"proposed change [which] would implement a victim's right to be 'treated with fairness' and to be heard at any proceeding 'involving release' of the defendant.\" The same logic would appear to support a victim's right to be heard in suppression hearings and other pretrial motions.", "Section 3771(a)(4)'s reach does not seem to extent to all proceedings, regardless of how expansively \"release\" is construed.

At least one court has expressed the view that \"the provision requires at least some proactive procedure designed to ensure victims' rights,\" while noting the apparent primacy of the right to attend. The trial court's obligation to \"ensure\" victims' rights seems to set its responsibilities a notch above the \"best efforts\" level of obligation imposed upon other officials.", "In a Federal habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a State conviction, the court shall ensure that a crime victim is afforded the rights described in paragraphs (3), (4), (7), and (8) of subsection (a).", "The history of the proposed constitutional amendments sheds little light on the scope of the provision since habeas corpus language dropped out of the proposals early on. Section 3771(b)(2), moreover, was not part of the original legislation, but was inserted by the Adam Walsh Act. It passed through the legislative process virtually without comment. ", "Section 3771(b)(2) provides the victims of state offenses limited rights when the offender seeks federal habeas corpus relief. It comes with its own, more tightly drawn definition of \"victim\": \"'crime victim' means the person against whom the State offense is committed, or if that person is killed or incapacitated, that person's family member or other lawful representative.\" It affords these victims a limited range of rights which relate to matters within the control of the federal courts: attendance rights; the right to be heard; protection from unreasonable delays; the right to fair and respectful treatment; and the right to enforce those rights. The right to be heard seems to consist of the right to brief and possibly argue points of law, since the usual form of a victim's right to be heard, an impact statement, has no real place in a habeas proceeding. In this context, the victim is treated as an amicus rather than an intervener, at least at the district court level. Section 3771(b)(2) vests enforcement authority in the victim or the victim's representative, but not in state or federal government officials. ", "Section 3771(b)(2)'s most interesting feature may be the absence of a right to notice. It does not list a federal right to be notified of federal habeas proceedings among the rights it provides.

In other contexts mandamus is more limited; it is a \"drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really extraordinary cases.\" The federal appellate courts were divided over this standard applied in the case of victims' rights. ", "The Second Circuit had observed that a mandamus \"petitioner must usually demonstrate: (1) presence of a novel and significant question of law; (2) the inadequacy of other available remedies; and (3) the presence of a legal issue whose resolution will aid in the administration of justice.\" It felt, however, that since Congress had designated mandamus as the principal avenue of review, it did not intend to require victims to \"overcome the hurdles typically faced by a petitioner seeking review of a district court determination through a writ of mandamus.\" Using for guidance the Supreme Court's determination of the appropriate standard of review under the Equal Access to Justice Act which grants attorneys' fees to the victims of governmental overreaching, the Circuit panel settled on an abuse of discretion standard. ", "The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits agreed. The Fifth, Sixth, Tenth, and DC Circuits did not. They concluded that when Congress selected mandamus as an avenue of review, it used the term as it was traditionally understood. They also considered mandamus the exclusive avenue for victim redress of a trial court's failure to adhere to the demands of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Congress resolved the dispute in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.

The amendments instead afforded the courts flexibility to deal with cases involving hundreds of victims or other unusual circumstances.

At first, they suggested that relief could only granted prospectively, specific judicial decisions could not be postponed or reopened.

Finally, they simply left the question for legislative resolution except for a prohibition on new trials.", "Section 3771(d)(5) provides the safeguard for a different reason.

It says nothing about bail, restitution, or other trial proceedings, all of which are thus presumably subject to the expedited, five-day stay and mandamus procedure of the statute.

Other Members regretted the fact that the section makes no provision for the appointment of counsel for indigent victims.", "Since then, the courts have confirmed that the statute creates no cause of action for damages against the United States or its officials; negates the possibility of Bivens action; and provides no grounds for a claim against the United States.", "At first glance, damages and prosecutorial discretion might seem an odd pairing, but they both limit the remedies available for a violation of a victim's rights. Moreover, some of the early proposals to establish a constitutional victims' rights amendment grouped damages and prosecutors' charging authority with other limitations. None of them, however, featured the broad prosecutorial discretion shield now found in the statute. The House Judiciary Committee added the prosecutorial discretion language late in the legislative process, perhaps at the behest of Justice Department, and it passed without comment.
