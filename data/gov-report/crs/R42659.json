Section 1385, in 1878. Congress has also enacted a number of statutes that authorize the use of land and naval forces to execute their objective.", "The Posse Comitatus Act outlaws the willful use of any part of the Army or Air Force to execute the law unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress. History supplies the grist for an argument that the Constitution prohibits military involvement in civilian affairs subject to only limited alterations by Congress or the President, but the courts do not appear to have ever accepted the argument unless violation of more explicit constitutional command could also be shown. The express statutory exceptions include the legislation that allows the President to use military force to suppress insurrection or to enforce federal authority, 10 U.S.C. Sections 251-255, and laws that permit the Department of Defense to provide federal, state and local police with information, equipment, and personnel, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271-284.", "Case law indicates that \"execution of the law\" in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to an organ of civil government, or (b) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government. Questions concerning the act's application arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the Posse Comitatus Act is violated when (1) civilian law enforcement officials make \"direct active use\" of military investigators; or (2) the use of the military \"pervades the activities\" of the civilian officials; or (3) the military is used so as to subject \"citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.\" The act is not violated when the Armed Forces conduct activities for a military purpose.", "The language of the act mentions only the Army and the Air Force, but it is applicable to the Navy and Marines by virtue of administrative action and commands of other laws. The law enforcement functions of the Coast Guard have been expressly authorized by act of Congress and consequently cannot be said to be contrary to the act. The act has been applied to the National Guard when it is in federal service, to civilian employees of the Armed Forces, and to off-duty military personnel. The act probably only applies within the geographical confines of the United States, but supplemental provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271-284 appear to apply worldwide.", "Finally, the act is a criminal statute under which there has been but a handful of known prosecutions. Although violations will on rare occasions result in the exclusion of evidence, the dismissal of criminal charges, or a civil cause of action, as a practical matter compliance is ordinarily the result of military self-restraint.", "This report provides an historical analysis of the use of the Armed Forces to execute domestic law and of the Posse Comitatus Act, including their apparent theoretical and constitutional underpinnings.

Section 1385, which forbids use of the Army and (as amended) the Air Force to execute civil law except where expressly authorized.", "The exception documents a contrary component of the tradition. Congress has expressly approved the use of the Armed Forces in extraordinary circumstances or where federal manpower to enforce the law was seen as inadequate. Striking the balance between rule and exception has never been easy, but failure to do so has often proven unfortunate. If the rule is too unforgiving, a Shays's Rebellion may go unchecked. If exceptions are too generously granted, a Boston Massacre or Kent State tragedy may follow.", "The terrorist attacks against the United States in September 2001 produced some calls for more generous exceptions to the rule. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the permissible circumstances for the use of the military to assist law enforcement agencies in countering terrorism, but Congress also reaffirmed its determination to maintain the principle of the posse comitatus law. The perceived breakdown in civil law and order in Hurricane Katrina's wake evoked more calls to reevaluate the military's role in responding to disasters. The possibility of using military surveillance equipment and resources, including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), to assist civilian law enforcement has raised some objections based on the military role. This report provides an historical analysis of the use of the Armed Forces to execute domestic law and of the Posse Comitatus Act, including their apparent theoretical and constitutional underpinnings. The report then outlines the current application of the Posse Comitatus Act as well as its statutory exceptions, and reviews the consequences of its violation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Magna Carta provides the first recorded acknowledgment of the origins of the Anglo-American tradition against military involvement in civilian affairs with its declaration that \"no free man shall be ... imprisoned ... or in any other way destroyed ... except by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\" Subsequent legislation in the reign of Edward III explained that this precluded punishment by the King except \"in due Manner ... or by Process made by Writ ... [or] by Course of the Law,\" or as later more simply stated, except \"by due Process of the Law.\" Three hundred years after the passage of the Edwardian statutes, Lord Coke and other members of Parliament read these due process and law of the land requirements to include a broad prohibition against the use of martial law in peacetime, an interpretation they compelled King Charles I to acknowledge.", "King Charles I, preparing for a military expedition in France, had quartered his troops in homes along the southern English coastline. Rioting resulted, and the participants, both military and civilian, were tried and punished by commissioners operating under the authority of martial law. Offended by this peacetime exercise of military judicial authority over civilians, Parliament sought and was granted the Petition of Right of 1628, which outlawed both quartering and martial law commissions.", "When, in the following century, the British responded to colonial unrest by quartering troops in Boston, the colonists saw it as a breach of this fundamental promise of English law. Their circumstances, however, were not exactly identical to those surrounding the Petition of Right. First, the question arose in the British colonies rather than England itself. England had stationed troops in the colonies to protect them against the French and Indians and had opted for military governorships in other territories. Second, there was no military usurpation of judicial functions. The colonists remained subject to civil rather than military justice, and soldiers who employed more force than civilian law permitted were themselves subject to civilian justice as the trial of the soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre demonstrates.", "On the other hand, the troops involved in the Boston Massacre were stationed in Massachusetts not for protection against a marauding invader as they had been in the French and Indian Wars, nor to accomplish the transition between civil governments within a conquered territory as they had been after the French lost Canada to the British as a consequence of those conflicts, but as an independent military force quartered among a disgruntled civilian population to police it. Public resentment of the use of the troops in such a manner sparked the incident, which led in turn to further heightened resentment.", "In any event, the experience was sufficiently vexing that the Declaration of Independence listed among our grievances against Great Britain that the King had \"kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the consent of our legislatures,\" had \"affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the civil power,\" and had \"quarter[ed] large bodies of armed troops among us ... protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States.\"", "The Articles of Confederation for the newly established United States addressed the threat of military intrusion into civilian affairs by demanding that the Armed Forces assembled during peacetime be no more numerous than absolutely necessary for the common defense; by entrusting control to civil authorities within the states; and by a preference for the farmer in arms as a member of the militia over the standing professional army.", "The Constitution continued these themes, albeit with greater authority vested in the federal government. It provided that a civilian (the President) should be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and civilian authorities (Congress) should be solely empowered to raise and support Armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make rules for their government and regulation. The Bill of Rights limited the quartering of troops in private homes, and noted that \"a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The Constitution, on the other hand, explicitly permitted Congress to provide for calling out the militia to execute the laws, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Use of Federal Troops Prior to 1878", "paragraphs": ["Notwithstanding the founders' aversion to the use of a standing army to control the civilian populace, the Constitution nowhere explicitly prohibits it, and Congress lost no time in authorizing the President to call out the militia for the purposes permitted under the Constitution. Despite the retention of most police powers by the several states, Congress quickly established a law enforcement capability in the federal government in order to effectuate its constitutional powers and provide a means to enforce the process of federal courts. This authority was vested through the President in federal marshals, who were empowered to call upon the posse comitatus to assist them, an authority similar to that enjoyed by the sheriff at common law, and which was understood to include the authority to call for military assistance.", "Thus, the militia under federal control (and later the Armed Forces ) could operate either as an arm of the government or to support the federal marshal. These two roles of the military were similar in many respects, but, at least in theory, differed in one key aspect: troops serving as a posse comitatus remained subordinate to civil law enforcement authorities, while troops called up to suppress an insurrection or remove an obstruction to the execution of the laws supplanted civil authorities that had been rendered ineffective. In some cases, if the marshal feared he would be unable to control a disturbance even with the aid of a posse, or if local military commanders declined to give assistance, the marshal would try to persuade the President that an insurrection was underway. At other times, the President might order troops to quell what appeared to amount to an insurrection, yet limit the role of the Armed Forces to responding to the requests of the appropriate civil official, possibly dispensing with the need to issue the requisite proclamation under the Insurrection Act.", "In addition, Congress has from time to time enacted statutes authorizing federal troops to enforce specific proscriptions, sometimes in aid of civil authorities and sometimes (apparently) in their stead, and Presidents have issued proclamations exhorting all federal officials, civilian or military, to assist in arresting a particular conspiracy or uprising. It is not always easy to ascertain which statutory authority (if any) forms the basis for sending in federal troops.", "Presidents have relied upon the militia and Armed Forces with some frequency for riot control or when in extreme cases they felt it necessary to ensure the execution of federal law. The following sections provide an overview of the domestic employment of military forces and the statutes that govern such use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Insurrection Act and Other Statutes", "paragraphs": ["Soon after Congress was first assembled under the Constitution, it authorized the President to call out the militia, initially to protect the frontier against \"hostile incursions of the Indians,\" and subsequently in cases of invasion, insurrection, or obstruction of the laws. Shortly thereafter, and echoing Article I, Section 8, cl. 15 and Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, Congress enacted the Calling Forth Act, authorizing the President to call out the militia in case of invasion or, at the request of a state legislature (or its governor, if the legislature could not be convened) in case of an insurrection within a state. Congress also empowered the President to call forth the militia, for a period of 30 days:", "whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed, or the execution thereof obstructed, in any state, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by this act, the same being notified to the President of the United States, by an associate justice or the district judge.", "In any of these events, the President was first required to issue a proclamation commanding the \"insurgents\" to disperse. President Washington used this authority to put down the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. Resistance to an excise tax on distilled whiskey led to violence against tax collectors; indictments of those perpetrating the violence went unanswered, and farmers eventually rose in rebellion against all efforts to enforce the federal law. The governor, having declined to call out the state militia to control the violence, the federal courts were left to call on the federal government for assistance. When the rioters failed to disperse on the President's proclamation, some fifteen thousand militiamen from Pennsylvania and neighboring states quickly mobilized to restore the peace.", "After the Calling Forth Act expired two years later, Congress reenacted virtually the same language, except that a court finding was no longer necessary, and the proclamation to disperse did not have to occur prior to calling up the militia. It appears that the revised Calling Forth Act was understood to cover the use of the militia as an aid to civilian power or, in rare cases, as a means of temporarily supplanting local civilian authority. ", "Both provisions of the Calling Forth Act were extended in 1807 to allow for the employment of the Army and Navy in domestic circumstances where the militia could be employed. Even before this change, President John Adams had used regular federal troops to put down, more by intimidation rather than the actual use of force, the 1799 Fries Rebellion in eastern Pennsylvania. The cavalry arrested the instigator of the resistance, John Fries, along with other participants, and turned them over to civil authorities to be tried for treason. Those convicted were eventually pardoned."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resistance to Taxes and Duties", "paragraphs": ["As in the Whiskey and Fries Rebellions, resistance to the laws of the United States during the early years of the republic had mainly to do with citizens' objections to steadily increasing federal taxes, which were largely necessary to build up the military establishment, and other laws that tended to make themselves felt in citizens' pocketbooks. In 1808, President Jefferson called out federal troops to suppress opposition to the Embargo Act by groups of traders in Vermont whose livelihood depended on imports and exports with Canada. Although President Jefferson followed the contemporary practice of turning to states' governors to supply militia in support of revenue collectors, the state militia troops proved reluctant to enforce the law against their neighbors, so the President sent in a detachment of regular troops to restore order. Congress subsequently amended the Embargo Act specifically to authorize the use of troops to enforce the embargo. Resentment at the newly enacted authority to use federal military force to enforce ordinary laws in the absence of armed resistance led to a speedy demise of the embargo statute. ", "In 1832, resistance to revenue laws again led to the prospect of using federal troops. Southerners objected to the system of protective tariffs that had been adopted in 1816 after the post-war resumption of trade threatened new domestic industries. Rather than gradually reducing the tariffs, as it had indicated was its intent, Congress steadily increased the tariff until by 1832 it became a policy fixture. Southerners believed that the money was raised unfairly at their expense and was expended mainly for the benefit of Northerners. The legislature of South Carolina voted to nullify the tariff and declared the state ready to meet force with force in the event the federal government sought to collect the tax. Congress passed a \"Force Bill\" to authorize the President to use the Army and Navy to collect duties, but at the same time reduced the duties. South Carolina rescinded its nullification ordinance, bringing the confrontation to an end without the use of force (although, as a final defiant gesture, it issued a new ordinance to nullify the Force Bill)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Neutrality Act Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["The early U.S. desire to avoid foreign entanglements of the sort that kept Europe in arms during the founders' era manifested itself in a policy of neutrality which tended, at times, to conflict with the economic interests or political views of some part of the citizenry. Congress enacted a statute to prohibit the enlistment in or recruitment for foreign military service, the arming of foreign war vessels or privateers, and the dispatch of military expeditions against the territory of a state at peace with the United States. The statute also empowered the President to call upon the Armed Forces to detain or take possession of illicitly armed vessels and to prevent expeditions from departing U.S. territory. Even prior to its enactment, President Washington had called on state militias to deal with efforts of the French Ambassador to fit out privateers and military expeditions against British and Spanish interests. President Jefferson relied on this authority to counter Aaron Burr's conspiracy in 1806 as well as other schemes to liberate Spain's South American colonies. State militias employed for this purpose remained under the control of their respective governors.", "In 1836, at the time of Texas's struggle for independence from Mexico, the Armed Forces were employed in an effort to prevent armed American sympathizers from crossing the border to join the fight in violation of the Neutrality Act of 1818, which expressly authorized the employment of the militia and Armed Forces in its enforcement. The next year, the Army was employed in a similar vein to quiet militant activity along the Canadian border. President Zachary Taylor issued a proclamation urging all officials, \"civil and military,\" to halt a planned expedition to attack Cuba, which resulted in the Navy dispatching vessels to New Orleans to prevent the expedition from departing. To block American sympathizers from aiding Cuban separatists during the Ten Years' War and to halt Fenian expeditions against Canada, President Grant issued a proclamation in 1870 urging civil and military officers to take measures to prevent expeditions in violation of neutrality and to bring violators to justice.

President Jackson promptly endorsed the request to the Secretary of War and ordered \"at least two companies of regulars\" be sent to aid state civil authorities, without, however, issuing a proclamation to the laborers to disperse. The presence of federal troops helped to stabilize the situation without requiring any actual use of force.", "A second request was occasioned in 1838, when both parties to the Pennsylvania state election claimed victory and set about to establish majority control of the state House. When public reaction turned violent, the governor called out the militia and requested aid from the local military commander, who denied the request. The governor then appealed to President Van Buren for federal assistance under the Domestic Violence Clause of the Constitution. Despite that clause's guarantee of protection, President Van Buren took the position that his duty was discretionary, and believing the domestic violence was not of a character that the \"State authorities, civil and military ... have proved inadequate to suppress it,\" he declined to authorize assistance. In the meantime, however, the commanding general of the U.S. arsenal at Frankford brought men and ordnance in response to the governor's request. The \"Buckshot War\" ended without armed confrontation, but the commander was reprimanded by the War Department for acting without authorization.", "A more serious state of affairs was reached in Rhode Island in 1842, where dissatisfaction with the government under the state's charter, still that granted by King Charles II in 1663, led to efforts to draft a new constitution. Two separate conventions were established, resulting in two separate sets of government officials claiming legitimate authority. The governor under the charter declared martial law and requested the President provide federal troops to stop the feared violence, but President Tyler declared he had no power to anticipate insurrections. Three subsequent similar requests were similarly denied. By the time the President had decided that intervention might be necessary to prevent the opposition army (led by contending Governor Thomas Dorr) from using force, the Secretary of War had determined that Dorr's men had dispersed, and the already-prepared proclamation would not be necessary. ", "The \"Dorr Rebellion\" had ended without a clash of arms. It did, however, produce a seminal Supreme Court decision, Luther v. Borden . In Luther , among other things, the Court established that whether a state enjoys a republican form of government guaranteed by the Constitution was a political matter for Congress to decide. Moreover, the Court indicated that Congress having delegated to the President its prerogative to call forth the militia in cases of domestic violence, it is up to the President to determine the exigency of responding to a call from a state for military intervention to put down a claimed insurrection. In either case, the Court determined the judiciary has no role to play.", "After the Civil War, labor disputes led to numerous requests for federal troops to suppress violence. In 1877, in response to strikes and related violence that erupted after railroads cut the pay of their workers by 10%, federal troops were requested by the governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, and Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, California, and Kentucky, with varying degrees of conformity to the requirements of the Insurrection Act, as interpreted by President Hayes. Although Ohio's governor did not request federal troops to quell strike-related violence in Toledo, Cincinnati, and other places, local officials appealed for assistance from nearby military commanders. No direct help was given, although supplies of arms from Rock Island Arsenal were made available to the state. It has been suggested that federal authority might have been asserted on the basis of the protection of a federal function (i.e., the delivery of the mail), but either due to an understanding that federal assistance to enforce state law was constitutionally unavailable without the request of the state government, or due to the lack of available federal troops, the President made no effort to do so.", "Questions regarding the federal versus state control of troops arose during the 1877 riots. In West Virginia and Maryland, federal troops were placed under the command of the governors to be employed alongside state troops. In Indiana, where the governor's request was initially turned down for lack of compliance under the Constitution and Insurrection Act, federal troops were to be furnished on the request of the federal marshal as a posse comitatus and were not turned over to the governor. When disorder spread to Pennsylvania, federal troops were initially sent in to protect federal property, the governor's first request for assistance having apparently been deemed deficient. After the deficiencies were corrected and a proclamation was issued, the general officer in charge of federal troops requested clarification as to the disposition of federal troops and espoused the doctrine that whenever a state government asks for assistance under the Insurrection Act, federal military power should supplant local civil authority:", "When the governor of a State has declared his inability to suppress an insurrection and has called upon the President of the United States under the Constitution to do so, that from that time commences a state not of peace but of war, and that although civil local authority still exists, yet the only outcome is to resort to force through the Federal military authorities, and that can only be through a subordination of the State authorities for the time being and until lawful order is restored; otherwise there can be no complete exercise of power in a military way within the limits of the State by the Federal officers. ", "The doctrine appears to have gained the approval of President Hayes, at least insofar as it had to do with command of state troops, although a telegram advising the commander to in effect federalize state troops arrived too late to be carried into effect. The proposed equation of insurrection to war calling for the substitution of military force for ordinary methods of law enforcement seems to have found its way into later War Department manuals regarding the military role in civil disturbances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trouble in the Western States and Territories", "paragraphs": ["U.S. troops were sent to deal with disputes in western territories and new states on several occasions. In California, the failure of the governor to request assistance under the Insurrection Act led to a denial of military assistance. The California Gold Rush was marked by a heightened tendency toward lawlessness, which was for a time brought under relative control by vigilantes. The self-appointed Vigilance Committee of San Francisco, which had been allowed to operate separately from federal and local law enforcement authorities, refused to surrender a prisoner to the federal court under a writ of habeas corpus. The governor called out the militia to put down the insurrection, and, having received a less than enthusiastic response, requested assistance from the Army, and when that was refused, from the President. The Attorney General advised the President that the situation was not sufficiently dire to require federal intervention, and noted that during the month of turmoil said to require armed intervention, no effort had been made to convene the legislature. When the Vigilante Committee took another prisoner, a judge of the California Supreme Court, the state governor again requested assistance from the military, this time from the commander of a ship in the harbor. Again, the request was turned down. The senior naval commander in San Francisco, stressing the constitutional requirements for requesting aid from the federal government to put down domestic violence, instructed the ship's captain that there was to be no interference in the domestic troubles of the state.", "The territory of Utah was the site of considerable resistance to federal law after it was established in 1850, and Brigham Young, the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, appointed its governor. Most white inhabitants of Utah were also members of the Church and tended to regard laws not emanating from the governor to be invalid, eventually compelling nearly all federal officials to leave the territory for their own safety. In 1857, the President appointed a new governor, and federal Armed Forces were sent in to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. Governor Young responded by declaring martial law and forbidding any Armed Forces from entering the territory. It was not until April 1858 that President Buchanan issued a proclamation offering amnesty to those who would obey the law and promising to prosecute those who did not. The proclamation was not styled as an order to disperse, and troops were instructed to act in aid of the execution of civil power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction", "paragraphs": ["In 1831, federal troops were sent out on several occasions to respond to reports of slave insurrections, initially in New Orleans and later in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the Carolinas. These actions appear to have been undertaken by the local military commandants in response to requests from local officials, and do not appear to have been justified by any statute or presidential proclamation.", "During troubles related to the slavery issue in Kansas in 1856, President Pierce issued a proclamation commanding persons involved in unlawful combinations to disperse. In the following months, the new governor sent frequent requests to the commandants at Ft. Leavenworth and Ft. Riley for troops to disband a territorial militia that had formed in Lawrence. When Kansas's pending entry into the Union in 1858 again brought tensions to a head, the governor called upon the commander of U.S. troops for troops to act \"as a posse comitatus in aid of the civil authorities.\" There does not appear to have been another proclamation under the Insurrection Act, and since only the federal marshal and his deputies were empowered to request the assistance of the military as a posse comitatus, there was no statutory basis for this action. Rather, it appears to have been an exercise of the newly emerging theory known as the Cushing Doctrine, explained below, under which members of the Armed Forces could act as a posse comitatus to enforce the law without invoking the Insurrection Act or other law that permitted the use of the Armed Forces. ", "At the dawn of the secessionist movement that led to the Civil War, President Buchanan declined to send troops into seceding states, apparently based on his perception that any troops dispatched to execute the laws of the Union would necessarily be subordinate to civil authorities. He informed Congress that because federal law enforcement and judicial machinery in those areas had already been demolished, his duty to execute the law could not be accomplished even with the aid of military troops. On coming into office, President Lincoln took a very different view, at times using federal military power without subordination to civil authority even in loyal Union states. Congress also enacted a new provision to replace \u00a7 2 of the Calling Forth Act, adding \"rebellions\" to instances for which the use of the Armed Forces was envisioned and to change the standard from a situation in which a combination or obstruction to law enforcement was \"too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\" to one in which the unlawful obstruction or assemblage \"make[s] it impracticable to enforce the laws ... by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\" ", "The successful suppression of the rebellion did not put an end to violence in the South. The Reconstruction period after the Civil War was characterized by constant political turbulence in the South. Efforts to establish new governments in former Confederate states were particularly contentious during the decade following the Civil War, and Presidents received more requests for military aid from state governors during these years than all previous decades combined, sometimes receiving simultaneous requests from two rival governors claiming legitimacy in the same state after an election.", "Resistance to efforts to achieve equal status for newly freed slaves led Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also called the \"Ku Klux Klan Act\"), which among other things added a new insurrection provision permitting the President to employ the land and naval forces to enforce civil rights. This authority was used immediately after enactment when President Grant issued a proclamation calling attention to the new law and declaring himself ready to invoke it if necessary. This was followed several months later by a proclamation under the new act commanding conspirators in nine counties in South Carolina to disperse within five days and turn in their firearms, ammunition, and disguises to the local marshals or military officers, and shortly thereafter by a proclamation suspending habeas corpus, as permitted under Section 4 of the act.

Congress had vested the federal equivalent of the sheriff, the federal marshal, with the power to call forth the posse comitatus in performance of his duties. The federal marshals and their deputies were thus implicitly empowered to compel the assistance of members of the Armed Forces when force became necessary to execute the process of federal courts, but the military units serving on a posse were to remain subordinate to the marshal and could not initiate legal proceedings.", "In some cases when it passed a particular statute, Congress specifically authorized recourse to the posse comitatus for its enforcement. The Fugitive Slave Act was such a law, and its use led to the crystallization of the government's doctrine regarding the use of the military in the role of a posse. Under that act, owners whose slaves had escaped to another state were entitled to an arrest warrant for the slaves and to have the warrant executed by the federal marshals. The marshals in turn might \"summon and call to their aid the bystanders, or posse comitatus of the proper county ... [and] all good citizens [were] commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law, whenever their services may be required, as aforesaid, for that purpose.\" The act did not specifically authorize the use of the military or militia in its execution, but when particularly fierce opposition arose in Boston in 1851, the President issued a proclamation requiring \"all officers and persons, civil and military to aid and assist by all means in their power in quelling [such] combinations.... \" The Secretary of War sent orders to Army units to be ready to respond to the call of a marshal or deputy, or the certification of a federal judge stating that military force would likely be necessary. Troops in Boston Harbor were made ready to intervene in the event of a riot, but such intervention was unnecessary. ", "When asked by the Senate whether sufficient authority for vigorous enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act was available, President Fillmore advanced the doctrine that his use of the Army and Navy to enforce federal law was an inherent power, suggesting that it ought not be construed as restricted by the Insurrection Act's requirements, in particular that of issuing a proclamation to disperse. He also made the argument that all citizens, whether enrolled in any military service or not, may be summoned as a posse comitatus, while conceding doubt as to whether an organized military force acting under military command might be employed in such a manner. The Senate Judiciary Committee declared that it saw no reason to consider military members exempt from duty to serve as a posse comitatus, whether as individuals or organized under their ordinary command structure.", "In June of 1851, a federal marshal in Chicago arrested a fugitive slave on a warrant issued under the act. He called for the assistance of members of the police force and of the state militia to prevent abolitionists from rescuing the prisoner before he could be returned to his owner. The marshal subsequently filed a claim with the Department of the Treasury for reimbursement of the funds he had paid the members of the police force and the militia who responded to his call. Attorney General Caleb Cushing was asked whether the United States was obligated to honor the claim. While this question remained pending, another incident in Boston arose in response to the arrest of fugitive slave Anthony Burns in 1854. Two batteries of artillery and a detachment of federal troops were sent into the city while the governor also called up the local militia, but when additional forces were requested, military commanders considered further authorization from Washington to be necessary before complying with the requests.", "The Attorney General took the opportunity, ostensibly in response to the earlier request, to announce a new doctrine regarding the employment of the Armed Forces. Cushing's response went well beyond the question of whether the \"bystanders\" contemplated by the Fugitive Slave Act might include members of a state militia when not in federal service, and announced a broader principle\u2014members of the military by virtue of their duties as citizens were part of the posse comitatus. Apparently adopting the views expressed earlier by the Senate Judiciary Committee in reaction to the previous Administration's views on the matter, Cushing declared:", "The posse comitatus comprises every person in the district or county above the age of fifteen years, whatever may be their occupation, whether civilians or not; and including the military of all denominations, militia, soldiers, marines, all of whom are alike bound to obey the commands of the sheriff or marshal.

The Constitution neither authorizes nor proscribes martial law (which is said to exist when civil authority is supplanted by military rule due to war or similar emergency), but it has been proclaimed on rare occasions. Lesser forms of military involvement in law enforcement have not been commonplace, but have not been particularly rare during the history of the republic.", "Without more judicial guidance, it would appear that traditional reservations about military involvement in the execution of civilian law can only clearly be said to rise to the level of constitutional imperative when they take a form that offends some more explicit constitutional prohibition or guarantee such as the right to jury trial, grand jury indictment, or freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to make the laws whose faithful execution the President must take care to observe and which carry into execution Congress's own powers and those of the President. It likewise vests Congress with the power to establish, maintain, and regulate the Armed Forces; and with the power to describe the circumstances under which the militia may be called into federal service.", "The Supreme Court has shed some light on the coordination of presidential and congressional powers concerning use of the military to enforce civilian law. The Court has pointed out that the President's power under the Guarantee Clause of Article IV, Section 4, which guarantees the states protection against domestic violence, is only provisionally effective until such time as Congress acts. And the President may not always use the Armed Forces to meet a domestic emergency when Congress has previously resisted an invitation to sanction their employment.

The first request by a governor for troops after enactment of the Posse Comitatus Act appears to have occurred in 1879, when the governor of Nebraska requested a company of troops to help protect a local court where the trial of a prominent outlaw was taking place, which had occasioned concern that the courthouse would be the scene of a rescue attempt by the portion of the band of outlaws still at large. This request was denied, however, as it was framed as a request to use the troops as a posse comitatus, which, according to the Secretary of War, had become unlawful following enactment of the Posse Comitatus Act, although if the situation were to become more dire, the governor could request aid from the President in the form of troops under military command.

In 1899, President McKinley deployed 500 troops to Coeur D'Alene, ID, at the governor's request, to keep a conflict between union miners and mine owners under control, but did not issue a proclamation required by statute. Although by this time General Hancock's doctrine regarding the relationship between federal and state troops had gained acceptance, state officials directed operations there. When the governor of Colorado requested federal aid to assist state militia to cope with a coal miners' strike, Secretary of War Elihu Root informed the governor that any troops furnished pursuant to the relevant provision of the insurrection statutes would not be at the disposal of the governor, but would remain under the direction of the President.", "During the early part of the 20 th century, Presidents generally insisted that governors comply with the requirements of the Insurrection Act and the Constitution in formulating requests for the assistance of the Army. After the governor of Nevada requested troops in 1907 to put down violence by a miners' union that was forcibly removing non-union workers from the area, nine companies of infantry were sent there, but told not to act until a proclamation was issued. The mere presence of troops having quieted the unruly element, no proclamation was issued. President Roosevelt chastised the governor for having requested federal troops without endeavoring to convene the legislature as required under the Constitution and Insurrection Act. In 1914, a miner's strike at Ludlow, Colorado, led the governor there to request federal troops, which President Wilson granted.

Between 1919 and 1920, federal troops were employed to assist in putting down labor disputes and other minor disturbances 29 times, all without the issuance of a presidential proclamation. Troops were deployed from the lumber mills of the Northwest to the copper mines in Arizona and New Mexico, and from the coal mines in Appalachia to the oil fields in Texas and Louisiana, justified on the need to keep up production for the war and replace absent state militia. Federal troops also intervened to keep the peace in several cities afflicted by racial quarrels. The policy was revoked in 1921 due to the perception that troops were being misused, and President Harding issued the requisite proclamation in order to send troops to quell a dispute involving West Virginia coal miners. The governor directed state police forces to act under the direction of the U.S. military commander.", "At the request of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, President Hoover used federal troops in 1932 to oust the Bonus Marchers from federal property in Washington, DC, but did not issue a proclamation. President Roosevelt turned down several requests during the 1930s to provide federal troops for strike duty, but directed the Secretary of War in 1941 to seize and operate an aviation plant where a strike threatened wartime fighter plane production. Although the Attorney General likened the situation to an insurrection, the President's order did not make reference to the insurrection statutes, nor was it accompanied by a proclamation to disperse. When faced with losing their deferred status under the draft, the workers promptly returned to the plant and resumed production under military supervision. Other labor disturbances were similarly addressed by having the Army or Navy seize and manage plants or railroads deemed necessary for the war effort, but these occurred under separate authorities.", "During the Second World War, racial strife began to contribute once again to civil disturbances, although federal troops were only called in twice. At the request of the Michigan governor, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation and sent federal troops to Detroit to restore order during a race riot there. Troops were also sent to Philadelphia in 1944 to seize and operate the transportation system after white workers went on strike to protest the employment of some black workers as operators. This, however, was done pursuant to a 1916 statute that empowered the President, during time of war, to order the Secretary of War to take over the possession and operation of transportation systems as required for war efforts.", "A race riot in Detroit led the Michigan governor to request troops in 1967, which President Johnson provided.

In the end, only the mayor of Washington, DC, and the governors of Illinois and Maryland requested assistance under the insurrection statutes. President Lyndon Johnson issued proclamations in April, 1968 ordering rioters to disperse in Washington, DC, Chicago, and Baltimore.

Its first application after the enactment of the Posse Comitatus Act involved an appeal by the governor of the Territory of New Mexico in 1878 for federal military assistance in putting an end to the anarchy that characterized the territory due to the operation of bands of robbers who were besieging mail coaches and terrorizing the local populace. After the proclamation to disperse was issued, military forces restored relative order, after which civil authorities reportedly came to depend on U.S. troops for law enforcement to such an extent that they essentially abandoned their own efforts to enforce the law. When the governor complained about the lack of military assistance for arresting lawbreakers, the local commanding general replied that his troops could not be used to make ordinary arrests in situations that did not amount to an insurrection or reach a level of lawlessness that would extend beyond the capacity of the usual civil machinery to handle. This interpretation of the new posse comitatus restriction was adopted by the War Department. The Secretary of War later blamed the Posse Comitatus Act in part for the fact that lawlessness and riots in the territory had reached such a level that military intervention was required. ", "\"Indian outrages\" in Arizona led to another proclamation under the Insurrection Act, not at the request of the territorial governor but as a response to news that the governor was proposing to arm citizens to go after Apaches suspected of murder, which would oblige the military to take action to protect the reservation. President Arthur initially requested legislative relief from the Posse Comitatus Act due to his view that its prohibition inhibited an effective military response. Congress declined to repeal the prohibition, however, with the Senate Judiciary Committee pointing out that the Posse Comitatus Act was meant to curb the practice of local marshals and their subordinates employing the Armed Forces to assist them in enforcing the law, but not to prevent the President from himself using any part of the Army under a military chain of command.

President Grover Cleveland did not issue a proclamation for rioters to disperse until several days after violence had begun, after learning that troops had been compelled to fire on a mob in the nearby town of Hammond, IL. Another proclamation was issued the next day to remove further obstructions to the mail and execution of U.S. law occasioned by the strike as it spread westward. The governors of the afflicted states did not call for federal assistance; in fact, the governor of Illinois opposed intervention. Rather, the federal marshals and U.S. attorneys notified the Attorney General, who presented the requests to the President. It appears that obtaining civilian deputies to assist marshals against the strikers was made difficult due to the fact that popular sympathies were with the strikers, leading the civilian authorities to prefer shifting the responsibility to the Army. Federal troops were also used to recapture trains stolen by various \"industrial armies\" of disaffected miners and laborers. ", "In 1885, resistance in Utah to the \"Edmunds law\" for the suppression of polygamy caused the governor of that territory to seek federal assistance, which was granted. Animosity toward Chinese railroad laborers and miners led to major disturbances and to calls for federal troops in a number of western states and territories in 1885-1886. Proclamations were issued for the state of Washington, but federal troops sent there met with no resistance. Federal troops were employed in Montana in 1897 to protect a prisoner charged with murder from a potential mob lynching, but this was done on the order of the local commander under \"emergency authority,\" without a presidential proclamation.

Section 332 (now codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 252) was considered in order to provide the legal justification, but rejected because violence was merely projected and a proclamation was thought to be too difficult to frame under such circumstances. In the end, authorities decided to rely on a non-statutory basis regarded as an implicit sovereign right to protect government property, although section 332 was held in reserve in case the level of violence called for federalizing the National Guard.

In 2015, Congress added authority for military assistance to the Department of Justice in the case of situations involving bombings of places of public use, government facilities, public transportation systems, and infrastructure facilities, including the use of ordinance disposal units.

For assistance to domestic agencies, support is limited to maintenance and repair or upgrade of equipment on loan for such purposes; transportation of personnel and supplies and equipment; establishing operation of bases of operations or training facilities; training of law enforcement personnel in counterdrug or counter-transnational crime activities; detection, monitoring, and communication of the movement of air and sea traffic within 25 miles off the U.S. coast or surface traffic within 25 miles outside the geographic boundaries of the United States if such activities were initially detected outside the boundaries; construction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling at international boundaries of the United States; establishment of command and control centers and computer networks to improve integration of participating agencies and units; linguist and intelligence analysis; and aerial and ground reconnaissance.

Congress did not intend to limit the authority of the Army to perform its military duties. The legislative history, however, does not resolve the question of whether the act prohibits the Army from performing its military duties in a manner that affords incidental benefits to civilian law enforcement officers.", "The courts and commentators believe that it does not. As long as the primary purpose of an activity is to address a military purpose, the activity need not be abandoned simply because it also assists civilian law enforcement efforts. Courts appear to view the location of the activity as particularly indicative of primary purpose; as one court noted, \"the power to maintain order, security, and discipline on a military facility is necessary for military operations.\"", "The courts have concluded that, consistent with this legitimate military purpose to maintain order on military installations, military personnel may, without violating the Posse Comitatus Act, turn over to civilian law enforcement authorities armed felons arrested when they flee onto a military base, or drunk drivers arrested on a military base, or firearms stolen from a military installation, as well as any stolen equipment that belongs to a military unit. The courts have likewise found no violation of the act when military personnel arrest civilians on military facilities for crimes committed there, or when military authorities assist a civilian police investigation conducted on a military facility. The military purpose doctrine also permits military law enforcement personnel to investigate the off-base conduct of military personnel, and allows them to assist in investigating the off-base conduct of civilians who are suspected of involvement in a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The DOD Instruction evidences a comparable understanding.", "Cases called to apply the military purpose doctrine in cooperative police activities occurring off-base are the most difficult to reconcile. Some seem to require no more than a logical military nexus; others demand a very clear, specific military connection before they will concede the presence of a military purpose; and still others seem to seek a middle ground.", "Finally, it is arguable that Congress's authorization for the use of force against those responsible for the September 11 attacks has mooted some of the limitations on the use of the military for law enforcement purposes by recasting them as military operations. Soon after the attacks, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) advised the White House and Defense Department that the Posse Comitatus Act imposed no constraint on the President's use of military forces domestically for anti-terrorism operations against \"international or foreign terrorists operating within the United States.\" This conclusion rested on the determination that the act", "only applies to the domestic use of the Armed Forces for law enforcement purposes, rather than for the performance of military functions. The Posse Comitatus Act itself contains an exception that allows the use of the military when constitutionally or statutorily authorized, which has occurred in the present circumstances.", "In concluding that the prevention and deterrence of terrorism is \"fundamentally military, rather than law enforcement, in character,\" OLC conceded that distinguishing between military and law enforcement functions when dealing with terrorism is \"no easy task.\" Counter-terrorism operations could therefore \"resemble, overlap with, and assist ordinary law enforcement activity.\" ", "Military action might encompass making arrests, seizing documents or other property, searching persons or places or keeping them under surveillance, intercepting electronic or wireless communications, setting up roadblocks, interviewing witnesses, and searching for suspects. Moreover, the information gathered in such efforts could be of considerable use to federal prosecutors if the Government were to prosecute against captured terrorists.", "OLC further opined that the President's inherent power to defend the United States supplied a \"constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act, and that statutory exceptions could be found in both the authorization for use of military force and section 333 (now section 253) of the Insurrection Act. ", "It does not appear, however, that much of this opinion remains the official interpretation of the Justice Department. In 2008, OLC advised that \"caution should be exercised before relying in any respect on the Memorandum [regarding the Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States (Oct. 23, 2001) as a precedent of the Office of Legal Counsel,\" and that \"certain propositions\" stated therein \"should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose.\" With respect to the discussion of the Posse Comitatus Act, the superseding memorandum criticized the 2001 memo as \"far too general and divorced from specific facts and circumstances to be useful as an authoritative precedent of OLC.\" Rather than viewing the authorization statute as a statutory exception to the act, the successor memo believed it better to state that the \"reasonable and necessary use of military force taken under the authority of the AUMF would be a military action, potentially subject to the established 'military purpose' doctrine, rather than a law enforcement action.\" Likewise, the revised view of the OLC emphasized that the use of the military to execute the law under the Insurrection Act \"would require the presence of an actual obstruction of the execution of federal law or a breakdown in the ability of state authorities to protect federal rights.\"", "The use of the military within the United States for counter-terrorism purposes has been negligible, despite some prodding from Congress to use military forces to apprehend, interrogate, and detain suspected members of Al Qaeda and \"associated forces.\" Consequently, there is more commentary regarding the interplay of the Posse Comitatus Act and what was previously called the \"Global War on Terror\" than there are judicial decisions to test these theories. One U.S. citizen who was detained by the military without trial after having been designated an \"enemy combatant\" by the President sought habeas corpus relief, in part on the contention that his confinement by the military violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The reviewing district court judge saw things differently:", "Padilla is not being detained by the military in order to execute a civilian law or for violating a civilian law, not-withstanding that his alleged conduct may in fact violate one or more such laws. He is being detained in order to interrogate him about the unlawful organization with which he is said to be affiliated and with which the military is in active combat, and to prevent him from becoming reaffiliated with that organization.", "The decision, however, was reversed on the grounds that the detention violated a more specific statute, but was then vacated by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds. In subsequent proceedings, the petitioner did not rely on the Posse Comitatus Act. It seems safe to say, however, that if the Constitution does not stand in the way of such a measure, the Posse Comitatus Act will not likely impose a greater hurdle.
