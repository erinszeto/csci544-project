This report provides an overview of the options available to pursue that goal.", "Approaches for Congress", "Congress can mandate that regulators provide relief through legislation. Most relief legislation likely would follow the normal legislative process. For example, H.R. 10, a wide-ranging regulatory relief package, was passed by the House on June 8, 2017. Two special legislative procedures may be available in limited circumstances, however.", "The Congressional Review Act (CRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801-808) provides expedited procedures for Congress to overturn recently promulgated regulations. To date, the 115th Congress has used the CRA to overturn one Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking (disclosure requirements for resource-extraction firms). The reconciliation process provides for expedited consideration in the Senate, but is intended to be limited to provisions intended to change direct spending or revenues. Only a few of the funding provisions affecting financial regulators might meet these criteria.", "Approaches for Financial Regulators", "The vast majority of postcrisis regulatory reforms have been issued by independent financial regulators, not the Administration. In theory, the regulators issuing any regulation could issue new regulations modifying or repealing the original, provided they have authority under the authorizing statute to do so. But to overturn a final rule that has already been promulgated, regulators must initiate new rulemaking following the standard process, generally including notice and comment procedures. In addition, applying a regulation involves judgment by regulators. Regulators can alter how a regulation is interpreted and enforced using their supervisory (e.g., regulatory guidance and supervisory letters) and enforcement powers. Until new leadership is appointed, regulators may have little desire to revisit regulations that they have issued recently under current or previous leadership.", "Approaches for the Administration", "On February, 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to \"identify any laws, treaties, regulations, [and] guidance ... that inhibit Federal regulation of the United States financial system in a manner consistent with the Core Principles.\" One of the core principles is to \"make regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored.\" The order does not revise or repeal any specific regulation, which can be done administratively only through the standard rulemaking process. Because financial regulators are independent regulatory agencies, they cannot be compelled to comply with executive orders governing certain aspects of the rulemaking process.", "The Treasury Secretary has the opportunity to influence regulatory priorities through his position as chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a council made up predominantly of the federal financial regulators. FSOC has limited rulemaking authority, however. It can make recommendations to member agencies, but it cannot compel agencies to follow those recommendations. FSOC's most notable rulemaking authority is its ability to designate nonbank financial institutions as systemically important (SIFIs).", "One notable regulation issued by the previous Administration\u2014as opposed to by an independent regulatory agency\u2014was the Department of Labor's (DOL's) fiduciary rule, which requires a uniform fiduciary standard for registered broker-dealers and investment advisers when giving financial advice on retirement accounts.

Although most of these individuals may be removed only \"for cause,\" over time, these positions will become vacant, allowing President Trump to nominate candidates to fill most, if not all, of them. At present, President Trump has filled the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), while several other positions are vacant, including the chairs of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The G-20 is an informal grouping of 19 major economies (including the United States) and the European Union; since 2009, the G-20 has been the primary political steering forum for international economic cooperation. The FSB is a technical body, which was established by the G-20 to coordinate the G-20 agenda and set the priorities for the international financial standard-setting process. FSB members include the regulators from the G-20 countries (and others), as well as several international financial institutions and international standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).", "As illustrated in Figure 1 , national financial authorities are the primary actors responsible for devising rules and providing oversight and supervision of financial institutions operating under their jurisdiction. National financial authorities also are responsible for participating in the international standard-setting bodies. The international agenda and standard-setting bodies operate on a consensual basis and have no legally binding authority. Because national regulators (or other authorities) cannot enter into treaties with other countries, agreements made at international fora or by regulators at standard-setting bodies require domestic legislative or regulatory changes before they are implemented. Many of the primary postcrisis reform initiatives of the FSB closely match parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. International financial institutions, primarily the International Monetary Fund, provide overall monitoring of national compliance with the agreed-upon international financial standards, among other functions.", "For banks, an important source of new and revised prudential regulatory standards is the multilateral Basel III accords, a nonbinding international agreement to harmonize banking regulation, such as capital requirements. U.S. banking regulators promulgated new regulations to comply with the standards set out in Basel III. For globally active financial institutions, the FSB, in coordination with the Basel Committee and IAIS, respectively, designates firms as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and global systemically important insurers.

In some cases, postcrisis reforms stem from this authority rather than from recent statutory changes.

This report does not discuss the content of current financial regulatory policy or proposals to provide relief from those policies. Instead, it discusses different approaches to implementing regulatory relief. Nevertheless, the following framework for evaluating relief proposals may be useful to consider before choosing between different approaches. In determining whether to provide regulatory relief, a central question is whether an appropriate trade-off has been struck between the benefits and costs of regulation.", "Benefits. Financial regulation has different objectives and potential benefits, including enhancing the safety and soundness of certain institutions; protecting consumers and investors from fraud, manipulation, and discrimination; and promoting financial stability while reducing systemic risk. A financial regulatory system that delivers a baseline level of stability and trust between financial agents is a precondition to a healthy financial system that can generate robust economic growth.", "Regulators employ different tools to achieve these goals. Regulators issue rules; supervise and examine institutions to verify that the rules are followed; and take enforcement actions, such as imposing fines, when the regulations are not followed. In other cases, regulators require companies or individuals to meet certain standards and receive a license before engaging in a particular business practice. The specific goals regulators attempt to achieve and the tools they use vary by market. For example, risk management is emphasized for banking regulation and disclosure is a priority in securities regulation.", "Costs. The costs associated with government regulation\u2014rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement\u2014are frequently referred to as regulatory burden . Regulatory requirements often are imposed on providers of financial services, so financial institutions frequently are the focus of discussions about regulatory burden. But costs associated with regulation can flow through the providers and ultimately be borne, in part, by different entities, including consumers, the government, and the economy at large. For example, a provider may respond to increased regulatory burden by raising the prices it charges to customers. If regulatory burden reduces the long-term availability of credit, it would have a negative effect on business investment and economic growth. ", "Regulatory burden may manifest itself in different forms. Operating costs are the costs the company must bear to adhere to the regulation, such as employee training. Some regulations create one-time operating costs borne up front, whereas other regulations create recurring costs that exist as long as the requirement is in effect. Opportunity costs are the costs associated with foregone business opportunities because of additional regulation. For example, a lender may make fewer mortgages because new regulations make mortgage lending more expensive, and that lender may instead perform a different type of lending that is now more profitable.", "Trade -O ffs. Regulatory relief may face trade-offs between reducing regulatory burden and potentially reducing the benefits of regulation. The trade-offs are not limited to the effects on the direct recipients of relief\u2014usually the providers of financial services\u2014but may extend to the effects on consumers, investors, particular markets, and market stability more broadly. ", "The presence of regulatory burden does not necessarily mean that a regulation is undesirable or should be repealed. A regulation can have benefits that could outweigh its costs, but the presence of costs means, tautologically, that the regulation causes regulatory burden. The concept of regulatory burden can be contrasted with the phrase unduly burdensome . Whereas regulatory burden is about the costs associated with a regulation, unduly burdensome refers to the balance between benefits and costs. For example, some would consider a regulation to be unduly burdensome if costs are in excess of benefits or the same benefits could be achieved at a lower cost. However, the presence of regulatory burden does not mean that all regulations are unduly burdensome.", "Policymakers consider these trade-offs and evaluate the broader effects of regulation that could be either positive or negative, such as how a requirement would impact innovation, the price of credit, and the availability of credit. For example, efforts to protect consumers against potential actions taken by banks may drive up the cost for a bank to provide certain services and may result in that activity migrating to a less regulated part of the financial system or to foreign jurisdictions with lower regulatory standards. However, trade-offs are not always present. If regulation makes an unstable system more stable, it could reduce costs and increase the availability of credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approaches for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Through legislation, Congress provides financial regulators with the authority that underpins the regulations they issue. Thus, Congress can amend or repeal that authority through new legislation. Congress can pass legislation that amends or repeals specific rules or parts of the statute that those rules are based on.

Alternatively, Congress may provide regulators with broad authority to provide relief at their discretion. Congress may provide relief to all financial services providers or target it to specific groups, such as small financial institutions.", "Regulatory relief could be enacted through the normal legislative process. For example, H.R. 10 , a wide-ranging regulatory relief package, was passed by the House on June 8, 2017. Regulatory relief could also occur through the annual appropriations process.

These instructions trigger the second stage of the process by directing individual committees to develop and report legislation that would change laws within their respective jurisdictions concerning direct spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Once a specified committee develops legislation, the reconciliation legislation is eligible to be considered under expedited procedures in both the House and Senate. These expedited procedures are particularly important in the Senate, because reconciliation legislation does not require the support of three-fifths of Senators to invoke cloture in order to reach a final vote.

Under the Byrd rule, \"extraneous\" material is not permitted to be included in a reconciliation measure or offered as an amendment to it. If such extraneous material is included in reconciliation legislation, or offered as an amendment to it, any Senator may raise a point of order against that material. If a point of order is raised and sustained against a legislative provision for violating the Byrd rule, the provision in question is stricken, but further consideration of the bill may proceed.

Nevertheless, it may be useful to first examine whether a provision of interest might be projected to produce a change in outlays or revenues (or a change in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are collected). If a provision is not projected to produce such a change, it may be considered extraneous and therefore prohibited. It should be noted, however, that even if a provision does have such a budgetary impact, it still might be considered extraneous if the change in outlays or revenues is considered to be merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision.", "The question of what changes to financial regulation might not be projected to have a budgetary impact (and, thus, would be considered extraneous, and therefore prohibited in reconciliation) is not easily answered. This is because such legislation would typically provide regulators with a change to their mandate or authority (e.g., increasing or decreasing a regulator's responsibilities by adding or eliminating the authority to regulate a specific activity), but not include language that makes changes that would directly relate to funding. For example, legislation might make changes that increase or decrease a regulator's responsibilities (e.g., by adding or eliminating the authority to regulate a specific activity); such legislation need not include changes to regulators' budget levels because, among other reasons, all of the regulators in Table 1 except the SEC and the CFTC set their own budgets. For any regulator that sets its own budget, it would be at the discretion of that regulator to decide whether to respond to the change in its responsibilities by increasing or decreasing its budget, respectively, or by handling its changed responsibilities within the same budget levels. If the regulator did subsequently increase or decrease its budget in response, that action might be projected beforehand to affect direct spending. If such actions were projected to have a budgetary effect, it is unclear whether that effect might nevertheless be considered merely incidental to the policy impact of the legislative provision and therefore in violation of the Byrd rule.", "Another example of proposed regulatory reform that would likely be considered extraneous is related to moving the funding for financial regulators to the annual appropriations process. Such proposals typically include authorizations of appropriations for financial regulators, the funding for which subsequently would be provided by appropriations legislation. Because authorizations of appropriations do not provide budget authority, they typically are not viewed as producing a change in spending (or a change in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are collected) and therefore may be prohibited under the Byrd rule.", "It has been argued, however, that a few financial regulatory proposals might be projected to have a budgetary impact and therefore be more likely to be eligible for inclusion in reconciliation. In attempting to determine what might qualify for inclusion in reconciliation, it may be helpful to examine some of the few provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that were scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as having a budgetary impact. As discussed above, many regulatory relief proposals have focused on changing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Fees Assessed on Financial Institutions. To finance specific new regulatory duties, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a number of new fees that CBO scored as increasing general revenues. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act assesses fees on certain large financial institutions to finance losses to the Orderly Liquidation Fund, the budget of the Office of Financial Research, and the Federal Reserve's supervisory responsibilities under Title I of the act. CBO also scored the Orderly Liquidation Fund and the Office of Financial Research's budget as increasing direct spending. Changes That Affect B orrow ing from Treasury. The Dodd-Frank Act affects the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation to borrow from the Department of the Treasury to temporarily cover certain losses and the likelihood that those agencies would experience losses. Although these agencies must repay any Treasury borrowing, these provisions were scored as having an impact on the level of direct spending within the 10-year scoring window since repayment is not instantaneous. Agency Funding Sources. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to transfer a fixed amount of revenues to the CFPB to finance its operations. Spending by the CFPB is recorded in the federal budget as direct spending and is dependent on the transfer under current law. Bills from previous Congresses that eliminated the Fed transfer have been scored by CBO to reduce direct spending. Funds P rovided to A gencies O utside the A ppropriations P rocess. The Dodd-Frank Act allowed the SEC to deposit up to $100 million of fees in a newly created reserve fund that could be spent at the SEC's discretion. CBO scored this as increasing direct spending. Previously, the SEC's budget was provided solely through annual appropriations.", "Most of these examples involve the resources available to a regulator to carry out some specified regulatory duty; changes to those resources would affect its ability to carry out that duty. Each of these examples, however, represents just one aspect of a broader policy area. Although legislative provisions related to a narrow aspect of that broad policy might be eligible on its own for inclusion in reconciliation, other changes related to that policy area might not. Because the Byrd rule applies to any specific matter within reconciliation legislation, provisions that make broad changes still might be stricken for violating the Byrd rule even if they are coupled with a change that might be eligible for inclusion. For example, in the past, the proposal to eliminate the Fed's transfer to the CFPB has been paired with broader reforms to the CFPB's budgetary status, structure, powers, and mission. If it were determined that these broader reforms had no budgetary impact, they would arguably be considered extraneous even if changes to the Fed transfer provision were considered eligible under the Byrd rule on its own."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Annual appropriations legislation provides Congress a regular opportunity to consider changes to financial policy.

However, the SEC and the CFTC are the only two financial regulators that are currently funded primarily through the appropriations process. In addition, appropriations bills might include \"policy riders\" that make policy changes to financial regulators, whether or not those agencies receive appropriations.", "Congress has recently included legislative language in appropriations bills that would make changes affecting agencies that do not receive appropriations. Using the Dodd-Frank Act as an example, the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 114-113 ) made minor changes to the CFPB, the Orderly Liquidation Authority, and swaps regulation, and the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-235 ) made minor changes to the swap pushout rule and rescinded funds from the SEC's reserve fund.", "Some recent versions of the Financial Services and General Government appropriations (FSGG) bill that have not become public law have included more significant changes to financial regulation.

The financial regulators have been statutorily structured to be independent from the Administration, in the sense that they have greater autonomy from the President's leadership and insulation from partisan politics than is typical of executive-branch agencies. A number of organizational features found in some of these agencies, including self-funding and \"for cause\" (as opposed to \"at will\") removal, support this independence.", "In theory, a regulator could issue new regulations modifying or repealing any previously issued regulation, assuming in the case of repeal that the rule is not statutorily or judicially required to be in place.

The APA explicitly defines rulemaking as \"the agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule .\" Under the APA, the agency must provide a reasoned justification for repealing a rule.", "Proposed rules can be modified more quickly and easily than final rules. Each financial regulator currently has several proposed rules that have not yet been finalized. If a rule is in the proposed stage, a regulator can more easily modify it by withdrawing the proposed rule or by republishing a modified proposed rule for public comment. Sometimes, agencies decide not to finalize proposed rules, although a key factor in such a decision would be whether the statute requires or gives regulators the discretion to act.

Regulators can alter how a regulation is interpreted and enforced using their supervisory and enforcement powers. Regulators can issue nonbinding guidance and supervisory letters to regulated entities providing further explanation of how to adhere to a regulation. Although changes in supervision and enforcement cannot substitute for the rulemaking process, they can subtly influence regulatory burden by changing how rules are complied with or enforced. High-profile examples of how supervision has influenced financial policy in recent years include a joint agency guidance on leveraged lending, a CFPB bulletin on indirect auto lending, and a joint agency statement on commercial real estate.

Previously, broker-dealers were held to a lower \"suitability\" standard. On February 3, 2017, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing the DOL \"to examine the Fiduciary Duty Rule to determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice.\" If the DOL finds the fiduciary rule to be inconsistent with the priorities of the presidential memorandum, the memorandum directs the DOL to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule.

The Treasury Secretary has the opportunity to influence regulatory priorities through his position as chair of FSOC. FSOC is a council created by the Dodd-Frank Act and made up predominantly of the federal financial regulators that is tasked with identifying risks to financial stability, promoting market discipline, and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. As FSOC chair, the Treasury Secretary sets the council's agenda. FSOC has limited rulemaking authority, however. It can make recommendations to member agencies, but it cannot compel agencies to follow those recommendations. Potentially, these powers could be used to \"name and shame\" a member agency that is conducting activities with which the FSOC chair or other members disagree\u2014but the agency could choose to ignore that pressure. With the exception of limited authority regarding the CFPB, FSOC cannot override or reverse member agency rulemaking. ", "FSOC's most notable rulemaking authority is its ability to designate nonbank financial institutions as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). SIFIs are subject to enhanced prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. On April 21, 2017, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum calling for the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a review of the SIFI designation process within 180 days. The memorandum recommended a temporary pause on designations until the review was complete. Currently, two insurers (AIG and Prudential) are designated as SIFIs. FSOC is required to review SIFIs' designations at least once a year. FSOC last designated a SIFI in December 2014. If a SIFI were de-designated, it would automatically cease to be subject to enhanced regulation. In a vote to designate a company as a SIFI, the FSOC chair has veto power. However, de-designating an existing SIFI requires a vote of two-thirds of FSOC, including the chair. In other words, the chair can unilaterally prevent a SIFI from being designated or de-designated but cannot unilaterally de-designate an existing SIFI. ", "Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) to resolve certain failing financial firms. OLA can only be triggered if the Treasury Secretary makes a determination, subject to a recommendation by the Fed and FDIC and subject to judicial review, that the firm's failure would \"have serious adverse effects on financial stability,\" and no viable private alternative is available to OLA. OLA has never been used since its enactment in 2010. On April 21, 2017, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum calling for the Treasury Secretary to review OLA and refrain from using OLA until the review is complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leadership Nominations", "paragraphs": ["All the leadership positions at the financial regulators have fixed terms and are appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Many recent reforms were approved by current agency leadership, who might therefore be reluctant to revisit them. Although not always specified in statute, it appears that the heads of financial regulators, in contrast with Cabinet Secretaries, typically do not serve at the pleasure of the President (\"at will\"). Instead, most financial regulators may be removed only if a higher \"for cause\" threshold is met. (An ongoing court case will determine whether the CFPB director's for cause removal status is constitutional given the unique structure of the CFPB.) Thus, opportunities to nominate individuals for these positions generally must wait until the positions become vacant as terms end or individuals step down prematurely. Over time, these positions will become vacant, allowing President Trump to nominate candidates to fill most, if not all, of them. On May 2, 2017, the Senate confirmed President Trump's nominee, Jay Clayton, to be chair of the SEC. At present, several positions are vacant, including the chairs of the OCC and the CFTC. President Trump's nominees for chairs of the OCC and the CFTC await Senate confirmation.

Most, but not all, multimember boards or commissions have statutory political affiliation requirements that give the President's party a majority of seats but limit the number of board members from one party. These requirements might limit the number of like-minded nominees that the President could select."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
