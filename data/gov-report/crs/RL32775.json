In recent years, the programs have been criticized because a large share of funding is allocated to institutions on the basis of amounts received in prior years for \"base guarantees\" as opposed to being allocated exclusively on the basis of aggregate student financial need. They also have been criticized because the current funding procedures allow institutions that receive proportionately greater funding on a per-student basis to provide larger awards to students with higher incomes than can be provided to lower-income students at institutions that receive less funding. In recent Congress bills have been introduced to modify the funding procedures by gradually phasing out base guarantee funding and requiring all campus-based funding to be allocated to institutions according to existing need-based \"fair share\" formulas.", "This report describes and analyzes (a) the process through which federal funds are allocated to institutions under the campus-based programs, (b) the potential for allocating all campus-based funding according to the existing need-based formulas, and (c) the current distribution of aid to students. It will be updated to track legislative proposals addressing the campus-based allocation procedures. Major findings presented in the report include the following:", "Under each program, the majority of funds are allocated to institutions on the basis of amounts received in prior years, while only a modest amount are allocated according to aggregate student financial need as calculated according to \"fair share\" formulas. Under the need-based formulas, the cost of attendance at an institution is the dominant factor in determining institutional need. Much greater amounts of institutional need are calculated on a per-student basis at high-cost institutions than at low-cost institutions. At low-cost institutions, institutional need comprises limited amounts of aggregate student need attributable to large numbers of predominately low-income students, while at high-cost institutions, it tends to comprise greater amounts of need attributable to a smaller number of mostly middle- and upper-income students. It is estimated that if the allocation procedures were to be modified so that funding was allocated entirely on the basis of institutions' proportionate share of institutional need, more institutions would receive allocation increases than would receive allocation decreases. Larger proportions of students at higher-cost institutions receive campus-based aid, and receive larger awards, than do comparable students at lower-cost institutions; however, average awards at higher-cost institutions cover a smaller percentage of costs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Three need-based Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) \u2014the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program\u2014are collectively referred to as the campus-based financial aid programs. The programs are called the campus-based programs largely because participating institutions of higher education (IHEs) have a significant role in administering the programs and because they must use institutional funds to match the federal funds they receive for the operation of the programs. In contrast to other need-based FSA programs in which aid is awarded to students according to non-discretionary criteria, the financial aid administrators of participating IHEs have discretion in determining the mix and amount of aid individual students receive from funds made available under the programs. The FSEOG program allows IHEs to provide grant aid to undergraduate students who have not yet earned a first baccalaureate degree. The FWS program supports undergraduate and graduate students through subsidized part-time employment. Under the Perkins Loan program, IHEs use federal capital contributions (FCCs) to help establish revolving loan funds from which they make low-interest loans to undergraduate and graduate students. Over $3.8 billion in financial aid is awarded annually to students under the three programs.", "The programs are popular with many IHEs and financial aid administrators because of the flexibility they provide to tailor aid to meet the specific needs of students and for the ability to shift funds between programs. The programs have come to be criticized, however, for the way in which the majority of funding provided for the programs is allocated to institutions in proportion to the amount they received in previous award years, as opposed to being allocated entirely according to the aggregate financial need of the students attending each institution. The programs have also been criticized because the current distribution of funds allows institutions that receive proportionately more funding on a per-student basis to give larger campus-based awards to more students and to students with higher incomes than can be awarded at other institutions.", "Some have proposed modifying the campus-based programs' funding procedures to gradually phase out the current practice of allocating the majority of funds to institutions on the basis of the amounts they received in prior years and to require that all funding eventually be provided in proportion to the aggregate financial need of students at participating institutions. Others have expressed concern that amending the allocation procedures without also providing increased funding for the campus-based programs overall might result only in making more aid available to needy students at some institutions at the expense of needy students at those institutions that would experience funding decreases. In the 109 th Congress, H.R. 609 , as introduced in the House, would have amended the allocation procedures for the campus-based programs to gradually phase out provisions that provide for the allocation of funds on the basis of the amounts institutions' received in prior years so that eventually all funds would be allocated to institutions on the basis of their aggregate student financial need. However, these provisions were removed during consideration of the bill, and H.R. 609 as passed by the House would have retained the current allocation procedures. The Senate bill to reauthorize the HEA in the 109 th Congress, S. 1614 , also would have retained the current allocation procedures. While the 110 th Congress will likely consider bills to amend and extend the HEA, it is unclear whether substantive changes to the allocation procedures to the campus-based programs will be proposed. (Additional information on the campus-based programs, including a history of appropriations and basic program data for each of the three programs, and a review and analysis of proposals to amend the programs under bills that would reauthorize the HEA can be found in CRS Report RL31618, Campus-Based Student Financial Aid Programs Under the Higher Education Act , by [author name scrubbed].)", "This report describes and analyzes the process through which federal funds are currently allocated to IHEs under the campus-based programs and also examines the subsequent distribution of aid to recipients of awards provided under the programs.

This includes a discussion of the development of the allocation procedures and significant changes to them over the history of the programs. Next, the report analyzes the allocation of funds to IHEs according to the current allocation procedures, focusing on key aspects of these procedures that largely affect the distribution of funds to institutions. The report then discusses issues related to the campus-based programs that may be considered as the 110 th Congress debates reauthorization of the HEA. In particular, it examines how the distribution of funds to institutions might be affected should the current allocation procedures for the programs be amended to phase out the allocation of funds on the basis of prior year allocations in favor of providing institutions with funding entirely on the basis of aggregate student need, as had been proposed in prior Congresses. The report concludes with a review and analysis of the distribution of campus-based financial aid to different types of students at participating IHEs and an examination of the role that the current allocation procedures may have in affecting the distribution of aid."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Allocation Formulas for the Campus-Based Financial Aid Programs", "paragraphs": ["Under each of the campus-based programs, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) allocates funds to participating IHEs according to a complex two-stage procedure. These allocation procedures are specified in the authorizing statute of each program. While there are slight differences between programs, the allocation procedures all share the same basic framework. In the first stage, an IHE that is a continuing participant in a program receives funding based on what it received in prior years. This is commonly referred to as the base guarantee . In general, an IHE's base guarantee is equal to some portion of the funds it received in FY1999; however, there are also procedures for allocating a base guarantee to IHEs that began participating in a campus-based program after FY1999.", "In the second stage, any funds remaining after the allocation of base guarantees are allocated to IHEs according to need-based formula allocation procedures. Under the allocation formulas for the programs, each IHE receives funding in proportion to its share of the national total of institutional need that is in excess of the amount it received as its base guarantee. (Institutional need is a program-specific measure of the total financial need of all eligible students at an IHE). Under each of the formulas, ED determines the amount of funds each IHE would receive if the entire appropriation for the program were to be allocated in proportion to its share of the national total of institutional need (supposing that no funds were allocated for base guarantees). This amount is referred to as an institution's fair share . If an IHE's fair share is greater than its base guarantee, it has a shortfall in funding and is eligible to receive additional funding\u2014a fair share increase \u2014to help reduce its shortfall. An IHE's total allocation is the sum of its base guarantee and its fair share increase. Figure 1 summarizes the allocation procedures for the campus-based programs.", "The basic structure for allocating campus-based program funding to institutions\u2014first for base guarantees, and then for fair share increases\u2014can be traced back to procedures developed in the late 1970's and first put into place for the 1979-1980 award year. Funding for the campus-based programs previously was allocated according to a different two-stage procedure in which funds first were apportioned on a state-by-state basis according to the student population in each state, and then sub-allocated to IHEs on the basis of the student need at institutions within each state according to a procedure called the panel review process . Under the panel review process, institutions would apply to receive a share of the funds allocated to their state based on the projected financial need of their students. A regional panel would then review the institutions' applications and determine the amount of funding each IHE would receive. In the mid-1970s, the panel review process became subject to criticism for being too complex and time-consuming, and for leading to inequities in the distribution of aid to students. In response, the U.S. Office of Education convened a panel of experts to study and make recommendations on how to allocate funds to IHEs under the campus-based programs. The panel's recommendations led to the implementation of new allocation procedures. Over time, these procedures have been modified slightly; however, the same basic structure remains.", "At the time the new allocation procedures were adopted, it was decided that in the first year of their implementation, IHEs would first be allocated funds in amounts comparable to what they had received in the past. Called the conditional guarantee , this was the precursor to the current base guarantee. Funds remaining after the allocation of conditional guarantees would be allocated according to the fair share formulas. In the first year of implementation, conditional guarantees were to be set at the greater of the amount of funds IHEs had expended in either the 1977-1978 or 1978-1979 award years. The next year, they were to receive 90% of that amount. In subsequent years, conditional guarantees were to be gradually reduced until ultimately all funds were allocated according to the fair share allocation procedures. Ultimately, however, conditional guarantees\u2014now called base guarantees\u2014were not phased out. The majority of the funds appropriated for each of the three campus-based programs continues to be allocated for institutional base guarantees. (It is important to note that as appropriations increase, a greater proportion of funding becomes available for fair share increases, while a decrease in appropriations results in proportionally more funding being allocated for base guarantees.)", "The capacity of an IHE to award campus-based aid to eligible students is directly related to the amount of funds it receives. The major factors determining each IHE's allocation are its base guarantee, its cost of attendance (COA), the number of FSA applicants, and the expected family contributions (EFCs) of those students.

Because most institutions' base guarantees are equal to a portion of the amount of funds they received in prior award years, it is often stated that the procedures for determining base guarantees favor long-term participants over new entrants to the programs. More precisely, the base guarantee component of the allocation procedures gives a funding advantage to an institution with a base guarantee that is greater than its fair share. Base guarantees are determined according to the following procedures:", "First, from the funds appropriated for any of the programs, each IHE that participated in that particular program in FY1999 is allocated a base guarantee equal to 100% of the sum of (a) its FY1999 base guarantee and (b) its FY1999 pro rata , or proportional, share of the funds that remained after the allocation of all base guarantees. Next, those IHEs that began participation in the program after FY1999, but which are not first- or second-time participants, are allocated a base guarantee equal to the greater of $5,000, or 90% of the amount they received in their second year of participation (100% in the case of Perkins Loan FCCs). Finally, IHEs that are participating in the program for their first or second year receive a base guarantee equal to the greatest of (a) $5,000, (b) 90% of the per-pupil amount allocated to and used by comparable institutions in the second preceding fiscal year, multiplied by the number of students at the IHE, or (c) 90% of what the IHE received in its first year of participation.", "However, notwithstanding the second and third of these steps, if an institution began participating in the program after FY1999 and received a larger allocation in its second year of participation than in its first, its base guarantee is equal to 90% of the allocation it received in its second year of participation.

Public four-year and proprietary institutions are distributed somewhat evenly across the lower-middle to upper-middle cost categories.

At the time the fair share allocation formulas were introduced, it was anticipated that base guarantees would eventually be phased out, and that this would be done gradually in a manner that would not result in wild fluctuations in the amount of funds institutions received. For the FSEOG program, provisions to phase out the base guarantee were even included as part of the authorizing statute for a period of time. Under the Higher Education Amendments of 1980 ( P.L. 96-374 ), the allocation procedures were amended to call for a 20% decrease in each institution's base guarantee for every $20 million appropriated for the program in excess of $400 million. However, the Higher Education Act Technical Amendments of 1982 ( P.L. 97-301 ) prevented this provision from being implemented. Since then, base guarantees have remained a part of the allocation procedures for each of the campus-based programs.", "Under the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 ( P.L. 99-498 ) the campus-based allocation procedures were amended to provide IHEs with base guarantees equal to 100% of their 1985 allocation. The revised allocation procedures also provided that after base guarantees were awarded, 25% of the funds remaining from each program's appropriation were then allocated (as pro rata shares ) to IHEs in amounts proportional to their base guarantees. Only 75% of the funds remaining after the allocation of base guarantees were allocated according to the fair share formulas. Under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ), the procedures for determining base guarantees were revised again. These procedures (described earlier in this report) remain in effect.", "Prior to the Higher Education Amendments of 1986, the campus-based allocation procedures had specified that funds would first be apportioned to states, primarily on the basis of the population in each state, prior to being allocated to IHEs. Thus, an IHE's allocation depended in part on the state in which it was located. Since the 1986 Amendments, ED has allocated funds directly to IHEs and the state in which an institution is located has not played a direct role in funding allocations. However, the legacy of the base guarantee allocation procedures has had the effect of perpetuating the distribution of funds to IHEs in a manner that to an extent reflects the distribution of the student age population across states and IHE's institutional need as they existed years ago. Given that institutions have grown at different rates, and so has the aggregate financial need of their students, some institutions' base guarantees may be close to or even exceed their fair share of funds, while other's base guarantees may represent only a fraction of their fair share. Often, IHEs have grown faster in some parts of the country than in others.", " Table 3 shows (a) the total number of IHEs participating in each of the campus-based programs, (b) the number of IHEs with base guarantees that are greater than their fair share, and (c) the number that are eligible to receive a fair share increase above their base guarantee allocation.

Totals are provided for each program, as well as by COA categories, and by state.", "The table shows that the majority of the funding provided for each of the campus-based programs is allocated to meet institutions' base guarantees. In the FWS program, two-thirds of funding goes to base guarantees and for the Perkins Loan program, over 92% of funding is provided to meet base guarantees. There does not appear to be a strong relationship between institutional COA and whether IHEs receive funding only according to base guarantee procedures, or if they also receive a fair share increase. However, in each of the programs, middle-cost IHEs receive a somewhat greater proportion of their funding for base guarantees than do IHEs on average. Also, under the FSEOG program, very high-cost IHEs are allocated a much greater proportion of their funding for base guarantees than are IHEs on average.", "When examining the proportion of funds allocated for base guarantees by state, Table 3 shows wide variation in the FSEOG and FWS programs. In some states, more than 90% of funding goes toward meeting base guarantees, while in others base guarantees comprise less than half of total allocations. This degree of variation may have resulted in part because in some states, IHEs may have seen considerable growth in institutional need since the base guarantee procedures were implemented, whereas in others, base guarantee funding meets or exceeds total institutional need for most institutions.", "In the Perkins Loan program, more than 90% of funds are allocated for base guarantees in all but a few states. This is likely because, in contrast to the other two campus-based programs, appropriations for Perkins Loan FCCs have decreased substantially since the early 1980s. When appropriations decrease, base guarantees comprise a greater proportion of total funding. Through FY2004, funds remained available for Perkins Loan FCC base guarantees and fair share increases, despite declining appropriations, largely because a considerable number of institutions have ceased participation in the program. Had this not occurred, it is likely that funds would have been available only for the allocation of base guarantees. (No funds were appropriated for Perkins Loan FCCs for FY2005 nor FY2006.)", "Given that more than half of funds appropriated for the campus-based programs are allocated for base guarantees, if base guarantees were to be reduced or phased out so that all funds were allocated according to the fair share formulas, there could be a noticeable shift in the distribution of funds allocated to IHEs.

The last revision to the income bands occurred in 1994 for the 1995-1996 award year, when the highest income bands were raised to $60,000 and above for dependent students, and to $20,000 and above for independent students; and some lower income bands were consolidated.", "Since the relationship between an institution's COA and students' average EFCs determines its institutional need, it is important that the average EFCs for each income band reflect as closely as possible the actual EFCs of students at participating institutions. It appears, however, that with the growth in incomes that has occurred over the years, the current income bands used in the fair share formulas may no longer be as reliable a proxy of actual student EFCs for upper-income students as they once were because so many students are in the highest income category. At many institutions\u2014particularly high-cost institutions\u2014students in the highest income category often comprise the largest group of students. At low-cost IHEs, students in the higher-income categories do not contribute to the tabulation of institutional need because their composite EFC is typically greater than the IHE's COA. However, at high-cost institutions, the need calculated for students in the upper income bands often constitutes the majority of institutional need.", "The table of EFCs also does not take into account whether independent students have their own dependents. (In general for FSA purposes, independent students with dependents and those without are categorized separately.) Since slightly more than half of undergraduate students are classified as independent for FSA purposes, and with the significant effect that having dependents typically has on lowering students' EFCs, calculating average EFCs for independent students without taking into account whether they have their own dependents may result in average EFCs that mask or cancel out the differences in EFCs that exist for independent students with dependents and those without dependents. This could affect the calculation of institutional need if independent students with dependents and those without dependents are unevenly distributed across institutions. For example, if independent students with dependents attend certain institutions in greater (or lower) proportions than do independent students without dependents, then the practice of combining all independent students as a single group could result in lower (or higher) amounts of institutional need being calculated for them than otherwise might occur if independent students were treated separately.", " Figure 2 shows estimates based on data from the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) of the number of undergraduate dependent students in each of the income bands of the Table of EFCs used in the campus-based formulas. The distribution of students is concentrated at the middle- and upper-income categories, with the most students in the highest income band. This distribution suggests that a more accurate reflection of upper-income students EFCs could be obtained if additional income bands were added for dependent students from families with incomes above $60,000.", " Figure 3 shows estimates of the number of independent undergraduate students, and graduate and professional students in each of the income bands used in the Table of EFCs ( Table 1 ). However, unlike the Table of EFCs, it also distinguishes between independent students with dependents (both undergraduate, and graduate and professional) and those without. Figure 3 shows that independent students are concentrated in the highest income band. It also shows that independent students with dependents and those without dependents are distributed unevenly across income bands. Similar to the case with dependent students, it appears that more accurate calculations of average EFCs might be obtained for independent students if the top income band were broken up into multiple categories. In addition, given the uneven distribution of independent students with and without dependents across the various income bands, it appears that better approximations of students' actual EFCs could be made if average EFCs were calculated separately for independent students with and without dependents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Average Need Per Student", "paragraphs": ["While at any particular institution, students with the lowest incomes may be the primary recipients of campus-based aid, the amount of institutions' allocations as determined under the campus-based fair share formulas, by design, is based on the aggregate need of all students eligible for FSA aid at the institution. In the current postsecondary education environment in which college costs have been rising rapidly in recent years, it is not uncommon under the fair share formulas for institutional need at higher-cost IHEs to be comprised largely of the financial need of middle- and upper-income students, whereas at lower-cost IHEs, institutional need is comprised primarily of the financial need of lower- and middle-income students. In many instances, students attending high-cost institutions who are from upper-income families have more financial need than students attending lower-cost institutions who are from lower-income families.", "Institutional need is the sum of the financial need of the students attending any particular IHE. The critical factor in the calculation of institutional need is the relationship between institutional COA and students' composite EFCs. At lower-cost IHEs, upper-income students' composite EFCs are often so high relative to COA that under the formulas, they do not contribute to institutional need. However at higher-cost IHEs, the relationship between the EFC assigned to students in the highest-income band and COA often still results in financial need being calculated for those students. Combined with the even greater need calculated for lower-income students, this can result in very high amounts of institutional need being calculated for high-cost IHEs. Figure 4 shows the average amount of need calculated under the fair share formulas for each program, by category of institution, on a per-student basis.", " Figure 4 demonstrates that on a per-student basis, the largest amounts of need are calculated for IHEs with the highest COAs. While it is not surprising that students with any given EFC will have more need if they attend institutions with high COAs than if they attend lower-cost institutions, the effect that this has on the distribution of aid to institutions and the subsequent availability of aid to students attending these institutions is striking. This is especially so, because as will be shown later in this report, low- and middle-income students constitute the greatest proportion of students at low-cost institutions, and upper-income students make up the greatest proportion of those attending high-cost institutions. The design of the fair share formulas, however, results in significantly greater amounts of need being calculated for students at high-cost institutions than for students at low-cost institutions. In many instances, significantly more need is calculated for upper-income students at high-cost institutions than for students with very low EFCs who attend low-cost institutions.

(There is no specific maximum award amount in the FWS program.) Thus, if sufficient federal funding were to be made available to provide institutions with allocations equal to their institutional need, some conceivably would be unable to distribute it all as campus-based aid to students because of statutory limitations on maximum award amounts and because of the requirement that federal funds must be matched with institutional funds (generally according to a 3:1 ratio)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tabulation of Institutional Need", "paragraphs": ["It was just shown that there are stark differences between institutions with high and low COAs in the amount of need calculated on a per-student basis.

(Nearly all of the aid shown in the Pell Grant and LEAP/SLEAP category is Pell Grant aid). With Pell Grants serving as the foundation of need-based aid for low-income students, it is not surprising that Pell Grants are received in the greatest amounts by students attending the lowest-cost IHEs, which are attended by low-income students in the greatest proportions. With few students at high-cost schools receiving Pell Grants, FSEOG need at these IHEs is affected only slightly by the subtraction of Pell Grant aid. The comparatively small amount of LEAP/SLEAP aid is distributed relatively evenly across categories of IHEs and FSEOG need is not disproportionately affected by its subtraction in any category of institutions.", "As previously mentioned, the formula for calculating FSEOG need was designed with the presumption that 75% of college costs would be met through the combination of students' EFC, scholarships, and grants (in the current formula, EFC and federal grants). Pell Grant and LEAP/SLEAP aid are subtracted from the amount of aggregate student need calculated in the formula to ensure that FSEOG funding is provided to supplement Pell Grant and other gift aid, but not duplicate it. Since the time when the formulas were last amended, higher education tax benefits (e.g., the Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits, and the Higher Education Deduction) have evolved as a new type of federal financial assistance that shares an essential characteristic with gift aid\u2014namely, that students' (or their parents') receipt of the credits is not conditioned on any non-academic obligation (e.g., repayment of funds, or a service requirement). Gift aid and tax benefits may be referred to as obligation-free aid . The FSEOG need formula, however, does not contain any provision that would account for the receipt of higher education tax benefits by eligible students.", "The different treatment of the various types of obligation-free aid could be of concern when considering their effect on the calculation of FSEOG need. Pell Grants are targeted to low-income students who disproportionately attend low-cost institutions, while the Hope and Lifelong Learning higher education tax credits are primarily beneficial to middle- and upper-income students. Since Pell Grants (and LEAP/SLEAP aid) are subtracted from the student need computed under the FSEOG need formula and Hope and Lifelong Learning tax credits are not, this may affect how closely FSEOG need, as calculated, represents actual aggregate student need. While it appears that subtracting out tax credit aid might make the FSEOG need formula more equitable than it currently is in determining aggregate student need\u2014especially when distinguishing between institutions attended by students with different incomes\u2014there does not appear to be any easy way for IHEs to gather and report the value of tax credits on the FISAP for use in the allocation of funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FWS Self-Help Need", "paragraphs": ["In the FWS program, the aggregate amount of institutional self-help need tabulated for different types of students differs noticeably between categories of IHEs.

However, for graduate and professional students, self-help need is calculated exclusively by multiplying the number of students in each income band by the difference between graduate and professional student COA and the EFC taken from the Table of EFCs for students in each respective income band. For undergraduate students, 25% of COA is often the lesser of the two amounts and thus serves to limit the amount of self-help need calculated for undergraduate students. For graduate and professional students, the difference between COA and EFC is often quite large\u2014especially at higher-cost IHEs.

(Higher-cost institutions participate in all three programs in the greatest percentages\u2014see Row g. in Table 12 .) Information on the number of eligible applicants, the number receiving campus-based awards, and the percent receiving aid and average award amounts by program are presented in Table 13 for each COA category.", "This analysis shows that among students attending IHEs participating in all three campus-based programs, at low-cost institutions, only 15.3% of students received any type of campus-based aid with the average total award being $1,086. At very high-cost institutions, 44.0% of students received campus-based aid, with total awards averaging $3,228. When examining all students as a group, both the proportion of students receiving aid and average aid amounts increased steadily with COA across categories of institutions. At low-cost institutions, the average award covered 15.4% of the median COA, while at very high-cost institutions, the average combined award covered 10.9% of the median COA.", "Graduate and professional students, who may receive aid only under the FWS and Perkins Loan programs, received larger awards on average than did undergraduate students in any category. Both the percentage of students receiving aid and average award amounts increase consistently with institutional COA. In the very high-cost category of institutions, 37.2% of undergraduate dependent students from families with incomes of $60,000 and above receive some form of campus-based aid, with the average total award being $2,127. Both the percentage of students receiving aid and the average award amount are greater for students in this category than for any undergraduate student category in both the low-cost and lower middle-cost categories of IHEs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The procedures currently used to allocate funds to institutions under the campus-based programs were developed several decades ago in response to concerns that had been raised about the inequitable distribution of funds. When these procedures were developed, it was envisioned that funds would be allocated according to a series of formulas designed to provide each institution with funding in proportion to its fair share of aggregate student need. To ease the transition to the new formula-based fair share method of allocating funds, for a limited period, IHEs were to receive a conditional or base guarantee of funding proportional to the amount they had received in a base year. However, instead of being phased out over time, base guarantees remain the primary method for allocating the majority of the funds appropriated for the campus-based programs. In recent years, proposals again have been made to phase out funding for base guarantees and to transition to the allocation of funds to institutions entirely on the basis of their fair share of aggregate student need.", "To facilitate an understanding of the potential consequences of modifying the current procedures for allocating funds to institutions, this report has set out to explain in detail the functioning of the current allocation procedures and the resulting distribution of aid to students. Throughout the report, the distribution of funding to institutions and the distribution of aid to students was explored by grouping institutions into categories in rank order of their costs of attendance. It was shown that under each of the campus-based programs the majority of funding is currently allocated to institutions on the basis of their institutional base guarantees. In each of the programs, there is only modest variation across categories of institutions in the proportion of total funding allocated to institutions on the basis of their base guarantees, while there is somewhat more variation across institutions grouped by states. Most of the funding provided for the FSEOG and FWS programs is allocated according to institutional base guarantees, and nearly all is for the Perkins Loan program.", "An analysis of the calculation of institutional need has shown that institutional COA plays a critical role in determining the amount of aggregate need calculated under the fair share formulas for any particular IHE. Since COA varies widely across institutions, vastly different amounts of need can be calculated on a per-student basis depending on the characteristics of the institution. In many instances, for high-cost institutions the average amount of need calculated on a per-student basis greatly exceeds the maximum award amount, and exceeds the federal share by an even greater amount. When examined in the aggregate for categories of institutions, it was shown that at low-cost institutions, institutional need is largely the aggregate need of undergraduate independent students and low-income dependent students; whereas at higher-cost institutions, institutional need is largely the aggregate need of upper-income undergraduate dependent students and graduate and professional students. It was also noted that for the FSEOG program, aggregate student need is offset by Pell Grant aid (which is targeted primarily at low-income students), while no adjustments are made for higher education tax benefits (which are beneficial primarily to middle- and upper-income students).", "The prospect of eliminating the allocation of funds for institutional base guarantees in favor of providing all funding on the basis of fair share criteria was also examined. It was found that in the FSEOG program, there would only be a modest redistribution of funds across categories of IHEs based on COA. Nonetheless, there would be a considerable amount of churning in the allocation of funds within categories, and more institutions would receive an increase in funding than a decrease. For the FWS and Perkins Loan programs, if funds were to be allocated entirely on the basis of the fair share formulas, very high-cost IHEs, as a category, would receive a funding increase, due to the high aggregate need of their student bodies. Overall, however, more IHEs would receive allocation increases than decreases if base guarantees were eliminated.", "Analysis of the distribution of aid to students revealed that despite there being a strong correlation between a student's family income and the cost of attendance at the institution a student attends, larger proportions of students at high-cost institutions receive campus-based aid than students at low-cost institutions. In the FSEOG program, award amounts are larger at high-cost IHEs than at low-cost ones, while in the FWS and Perkins Loan programs, awards tend to be of similar values across institutions and student groups. Higher-cost institutions are more likely to participate in all three campus-based programs than are lower-cost institutions. However, even when examining only institutions that participate in all three programs, it is revealed that higher-cost institutions are able to give larger awards to a higher proportion of their students than are lower-cost institutions.", "The findings presented in this report highlight an important characteristic of need based financial aid\u2014that student financial need is relative to the COA at the institution a student attends. A middle- or upper-income student attending a higher-cost institution may have financial need, whereas a similarly situated student attending a low-cost institution might have no financial need. Under the campus-based programs, this has resulted in higher-cost institutions having greater institutional need, on a per-student basis, than lower-cost institutions. In turn, this has allowed higher-cost IHEs to provide larger awards\u2014even to students with higher incomes\u2014than could be provided by lower-cost IHEs. Still, at higher-cost IHEs, these substantially larger campus-based awards typically cover a much smaller portion of COA than do awards at lower-cost IHEs."], "subsections": []}]}}
