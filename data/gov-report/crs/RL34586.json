Although Congress provided support during this time for other global health initiatives that affect CS/MH, such as some $19.7 billion for international programs that prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria, other global health interventions are discussed only as they relate to USAID's CS/MH programs.", "According to latest estimates, 9.7 million children under the age of five died in 2006; some 26,000 each day.

Despite the decrease, Ms. Veneman asserted that a critical number of daily deaths among children under five remains high; some 26,000 die each day. Most studies that measure child mortality focus on deaths that occur before age five because 90% of childhood deaths occur during this time, while 37% occur during the neonatal period (the first 28 days), amounting to about 4 million annual newborn deaths.", "The majority of child deaths occur in developing countries, and almost half of them in Africa.

According to UNICEF, undernutrition is the underlying cause of up to half of these deaths.", "Some health experts assert that maternal and child health are particularly important to monitor, because their mortality rates serve as a barometer for overall health conditions. Supporters of this idea often use the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) listed in Table 2 to demonstrate the interconnected nature of health and development and to gauge improvements in child and maternal health ( Table 3 ). MDGs 4 and 5 call for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. The ability to reach those goals, however, is affected by progress in other MDGs. For example, countries with significant undernourished populations (MDG 1) that lack sufficient access to clean water (MDG 7) tend to have higher maternal and child mortality rates (MDGs 4 and 5); undernourished women and children are also more likely to be impoverished (MDG 1) and are more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria (MDG 6).

More than 500,000 women die each year due to pregnancy-related causes, and an additional 15-20 million more suffer debilitating long-term effects, such as obstetric fistula (discussed below). The vast majority of women who die during or shortly after labor live in developing countries where maternal mortality rates are significantly higher than in industrialized nations ( Table 4 ). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) maintains that almost all of these deaths could be prevented if women in developing countries had access to adequate diets, safe water and sanitation facilities, basic literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth. UNICEF estimates that 20% of all maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and that about 75% of maternal deaths are caused by obstetric complications including hemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disorders (mostly eclampsia), prolonged or obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions.", "Maternal mortality and morbidity rates are generally higher for mothers younger than 20 years who typically have more pregnancy and delivery complications, such as toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, prolonged labor, and cervical trauma, and are at higher risk of delivering low birth weight babies. Pregnancy-related complications are the leading cause of death among 15- to-19-year-olds around the world, and their babies have higher morbidity and mortality rates. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year. Girls aged between 15 and 19 years are twice as likely to die from childbirth as women in their twenties, and those younger than 15 years are five times as likely to die. A survey conducted in Mali indicated that the maternal mortality rate for girls aged between 15 and 19 years was 178 per 100,000 live births and 32 per 100,000 for women aged between 20 and 34 years.", "Causes of maternal death vary significantly among regions. Data collected from 1990 through 2006 indicate that hemorrhage caused about 34% and 31% of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, respectively. In industrialized nations and Latin America and the Caribbean, hemorrhage caused an estimated 13% and 21% of maternal deaths, respectively ( Table 5 ). The United Nations has found that regions with the lowest proportions of skilled health attendants at birth also have the highest maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women gave birth with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant, 65% in south Asia, and 99% in industrialized nations. One in every 22 women in sub-Saharan Africa will likely die from pregnancy-related causes, as will one in every 59 Asian women. In industrialized nations, meanwhile, one in every 8,000 woman faces the probability of dying from pregnancy-related causes.", "UNICEF has found that health systems in many countries do not have the capacity to reduce mortality nationwide. Of the 68 priority countries that account for 97% of all maternal and child deaths, 54 (80%) have health workforce densities below the critical threshold (2.5 health workers per 1,000 people) for significantly improving their health conditions and reaching the health-related MDGs ( Table 6 ). South Africa and Swaziland are the only two sub-Saharan African countries among the 68 priority countries that have reached the minimum standard. Child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with ample numbers of health workers to administer immunizations, easy access to clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and sufficient access to nutritious food.", "While the greatest shortage of health care workers in absolute terms is in southeast Asia (mostly in Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia), sub-Saharan Africa suffers from the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers in the world. WHO estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers, of which 36 are in Africa and none in industrialized nations. Globally, WHO estimates that an additional 4.3 million health workers are needed, and that on average, countries across Africa would need to increase their number of health workers by about 140% in order to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID's Efforts to Improve Child Survival", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Agency for International Development is the lead U.S. agency responsible for improving child survival around the world.

The cost of ART is significantly higher for children than for adults. UNAIDS estimates that an annual supply of generic ARTs costs about $260 per child, while the same regimen for adults costs about $183. Fixed-dosed treatments, in which two or three different drugs are combined in a single pill, have proved to be most effective, though they are more expensive for children. In 2005, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for an adult costs an average of $148 in low-income countries, but the regimen for children cost $2,000 per child and $800 for a generic version.

Obstetric fistula can be prevented by delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean surgery when needed. The condition can be repaired for about $300, a cost that is prohibitive to most young girls and women in the most affected countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase Support for Health System Strengthening and Improve Donor Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Some observers advocate that Congress increase spending on health systems, because to significantly reduce maternal and child mortality, governments must be able to effectively undertake a range of health strategies, including ensuring income and food levels; the nutritional and health status of mothers; access to immunizations, oral rehydration therapy, and maternal and child health services (including prenatal care); safe drinking water; and basic sanitation. Improvements in these areas are significantly affected by the strength of health systems and availability of health workers. UNICEF has found that without donor support, health systems in many countries cannot deliver essential interventions (such as vaccinations) sufficiently enough to reduce mortality nationwide.", "Supporters of strengthening health systems urge Congress to direct USAID to better coordinate its health assistance with other donors and with respective health ministries to improve efficiency and overall health outcomes. Proponents of this idea point to WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+)\u2014a coalition of international health agencies, governments, and donors committed to improving health and development outcomes in developing countries and reaching the health-related MDGs. The IHP+ encourages donors to create a compact with countries to commit development partners and governments to support one results-oriented national health plan in a harmonized way that will ensure predictable, long-term financing from both national and international sources. A compact is a contract through which the international community and the recipient country reach consensus on results based on mutual accountability. Country compacts bind all donors and respective government agencies to one single country health plan, one monitoring and evaluation plan, one budget (with external funding harmonized with recipient countries' budget cycles), one reporting and validation process, and benchmarks for government performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Encourage Governments to Increase National Health Budgets", "paragraphs": ["Global health experts increasingly underscore the role recipient governments should play in improving health systems. Some critics contend that donors must consider the role that political will plays in minimal health spending by many developing countries.

According to the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Plans of Action of the Abuja Declarations on Malaria (2000), and HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (2000/1 to 2005) , 33% of AU States had allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to the health sector by 2004, 38% spent between 5% and 10% on health care, and 29% indicated reserving less than 5% of their national budgets for health systems. Only Botswana reported spending at least 15% on health.", "Although most health experts agree that African governments need to boost their health budgets, some counter that poor political will is not the primary cause of low health spending. Instead, opponents argue that structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices have limited African governments' abilities to increase investments in public health and health worker education. Shrunken health budgets have led to a decline in the quality of education and training opportunities for medical students, a perpetual shortage of health supplies and equipment (e.g., sanitation gloves and hypodermic needles), insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and a brain drain of African health workers. The International Development Research Center maintains, however, that discussions about the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures are often laden with biased terminology that observers use to make \"sweeping triumphalist or catastrophist arguments.\" The organization found that results of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform were mixed and that the organization could \"support neither the opinion of those who believe the erosion of public expenditure on health is a characteristic feature of adjustment, nor of those who hold the opposite view.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislation Introduced in the 110th Congress Related to Maternal and Child Health", "paragraphs": ["Below is a list of bills introduced to date in the 110 th Congress to directly and indirectly improve maternal and child health.", "H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 , Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, increased support for maternal and child health by $5 million for FY2008.
