Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, the federal government had no established approach to security for federally owned or leased facilities. Immediately following the bombing, President William J. Clinton directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to assess the vulnerability of federal facilities to terrorist attacks or violence and to develop recommendations for minimum security standards. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), within DOJ, coordinated two working groups to accomplish these presidential directives. The working groups identified and evaluated various security measures and activities that could address potential vulnerabilities, and minimum security standards were proposed for federal facilities. Additionally, USMS deputies and General Services Administration (GSA) security specialists conducted inspections at more than 1,200 federal facilities to obtain security data on buildings for use in upgrading existing conditions to comply with the proposed minimum standards. The result of the working groups' efforts was the Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities report. After the report was issued, President Clinton directed all executive branch agencies to begin upgrading their facilities to meet the recommended minimum security standards. Following the DOJ recommendations, President Clinton also required GSA to establish building security committees for GSA-managed facilities.", "The September 2001 terrorist attacks, the September 2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings, and the April 2014 Fort Hood shootings focused the federal government's attention on building security activities.

Physical assault by criminals and weapon (including explosives) possession appear to be the most frequent crimes committed at federal facilities. On September 16, 2013, a federal contractor shot fellow employees at the Washington Navy Yard facility. This resulted in a Department of Defense (DOD) investigation on the Navy Yard's security operations. ", "Federal facility security is as diffuse as the number of law enforcement agencies securing them. Individual facilities secured by the same law enforcement agency may be secured in different manners based on specific security needs and threats. This makes it challenging to collect official and comprehensive data on threats to or incidents occurring at federal facilities. A brief search of media sources between 2005 and 2017 reveals approximately 67 media-reported threats or incidents. It should be noted that the following examples are not representative of the full number of threats or incidents. These threats and incidents range from bomb threats to the shooting of federal facility employees and the visiting public. Of these 67 threats or incidents, 24 were an evacuation of a federal facility due to either a \"suspicious package\" or a \"bomb threat.\" Fifteen of the incidents were shooting incidents, including the Navy Yard shooting in September 2013. Other threats or incidents included a plane flying into a building with the IRS as a tenant in Austin, TX, in February 2010, and a Molotov cocktail thrown at a St. Louis, MO, federal building in April 2012.

In 2009, however, DHS's Homeland Security Advisory Council established a task force to review the HSAS and recommended changes to the administration and use of the system. Upon completion of the review, DHS replaced the HSAS with the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS). NTAS communicates terrorism threat information by providing \"timely, detailed information to the public, government agencies, first responders, airports and other transportation hubs, and the private sector.\"", "Within DHS, the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning is responsible for monitoring the nation's security situation daily, through the National Operations Center (NOC), and coordinating activities among DHS, governors, homeland security advisors, law enforcement entities, and critical infrastructure operators.

In 2005, the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security about the FBI's coordination with other federal agencies concerning potential nuclear threats or incidents. The Deputy Assistant Director stated that the FBI has developed liaison relationships with DHS, the Department of Energy (DOE), and DOD, and detailed how the FBI and these departments would coordinate their response efforts if there was a nuclear threat or incident. Some federal entities, in response to targeted and specific threats, have developed mechanisms for notifying other federal departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident response, which coordinates with DHS, the federal intelligence and law enforcement communities, and DOE.", "Threat information relevant to federal facility security is communicated between federal facility security managers, federal law enforcement entities securing the facilities, and local law enforcement entities that assist the federal government. Some federal facilities, especially those located in areas without a large federal government presence, rely on state and local law enforcement entities.", "Congress reviews the communication of threat information because of the continued criminal and terrorist threats faced by federal facilities. How this threat information is shared among federal, state, and local government entities is an important aspect to federal facility security and is a proactive step in the risk management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What are the potential congressional issues associated with federal facility security?", "paragraphs": ["Congress may continue its oversight of federal facility security generally, and the FPS specifically. One issue the Government Accountability Office identified in a report published on May 21, 2014, was FPS's continued shortcomings in training and monitoring its contract security guards. GAO stated that FPS continued to face challenges ensuring that its contract security guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities. In its December 2013 report, GAO found that FPS was challenged in providing active shooter response and screener training. As a result, GAO found that FPS had limited assurance that contract security guards at federal facilities are prepared to respond to active shooter incidents, and that contract security guards may have been using screening equipment without proper training.", "Additionally, GAO found that FPS and other federal agencies continued to face issues in assessing risk at federal facilities. GAO stated that its continuing study of federal facility risk assessment activities indicates that several federal agencies, including FPS, face challenges in completing and implementing the results of in-depth risk assessments. Specifically, GAO found that the Departments of the Interior and Veterans Affairs, FPS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not assess the threat, consequences, or vulnerability to specific events as required by ISC federal facility security standards. Also, GAO found that FPS's Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool, which it currently uses to assess risk at federal facilities, does not assess potential consequences.", "Another issue Congress may address is federal facility emergency plans and planning. Even though GAO found that selected federal facilities' emergency plans generally reflect federal guidance, there are still challenges that federal agencies face. These challenges include employee participation apathy, accounting of employees, and updating of employee emergency contact information during testing of emergency plans.", "These issues, and other potential issues, were initially prompted by the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building. Since then, efforts have been made to improve standards. However, incidents such as the September 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and the shootings at the U.S. Navy Yard and Fort Hood, TX, indicate that some issues remain."], "subsections": []}]}}
