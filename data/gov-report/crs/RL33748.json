The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) maintains them with a Life Extension Program (LEP). NNSA questions if LEP can maintain them indefinitely on grounds that an accretion of minor changes introduced in replacement components will inevitably reduce confidence in warhead safety and reliability over the long term.", "Congress mandated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in 2004 \"to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components.\" Since then, Congress has specified more goals for the program, such as increasing safety, reducing the need for nuclear testing, designing for ease of manufacture, and reducing cost. RRW has become the principal program for designing new warheads to replace current ones.", "The program's first step was a design competition. The winning design was selected in March 2007. If the program continues, NNSA would advance the design of the first RRW, assess its technical feasibility, and estimate cost and schedule in FY2008; start engineering development by FY2010; and produce the first deployable RRW between FY2012 and FY2016. Congressional actions on the FY2008 national defense authorization bills (H.R. 1585, S. 1547) and energy and water appropriations bills (H.R. 2641, S. 1751) have called this schedule into question. For details, see CRS Report RL32929, The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program: Background and Current Developments, which provides background and tracks legislation and developments. Each year, Congress would decide whether to fund the program as requested, modify it, or cancel it, and whether to continue or halt LEP.", "RRW's supporters argue that the competing designs meet all goals set by Congress. For example, they claim that certain design features will provide high confidence, without nuclear testing, that RRWs will work. Some critics respond that LEP should work indefinitely and question if RRW will succeed. They hold that LEP meets almost all goals set by Congress, and point to other LEP advantages. Others maintain that the scientific tools used to create RRW designs have not been directly validated by nuclear tests, and that the accretion of changes resulting from LEP makes the link of current warheads to the original tested designs increasingly tenuous. In this view, nuclear testing offers the only way to maintain confidence in the stockpile. RRW raises other issues for Congress: Is RRW likely to cost more or less than LEP? How much safety, and how much protection against unauthorized use, are enough? Should the nuclear weapons complex be reconfigured to support RRW? And what information does Congress need to choose among the alternatives?", "This report is intended for Members and staff interested in U.S. nuclear weapon programs. It will be updated occasionally."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear weapons will continue to play a key role in U.S. security policy for many decades. Yet the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the Department of Energy (DOE) agency in charge of the nuclear weapons program, have raised concerns that maintaining current weapons, which date from the Cold War, will become increasingly difficult.", "At issue for Congress is how best to maintain the nuclear stockpile so that it will retain, for many decades, capabilities that political and military leaders deem necessary. There are three main options: (1) extend the service lives of current warheads without nuclear testing; (2) develop, build, and deploy a new generation of warheads without testing to replace the current stockpile; or (3) resume nuclear testing, which the United States suspended in 1992, as a tool to help maintain existing warheads or develop new ones.", "This report focuses on the first two options. It compares how they respond to congressional goals, presenting pros, cons, uncertainties, costs, and potential risks and benefits, then discusses issues for Congress. Regarding the third option, the United States has not conducted a nuclear test since 1992, yet has assessed for the past 12 years that current warheads are safe and reliable. On the other hand, some would resume testing on grounds that that is the only way to be sure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable, to validate tools for maintaining weapons without testing, and to develop new weapons if needed. However, the Administration and many in Congress prefer not to resume nuclear testing, so this report does not consider it as a separate option, but discusses it at various points because testing would provide additional data to help maintain or develop nuclear weapons. This report does not consider a fourth option, abolition of U.S. nuclear weapons, as it has garnered no support in Congress or the Administration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Almost all warheads in the current stockpile were built in the 1970s and 1980s. They require ongoing surveillance and maintenance because their components deteriorate. In the wake of the nuclear test moratorium that the United States has observed since 1992, Congress instituted the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) in 1993 \"to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons.\" SSP has provided the technical basis for advancing the relevant science in an effort to maintain confidence in U.S. warheads without nuclear testing. NNSA requests $6,511.3 million for SSP, under the heading \"Weapons Activities,\" for FY2008. Part of SSP is the Life Extension Program (LEP), which seeks to maintain warheads by replacing certain components, as needed, with newly-fabricated ones that stay as close as possible to the originals; other components may be modified. For details on congressional action on FY2008 authorization and appropriations bills, see CRS Report RL32929, The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program: Background and Current Developments , by Jonathan Medalia , which provides background and tracks legislation and developments.", "NNSA is concerned that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in current warheads for the long term with LEP. Reflecting this concern, Congress initiated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-447 ) \"to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components.\"", "NNSA executes the RRW program in cooperation with DOD, the \"customer\" for nuclear weapons, through the Nuclear Weapons Council, a joint DOD-NNSA organization that oversees and coordinates nuclear weapon activities. When DOD needs a new warhead, or when NNSA must modify a warhead, the council establishes a warhead Project Officers Group (POG) to develop draft \"military characteristics\" that the warhead must meet, such as explosive yield. The RRW POG has representatives from key stakeholders: Office of the Secretary of Defense, NNSA, U.S. Strategic Command, Navy, Air Force, and design teams. It spelled out military characteristics for RRW and established RRW program priorities that the council has vetted. Safety is the first priority; security/use control is the second. Others\u2014certifiability, cost, longevity, manufacturability, reliability, survivability in nuclear environments, and yield\u2014are not rank-ordered.", "NNSA must also meet policy goals in designing or maintaining warheads. Congress, mainly through FY2006 legislation and committee reports, spelled out at least 20 goals for RRW in the following categories: reduce the need for nuclear testing; improve safety and use control; design for manufacturing and maintenance; fulfill current mission requirements but not new ones; facilitate upgrading the nuclear weapons complex (the \"Complex\"; see Appendix A ); and reduce the cost of the stockpile and Complex. RRW designs seek to meet all these goals.", "The Nuclear Weapons Council started a competition between a New Mexico (NM) design team composed of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (NM) and Sandia National Laboratories' NM site, and a California (CA) team of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (CA) and Sandia's CA site. Both teams created preliminary warhead designs between October 2005 and March 2006, then did further detailed design work. According to a December 2006, statement, the Nuclear Weapons Council determined that RRW is a feasible strategy for sustaining U.S. nuclear weapons without testing. It selected the California design in March 2007 as the first RRW, or RRW-1. This warhead is now called \"WR1.\"", "Nuclear weapons development proceeds in \"phases\" that have been defined for many years, from Phase 1 (concept assessment) to Phase 7 (retirement). For FY2008, NNSA requests funds mainly for Phase 2A (design definition and cost study), with some funds for Phase 3 (development engineering). As of July 2007, the Navy-led RRW POG is conducting a Phase 2A, design definition and cost study. The Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories are working within the POG study to refine the design, review tradeoff options, plan the potential development program, and estimate costs of the California design.", "The choice between LEP, RRW, or some combination is important because it will set the course for U.S. nuclear weapons for decades to come, and each year it is up to Congress to decide whether to fund these programs as requested, or modify or cancel them. A crucial decision is whether to move RRW to Phase 3 from the current Phase 2A. While the Nuclear Weapons Council had envisioned completion of Phase 2A by the end of December 2007, it appears unlikely that Congress will make a decision on Phase 3 in the FY2008 budget cycle, as the defense authorization bills reported by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ( H.R. 1585 and S. 1547 , respectively) and the energy and water appropriations bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee ( S. 1751 ) recommended holding RRW in Phase 2A in FY2008. Further, the energy and water appropriations bill as passed by the House ( H.R. 2641 ) provided no funds for RRW.", "There are many RRW issues to resolve. Cost is important to any decision to proceed with RRW, yet long-term cost projections are notoriously unreliable. There are technical uncertainties, such as whether the winning RRW design can be turned into a functioning warhead. The future Complex has yet to be determined, along with how it might differ depending on whether the United States pursues LEP or RRW and how it would handle a transition to an all-RRW stockpile. Stockpile numbers decades out are unknowable, yet a Complex would spend money unnecessarily if sized too large and could not support requirements if sized too small. A commenter noted that while claims are made that RRW is cheaper, safer, more reliable, etc., than LEP, or vice versa, in many cases \"no numbers exist to substantiate the claim. The proponents of either approach, in many cases, while implying a measurable effect are really saying 'believe me.'\" Beyond RRW issues are broader issues of strategic policy.", "Accordingly, many in Congress want NNSA to use FY2008 to perform further Phase 2A work, and others to study broader issues. For example, the report on H.R. 2641 stated: \"it is premature to continue design activities for a new nuclear warhead until a revised U.S. nuclear weapons strategy is developed that describes the long term nuclear stockpile requirements and demonstrates how a new nuclear warhead is necessary to address specific U.S. national security requirements and nuclear nonproliferation commitments.\" The House Armed Services Committee called for a congressional commission on U.S. strategic posture in its FY2008 national defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585 . It said, \"The committee believes clear policy objectives should be established before Congress commits to ambitious new programs.\" The commission's report would be due by December 1, 2008. Section 1061 of S. 1547 , the Senate Armed Services Committee's defense authorization bill, called for a revised nuclear posture review that, among other things, would \"includ[e] any plans for replacing or modifying warheads.\" The committee's report states that the report would be due to Congress in December 2009. Consistent with that language, Congress might decide to hold RRW in Phase 2A until the next President reviewed U.S. nuclear policy and the possible role of RRW in it. The earliest that a request to move RRW to Phase 3 could be made as part of the regular budget process would then be the budget submitted in February 2010 (i.e., the FY2011 budget). In that case, Phase 3 work could not begin before October 2010. S. 1914 , Nuclear Policy and Posture Review Act of 2007, calls for the President to submit to Congress a nuclear policy review by September 1, 2009, and a nuclear posture review by March 1, 2010. The bill would bar funds for RRW for FY2008-FY2010 until these reports have been submitted to Congress.", "Conversely, some recommend proceeding with R&D on RRW. An article in November 2007 reported that a letter to Senators Jon Kyl and Pete Domenici from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said, \"I believe that research and design of the RRW should continue and that the infrastructure to support our current program should be urgently strengthened.\" The article also cited a letter by former Secretary of State George Shultz and Sidney Drell, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University, to Kissinger that stated, \"research work on new RRW designs should certainly go ahead. Such work would make possible the decision to implement the construction phase of the program were that to be desired at some future time. The design work itself is relatively small in cost and need not be viewed in any way as an eventual commitment to go ahead.\"", "The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 109-364 , Section 3111) sets as an objective having the RRW first production unit (FPU, the first complete warhead from a production line certified for deployment) in 2012, and the FPU is scheduled for September 2012. NNSA stated in April 2007 that a 2012 FPU remains its target date. There is some uncertainty about NNSA's ability to meet that date. Barry Hannah, Chairman of the RRW POG, stated, \"I believe that an FPU of FY2012 for the first RRW is extremely optimistic.\" A Nuclear Weapons Council memorandum of March 2007 states, \"Given the level of maturity of the [RRW] design effort to date, our planning target for the First Production Unit, is 2014 plus or minus two years.\" Any delay in moving RRW to Phase 3 would likely retard the FPU date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship among Goals", "paragraphs": ["Many goals Congress set for RRW are interrelated. A more efficient Complex and increased confidence in long-term reliability might let DOD retain fewer nondeployed warheads as a hedge against reliability problems or adverse geopolitical changes. Wider performance margins would give DOD more confidence in NNSA's ability to certify warheads without testing. The effort to design and produce an RRW that offers greater resistance to unauthorized use, that is easier to manufacture, and that increases performance margins should help maintain design and production expertise. Using more environmentally benign materials should increase safety and ease of manufacture and facilitate a smaller and more modern Complex.", "Many goals seek to reduce cost over the long term. Reducing the use of hazardous materials requires less equipment to shield workers and protect the environment, permits some work to be done outside of high-cost buildings, and reduces waste streams. Moving some work outside of high-cost buildings to make space available inside them may permit more production lines to be installed in such buildings, increasing their productivity. Designing warheads for ease of manufacture, assembly, and maintenance is likely to save money by requiring fewer process steps, reducing the equipment and workers to support those steps, and permitting more rapid production. Less rigid tolerances and wider design margins reduce costs by reducing the number of rejected components, increasing throughput, and reducing waste streams. Making a warhead more resistant to terrorist attack could slow the growth of physical security costs.", "While Congress has specified many goals, it did not set a clear goal on an issue that it has considered for other nuclear weapons: whether RRW is to be a \"new warhead.\" Congressional language on this point may appear ambiguous. For example, the program is \"to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components\"; a goal is \"to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads\"; another goal is \"[t]o ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems, to include the ability to produce replacement warheads\"; \"any new weapon design must stay within the design parameters validated by past nuclear tests\"; and a committee's \"qualified endorsement of the RRW initiative is based on the assumption that a replacement weapon will be designed only as a re-engineered and remanufactured warhead for an existing weapon system in the stockpile.\"", "Part of the ambiguity is semantic. \"Warhead\" refers clearly to a nuclear explosive device, but \"weapon\" may mean a warhead or its delivery system. If \"weapon\" refers to delivery system, then the warhead may be viewed as a \"component\" of the delivery system. If \"weapon\" refers to \"warhead,\" then a component would be a part of a warhead. The term \"new\" is also ambiguous. While neither competing RRW design is exactly like any warhead currently deployed, each design contains key components that are similar to those of current warheads.", "Whatever the case, NNSA could not meet the goals for RRW by modifying current warheads. A dominant design consideration of these Cold War warheads was maximizing yield to weight\u2014having the most explosive energy possible within a tight weight budget so that more warheads could be placed on a missile. To pare down weight, some warheads used a nuclear explosive package (NEP; see Appendix A ) designed with parameters close to the point at which the warhead would fail to meet its design requirements. NNSA expresses concern about the impact of even minor changes to NEP components that the Life Extension Program might introduce. These tight designs could not undergo drastic modifications needed to accommodate such goals as increased safety and use control, lower cost, and reduced use of hazardous materials and still provide confidence that they would work as intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Terminology and Pending Studies", "paragraphs": ["This report refers to \"supporters\" and \"critics\" of RRW. While this division may oversimplify matters, it permits the report to highlight key points of contention while avoiding a tedious discussion of minor differences. In general, supporters of LEP are critics of RRW, and vice versa, but finer divisions of opinion exist. Raymond Jeanloz, Professor of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California at Berkeley and a long-time adviser to the U.S. government on technical aspects of national and international security, said, \"I still don't think of myself as being in the 'critic' [of RRW] category because I find that many of the objectives motivating [RRW] are reasonable, and it's more in the implementation (and interpretation of what is needed) where I find myself concerned.\" Some RRW supporters question aspects of RRW designs. And supporters of RRW are not necessarily critics of LEP. As Los Alamos states,", "We have been asked to study the feasibility of RRW-design enabled by relaxing yield/weight. We have found compelling designs that provide added margin, surety, and manufacturability in our studies. Just because this exercise has been successful does not imply that we're opponents of LEP-strategies. At the end of the day, we are service providers and advisors. We will pursue the course of action decided by the Administration, Congress, and the DoD. If they wish to pursue LEPs, then we're fully committed to that path and will provide our best advice and service.", "This report offers two terminological notes. First, as the RRW program has progressed and congressional goals for it have become clearer, the term \"Reliable Replacement Warhead\" no longer seems appropriate. It implies that current warheads are not reliable, which Ambassador Linton Brooks, the head of NNSA, has emphatically denied. It implies that reliability is the program's goal, yet Congress has set forth dozens of goals. It deemphasizes \"replacement,\" yet a key goal of RRW is to replace existing warheads in such a way as to be used on existing aeroshells and missiles. Second, this report distinguishes between \"Competing Candidate RRW Designs,\" or CCRDs, which currently exist; the RRW program; and RRWs, actual warheads that may be built in the future.", "Several external reviews of the program are forthcoming. The House Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to have the JASONs, a group of scientists who advise the government on defense matters, conduct an independent peer review", "to evaluate the competing RRW designs. The JASONs should evaluate the RRW design recommended by the POG [the RRW Project Officers Group] against the requirements defined by congressional legislative actions to date and the elements defined in the Department of Defense's military characteristics for a reliable replacement warhead requirements document. The JASON review should also include an analysis on the feasibility of the fundamental premise of the RRW initiative that a new nuclear warhead can be designed and produced and certified for use and deployed as an operationally-deployed nuclear weapon without undergoing an underground nuclear explosion test.", "The report was due March 31, 2007.

The preliminary report, which is classified, was submitted in late January. The executive summary was transmitted September 28. The final report, which is classified, was submitted to NNSA on schedule. The Nuclear Weapons Complex Assessment Committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) studied whether RRW is the best path for addressing certain potential risks of SSP and LEP and for developing a responsive infrastructure in a report released April 24, 2007.

As a result, there have been 12 annual assessments that each warhead type in the stockpile remains safe and reliable, and that testing is not required.", "Yet NNSA and its labs have expressed concerns that, over the long term, minor changes to current warheads through repeated LEPs and maintenance will decrease confidence in the warheads, possibly requiring a return to nuclear testing. Critics counter that careful attention to minimizing changes, and advances in understanding of the relevant science, should keep existing warheads reliable for many years.", "Because of its desire to avoid testing, Congress has stated that a goal for RRW is to minimize the need to return to testing. NNSA claims that the RRW program will meet this goal because of steps, discussed below, to increase confidence. LEP's proponents respond that the lack of a nuclear test \"pedigree\" reduces confidence in RRWs. Others maintain that certification using SSP has been a political assessment rather than a technical one. Since SSP emerged after the moratorium on testing began, this position holds that its tools were never validated with nuclear tests done for that purpose, so they could lead to false conclusions. Accordingly, in this view, NNSA will not know for sure if SSP, and thus RRW or LEP, work until it conducts nuclear tests. As former LANL Director Siegfried Hecker stated in 1997,", "Of course, if nuclear testing were allowed, we would gain greater confidence in the new tools. We could validate these tools more readily, as well as validate some of the new remanufacturing techniques. One to two tests per year would serve such a function quite well. Yields of 10 kt would be sufficient in most cases. Yields of 1 kt would be of substantial help."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1.

The design teams argue that they could do so because the designs were unconstrained by technologies and design choices made decades ago. With wide margins, they claim, material deterioration or design or manufacturing defects are less likely to degrade warhead performance below the minimum required. Further, diagnostic systems that could be incorporated in the designs would help detect deterioration at an early stage. In contrast, RRW advocates project increasing difficulty in maintaining the reliability of existing warheads. Sandia stated, \"As systems age and [warhead] lives are extended, changes due to aging or repair creep into the system that make it more difficult to predict performance, and repair itself becomes more challenging as we move further away from the design era.\"", "LEP's supporters argue that current warheads are reliable, as evidenced by 12 stockpile assessments. While problems emerge, solutions do as well, and LEP supporters argue that SSP has been keeping at least even in this race. RRW supporters agree with this latter statement; an NNSA official stated, \"Each year, we are gaining a more complete understanding of the complex physical processes underlying the performance of our aging nuclear stockpile.\" LEP supporters challenge the view that reliability of current warheads must decline. Richard Garwin, IBM Fellow emeritus, said, \"with the passage of time and the improvement in computing tools, I believe that confidence in the reliability of the existing legacy weapons will increase rather than diminish, just as has been the case with the nuclear weapon pits.\" They question if RRW will improve reliability. Steven Fetter, Dean, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland, said, \"Like most other warheads, RRW will have, or could be expected to have, birth defects or reliability problems that would be discovered and corrected soon after the warhead was deployed. No one can say whether the unreliabilities introduced by these birth defects would be greater or smaller than the unreliabilities that would crop up in the existing warheads due to their age.\"", "The executive summary of the JASON RRW report of September 2007 raised questions about the current ability to certify WR1. It stated, \"certification is not yet assured. The certification plan needs further development.\"", "Supporters and critics viewed the report differently. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino wrote,", "The initial RRW phase 2 studies have established that certification without new underground testing, while not assured at this point, is a very reasonable expectation.... Over the next year, if we are funded by Congress to do so, we will complete an integrated RRW certification plan ... Certification will be demonstrated once we establish, in a process involving intensive peer review of all related experiments and analyses, that the fully engineered and weaponized RRW production unit meets the original intent of the RRW design.", "Representatives Visclosky and Hobson, commenting on the report, said, \"Once again, independent sources have raised serious questions that must be addressed before proceeding with the RRW.... Only when the Department of Energy has completed the work recommended by the JASON report, can the nation appropriately consider what role an RRW might play as a 21 st century nuclear deterrent.\"", "Some doubt that either LEP or RRW can be assessed as reliable. They contend that stewardship tools should not be relied on, and that RRWs cannot be assessed as reliable without testing because of questions about how new warheads will function. They also contend that LEPs cannot be assessed as reliable without testing because LEPs will inevitably introduce small changes into warheads, and their cumulative effect will undermine confidence in reliability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2. Increase performance margins", "paragraphs": ["[3, 7] Margins, uncertainty, and confidence are important for understanding risks of implementing RRW or LEP without nuclear testing. For a given characteristic, a minimum value is required for a warhead to operate as intended. Margin is the amount by which the design parameter exceeds that minimum\u2014the excess performance built into the design. A warhead's design provides a higher value than the minimum for each characteristic to ensure margin and avoid failure. Uncertainty results from imprecise knowledge of design parameters and of the minimum value required to ensure performance. The labs use computer models, experimental data, etc., to bound these uncertainties. Confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty: if margin is high and uncertainties low, confidence is high; if both are high, confidence is low. Having margins greater than uncertainties provides confidence against potential failure modes.", "The close relationship of margins, uncertainties, and confidence is formalized in Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties, or QMU, an analytic framework that LANL and LLNL have developed. They are implementing it to assess, in the absence of testing, confidence in weapon performance. Since its inception, the nuclear weapons program has used the core principle of QMU, building margins into warhead designs, to assess performance risk, such as identifying situations where small changes could cause performance to degrade sharply.", "Current missile warheads maximize explosive yield while minimizing warhead weight. For example, to minimize weight, a warhead's primary stage (see Appendix A ) has little yield above that needed to make the warhead work as intended. While this approach resulted in \"thin\" margins, nuclear testing helped provide confidence that warheads would work. For RRW, DOD traded off a reduction in yield per unit of weight to improve margin (as well as safety and use control). To gain confidence without testing, both teams used metrics that were derived statistically from the nuclear testing database but that can be obtained without nuclear testing, such as through calculations or hydrodynamic experiments. Using existing nuclear test data, the labs found that if these metrics exceed certain values, there is very high confidence that the primary will work as intended. Knowing this, designers at both labs adjusted CCRDs so that primary margins greatly exceed the minimum required.", "The design teams claim a key advantage for the competing designs: because the designs start fresh, designers can increase margin. The teams view added margin as the single most important goal of the designs, as it enables confidence without testing by compensating for unanticipated uncertainties. In contrast, they argue, one cannot increase margin in an LEP in the many cases requiring changes to the warhead because that would push the warhead beyond the design envelope validated by nuclear testing. As a result, they claim, one can only attempt to drive down uncertainty, but that path has proven costly and might in some cases be unsuccessful.", "RRW's critics hold that SSP, the surveillance program, and LEP can maintain margins through careful remanufacture of nuclear explosive package components to minimize changes. They also state, to general agreement, that primary margin for some warheads could be increased with no change to a warhead through revised means of dealing with the boost gas. Critics express concern that RRWs would increase uncertainty, offsetting the potential gain in margin that advocates claim for RRW. Precisely because the design is new, critics believe RRWs are likely to have \"birth defects,\" while such defects have been wrung out of existing designs. Critics point to a 1996 Sandia study of stockpile surveillance that showed that the greatest number of problems requiring corrective action occurred in the first three years after FPU, a lower but still substantial number of such findings occurred in years 4-11 after FPU, and very few occurred in years 12-23. (There are no public data on whether that number remains low, or increases, after year 23 because the study has not been updated in unclassified form.) RRW's supporters respond that LEP can also introduce birth defects.", "The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, P.L. 109-364 ( H.R. 5122 ), required (Section 3116) NNSA to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to have the latter prepare a study of Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties, a method to assess the nuclear stockpile. The study is to evaluate, among other things, \"Whether the application of the quantification of margins and uncertainty used for annual assessments and certification of the nuclear weapons stockpile can be applied to the planned Reliable Replacement Warhead program so as to carry out the objective of that program to reduce the likelihood of the resumption of underground testing of nuclear weapons.\" As of December 3, 2007, NAS expects to deliver an interim report in March 2008 and a final report in August 2008.

It is thus premature to speculate on whether RRWs will replace current warheads.", "The Air Force raises questions about the effectiveness of LEPs, and makes the following assertions:", "LEPs are complicated. Current warheads were not designed to be refurbished, so disassembly is difficult. Some LEP components are made with archaic processes and hazardous materials. LEPs are time-consuming. The Air Force was convinced by 1992 that the W87 ICBM warhead needed certain changes, and the Secretary of the Air Force sent a letter to the Secretary of Energy in that year asking DOE to make the changes. It took until 1999 for DOE to deliver the FPU to the Air Force. It is preferable not to rely on old warheads, though the first B61 has been in the stockpile since 1968. Warheads deteriorate over time, and a warhead in good condition now might, it is argued, suffer severe corrosion and become unreliable in 10 or 15 years. Margins in some current warheads were thin by design, and a series of changes could erode confidence that the margin remained sufficient. The foregoing factors raise questions about whether DOD can have confidence in the ability of the Complex to execute LEPs as a long-term sustainment strategy.", "Critics expect that LEP will enable NNSA to maintain current warheads for many years. As noted under Goal 15, a Navy official shared this view in the case of the LEP for the W76.

Geopolitical risk arises from the prospect that the Complex could not manufacture new warheads fast enough to respond to such threats as a major expansion of an adversary's nuclear forces.", "RRW's supporters claim that RRW would permit a reduction in nondeployed warheads for several reasons: RRWs would be less likely to develop defects because of increased margins; defects could be corrected more easily because RRWs would be designed for ease of surveillance and disassembly; a modified Complex could produce RRWs in time to respond to threats because they would be designed for ease of manufacture, and fewer types of warheads would be needed as backups. Regarding the latter point, at least two warhead types are currently available for each delivery system. This approach hedges against the prospect that a failure of one warhead type would render an entire delivery system unusable until the problem was fixed, impairing the U.S. deterrent. Each warhead, however, is designed for use on only one type of delivery vehicle. In contrast, RRWs designed for one delivery system could be used on another. While the first RRW is designed for use on SLBMs, RRW supporters point out that it is designed so it could fit into ICBM aeroshells with slight modifications, such as adjusting ballast. Using this approach, an RRW intended for SLBMs could back up ICBM warheads, and vice versa, and an RRW for cruise missiles could back up gravity bombs, and vice versa.", "LEP supporters reject the argument that many nondeployed warheads are needed to hedge against technical problems. In their view, surveillance and life-extension programs have shown a continually-improving ability to find and fix problems. They expect that too few RRWs would be built to arm both the intended and alternate delivery vehicles because building enough to arm both would be at odds with the goal of fewer nondeployed warheads. But LEP supporters believe it makes sense to retain nondeployed warheads to hedge against geopolitical risks not detected in time by intelligence.

RRW's supporters maintain that RRW would permit a more efficient Complex. They assert that it would take fewer steps to make NEP components for RRWs than for LEPs, simplifying production. Looser tolerances would result in fewer rejected parts. Modular designs and elimination of conventional high explosives would permit greater throughput at Pantex. Reducing hazardous materials, it is argued, would enable more manufacturing to be done away from the most costly floor space and might permit more work to be contracted out.

For example, LEP's supporters question the advantage of dismantling thousands of warheads while building facilities able to manufacture large numbers of RRWs to respond to a threat.

Because RRWs are designed to be easier to manufacture, certify, and maintain, they can make the complex more responsive. When problems arise, the complex will have the demonstrated capability to replace problem warheads with more reliable and maintainable warheads. Thus risk mitigation can be borne by the infrastructure rather than by the large inventory of reserves. Whatever problems arise, a complex and work force that is experienced and capable of producing and fielding warheads that meet the needs of the day rather than dedicated to perpetuating the designs of another era has a better chance of being able to respond.", "NNSA prefers a continuous cycle of design and deployment, as noted, in part to exercise Complex capabilities, rather than conducting LEPs of RRWs in the future. Similarly, a SEAB Task Force argued for an ongoing program of RRW design and production on a five-year cycles. In discussions with CRS in September 2006, a task force member argued that this approach, by using the latest design and production methods rather than sustaining old technologies, would aid recruitment, retention, and capability development in the Complex workforce. LANL claims that RRW would exercise design skills better than LEP. Because RRW is a new design, designers must confront the full range of tradeoffs simultaneously, balancing yield, weight, ease of manufacture, cost, use control, safety, reduction of hazardous material, etc. In contrast, LANL argues, an LEP constrains choices for the nuclear explosive package because replication is required to minimize divergence from parameters that were validated by nuclear testing.", "LEP's advocates respond: (1) LEP exercises skills. Design expertise is needed to ensure that a minor change introduced by an LEP will not create a problem, such as a material incompatibility, elsewhere in the warhead. Production expertise is needed in making replacement components and exchanging new for old components. Certification expertise is needed to ensure that a life-extended warhead will meet safety, reliability, and other requirements. A report by the AAAS states, \"Although life extension is not equivalent to executing a new design, it nonetheless employs many of the same tools, processes, and disciplines.\" (2) Most warhead problems, they claim, will be discovered after several decades, and current warheads are very well understood, so unforeseen problems are less likely for LEP than for RRW.

Nonetheless, RRW's supporters assert that many aspects of the competing RRW designs are intended to reduce cost.", "The designs emphasize ease of manufacture and assembly, and use of safer and less costly materials. RRW should lower surveillance costs. The legacy stockpile consists of eight basic designs and many modifications within each design. Surveillance data for each are required. An RRW-based stockpile, it is argued, would have far fewer basic designs and modifications. Further, surveilling each warhead type would be less costly. The plan is to withdraw fewer units for surveillance, and embedded sensors, if used, could report on a warhead's condition without requiring disassembly. Enhanced use-control features would permit a modification of physical security practices, perhaps slowing the growth of security costs. Increased design margins should make RRWs more tolerant of design or manufacturing flaws, or of changes due to aging or other causes. As a result, designers might be able to judge that a corrective action was not needed to fix certain problems, lowering maintenance cost. Ease of disassembly and reduction of hazardous materials would reduce cost of final dismantlement and any disposal of components when an RRW is to be retired. RRW costs should be more predictable than those of LEPs because LEPs must use some archaic technologies that will become increasingly difficult to maintain, while RRWs would have all-new components. RRW, by permitting DOD to have fewer nondeployed warheads, would result in fewer units undergoing LEPs or routine maintenance.", "LEP supporters counter that LEP costs are more predictable because LEP would maintain warheads with which the Complex has considerable experience. They argue that extending the life of existing warheads would reduce manufacturing costs, avoid costs of training and equipment needed to handle new warheads, and postpone for decades the retirement of thousands of warheads. They note that LEPs consume a small fraction of the total stockpile stewardship budget, for example $238.7 million (requested), or 3.7 percent, for FY2008. Another program, Stockpile Systems, involves routine maintenance of warheads. Its FY2008 request is $346.7 million, or 5.4 percent of the stewardship budget. LEP supporters doubt that RRW could reduce these costs by much, especially because they expect the large body of relevant experience to hold down costs for maintaining or life-extending current warheads.", "Advocates of LEP wonder when savings that RRW might yield might offset the large investment costs. They note an AAAS report stating, \"an RRW program would likely add to costs in the near term, and it is not yet possible to determine when (and whether) the RRW could lead to savings in the long term.\" They see any savings from fewer nondeployed warheads as at risk if more RRWs must be built to respond to unforeseen threats. They note that adjusting costs and savings for net present value, taking into account the time value of money by placing heavier weight on costs and savings early in a project's life, would delay reaching that point. A second LEP of a current warhead years hence might cost less cost than the first because the certification procedures, manufacturing processes, equipment, and materials needed for the first LEP could be used in subsequent LEPs if the items to be repaired were identical. They argue that RRW maintenance costs would be nonnegligible if RRW had birth defects. They cite another AAAS statement, \"The panel heard no quantitative analysis that enhanced surety features in the RRW designs would be sufficient to substantially reduce the current reliance on guns, guards, and gates for the security that governs the work in most parts of the complex.\"", "It does not appear that reducing the number of nondeployed warheads in storage would generate large savings for DOD. In response to a CRS question to the Air Force about the annual cost of maintaining its non-deployed warheads, the Air Force responded, \"Most AF costs are associated with overall manpower, support equipment and facilities. The majority of these overhead costs do not vary directly in proportion to the quantity of weapons on hand.\" A senior Air Force official stated that storage of nuclear weapons is a fixed cost, with the size of the security force driven by storing nuclear weapons, not by the number of weapons.

Yet there are serious questions about the validity of any 30-year life-cycle projection, especially one with such great unknowns: what engineering details must be solved to move from a preliminary to a final RRW design, how many warheads must the Complex support, how would the Complex support a mixed force for decades while LEPs were being phased out and RRWs were being phased in, and what will the reconfigured Complex look like. Nonetheless, cost studies can be of value even if they are preliminary, or can provide only relative costs, or note uncertainties that must be resolved to produce a firmer cost estimate.

Pits of current warheads are difficult and costly to build, involve hazardous materials, and require elaborate safety and security precautions. It is difficult to certify a remanufactured pit of current design without nuclear testing; for example, LANL has spent several hundred million dollars and many years to certify the nuclear performance of the W88 pits that PF-4 is manufacturing. If existing pits could remain in the stockpile for decades to come, then there would be high confidence in them. DOD could have high confidence in life-extended warheads, and fewer pits would have to be manufactured for many decades, reducing LEP costs.", "RRW's supporters respond that RRW offers many advantages over LEP, such as in safety, use control, and skill maintenance, as discussed earlier, independent of pit life. They argue that wide margins will increase DOD's confidence in RRW pits, and that RRW pits will cost less to manufacture than pits for LEPs.", "Pit life also bears on an issue that Congress has grappled with for years, pit production capacity and the need for a new production facility. In the FY2006 budget cycle, Congress deleted funds for a Modern Pit Facility, with a capacity of 125 pits per year. NNSA argues that it needs more capacity than PF-4 offers. To that end, its preferred Complex, \"Complex 2030,\" includes a Consolidated Plutonium Center (CPC) with a capacity of 125 pits per year. John Harvey, Director of NNSA's Policy Planning Staff, explained why that capacity is needed despite the pit life findings:", "First, even with longer lifetimes, as the stockpile ages, we will need to replace considerable numbers of pits in stockpiled warheads. Second, even if pits were to live forever, we will require substantial production capacity in order to introduce, once feasibility is established, significant numbers of RRW warheads into the stockpile by 2030. We should not assume that RRW could employ pit reuse and still provide important efficiencies for stockpile and infrastructure transformation. Finally, at significantly smaller stockpile levels than today, we must anticipate that an adverse change in the geopolitical threat environment, or a technical problem with warheads in the operationally-deployed force, could require us to manufacture and deploy additional warheads on a relatively rapid timescale.", "LEP supporters challenge each point. (1) The JASON study implies that NNSA would not need to replace large numbers of pits of current warheads for many decades. (2) LEP supporters recognize that the competing RRW designs use pits of new design and would require pits of new manufacture, and that production of 50 pits per year would hold deployment of RRWs to an extremely slow pace. However, they see this reasoning as self-justifying: the assumption that RRW will be introduced justifies a new pit facility, and a new pit facility makes it possible to introduce RRWs at an acceptable pace. In the view of LEP supporters, LEP, especially if existing pits are retained, permits the United States to delay a decision on RRW for decades. (3) LEP supporters see this argument as circular. RRW permits a reduction in the stockpile, while the possibility of a technical or geopolitical problem requires a larger pit capacity to build more RRWs if needed. Instead, LEP supporters would retain current warheads and maintain them with LEP and Stockpile Systems programs, thereby avoiding the need for RRW and a new pit facility while hedging against technical risks and geopolitical threats. They see these reductions in cost and risk as outweighing any benefits that might arise from having fewer nondeployed warheads.", "RRW supporters advance other reasons for a new pit facility. More capacity would permit production of more than one pit type at a time, so NNSA could respond to problems that require rebuilding pits out of the planned sequence and to threats that require new-design pits. In contrast, it would be hard to manufacture several pit types concurrently in PF-4, and if a problem were discovered in a pit type in the stockpile, PF-4 might be unable to replace pits in time to prevent withdrawing some weapon systems from deployment. Since PF-4 was completed in 1978, it might prove less costly to build a new facility than to upgrade PF-4, as a recent example from industry indicates. They doubt that PF-4 could accommodate increasingly stringent safety and security requirements, and note that TA-55 has problems meeting current standards. Pit production capacity is critical for RRW regardless of pit aging. Since the first RRW will use new pits, production of 50 pits per year would make for a slow deployment of RRWs; converting the stockpile to RRWs would take decades.", "RRW supporters argue that using certified pits from retired warheads in RRWs would permit faster introduction of RRWs whether NNSA uses PF-4 or CPC. LANL saw pit reuse as desirable for RRW in theory because it would avoid most problems and capacity limits of pit production and would save large sums. Nonetheless, it ruled out pit reuse for missile warheads because existing pits could not accommodate all the safety and use-control features in the RRW designs and because they would be harder to certify than RRW pits. Pit reuse might, however, be possible for an RRW bomb. Because bombs are larger and heavier than warheads, they permit a wider range of design tradeoffs to improve margin, safety, and use control. Reusing pits would make all the limited pit production capacity of PF-4 available for the first RRW, rather than having to divide it between two warhead types.", "Regarding pit reuse, Thomas D'Agostino, Acting Administrator of NNSA, said,", "And what we would like to do is examine those pits [currently in storage from dismantled warheads], those small numbers of pits as potential pits that would be used in future reliable replacement warhead concepts. For example, if we were looking at providing reliable replacement concepts into a bomb, we would look primarily to one of those pits that we already know has these features. And assuming the shape is not a problem, then we would use that particular pit in that system because it would have, again, offset further expense. A warhead on top of a ballistic missile is a little bit different animal because of the constraints associated with the size. And therefore, we had to kind of start from the ground up on that particular system. And we didn't have enough of those old other pits.", "Some opponents of a new pit facility hold that PF-4's capacity could be increased beyond 50 per year. Some equipment could be removed, including that used to fabricate plutonium-238 components for powering deep space probes. Production equipment now in PF-4 was set up as a pilot project.

The first stage, the \"primary,\" is an atomic bomb similar in principle to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The primary provides the energy needed to trigger the second stage, or \"secondary.\"", "The primary has at its center a \"pit,\" a hollow core containing fissile material (typically plutonium) and containment shells of other metals. It is surrounded by chemical explosive shaped to generate a symmetrical inward-moving (implosion) shock front. When the explosive is detonated, the implosion compresses the plutonium, increasing its density so much that it becomes supercritical and can sustain a runaway nuclear chain reaction. A neutron generator injects neutrons into the plutonium. The neutrons drive this reaction by splitting (fissioning) plutonium atoms, repeatedly doubling the number of neutrons released. But the chain reaction can last only the briefest moment before the force of the nuclear explosion drives the plutonium outward so that it becomes subcritical and can no longer support a chain reaction. To increase the fraction of plutonium that is fissioned, boosting the yield of the primary, another system injects \"boost gas\"\u2014a mixture of deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen) gases\u2014into the pit before the explosive is detonated. The intense heat and pressure of the fission chain reaction cause this gas to undergo fusion. While the fusion reaction generates energy, its purpose is to generate a great many neutrons and thus \"boost\" the fission chain reaction to a higher level.", "A metal \"radiation case\" channels the energy of the primary to the secondary, which contains fission and fusion fuel. The energy ignites the secondary, which releases most of the energy of a nuclear explosion. The primary, radiation case, and secondary comprise the \"nuclear explosive package.\" Thousands of \"nonnuclear\" components are also needed to make the nuclear explosive package into a militarily usable weapon, such as an arming, firing, and fuzing system, an outer case, and electrical and physical connections linking a bomb to an airplane or a warhead to a missile.", "Nuclear weapons were designed, tested, and manufactured by the nuclear weapons complex, which is composed of eight government-owned contractor-operated sites: the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NM) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (CA), which design nuclear explosive packages; Sandia National Laboratories (NM and CA), which designs nonnuclear components; Y-12 Plant (TN), which produces uranium components and secondaries; Kansas City Plant (MO), which produces many of the nonnuclear components; Savannah River Site (SC), which processes tritium from stockpiled weapons to remove decay products; Pantex Plant (TX), which assembles and disassembles nuclear weapons; and the Nevada Test Site, which used to conduct nuclear tests but now conducts other weapons-related experiments that do not produce a nuclear yield. These sites are now involved in disassembly, inspection, and refurbishment of existing nuclear weapons. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semiautonomous part of the Department of Energy, manages the nuclear weapons complex and program.", "NNSA maintains nuclear weapons and associated expertise through the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP), which Congress created in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 103-160 , section 3138). The legislation specified that the goal of SSP is \"to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons\" through \"advanced computational capabilities,\" \"above-ground experiments\" (experiments not requiring nuclear testing), and construction of large experimental facilities. SSP has three main elements. Directed Stockpile Work involves work directly on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition, maintaining them through refurbishment and modifications, R&D in support of specific warheads, and dismantlement. It includes the Life Extension Program and the RRW program. Campaigns provide focused scientific and engineering expertise in support of Directed Stockpile Work, in such areas as pit manufacturing and certification, computation, and study of the properties of materials. Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities funds infrastructure and operations at the nuclear weapons complex sites. While the legislation did not specify that SSP was not to involve nuclear testing, that goal seems clear from the history, and has become a goal of the program. NNSA does not rule out the possible need for testing, such as if a problem were to emerge in a warhead type that could not be remedied in any other way, but the United States has been able to maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing since 1992.", "Appendix B. Congressional Language Setting Goals", "Congress has set forth many goals for the RRW program.", "[1] That program originated as a funded activity in the conference report on the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, when conferees stated that $9.0 million \"is made available for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components.\" This was RRW's Washington debut; NNSA had not requested funds for it, and the relevant congressional reports had not mentioned it.", "[2] P.L. 109-163 , the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 3111, sets seven requirements for the program. (The text includes quotation marks because the requirements add a new Section 4204a, Reliable Replacement Warhead Program, to the Atomic Energy Defense Act, Division D of P.L. 107-314 .)", "(a) Program Required.\u2014The Secretary of Energy shall carry out a program, to be known as the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, which will have the following objectives:", "(1) To increase the reliability, safety, and security of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.", "(2) To further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of underground nuclear weapons testing.", "(3) To remain consistent with basic design parameters by including, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the objective specified in paragraph (2), components that are well understood or are certifiable without the need to resume underground nuclear weapons testing.", "(4) To ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems, to include the ability to produce replacement warheads that are safer to manufacture, more cost-effective to produce, and less costly to maintain than existing warheads.", "(5) To achieve reductions in the future size of the nuclear weapons stockpile based on increased reliability of the reliable replacement warheads.", "(6) To use the design, certification, and production expertise resident in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement components to fulfill current mission requirements of the existing stockpile.", "(7) To serve as a complement to, and potentially a more cost-effective and reliable long-term replacement for, the current Stockpile Life Extension Programs.", "[3] For FY2006, the House Armed Services Committee set forth many goals for RRW. Those not in the preceding text include the following:", "The committee understands that by designing and replacing components and warheads in our existing arsenal, the nuclear weapons complex can take full advantage of modern design techniques, more environmentally safe materials, and efficient manufacturing processes in a way that can make our arsenal more reliable, safe, and secure.... the committee encourages the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to focus initial Reliable Replacement Warhead efforts on replacement warheads for Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles.... A second objective of this program is to further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of nuclear testing by increasing warhead design margin and manufacturability.... [A sixth goal is] ensuring that the human capital aspect is not neglected. The nuclear complex is rapidly losing its design and production expertise, a concern highlighted by several studies in the past decade. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program will help train and sustain the weapons designers and engineers whose expertise is essential in ensuring the stockpile remains, reliable, safe and secure into the future.", "[4] The Senate Armed Services Committee set goals in its FY2006 report:", "The committee understands from the testimony of the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that the goals of this program are: (1) to increase the security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile; (2) to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads that can be more easily manufactured with more readily available and more environmentally benign materials; (3) to develop replacements that can be introduced into the stockpile with assured high confidence regarding their effect on warhead safety and reliability; (4) to develop these replacements on a schedule that would reduce the possibility that the United States would ever be faced with the need to conduct a nuclear test in order to diagnose or remedy a reliability problem in the current stockpile; (5) to reduce infrastructure costs needed to support the stockpile, while increasing the responsiveness of that infrastructure; and (6) to increase confidence in the stockpile to a level such that significant, additional reductions in numbers of non-deployed `hedge' warheads can be made.", "The committee supports these goals and this modest investment [$9.4 million] in feasibility studies ... with the goal of substantially increasing the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile and with the ultimate objective of achieving the smallest stockpile consistent with our nation's security.", "[5] Most House Armed Services Committee Democrats presented their goals for the program in a statement of additional views in the committee's FY2006 report:", "In our opinion, the RRW program is only worth[y] of support if it:", "\u2022 Truly reduces or eliminates altogether the need for nuclear testing;", "\u2022 Leads to dramatic reductions in the nuclear arsenal, including complete dismantlement of the weapons and safe disposal of fissile components;", "\u2022 Does not introduce new mission or new weapon requirements, particularly for tactical military purposes;", "\u2022 Reduces the reliance of the U.S. on nuclear weapons and deemphasizes the military utility of nuclear weapons;", "\u2022 Significantly reduces the cost of maintaining our nuclear weapon complex, to include avoiding the need to build a modern pit facility;", "\u2022 Increases nuclear security and decreases the risk of unauthorized or accidental launch and/or detonation; and", "\u2022 Leads to ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.", "[6] The House Appropriations Committee, in its report on FY2006 energy and water development appropriations, listed various requirements for RRW:", "The Committee is supportive of the Administration taking an accelerated approach to implement a new nuclear weapons paradigm that ensures the continued moratorium on nuclear testing and results in a dramatically smaller nuclear weapons stockpile in the near future. The RRW weapon will be designed for ease of manufacturing, maintenance, dismantlement, and certification without nuclear testing, allowing the NNSA to transition the weapons complex away from a large, expensive Cold War relic into a smaller, more efficient modern complex. A more reliable replacement warhead will allow long-term savings by phasing out the multiple redundant Cold War warhead designs that require maintaining multiple obsolete production technologies to maintain the older warheads. The Committee's qualified endorsement of the RRW initiative is based on the assumption that a replacement weapon will be designed only as a re-engineered and remanufactured warhead for an existing weapon system in the stockpile. The Committee does not endorse the RRW concept as the beginning of a new production program intended to produce new warhead designs or produce new weapons for any military mission beyond the current deterrent requirements. The Committee's support of the RRW concept is contingent on the intent of the program being solely to meet the current military characteristics and requirements of the existing stockpile.", "[7] The Senate Appropriations Committee's report on FY2006 energy and water development appropriations stated:", "NNSA is undertaking the RRW Program to understand if warhead design constraints imposed on Cold War systems (e.g. high yield to weight ratios that have typically driven `tight' performance margins in nuclear design) are relaxed, could replacement components for existing stockpile weapons be more easily manufactured with more readily available and more environmentally benign materials, and whose safety and reliability could be assured with high confidence, without nuclear testing. This effort does not call into question the safety or reliability of the current stockpile but acknowledges the long-term sustainability of the legacy stockpile will be difficult. Implementation of RRW should also result in reduced life-cycle costs for supporting the stockpile.", "[8] The FY2006 energy and water conference report stated:", "The conferees reiterate the direction provided in fiscal year 2005 that any weapon design work done under the RRW program must stay within the military requirements of the existing deployed stockpile and any new weapon design must stay within the design parameters validated by past nuclear tests. The conferees expect the NNSA to build on the success of science-based stockpile stewardship to improve manufacturing practices, lower costs and increase performance margins, to support the Administration's decision to significantly reduce the size of the U.S. nuclear stockpile.", "The FY2007 committee reports were released after the preliminary RRW designs were completed, and did not add requirements for RRW design.", "Appendix C.
