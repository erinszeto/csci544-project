", "For most of the boards and commissions included in this report, the fixed terms of office for member positions have set beginning and end dates, irrespective of whether the posts are filled or when appointments are made. In contrast, for a few agencies, such as the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the full term begins when an appointee takes office and expires after the incumbent has held the post for the requisite period of time. The end dates of the fixed terms of a board's members are staggered so that the terms do not expire all at once. The use of terms with fixed beginning and end dates is intended to minimize the occurrence of simultaneous board member departures and thereby increase leadership continuity.", "Under such an arrangement, an individual is nominated to a particular position and a particular term of office. An individual may be nominated and confirmed for a position for the remainder of an unexpired term to replace an appointee who has resigned (or died). Alternatively, an individual might be nominated for an upcoming term with the expectation that the new term will be under way by the time of confirmation. Occasionally, when the unexpired term has been for a relatively short period, the President has submitted two nominations of the same person simultaneously\u2014the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to complete the entire succeeding term of office.", "On some commissions, the chair is subject to Senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners. If the President wishes to appoint, as chair, someone who is not on the commission, the President simultaneously submits two nominations for the nominee\u2014one for member and the other for chair.", "As independent entities with staggered membership, executive branch boards and commissions have more political independence from the President than do executive departments. Nonetheless, the President can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of a board or commission's membership when he designates the chair or has the opportunity to fill a number of vacancies at once. For example, President George W. Bush had the chance to shape the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies, resignations, and the death of a member. Likewise, during the same time period, President Bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the National Labor Relations Board because of existing vacancies, expiring recess appointments, and resignations. Simultaneous turnover of board or commission membership may result from coincidence, but it also may be the result of a buildup of vacancies after extended periods of time in which the President fails to nominate, or the Senate fails to confirm, members.", "Two other notable characteristics apply to appointments to some of the boards and commissions. First, for 26 of the bodies in this report, the law limits the number of appointed members who may belong to the same political party, usually to no more than a bare majority of the appointed members (e.g., two of three or three of five). Second, advice and consent requirements also apply to inspector general appointments in four of these organizations and general counsel appointments in three."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointments During the 113th Congress", "paragraphs": ["During the 113 th Congress, President Barack H.

He submitted a total of 114 nominations for these positions, of which 77 were confirmed, 7 were withdrawn, 30 were returned to the President, and no recess appointments were made. The number of nominations exceeded the number of positions because the President submitted multiple nominations for some positions. In some cases, for example, the President nominated an individual for both the end of a term in progress and a reappointment for the succeeding term. In other cases, the President submitted a second nomination after his first choice failed to be confirmed. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity for the 113 th Congress.

For those nominations confirmed, a mean (average) of 124.2 days elapsed from nomination to confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 112.0.

", "Both sections include the pay levels of each position. For presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule, which ranges from level I, for Cabinet-level offices, to level V, for the lowest-ranked positions. Most of the chair positions are at level III, and most of the other positions are at level IV.", "For each board or commission, the \"Appointment Action\" section provides information about each nomination, in chronological order, including the name of the nominee, the position to which he or she was nominated, the date of submission, the date of confirmation (if any), and the number of days that elapsed from submission to confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (i.e., nominations rejected by the Senate, nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President, and recess appointments). Occasionally, where a position was vacant and the unexpired term of office was to end within a number of weeks or months, the President submitted two nominations for the same nominee: the first to complete the unexpired term, and the second for a full term following completion of the expired term.", "Tables that show more than one confirmed nomination provide the mean number of days to confirm a nomination. This figure was determined by calculating the number of days elapsed from the nomination and confirmation dates, adding these numbers for all confirmed nominations, and dividing the result by the number of nominations confirmed.
