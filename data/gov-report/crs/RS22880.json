However, the federal courts do not possess direct authority to block imports, as the ability to issue exclusion orders enforced by the CBP rests with the ITC.

Proponents of a faster process have argued that the U.S. economy and public health and safety may be adversely affected by the continued importation of IPR-infringing goods while Section 337 investigations take place. ITC proponents maintain that the length of time for investigations has risen because of increased Section 337 activity, which has contributed to heavier dockets for ALJs and investigation backlogs. In addition, they indicate that recent cases tend to involve more technologically complex products and that filings increasingly name multiple respondents, whereas previous cases generally named one respondent.

A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report notes that U.S. companies spend millions of dollars to file Section 337 complaints before the ITC, but that enforcement of exclusion orders is limited because of a lack of resources. As of July 2007, CBP reported that 66 exclusion orders were in effect. The number of exclusion order exams carried out by CBP has declined since FY2002. While U.S. capacity to carry out IPR enforcement has increased, according to GAO, challenges remain because IPR enforcement frequently may not be a top CBP priority and there may not be adequate resources targeted to this effort."], "subsections": []}]}}
