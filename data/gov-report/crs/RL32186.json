Even a quick reading of section 224 raises a number of questions. What is the substance of the temporary sections that disappear on March 10, 2006? What is the breath of the subsection 224(b) exceptions? What is the fate and impact of amendments to the expiring sections or to related provisions of law, enacted after passage of the act but before March 10, 2006? What is the substance of the sections in Title II that continue on unimpaired by virtue of their inclusion in the \"other-than\" list of the subsection 224(a)?", "These questions are among those likely to be asked as twilight approaches. The 9/11 Commission noted the coming sunset, and expressed the belief that as a general matter, \"[b]ecause of the concerns regarding the shifting balance of power to the government . . .a full and informed debate on the Patriot Act would be healthy,\" 9/11 Commission Report , 394 (2004).", "The expiring sections deal with the power of federal authorities to conduct searches and seizures, generally searches and seizures relating to communications. In most instances, they allow authorities to move more quickly; they reduce the required layers of administrative and judicial approval; they permit searches and seizures of a wider range of targets thus making these tools available earlier in an investigation; and they allow authorities to coordinate their activities. In doing so, they make it more likely that terrorism and crime will be prevented and that terrorists and criminals will be caught and punished. They accomplish these things, however, by easing or removing safeguards designed to protect individual privacy and to prevent government abuse. And so, they increase the risk that government authority will be abused and that the privacy of those who are neither terrorists nor criminals will be invaded. The debate over sunset is a debate of where the balance should be struck.", "To further complicate the debate, in some instances the expiring sections curtail rather than expand governmental authority; bolster rather than erode the safeguards against governmental overreaching or abuse of authority.", "The USA PATRIOT Act sections were originally set to sunset on December 31, 2005. By then, both Houses had passed legislation that amended and extended the expiring sections ( H.R. 3199 ) and a conference report resolving their differences had been issued, H.Rept. 109-433 (2005). In order to provider further time for consideration, the expiration date has been extended twice, first until February 3, 2006, P.L. 109-160 (2006), and more recently until March 10, 2006, H.R. 4659 , P.L. 109-____ (2006)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Sunset", "paragraphs": ["Subject to the exceptions of subsection 224(b), the new sections of law and the amendments to existing law, created by the sections of the act that expire on March 10, 2006, will cease to exist after that date. The same is true for any subsequent amendments to the expiring sections. They expire along with their hosts. Pre-existing provisions of law, repealed or amended by the expiring sections, will be revived automatically, unless they themselves have been repealed or amended by intervening legislation (as several have).", "The impact of subsection 224(b) is somewhat more difficult to discern. It provides two standards: one with respect to \"any particular foreign intelligence investigations that began\" before sunset and a second with respect to \"any particular offense or potential offense that began or occurred\" before sunset, P.L. 107-56 , \u00c2\u00a7224, 18 U.S.C. 2510 note. The first seems fairly straightforward. The authority granted by an expiring provision of the act may be exercised after sunset or may continue to be exercised after sunset, with respect to any foreign intelligence investigation initiated before sunset.", "The second comes with questions. What is a \"potential offense\"? Does the phrase refer to pre-sunset circumstances whose criminality is determined in a post-sunset investigation? Or does the phrase also include post-crimes that evolved out of pre-sunset circumstances which themselves constituted neither crimes nor elements of a crime? As a general rule, when Congress uses ordinary words, it is presumed to have intended them to have their commonly understood meaning. The word \"potential\" usually contemplates the incomplete, the unfulfilled, the undeveloped, or the unawakened possibility, rather than the suspected or uncertain possibility. That might suggest the term was intended at least in part to apply to post-sunset crimes that grow out pre-sunset circumstances. Although hardly a term of art, earlier federal courts have used the term to describe possible past offenses in some cases, and to describe possible future offenses in others. Congress in subsection 224(b), however, is not referring to all \"potential offenses,\" but only to those \"that began or occurred\" before sunset. Offenses occurring entirely after sunset cannot be said to have begun or occurred beforehand. Thus, although it is scarcely beyond debate, Congress appears to have added the term \"potential offense\" out of an abundance of caution lest the exception be read to extend only to investigations of conduct whose criminality was known prior to sunset but not of pre-sunset conduct whose innocence or criminality was only ultimately determined after sunset."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporary Law Enforcement Sections of Title II", "paragraphs": ["The expiring law enforcement sections of Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act involve three communications-related aspects of federal law: wiretapping; stored electronic communications and communication transaction records; and pen registers and trap and trace devices.

Prior law, as interpreted and implemented, had the effect of sharply limiting the ability of law enforcement and intelligence officers to share information, which severely hampered terrorism investigators' ability to connect the dots. However, the USA PATRIOT Act, along with changes in Attorney General Guidelines and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court procedures, brought down this wall separating intelligence from law enforcement and greatly enhanced foreign intelligence information sharing among federal law enforcement and national security personnel, intelligence agencies, and other entities entrusted with protecting the nation from acts of terrorism. This increased ability to share information has been invaluable to the conduct of terrorism investigations and has directly led to the disruption of terrorist plots and numerous arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in terrorism cases.", "The recent investigation and prosecution of members of an al Qaeda cell in Lackawanna, New York illustrates the benefits of the increased information sharing brought about by the USA PATRIOT Act. This case involved several residents of Lackawanna, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 to receive training at an al Qaeda-affiliated camp near Kandahar. The investigation of the \"Lackawanna Six\" began during the summer of 2001, when the FBI received an anonymous letter indicating that these six individuals and others might be involved in criminal activity and associating with foreign terrorists. The FBI concluded that existing law required the creation of two separate investigations in order to retain the option of using FISA: a criminal investigation of possible drug crimes and an intelligence investigation related to terrorist threats. Over the ensuing months, two squads carried on these two separate investigations simultaneously, and there were times when the intelligence officers and the law enforcement agents concluded that they could not be in the same room during briefings to discuss their respective investigation with each other.", "The USA PATRIOT Act, however, took down the \"wall\" separating these two investigations by making clear that the sharing of case-sensitive information between these two groups was allowed. As a result of key information shared by intelligence investigators, law enforcement agents were able to learn that an individual mentioned in the anonymous letter was an agent of al Qaeda. Further information shared between intelligence and law enforcement personnel then dramatically expedited the investigation of the Lackawanna Six and allowed charges to be filed against these individuals. Five of the Lackawanna Six pleaded guilty to providing material support to al Qaeda, and the sixth pleaded guilty to conducting transactions unlawfully with al Qaeda. These individuals were then sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven to ten years.", "Before the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, applications for orders authorizing electronic surveillance or physical searches under FISA had to include a certification from a high-ranking Executive Branch official that the purpose of the surveillance or search was to gather foreign intelligence information. As interpreted by the courts and later the Justice Department, this requirement meant that the primary purpose of the collection had to be to obtain foreign intelligence information rather than evidence of a crime. Over the years, the prevailing interpretation and implementation of the primary purpose standard had the effect of limiting coordination and information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement personnel. Because the courts evaluated the government's purpose for using FISA at least in part by examining the nature and extent of such coordination, the more coordination that occurred, the most likely courts would find that law enforcement, rather than foreign intelligence, had become the primary purpose of the surveillance or search.", "* * *", "In recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Fitzgerald, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, recounted from personal experience how this \"wall' between law enforcement and intelligence personnel operated in practice:", "I was on a prosecution team in New York that began a criminal investigation of Usama Bin Laden in early 1996.

[A]t least one member of the cell [Battle] had contemplated attacking Jewish schools or synagogues and had even cased such buildings to select a target for such an attack.

If prosecutors had failed to act, lives could have been lost through a domestic terrorist attack. But if prosecutors had arrested Battle in order to prevent a potential attack, the other suspects in the investigation would have undoubtedly scattered or attempted to cover up their crimes. Because of sections 218 and 504 . . . it was clear that the FBI agents could conduct FISA surveillance of Battle to detect whether he had received orders from an international terrorist group to reinstate the domestic attack plan on Jewish targets and keep prosecutors informed as to what they were learning. This gave prosecutors the confidence not to arrest Battle prematurely while they continued to gather evidence on the other members o the cell. Ultimately, prosecutors were able to collect sufficient evidence to charge seven defendants and then to secure convictions and prison sentences ranging from three to eighteen years for the six defendants taken into custody. Charges against the seventh defendant were dismissed after he was killed in Pakistan by Pakistani troops. . ..
