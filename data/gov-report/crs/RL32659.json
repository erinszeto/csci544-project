First, themeans by which authorization committees perform their basic function has changed. Authorization committees are basically responsible for evaluating the effectivenessof various existing and potential programs and policies, or assessing program quality(the program-quality analysis ). Appropriations committees are responsible forselecting items to be funded, determining the funding levels of each, and examiningwhether funds are spent according to congressional intent (the budget analysis ). During the earlier period, authorization bills were permanent law that established anagency and provided broad missions for the agency. Those enactments did notexplicitly provide authorization of subsequent appropriations. Occasionally, theoriginal act was amended by a subsequent authorization act. Annual appropriationsacts typically provided more detailed guidance to the agency than the authorizationact by setting funding levels for individual activities within the agency. Today,authorizations for discretionary spending (25) agencies and programs frequently providespending guidance to the appropriations committees, through authorization ofappropriations. They are typically temporary, on an annual or multi-year cycle. (26) In manycases, they establish and change programs or projects and also provide detaileddirectives to the agencies as well.", "Second, the 9/11 Commission proposal would transfer jurisdiction over allintelligence appropriations, for both the program activities and administrativeactivities, to the select intelligence committees. During the earlier period onlyprogram expenses were generally transferred. Earlier, appropriations bills wereorganized by topic, generally separating program activities of a department from itssalaries and contingent expenses. (27) As a result, the military activities of the WarDepartment, for example, were under the jurisdiction of the Committees on MilitaryAffairs (authorizing committees), while the salaries and contingent expenses of thecivilian administration of the War Department were under the jurisdiction of theAppropriations Committees. Today, appropriations measures are organized alongadministrative lines; funding for both programs and salaries of a department (oragency) are included in the same regular appropriations bill.", "Third, there are different institutional controls for spending today. During theearlier period, there was no institutionalized mechanism to coordinate revenue andspending decisions or establish enforceable spending ceilings. Today, under thecongressional budget process, Congress (1) sets annual total spending ceilings andrevenue floors; (2) distributes the spending among the various committees withjurisdiction, setting committee spending ceilings; and (3) may enforce these decisionsthrough points of order and a reconciliation process.

Proponents state, forexample, that intelligence spending decisions would be based on a morecomprehensive national perspective on intelligence. Some argue that concentratingintelligence spending could be used to counter consolidation of intelligence powerin the Executive, whether the congressional committees were intelligenceappropriations subcommittees or intelligence authorization committees withappropriations power.", "The disadvantages to establishing intelligence appropriations subcommittees, opponents argue, are that this approach too would be likely to (1) increase spending,unless the total intelligence amount is declassified or existing budget procedures aremodified; and (2) shortchange the intelligence needs of the military. Also, concernhas been expressed that congressional accountability would be more diffuse thanunder the 9/11 Commission proposal.
