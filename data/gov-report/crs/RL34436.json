Emission reductions from regulated sources (e.g., coal-fired power plants) would either be required or spurred by the emissions cap.

This approach is part of the European Union's (EU) Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), which EU members use to help meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Under the EU ETS, regulated entities can purchase emission credits that are created from approved offset projects.

If a U.S. law or regulation (other than an emissions cap) governs a specific emission source (e.g., methane from coal mines), that source's emission reductions would not qualify as domestic offsets, unless the reductions made went further than the regulations required. For example, if the source is required by law or regulation to reduce methane emissions by 50%, reductions up to this threshold would not qualify as offsets, but reductions in excess of 50% might qualify as offsets.

Thus, the reductions may be counted twice: first as an energy efficiency offset and second as a direct reduction at the power plant. One way to address this potential dilemma is to restrict energy efficiency projects to only those that reduce or avoid on-site combustion of fossil fuels.

Second, the offsets generated increase the compliance options for regulated entities: covered facilities can either make direct, onsite reductions or purchase emission credits generated from offsets.

As with other economic models of climate change regulation, the modelers necessarily make many assumptions. Thus, the relative differences between different scenarios are perhaps more useful than the absolute estimates. EPA's study demonstrated a dramatic difference between the offset scenarios.

In contrast, biological sequestration activities, particularly forestry projects, offer the most offset-generating potential, but many of these projects pose multiple implementation challenges. This may create a tension for policymakers, who might want to include the offset projects that provide the most emission reduction opportunities, while minimizing the use of offset projects that pose more implementation complications. Addressing these challenges may require independent auditing and/or an appreciable level of oversight and administrative support from government agencies. A report from the National Commission on Energy Policy stated, \"Proposals that expect to achieve significant (> 10 percent) compliance through offsets in the near term will be obligated to create a substantial enforcement bureaucracy or risk an influx of illegitimate credits.\"", "If concerns of legitimacy can be resolved, the next question for policymakers may be whether the potential benefits provided by offsets would outweigh any potential harm. One debate may involve whether including offsets would send the appropriate price signal to encourage the development and deployment of new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage. Policymakers may consider striking a balance between sending a strong price signal and reducing the costs of the emissions reduction program.", "Another debate may focus on the possible effects of offsets in the developing world (assuming international offsets are allowed in a federal program). On one hand, many of the offset projects may offer significant benefits\u2014more efficient energy infrastructure, improved air quality\u2014to local communities. On the other hand, some maintain that if developed nations use all of the low-cost offsets in developing nations, the developing nations will face higher compliance costs if and when they establish GHG emission reduction requirements. Moreover, there is some concern that international offsets may serve as a disincentive for developing nations to enact laws or regulations limiting GHG emissions because they would lose funding from the offset market.", "Whether to include international offsets in a federal program raises other considerations as well. The ability to use international offsets for compliance purposes would substantially expand emission reduction opportunities, compared to only allowing domestic offsets. The more emission mitigation opportunities available, the lower the carbon price. This highlights the debate over the balance between overall program costs and price signal for technological development.", "If eligible in a U.S. program, international offsets from countries without binding reduction targets are likely to dominate in early decades because of their comparatively lower costs. Certain domestic economic sectors, primarily agriculture and forestry (if eligible as offsets), would benefit if international offsets are excluded. However, the inclusion of international offsets may benefit other U.S. economic sectors through the transfer of technology and services to support the projects. Moreover, as noted above, the more offset opportunities, the lower the overall costs of the cap-and-trade program."], "subsections": []}]}}
