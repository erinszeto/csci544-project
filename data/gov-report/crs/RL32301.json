Discretionary spending is the category over which appropriatorshave direct control in annual spending bills. The pre-rescission discretionary total is about $140million above the enacted FY2004 level and the FY2005 House level, $210 million above the Senatelevel, and $413 million above the Administration request. Once it is applied, the rescission likelywill bring FY2005 spending close to the FY2004 and House level of $16.84 billion.", "In order to meet an FY2005 discretionary allocation that was close to the FY2004 enacted level, appropriators, as in past years, placed limitations on authorized levels of spending in the 2002 farmbill for various mandatory conservation, rural development, and research programs.

The CCC is a wholly owned governmentcorporation. It has the legal authority to borrow up to $30 billion at any one timefrom the U.S. Treasury. These borrowed funds are used to finance spending forongoing programs such as farm commodity price and income support activities andvarious conservation, trade, and rural development programs. The CCC has also beenthe funding source for a large portion of emergency supplemental spending over theyears, particularly for ad-hoc farm disaster payments, and direct market losspayments to growers of various commodities which were provided in response to lowfarm commodity prices. ", "The CCC must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the Treasury. Because the CCC never earns more than it spends, its losses must be replenishedperiodically through a congressional appropriation so that its $30 billion borrowingauthority (debt limit) is not depleted, which would render the corporation unable tofunction. Congress generally provides this infusion through the regular annualUSDA appropriation law. Because of the degree of difficulty in estimating itsfunding needs, which is complicated by crop and weather conditions and otheruncontrollable variables, the CCC in recent years has received a \"current indefiniteappropriation,\" which in effect allows the CCC to receive \"such sums as arenecessary\" during the fiscal year for previous years' losses and current year's losses. ", "As in past years, the CCC will receive an indefinite appropriation (\"such sums as necessary\") for FY2005. The Administration estimates the required FY2005appropriation at $16.452 billion, compared with a revised estimate of $22.937 billionfor FY2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-447 , H.R. 4818 ) concurs with this request. The estimated appropriation forFY2005 is not a reflection of expected outlays for FY2005, but is instead an estimateof the required reimbursement to the CCC for its losses incurred primarily inFY2003. Although the estimated FY2005 appropriation is nearly $6.5 billion belowthe estimated FY2004 appropriation, the reduction is not because CCC spending isbeing cut by Congress. Instead, it is primarily attributable to improved farmcommodity prices in recent years, which have contributed to a reduction in requiredspending for farm commodity support under the 2002 farm bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crop Insurance", "paragraphs": ["The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA). It offers basically free catastrophic insurance toproducers who grow an insurable crop. Producers who opt for this coverage havethe opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at a subsidized rate. Mostpolicies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurancecompanies that have their program losses reinsured by USDA. The annualagriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for thefederal crop insurance program. It provides discretionary funding for the salaries andexpenses of the RMA. It also provides \"such sums as are necessary\" for the FederalCrop Insurance Fund, which funds all other expenses of the program, includingpremium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to the private insurancecompanies. Annual spending on the crop insurance program is difficult to predict inadvance and is dependent on weather and crop growing conditions and farmerparticipation rates. ", "In its FY2005 budget request, the Administration requested such sums as are necessary for the mandatory-funded Federal Crop Insurance Fund, and estimated thisappropriation at $4.095 billion, up from the revised FY2004 appropriation of $3.765billion. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-447 , H.R. 4818 ) concurs with this request. Legislative enhancements ( P.L.106-224 ) made to the crop insurance program in 2000 have greatly increased thefederal subsidy of farmer premiums. The increased subsidy coupled with programlosses associated with disasters in various parts of the country have contributed toincreased program costs in recent years. ", "For the discretionary component of the crop insurance program, P.L. 108-447 provides $72.0 million for RMA salaries and expenses, up slightly from the enactedFY2004 appropriation of $71.0 million, but well below the Administration's FY2005request for $91.6 million. Approximately three-fourths (or $15.5 million) of therequested increase would have funded various information technology (IT)initiatives. The Administration had requested an $8.3 million increase in total RMAfunding for FY2004, mostly to cover proposed IT initiatives. However, the enactedFY2004 level was just $800,000 above the enacted FY2003 level. ", "Over the past few years, the Administration's budget contained legislative proposals to limit the amount of federal subsidy that accrues to the private insurancecompanies participating in the program. None of these proposals were adopted, andthe FY2005 request did not contain any legislative initiatives pertaining to the cropinsurance program. Instead, USDA earlier this year completed negotiations on a newstandard reinsurance agreement (SRA), which became effective on July 1, 2004. TheSRA contains the terms and conditions under which USDA provides subsidies andreinsurance on eligible crop insurance contracts sold or reinsured by the privatecompanies. The newly adopted SRA is expected to reduce program costs by $22million in 2005 and $36 million in 2006 and subsequent years, through lowersubsidies to private insurance companies and increased private risk-sharing.

The appropriatedamount is higher than the FY2004 appropriation of $1.266 billion, about equal to theSenate-reported level ( S. 2803 ), but below the $1.352 billion in theHouse-passed bill ( H.R. 4766 ) and the Administration request for$1.317 billion. The House-passed bill was higher because an adopted House flooramendment transferred nearly $53 million to FSA salaries and expenses fromUSDA's Common Computing Environment account, which was not agreed to in thefinal appropriations law. ", "Several years ago, FSA funding levels were bolstered by carryover funding from supplemental acts that allowed FSA to increase staffing to administer farm billcommodity support programs. The Administration notes that these carryover fundsare now dwindling and need to be compensated for with an increase in regularappropriations to maintain county office staff levels. Report language accompanyingthe FY2004 House appropriations bill instructed USDA not to shut down orconsolidate any local FSA offices unless rigorous analysis proves such action to becost-effective. The FY2005 House committee report ( H.Rept. 108-584 ) reinforcesthis policy. ", "FSA Farm Loan Programs. Through FSA farm loan programs, USDA serves as a lender of last resort for familyfarmers unable to obtain credit from a commercial lender. USDA provides directfarm loans and also guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest onqualified loans to farmers from commercial lenders. FSA farm loans are used tofinance the purchase of farm real estate, help producers meet their operatingexpenses, and help farmers financially recover from natural disasters. Some of theloans are made at a subsidized interest rate. An appropriation is made to FSA eachyear to cover the federal cost of making direct and guaranteed loans, referred to asa loan subsidy. Loan subsidy is directly related to any interest rate subsidy providedby the government, as well as a projection of anticipated loan losses caused byfarmer non-repayment of the loans. The amount of loans that can be made, the loanauthority, is several times larger.", "P.L. 108-447 provides an appropriation of $157.8 million to subsidize the cost of making $3.747 billion in direct and guaranteed FSA loans. An additional $301.8million is appropriated for salaries and administrative expenses to carry out the loanprogram, most of which is included by transfer in the total FSA salaries andexpenses. ", "The enacted FY2004 loan subsidy was $195.5 million to support FSA loans totaling $3.246 billion. Thus, P.L. 108-447 provides a loan subsidy that is 19%below the FY2004 level, but loan authority is increased in FY2005 by 15%. Theability to increase loan authority while decreasing the appropriation is possible dueto two factors: USDA adjustments in historical loan costs and loan repayment ratios,and relatively bigger increases in the lower-cost unsubsidized guaranteed loanprograms. The Administration had requested an FY2005 loan subsidy of $161million to cover $3.8 billion in loans. ", "P.L. 108-447 follows both the House and Senate bills in not funding the Administration's request for $3.2 million to cover $25 million in emergency loanauthority. In recent years, the emergency loan program has operated from carryoverfunds, but USDA expected to consume the remaining carryover in FY2004. Also, P.L. 108-447 maintains boll weevil eradication loan authority at its FY2004 level($100 million, up $40 million from the Administration request, with no additionalloan subsidy), and adds language that pink bollworm qualify for the boll weevileradication loan program.", "Most of the $500 million increase in overall loan authority in the final law is a 50% increase in farm ownership loans. The authority for direct farm ownership loansincreases by 63% (to $210 million in FY2005) and the authority for guaranteed farmownership loans increases by 48% (to $1.4 billion). Guaranteed loans with nointerest subsidy require a smaller appropriation than interest-subsidized or directloans. Thus, with the loan repayment ratio adjustments mentioned above, the $456million increase in guaranteed farm ownership loans costs only $2.3 million inadditional loan subsidy.", "Nearly all of the $37.7 million decrease in loan subsidy in P.L. 108-447 is in the direct lending programs (farm ownership and operating loans). Because of theperformance ratio adjustments, the loan subsidy for direct farm ownership loansdecreases by 60% ($17 million) despite the 63% increase in loan authorization. Theloan subsidy for direct operating loans decreases by 25% ($23 million) despite amore modest 6% increase in loan authorization.", "P.L. 108-447 effectively transfers funds from the unsubsidized guaranteed operating loan program to the subsidized guaranteed operating loan program. Although both types of operating loans are guaranteed, buying down the interest ratecosts USDA more. Loan authority for the unsubsidized program decreases by $93million while authority for the subsidized interest program increases by $20 million.

In reportlanguage, the conference committee makes clear that it expects \"the Administrationto abide by the statutory set-aside for non-emergency food aid programs.\" The 2002farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) increased this statutory set-aside, the volume of P.L. 480Title II commodities earmarked for non-emergency assistance, to 1,875,000 metrictons. The committee reminds USDA that if additional emergency assistance abovethe appropriated level is needed, the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Emerson Trust (seebelow) is available for that purpose. ", "For the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and child nutrition program (FFE), P.L. 108-447 provides $87.5 million, $37.8 million more thanenacted in FY2004. Both the House-passed ( H.R. 4766 ) andSenate-reported ( S. 2803 ) appropriations measures had recommendedsubstantially increased funding for FFE: H.R. 4766 by $25 million and S.2803 by $50 million. The increased funding level for FFE is partiallyoffset by reductions in the Title I loan account. Conferees also rescinded $191.1million in P.L. 480 funds carried forward to FY2005 from previous years, whichappropriators scored as savings in the measure. ", "USDA's other major discretionary account is the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), for which the conferees appropriated $137.8 million, $6.4 million more thanenacted in FY2004. FAS administers all of USDA's international activities with theexception of P.L. 480 Title II, which is administered by the U.S. Agency forInternational Development (USAID). P.L. 108-447 provides $4 million to coverexpenses for administering CCC export credit guarantees (which are mandatoryactivities).

These fellowships, which finance trainingfor hunger-related activities both domestically (Emerson) and abroad (Leland), areprovided through the Congressional Hunger Center. ", "Mandatory Programs. Other food aid programs are mandatory (for which an annual appropriation is not required),including Food for Progress (FFP), the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, andSection 416(b) commodity donations. The President's budget envisions $149 millionof CCC funding for FFP. That program level (plus some funding from P.L. 480 TitleI) is expected to provide the minimum 400,000 tons of commodities in FFPestablished in the 2002 farm bill. No commodities were released from the EmersonTrust in FY2004, but in FY2003, $212 million of commodities and related serviceswere provided through the Trust, which is primarily a commodity reserve, used tomeet unanticipated food aid needs or to meet food aid commitments if domesticsupplies are unavailable. The President's budget makes no estimate of releases fromthe Trust in FY2005, but notes that 500,000 tons are available for emergency foodassistance. About 1.6 million metric tons of wheat and $109 million in cash arecurrently in the Trust. For Section 416(b) commodity donations, the President'sbudget projects a program level of $147 million ($15 million for ocean freight andoverseas distribution costs and $132 million in commodity value). P.L. 108-447 contains a general provision stipulating that, to the extent practicable, $25 million ofSection 416(b) commodities be made available to foreign countries to assist inmitigating the effects of HIV/AIDS. The House bill (and the President's budgetrequest) had omitted this provision, which had been included in the FY2004 andprevious appropriations measures. USDA indicates that only nonfat dry milk will beavailable for distribution under Section 416 in FY2005.", "A number of USDA's export-related programs (including CCC export credit guarantees, mentioned above) are also mandatory and thus do not require anappropriation. Under the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy ExportIncentive Program (DEIP), USDA makes cash bonus payments to exporters of U.S.agricultural commodities to enable them to be price competitive when U.S. prices areabove world market prices. EEP has been little used in recent years, and no EEPbonuses were provided in FY2004. Reflecting this program experience, thePresident's budget assumes a program level of $28 million in FY2005, comparedwith $478 million authorized by the 2002 farm bill. Consequently, USDA retainssome flexibility to increase the level of EEP subsidies because of the mandatoryauthorization. For DEIP, the Administration expects a program level of $53 millionfor FY2005, compared with a current estimate of $22 million for FY2004. Forexport market development, the budget proposes $125 million for the Market AccessProgram (MAP) and $34 million for the Foreign Market Development Program. Both of these estimates are identical to amounts proposed in the FY2004 budget forUSDA. The MAP request, however, is $15 million less than authorized in the 2002farm bill. Previous efforts to reduce MAP spending have proved unsuccessful, butneither the final FY2005 appropriations act nor reports accompanying H.R. 4766 and S. 2803 address this issue. A Chabotamendment to H.R. 4766 that would have prohibited any MAP spendingin FY2005, but was defeated by a vote of 72-347 on the House floor.", "For more information, see CRS Issue Brief IB98006, Agricultural Export and Food Aid Programs .

Productsconforming to a monograph may be marketed without FDA pre-approval while anyothers must go through the New Drug Application (NDA) process. The conferencereport leaves standing the Senate language claiming that FDA's policy toward olderdrugs (which could go through a new monograph system and not need to go throughthe formal NDA process) may have raised prices to consumers and have become asubstantial cost on small businesses.

This increasedoes that and will provide the resources needed to significantly reduce review timesfor medical devices by allowing FDA to hire about 400 new reviewers.
