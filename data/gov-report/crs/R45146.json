The group market is divided into small and large segments. For purposes of federal requirements that apply to the group market, states may elect to define small as groups with 50 or fewer individuals (e.g., employees) or groups with 100 or fewer individuals. The definition for large group builds on the small-group definition. A large group is a group with at least 51 individuals or a group with at least 101 individuals, depending on which small-group definition is used in a given state.", "The reference to group markets technically applies to health plans purchased by employers and other plan sponsors from state-licensed issuers and offered to employees or other groups. Health plans obtained in this way are referred to as fully insured . However, health insurance coverage provided through a group also may be self-insured . Employers or other plan sponsors that self-insure set aside funds to pay for health benefits directly, and they bear the risk of covering medical expenses generated by the individuals covered under the self-insured plan.", "For simplicity's sake, the term plan is used generically in this report's descriptions of federal requirements; however, Table 1 provides detailed information about the application of federal requirements to different types of plans (e.g., individual market plans)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulation of Private Health Plans", "paragraphs": ["States are the primary regulators of the business of health insurance, as codified by the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act. Each state requires insurance issuers to be licensed in order to sell health plans in the state, and each state has a unique set of requirements that apply to state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer. Each state's health insurance requirements are broad in scope and address a variety of issues, and requirements vary greatly from state to state. State requirements have changed over time in response to shifting attitudes about regulation, the evolving health care landscape, and the implementation of federal policies. State oversight of health plans applies only to plans offered by state-licensed issuers. Because self-insured plans are financed directly by the plan sponsor, such plans are not subject to state law.", "The federal government also regulates state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer. Federal health insurance requirements typically follow the model of federalism: federal law establishes standards, and states are primarily responsible for monitoring compliance with and enforcement of those standards. Generally, the federal standards establish a minimum level of requirements ( federal floor ) and states may impose additional requirements on issuers and the plans they offer, provided the state requirements neither conflict with federal law nor prevent the implementation of federal requirements. For example, the federal rating restriction requirement provides that certain types of health plans may vary premiums by only four factors\u2014type of coverage (i.e., self-only or family), geographic rating area, tobacco use, and age. Some states have expanded this requirement by prohibiting issuers from varying premiums by tobacco use and age. The federal government also regulates self-insured plans, as part of federal oversight of employment-based benefits. Federal requirements applicable to self-insured plans often are established in tandem with requirements on fully insured plans and state-licensed issuers. Nonetheless, fewer federal requirements overall apply to self-insured plans compared to fully insured plans.", "Federal requirements for health plans are codified in three statutes: the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Although the health insurance provisions in these statutes are substantively similar, the differences reflect, in part, the applicability of each statute to private plans. The PHSA's provisions apply broadly across private plans, whereas ERISA and the IRC focus primarily on group plans.
