Each state designs and administers its own version of Medicaid under broad federal rules, and Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states.", "States incur Medicaid costs by making payments to service providers (e.g., for beneficiaries' doctor visits) and performing administrative activities (e.g., making eligibility determinations), and the federal government reimburses states for a share of these costs. The federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most Medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The FMAP varies by state according to each state's per capita income. For FY2016, FMAPs range from 50% to 74%. ", "The state share of Medicaid expenditures is funded through a variety of sources. At least 40% of each state's share of Medicaid expenditures must be financed by the state, and up to 60% of the state's share may come from local governments. In state fiscal year (SFY) 2014, states reported that about 74% of the state share of Medicaid costs was financed by state general funds (most of which are raised from personal income, sales, and corporate income taxes). The remaining 26% was financed by other funds (including local government funds, provider taxes, fees, donations, assessments, and tobacco settlement funds). ", "Currently, many states use provider taxes to finance a portion of their state share of Medicaid expenditures.

Essentially, Medicaid providers would donate funds or agree to be taxed, and the revenue from these taxes and donations would be used to finance a portion of the state's share of Medicaid expenditures. In some cases, Medicaid providers initiated these provider tax and donation arrangements because states would often use the provider tax and donation revenue to raise Medicaid payment rates. Plus, these arrangements were often designed in such a way as to hold the Medicaid providers harmless for the cost of their taxes or donations. ", "Here is an example of how the provider tax arrangements operated in the 1980s. In a state, hospitals with high Medicaid utilization could agree to pay $10 million in provider taxes, and the state would increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for hospitals with high Medicaid utilization by $20 million. Assuming the state had a 60% FMAP, the state would then receive $12 million in federal Medicaid matching funds (60% of $20 million). In the end, hospitals with high Medicaid utilization would have gained $10 million ($20 million in increased Medicaid rates minus $10 million in tax payments), the state would have gained $2 million ($22 million from the hospitals and the federal government minus the $20 million paid to the hospitals), and the federal government would have paid $12 million. ", "Essentially, states were borrowing funds from Medicaid providers in order to draw down federal funds and increase Medicaid payment rates to the providers that had paid taxes or donated funds. The providers were often fully reimbursed for the cost of their tax payment or donation. For this reason, provider tax mechanisms were politically viable for states.", "These financing arrangements became a point of contention between the federal government and the states. While not all states were using these Medicaid financing strategies, some states were particularly aggressive in their use of provider taxes and donations in financing Medicaid. This aggressive use of these Medicaid financing strategies motivated congressional action to curb states' use of the provider tax and donation arrangements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Statutes and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["In 1991, Congress passed the Medicaid Voluntary Contribution and Provider-Specific Tax Amendments ( P.L. 102-234 ) to restrict the use of provider donations in financing Medicaid to extremely limited situations and to limit states' ability to draw down federal Medicaid matching funds with provider tax revenue. ", "The 1991 law defines a provider tax as any licensing fee, assessment, or other mandatory payment in which 85% or more of the burden falls upon health care providers. In order for states to claim federal matching payments for provider tax revenues, the 1991 law", "requires provider taxes to be broad-based (i.e., imposed on all providers within a specified class of providers) and uniform (i.e., the same tax for all providers within a specified class of providers)\u2014in other words, states cannot limit the provider taxes to only Medicaid providers; and prohibits states from a direct or indirect guarantee that providers receive their money back (or be \"held harmless\").", "The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is authorized to waive the broad-based and uniform requirements of provider taxes. In order to waive either the broad-based or uniform requirement, a state needs to prove that the net impact of the tax is \"generally redistributive\" and the amount of the tax is not directly correlated to Medicaid payments. ", "\"Generally redistributive\" is defined as the tendency of a state's provider tax to derive revenues from non-Medicaid services in a class and to use these revenues as the state's share of Medicaid expenditures. According to the quantitative tests set forth in regulation, a provider tax is perfectly redistributive if the tax burden for Medicaid providers is the same under a tax without the waiver as under the tax with the waiver. The redistributive nature of a provider tax increases as the tax burden falls more heavily on providers with relatively fewer Medicaid patients.

Prior to the 1991 law, provider taxes were often imposed only on Medicaid providers. These provider tax arrangements were agreed to (and sometimes initiated) by the Medicaid providers because the Medicaid providers could be held harmless from the cost of the tax through increased Medicaid payment rates. However, because non-Medicaid providers cannot be as easily held harmless from the cost of the tax, the broad-based requirement restricted the use of provider taxes because the non-Medicaid providers are more likely to oppose the imposition of provider taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hold Harmless", "paragraphs": ["Regulations describe three tests that are applied to provider taxes in order to determine whether taxpayers (i.e., the providers paying the provider tax) are held harmless. Taxes that fail any of these tests are determined to have a hold harmless provision in violation of the law. The three tests are as follows:", "A positive correlation test is used to determine whether a state or other unit of government imposing the tax provides directly or indirectly for a non-Medicaid payment to the taxpayers in an amount that is positively correlated to either the tax amount or the difference between their Medicaid payment and the tax amount. The Medicaid payment test is violated if all or any portion of the Medicaid payment to the taxpayer varies based only on the amount of the total tax payments. The guarantee test is violated if the state or other unit of government imposing the tax provides directly or indirectly for any payment, offset, or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for all or a portion of the tax.", "Under the guarantee test, the existence of an indirect guarantee is determined through a two-prong test. The first prong of the guarantee test relates to the rate at which taxpayers are taxed. That is, if the provider tax is applied at a rate less than 6% of the net patient service revenues received by the taxpayer, the tax is permissible under the guarantee test.", "The second prong of the guarantee test is the \"75/75 rule,\" which is applied to provider taxes imposed at a rate greater than the threshold amount specified in the first prong of the guarantee test (currently 6%). When the provider tax produces revenue in excess of the threshold amount, the tax is considered to hold the taxpayers harmless (i.e., violate the hold harmless test) if more than 75% of the taxpayers in the provider class receive 75% or more of the cost of the tax back through enhanced Medicaid payments or other state payments.", "In other words, a state can impose a provider tax above the threshold amount (currently 6%) and draw down federal matching funds on the tax revenue, as long as the state can prove that the \"75/75 rule\" has not been violated (i.e., more than 75% of the taxpaying providers do not receive more than 75% of the cost of the tax back through enhanced Medicaid rates).", "If a state imposes a provider tax above the threshold amount and violates the \"75/75 rule\" (i.e., more than 75% of the taxpaying providers receive more than 75% of the cost of the tax back through enhanced Medicaid rates), then the full amount of the tax revenue would be offset from the state's Medicaid expenditures. This means the provider tax revenue could still be used to fund Medicaid, but the state would not be able to draw down federal Medicaid matching funds on the provider tax revenue. Specifically, the revenue from provider taxes that do not meet federal requirements would be deducted from the state's Medicaid expenditures prior to the calculation of the federal financial participation.", "To date, no state has imposed a provider tax at a rate above the threshold amount specified in the first prong of the guarantee test."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States' Current Use of Provider Taxes", "paragraphs": ["States' use of provider tax revenue varies from state to state, but states often use provider tax revenue to draw down federal Medicaid matching funds in order to increase Medicaid payment rates for the same providers that are responsible for paying the tax.

The state then increases Medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes, which means nursing homes with Medicaid enrollees receive an additional $8 million. With these Medicaid expenditures, the state draws down $4.8 million (60% of $8 million) in federal Medicaid matching funds.
