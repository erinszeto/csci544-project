NIST is directed to offer support to the private sector for the development of precompetitive generic technologies and the diffusion of government-developed innovation to users in all segments of the American economy. Laboratory research is to provide measurement, calibration, and quality assurance techniques that underpin U.S. commerce, technological progress, improved product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety.", "President Trump requested $725.0 million in discretionary funding for NIST in FY2018. In March 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) was enacted, providing $1,198.5 million in funding for NIST for FY2018. President Trump requested $629.1 million in discretionary funding for NIST in FY2019, $569.4 million (47.5%) below the FY2018 enacted level. The House-reported appropriations level for FY2019 is $985.0 million; the Senate-reported level is $1,037.5 million. In the absence of a year-long appropriation act for FY2019, NIST was funded under two continuing resolutions, first through December 7, 2018 (under P.L. 115-245), then through December 21, 2018 (under P.L. 115-298). NIST has been without appropriations since December 22, 2018. Following the start of the 116th Congress, the House passed H.R. 21, which would provide funding for each of the NIST accounts at the same levels as the Senate committee-passed bill from the 115th Congress (S. 3072).", "Concerns about the adequacy of federal funding for physical science and engineering research led to efforts by successive Presidents and Congresses to double funding for the NIST laboratory and construction accounts, together with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science. However, appropriations did not keep pace with authorization levels or presidential requests. In addition, the appropriations authorizations for the accounts targeted for doubling lapsed at the end of FY2013. Appropriations for the targeted NIST accounts increased by 42.3% from FY2006 to FY2016.", "Funding for NIST extramural programs directed toward increased private sector commercialization has been a topic of congressional debate. Some Members of Congress have expressed skepticism over a \"technology policy\" based on providing federal funds to industry for development of precompetitive generic technologies. This approach, coupled with pressures to balance the federal budget, led to significant reductions in funding for NIST. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which accounted for over 50% of the FY1995 NIST budget, were subsequently proposed for elimination. In 2007, ATP was terminated and replaced by the Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP was subsequently defunded in the FY2012 appropriations legislation. President Trump has proposed the elimination of funding for the MEP program in FY2019.", "In December 2014, Congress enacted the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (Title VII of Division B of P.L. 113-235), establishing a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (also referred to as the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation or NNMI). The explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) directed NIST to use an open competition to select the technological focus areas of industry-driven manufacturing institutes. Upon completion of its first competition, NIST announced its selection of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) in December 2016. Congress appropriated $15 million in FY2018 funding for NIST to continue its support for NIIMBL and to coordinate network activities.

", "In his FY2010 Plan for Science and Innovation , President Obama stated that he (like President Bush) would seek to double funding for basic research over 10 years (FY2006 to FY2016) at the ACI agencies. Actual appropriations, however, did not keep pace with the America COMPETES Act authorization levels. In his FY2011 budget request, President Obama extended the period over which he intended to double these agencies' budgets to 11 years. In 2010, Congress enacted the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ), setting appropriations authorizations for the targeted accounts for FY2011-FY2013 at a level that effectively set an 11-year doubling pace (a 6.3% CAGR). However, as with the original act, appropriations did not keep pace with the authorization act levels. While reiterating President Obama's intention to double funding for the targeted accounts from their FY2006 levels, President Obama's FY2013 budget request did not specify the length of time over which the doubling was to take place. President Obama's FY2014 budget expressed a commitment to increasing funding for the targeted accounts, but did not commit to doubling. President Obama's FY2017 budget did not address the doubling effort. From FY2006, the base year for the doubling effort, through FY2016, funding for the NIST STRS and construction accounts grew by 42.3% in nominal terms, a compound annual growth rate of 3.6%, a rate that would result in doubling in about 20 years. President Obama's FY2017 request sought an increase in aggregate funding for these accounts of 2.0%. President Trump's FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests did/do not mention doubling. The doubling effort appears to no longer be a priority for Congress or the President. It remains to be seen how support for internal R&D at NIST will evolve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIST Technology Policy", "paragraphs": ["Some of NIST's external programs have faced substantial opposition over time. Beginning with the 104 th Congress, many Members expressed skepticism over a \"technology policy\" based on providing federal funds to industry for development of precompetitive generic technologies. This philosophical shift from previous Congresses, coupled with pressures to balance the federal budget, led to significant reductions in funding for NIST's external programs. The Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which accounted for over 50% of the FY1995 NIST budget, were proposed for elimination. Although in the past strong support by the Senate led to their continued financing, funding for ATP remained controversial. Beginning in FY2000, the House-passed appropriations bills did not contain funding for ATP, and many of the budget proposals submitted by former President George W. Bush called for abolishing the program. In the 110 th Congress, the America COMPETES Act eliminated ATP and replaced it with the TIP initiative. While TIP received appropriations from FY2008 to FY2011, it has received no appropriations since. In his FY2003 budget proposal, President Bush also recommended suspension of federal support for those MEP centers in operation for more than six years; the following year, funding for the MEP program was significantly reduced. However, the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act brought support for MEP back up to the level necessary to fully fund the existing centers. Since then, funding has grown from $107.5 million in FY2005 to $130.0 million in FY2016. President Obama requested $142.0 million for MEP for FY2017, an increase of $12.0 million (9.2%); Congress provided $130 million, an amount equal to its FY2016 level. For FY2017, Congress provided $140.0 million for MEP. President Trump's FY2018 budget request sought to end the MEP program, providing $6.0 million in FY2018 to provide \"for the orderly wind down of federal funding for the program.\" President Trump's FY2019 request would provide no funding for MEP.

Sargent Jr. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Network for Manufacturing Innovation", "paragraphs": ["In his FY2013 budget, President Obama requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the creation of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation to help accelerate innovation by investing in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, and to support manufacturing technology commercialization by bridging the gap between the laboratory and the market. Congress did not act on this request or on President Obama's FY2014 request for the same amount. In FY2015, President Obama requested $2.4 billion for the NNMI as part of his Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. President Obama also requested $5.0 million for coordination of manufacturing innovation institutes as part of NIST's budget request. In December 2014, Congress enacted the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014 as Title VII of Division B of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), establishing a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI). The act does not appropriate funds specifically for the NMI program but instead authorizes NIST to spend up to $5.0 million of funds appropriated to NIST's ITS account each year from FY2015 to FY2024 to carry out the program. In addition, the act authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to transfer up to $250.0 million to NIST for the 10-year period FY2015 to FY2024 to carry out the program. As of the date of this report, DOE has not transferred any funding to NIST for this purpose.", "Through the end of calendar year 2015, seven NNMI institutes sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy had been awarded, and two additional institutes were being competed. In December 2015, Congress appropriated specific funding, for the first time, for the establishment and coordination of institutes under the provisions of the RAMI Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provided NIST with $25.0 million for FY2016 for the NNMI, to include funding for establishment of institutes and up to $5.0 million for coordination activities. The explanatory statement accompanying the act directed NIST to \"follow the direction of the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 in requiring open competition to select the technological focus areas of industry-driven manufacturing institutes.\" ", "NIST subsequently announced its intention to establish two institutes. On December 16, 2016, NIST awarded the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), led by the University of Delaware, \"to advance U.S. leadership in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\" NIST did not award a second institute due to a lack of funds.", "P.L. 115-141 provides $15.0 million for NIST NNMI efforts in FY2018, to include funding for its center and $5.0 million for coordination activities. President Obama had requested $25.0 million in discretionary funding and $1.9 billion in mandatory funding for NIST to establish institutes and coordinate the activities of the network. ", "As of the date of this report, 14 NNMI institutes have been established\u20148 by DOD, 5 by DOE, and 1 by the Department of Commerce. ", "As Congress completes the FY2019 appropriations process, an overarching issue will be how to respond to the Trump Administration's FY2019 NIST budget request and its policy implications, how much funding to provide to NIST in aggregate, and how to allocate NIST appropriations among the core standards and measurement functions performed by its laboratories and NIST external programs, such as MEP, AMTech, and the NMI.
