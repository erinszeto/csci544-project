{"id": "RL31242", "title": "Child Welfare: Federal Program Requirements for States", "released_date": "2007-08-02T00:00:00", "summary": ["States have primary responsibility for administering child welfare funds. However, the federal government provides substantial child welfare funding that is contingent on states meeting certain program requirements. The greatest part of federal assistance dedicated to child welfare is included in Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Programs authorized under these parts of the law provide funds for a range of child welfare services, from family support and preservation to foster care, adoption support and independent living. State compliance with the plan requirements of Title IV-E and Title IV-B is determined primarily via the Child and Family Services Review, (which is authorized by Section 1123A of the Social Security Act). Separately, under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), states receive funds to improve their child protective service systems; to develop and support community-based programs that support and strengthen families to prevent child abuse and neglect; and to improve the handling, investigation, and prosecution of child maltreatment cases.", "The 109 th Congress saw the enactment of six bills that amended federal child welfare policies in Title IV-B or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. S. 1894 ( P.L. 109-113 ) and S. 1932 ( P.L. 109-171 ) changed program eligibility rules for the federal Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance programs. Each of the remaining bills added to or otherwise amended the Title IV-B or Title IV-E state plan requirements. Under the Title IV-B programs, states are now required (or will be on a specified effective date) to (1) develop standards for the frequency and content of caseworker visits to children in foster care; (2) limit total funds spent for administrative purposes to no more than 10% of the program spending; (3) describe how they consult with medical professionals to assess the health and well-being of foster children and determine their appropriate treatment; (4) have procedures in place to respond to a disaster and to maintain child welfare services at such a time; and (5) to report on the actual use of federal funds received under Title IV-B ( S. 3525 , P.L. 109-288 ). Changes made to the Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs require all states to (1) establish procedures for the \"orderly and timely interstate placement of children,\" including compliance with specific time frames for conducting home studies requested prior to an interstate placement and for making a decision about the placement ( H.R. 5403 , P.L. 109-239 ); (2) comply with expanded federal procedures to check the criminal records of prospective foster or adoptive parents (as well as primarily civil child abuse and neglect registries) before approving placement of any foster child in a home ( H.R. 4472 , P.L. 109-248 ); and (3) have procedures for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of all children in foster care ( H.R. 6111 , P.L. 109-432 ).", "This report summarizes changes made in the 109 th Congress and then categorizes and describes state program requirements (and related definitions) linked to dedicated federal child welfare funds.

Separately, the legislation raised the mandatory funding authorization for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program (Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act), and authorized two new grants intended to improve court handling of child welfare proceedings and appropriated $100 million ($20 million in each of FY2006-FY2010) for those grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safe and Timely Interstate Placement Act of 2006", "paragraphs": ["This bill ( H.R. 5403 , P.L. 109-239 ) amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E to encourage the expedited placement of foster children into safe and permanent homes across state lines.

(For any home study begun before October 1, 2008, states may have up to 75 days to complete the study if they can document certain circumstances beyond their control that prevented a study's completion in 60 days.)

Separately, the bill requires courts (as a condition of receiving certain funding intended to improve their handling of child welfare proceedings) to notify any foster parent, pre-adoptive parent, or relative caregiver of a foster child of any proceedings to be held regarding the child, and emphasizes the right of these individuals to be heard at permanency planning proceedings.

The criminal records checks must include a check of national crime databases (i.e., an FBI check), and must be done before the placement of any foster child can be finally approved with prospective foster or adoptive parents. Under prior law, the kind of criminal record check (for example, state vs. FBI vs. local) was not specified, and the federal requirement for these checks extended only to children for whom a state intended to make federal Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance claims. As was true with prior law, if a criminal record check reveals certain felony convictions of a prospective foster or adoptive parent, a state may not claim Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance for a foster child placed in his or her home. However, this does not prohibit the state from placing a foster child in this same home if the state does not make Title IV-E claims on the child's behalf.", "For most states, these criminal record check requirements became effective with the first day of FY2007. However, prior law allowed states to \"opt out\" of the federal criminal records check procedures, and P.L. 109-248 permits those \"opt out states\" to have until the first day of FY2009 to come into compliance with the new requirements. As of July 2006, HHS reported that there were eight opt-out states: Idaho, Oklahoma, Oregon, California, New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Arizona.", "Many child abuse and neglect cases are not the subject of criminal court proceedings, and information on these cases does not appear in a criminal records check. As of the first day of FY2007, P.L. 109-248 requires all states to check any child abuse and neglect registry they maintain for information about a prospective foster or adoptive parent (and any adult living in their household). The check must be made before approving placement of a foster child in the home (and without regard to whether the state plans to claim Title IV-E support for the child). States must also request (and all states must comply with) information from any other state's child abuse and neglect registry where the prospective foster or adoptive parent, or other adult, has lived in the past five years. There are no federal stipulations about how states must use the information from these registries.", "Finally, P.L. 109-248 requires HHS, in consultation with the Justice Department, to create a national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect. Information in this national registry is to be accessible only to public entities (or agencies of those public entities) that needs the information \"to carry out its responsibilities under law to protect children from child abuse and neglect.\" Separately, the law requires HHS to \"conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing data collection standards for a national child abuse and neglect registry\" and to make recommendations and findings on the costs and benefits of such data collection standards; data collection standards currently employed by states, tribes or other political subdivisions; and data collection standards that should be considered to establish a model of promising practices.
