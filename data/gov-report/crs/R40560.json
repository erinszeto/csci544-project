Although currently the pandemic is of moderate severity with the majority of patients experiencing mild symptoms and making a rapid and full recovery, this experience could change. This report provides a brief overview of selected legal issues including emergency measures, civil rights, liability issues, and employment issues.", "There are a number of emergency measures which may help to contain or ameliorate an infectious disease outbreak. The Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the National Emergencies Act, and the Stafford Act contain authorities that allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the President to take certain actions during emergencies or disasters. While the primary authority for quarantine and isolation in the United States resides at the state level, the federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and border quarantine. The federal government also issues recommendations regarding such activities as school closures and vaccination programs. States and local governments have the authority to initiate emergency measures such as mandatory vaccination orders and certain nonpharmaceutical interventions such as school closures, which may lessen the spread of an infectious disease. The International Health Regulations adopted by the WHO in 2005 provide a framework for international cooperation against infectious disease threats.", "The use of these emergency measures to contain the 2009 influenza pandemic may raise a classic civil rights issue: to what extent can an individual's liberty be curtailed to advance the common good? The U.S. Constitution and federal civil rights laws provide for individual due process and equal protection rights as well as a right to privacy, but these rights are balanced against the needs of the community.", "Liability issues may become particularly important during the 2009 influenza pandemic. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act limits liability with respect to the use of countermeasures for pandemic flu or other public health threats. A patchwork of federal and state laws generally protect volunteers, which may include volunteer health professionals (VHPs), under certain circumstances. Laws also provide liability protections specifically for VHPs.", "Questions relating to employment are among the most significant issues presented by an influenza pandemic, since, if individuals fear losing their employment or their wages, compliance with public health measures such as social distancing and isolation or quarantine may suffer. It would seem possible for a court to conclude that the isolation or quarantine of individuals during a pandemic serves the public good and that the termination of individuals who are isolated or quarantined violates public policy.

", "The then-Acting HHS Secretary issued a nationwide public health emergency declaration in response to human infections from the influenza A(H1N1) virus on April 26, 2009. Making such a determination enables the Secretary to take three types of actions that can be especially useful for dealing with an emerging influenza outbreak. First, such a determination authorizes the Secretary to draw from a special emergency fund. Second, it is one of three events that can lead to the issuance of Emergency Use Authorizations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow for the use of unapproved medical treatments and tests, under specified conditions, if needed during an incident. Third, if there is a concurrent declaration pursuant to either the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act, the Secretary is authorized to waive or modify temporarily certain administrative requirements under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act, as necessary to ensure that sufficient healthcare items and services are available to meet the needs of individuals enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and that providers of such services in good faith who are unable to comply with certain statutory requirements are exempted from sanctions for noncompliance, absent fraud or abuse.

Emergency statutory provisions are not activated automatically, but must be specifically identified in the President's declaration before they may be given effect.", "President Barack Obama declared a state of national emergency pursuant to the National Emergencies Act on October 23, 2009.

Declarations under the Stafford Act fall into two categories: emergency declarations and major disaster declarations. As of this point in time, there have been no Stafford Act declarations pertaining to the 2009 influenza pandemic. A presidential emergency declaration under the Stafford Act authorizes the President to direct federal agencies to support state and local emergency assistance activities; coordinate disaster relief provided by federal and non-federal organizations; provide technical and advisory assistance to state and local governments; provide emergency assistance through federal agencies; remove debris through grants to state and local governments; provide assistance to individuals and households for temporary housing and uninsured personal needs; and assist state and local governments in the distribution of medicine, food, and consumables. The total amount of assistance available is limited in an emergency declaration to $5 million, \"unless the President determines that there is a continuing need; Congress must be notified if the $5 million ceiling is breached.\"", "Emergency declarations under the Stafford Act in the event of an outbreak of infectious disease are not unprecedented. In 2000, the detection of West Nile virus in New York and New Jersey was used as the basis of an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act. However, there may be uncertainty regarding whether a flu pandemic, or any outbreak of infectious disease, would be eligible for major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act. ", "A major disaster declaration authorizes the President to offer all the assistance authorized under an emergency declaration, and further authorizes funds for the repair and restoration of federal facilities, unemployment assistance, emergency grants to assist low-income migrant and seasonal farm workers, food coupons and distribution, relocation assistance, crisis counseling assistance and training, community disaster loans, emergency communications, and emergency public transportation. Additionally, the total amount of assistance provided in a major disaster declaration is not subject to a ceiling in the same way as under an emergency declaration.", "The authority of the President to declare a major disaster under the Stafford Act in response to a flu pandemic may be subject to some debate and likely depends upon whether a flu pandemic would qualify as a \"natural catastrophe\" under the Stafford Act. FEMA has historically excluded biological incidents from major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act, but executive policy under the Bush administration appeared to consider biological incidents, or at least flu pandemics, to be eligible for major disaster assistance. ", "Although there are differences between the types and amounts of assistance that are authorized by an emergency or major disaster declaration, either declaration would activate the Secretary's waiver or modification authority, if concurrent with a public health emergency declaration.

Waivers under Section 1135 involve administrative requirements principally relating to reimbursement through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, in order to facilitate the provision of health care items and services by providers in an emergency area subject to the concurrent declarations. An emergency area and an emergency period are defined in Section 1135 as the geographic area in which and time period during which there exists an emergency or disaster declared by the President pursuant to the National Emergencies Act or the Stafford Act concurrently with a public health emergency declared by the Secretary pursuant to Section 319 of the PHS Act.

Alternatively, the subject of an EUA may already be an FDA-approved product, but the emergency use justifying the EUA may be one that is not presently approved by the FDA. For example, a drug may be approved for use in the adult population but not for use in children, in which case an EUA may sanction its use by children. A drug may also be approved only for a specific disease, in which case an EUA may permit the drug's use for treating different conditions.", "The issuance of an EUA must also be supported by a number of findings. First, the FDA commissioner must conclude that the underlying agent for which the emergency declaration was made can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Second, the commissioner must conclude, based on available scientific evidence, that (1) it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition or that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by a product authorized for emergency use and (2) it is reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks.

If the flu appears to be causing more severe disease, other additional measures may be recommended, including active screening for fevers, advising high-risk students and staff to stay home, advising students with ill household members to stay home, and school dismissals. WHO has issued similar advice relating to schools, noting that \"[e]xperience to date has demonstrated the role of schools in amplifying transmission of the pandemic virus, both within schools and into the wider community.\"", "CDC and the Department of Education (ED) have established a school dismissal monitoring system in order to track school dismissals.

However, school closures also raise legal issues. The main question is who has the legal authority to institute a school closure. A CDC-requested study of state legal authorities to close schools found that school closure is legally possible in most jurisdictions during both routine and emergency situations. The study also indicated that state authority for closure may be vested at various levels of government and in different departments, generally the state or local education agencies or state or local departments of health. However, if there is a state or local declaration of emergency, the authority to close schools shifts to the state emergency management agencies in most jurisdictions. These varying laws may create legal controversies over who has the authority to make the school closure decision. In addition, there could be legal challenges to whatever school closure decision is made, particularly if the duration of a school closing is lengthy. Issues may also arise regarding whether school employees will be paid for the time the schools are closed.", "Other legal issues regarding school closures may be raised under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA requires that states receiving IDEA funding provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Although IDEA does not specifically address school closures due to a pandemic, the Department of Education has stated that schools must be careful not to discriminate on the basis of disability when providing educational services. ED noted that if schools are closed due to H1N1 and no educational services are provided to any children, services do not have to be provided to children with disabilities.

For example, would an individual have to \"prove\" that he or she had a medical condition that increased risk from the flu? What form would this proof have to take? Would there be potential liability issues for health care providers if they do not follow guidance concerning who is to be vaccinated? Would vaccinations be provided for illegal aliens who are within the priority groups? Finally, if there is possible liability for individuals or state or local agencies making these decisions, should there be any legal protections available to limit liability?

CDC notes that some providers may have enough doses of vaccine to meet the demand from all patients but, if this is not the case, \"the provider may wish to explain their local plan and rationale for vaccination among the initial target groups and ask others to wait to get vaccinated later.\" CDC emphasized that \"the decision regarding who should get vaccinated is one that should be made between the provider and the patient, weighing whether there are sufficient doses available for those at greatest risk for infection and serious complications as well as the likelihood that patients turned away will come back for vaccine at a later date.\" This guidance places the decision between the provider and the patient. It does not directly address the potential liability issue for a provider when an individual who was in a priority group is unable to get vaccinated because of the vaccination of individuals not in the priority group, and this priority group individual suffers adverse consequences due to the lack of timely vaccination. However, a provider who weighs the factors suggested by CDC and makes an individualized determination, most likely would not be found liable to another individual who was unable to obtain vaccination.

Whether a VHP is protected from civil liability depends on a number of factors, including under whose control the VHP operates and whether or not a state of emergency has been declared. It is important to note that liability protections shield volunteers from all civil liability for negligent conduct, i.e., a failure to take adequate care that results in injuries or losses to others.

The VPA does not prohibit the non-profit or governmental entity from bringing a civil action against its own volunteers; nor does the VPA shield from liability the non-profit or governmental entity for the actions of its volunteers.

This can be done for particular volunteers in all situations or only when a general state of emergency or public health emergency has been declared. Emergencies can be declared at both federal and state levels. Every state has a regime for declaring a general emergency or disaster, and such a declaration can explicitly trigger liability protections or allow the governor to do so. In addition to general emergency procedures, some states have regimes for public health emergencies, which, like general emergency management statutes, provide varying degrees of coverage.

CDC states that vaccination planners should assume that shipping of H1N1 vaccine will begin mid-October, although some vaccine may be available for shipping earlier. Therefore, the use of other infection control measures may be critical. These measures can include having workers stay home when they are sick.

The social distancing measures include the cancellation of large public gatherings and the alteration of workplace environments and schedules to decrease social density. The guidance noted the importance of workplace leave policies that would \"align incentives and facilitate adherence with the nonpharmaceutical interventions. \" Strategies to minimize the impact of workplace absenteeism were discussed in some detail and included the use of staggered shifts and telework.

During a pandemic, almost everyone will be susceptible to the illness. A central disease control strategy will be keeping sick people away from others to minimize the spread of infection. Employers should examine their human resource policies and, if needed, create new policies that would allow sick workers to stay at home during a pandemic.

The CDC further recommends that employees with influenza-like illness should avoid the workplace until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever or the signs of a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
