The United States is expected to go from a net importer of natural gas to a net exporter by 2016. With recent natural gas prices relatively low compared to global prices and historically low for the United States, producers are looking for new markets for their natural gas. Projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) by tanker ship have been proposed\u2014cumulatively accounting for over 60% of current gross U.S. natural gas production. Pipeline exports, which accounted for 99% of all exports of U.S. natural gas in 2013, are also likely to continue rising. However, under the Natural Gas Act, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) must authorize the export of the natural gas commodity and related facilities, respectively. This overarching federal role in the expansion of U.S. natural gas exports has been the subject of ongoing oversight and debate in Congress.", "What effect exporting natural gas will have on U.S. domestic prices is a central question in the debate over whether to export. A significant rise in U.S. natural gas exports would likely put upwards pressure on domestic prices, but the magnitude of any rise is uncertain. There are numerous factors that will affect prices: export volumes, economic growth, differences in local markets, and government regulations, among others. Producers contend that increased exports will not raise prices significantly as there is ample supply to meet domestic demand, and there will be the added benefits of increased revenues, trade, and jobs, and less flaring. Consumers of natural gas, who also benefit from the current low prices, fear prices will rise if natural gas is exported. The DOE's most recent price study concluded that greater LNG exports \"result in higher levels of real gross domestic product (GDP), which more than offsets the adverse impact of somewhat higher energy prices.\" Export opponents have been critical of DOE's conclusions.", "Environmental groups are split regarding natural gas use, with some favoring increased use to curb emissions of certain pollutants, while others oppose expanded use of natural gas because it is not as clean as renewable forms of energy, such as wind or solar. The use of hydraulic fracturing to produce shale gas for export markets has also raised concerns among environmental groups particularly concerned with its possible impacts on groundwater quality. The possibility of a significant increase in U.S. natural gas exports will factor into ongoing debates on the economy, energy independence, climate change, and energy security.", "Congressional interest has focused on the DOE's process and criteria for approving LNG commodity exports to non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries. Several bills in the 114th Congress would facilitate the approval of such permits. Both the House and Senate versions of the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act (H.R. 351 and S. 33), the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act (H.R. 89), and the Export American Natural Gas Act of 2015 (H.R. 428) would impose various deadlines on DOE export permit decisions. The American Job Creation and Strategic Alliances LNG Act (H.R. 287) would extend free trade treatment to World Trade Organization member nations with respect to LNG export permitting by DOE. The Crude Oil Export Act (H.R. 156) would repeal limitations on export of Outer Continental Shelf natural gas under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1354).

U.S. gas exports have been primarily via pipeline to Mexico and eastern Canada. Historically, the United States has also exported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska\u2014almost exclusively to Japan\u2014but the volumes of those shipments have been relatively small and Alaska's natural gas market has been isolated from the rest of the United States. Natural gas companies are now considering exporting greater quantities of U.S. LNG by tanker ship to a number of other countries. Increased development of U.S. natural gas resources\u2014primarily shale gas\u2014along with low domestic prices and idle LNG import infrastructure, have driven the change in the U.S. position.", "Within the next several years, the United States may become a much larger natural gas exporter, particularly in the form of LNG. However, natural gas exports from the United States require federal approval pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7717b). The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Fossil Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) must authorize the export of the commodity and related facilities, respectively. This overarching federal role in the expansion of U.S. natural gas exports has been the subject of ongoing oversight and debate in Congress.", "The prospect of the United States supplying a global market with large quantities of LNG from the lower-48 states raises concerns in Congress, particularly about a potential rise in what consumers pay for natural gas and effects on the economy. Developers of natural gas export projects and natural gas producers argue that domestic gas prices will not rise significantly if U.S. natural gas exports increase because the United States has ample gas resources to meet both export and domestic demand. They argue that any domestic gas price increases due to exports would be more than offset by benefits from the increased gas production, such as higher employment and an improved trade balance. DOE has used the results of several studies it commissioned about the impact on domestic natural gas prices of exports and the effect on the U.S. economy to justify the approval of LNG export proposals. However, some stakeholders disagree with the agency's conclusions. ", "U.S. natural gas prices are lower than those in other international markets, partly because of the nature of the natural gas resources and partly due to competition in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, natural gas prices within the United States vary by region because of transportation limitations, access to supplies, and differences in demand. As new volumes of shale gas are developed, these supplies seek markets where little or no natural gas production has existed before. Over time, the U.S. natural gas market is reconfiguring itself to balance supply and demand regionally and nationally. But getting new natural gas supplies to market may be an ongoing challenge for the industry, whether within the United States or abroad. Infrastructure constraints, such as limited pipeline capacity, environmental regulations, and other regulatory requirements will play a part in how the natural gas market adjusts. Exports of natural gas either by pipeline or as LNG will be a factor as the market seeks balance, especially on a regional basis. Hence the potential export of more U.S. natural gas may have economic effects that vary significantly from region to region, and regional impacts may diverge from impacts on the nation as a whole. (For an illustration of regional natural gas price differentials in the lower-48 states, see Appendix B ).", "Other issues have also been raised regarding natural gas exports. Environmental groups are divided on the desirability of greater use of natural gas at home and abroad. Advocates see it as reducing emissions compared to other hydrocarbons, especially coal, whereas opponents point out that natural gas still emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Concerns about contamination of water supplies during gas production have been raised because of hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\")\u2014which uses water, sand, and chemicals to create fissures in shale, allowing the trapped natural gas to be cost-effectively extracted. Other groups want to see greater use of natural gas in the U.S. economy for economic and national security concerns before it is exported overseas.", "The prospect of growing U.S. natural gas exports, particularly LNG, continues to be a factor as Congress debates the economy, energy independence, climate change, and energy security.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in its 1999 Annual Energy Outlook forecasted that net natural gas imports between 1997 and 2020 would grow from 12.9% of consumption to 15.5%, based on consumption growing faster than production. To accommodate the potential increase in imports, five new LNG import terminals were built by industry in the latter half of the 2000s, and some existing LNG import facilities were re-commissioned and expanded. The United States currently has LNG import capacity of almost 14 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) or over 5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) per year. However, higher domestic production has made imports largely unnecessary, leaving existing import capacity mostly idle. In its Annual Energy Outlook 201 4 , EIA projects that the United States will be an overall net natural gas exporter by around 2016, when U.S. production exceeds domestic consumption ( Figure 1 ).", "The abundance of new domestic natural gas supplies shifted industry interest from building LNG import terminals to constructing LNG export terminals. As of the beginning of January 2015, there have been 48 applications for permits either to construct liquefaction facilities at existing LNG import terminals (also known as regasification facilities) or for new LNG export facilities, in order to export domestically produced natural gas as LNG. The total capacity proposed is approximately 42 bcfd. In addition, companies have active permits to re-export LNG cargos from existing import terminals, which involves taking in foreign LNG cargos, holding them in storage, and then reloading them onto LNG tankers for shipment to foreign markets. Increased pipeline exports to Canada and Mexico may also continue to rise if their domestic demand continues to increase.", "Low U.S. natural gas prices (especially in the Gulf of Mexico) relative to other international markets have spurred interest in exporting U.S. produced natural gas ( Figure 2 ). What effect exporting natural gas will have on U.S. prices and the overall U.S. economy are central questions in the debate over whether to export. DOE has commissioned several studies as part of its evaluation of whether LNG exports to non-free-trade-agreement (non-FTA) countries are in the public interest, further discussed later in this report. ", "Lower U.S. natural gas prices since 2008 along with a large and growing resource base have also prompted calls for greater use of natural gas in the nation's overall fuel mix. Natural gas comprised about 27% of U.S. primary energy consumption last year and has averaged approximately 24% per year since 1973. Instead of exporting U.S. natural gas, some say, the United States should increase use of natural gas in the electric power sector to displace coal, as an alternative transportation fuel to displace oil, and to provide fuel and feedstock to domestic industries such as petrochemicals. Some transition to natural gas is already occurring, particularly in the electric power sector. However, the EIA's annual average projected prices to 2040 (which assume no changes in U.S. policy) never reach the price peaks of the latter 2000s ( Figure 3 ).

Starting in 1969, a small amount of natural gas was also exported as LNG to Japan via the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska. Kenai LNG operated continuously from its opening until its temporary idling in 2012. In April 2014, the facility's owner announced that it would reopen the Kenai LNG terminal because the local area gas supply forecast had increased, providing a renewed opportunity to export Alaskan natural gas production in excess of local demand. It remains the only completed LNG export facility in North America although it is currently not shipping any LNG.", "In 2010, the United States, through DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, allowed LNG import terminals to re-export foreign-sourced LNG to international markets. LNG volumes that are re-exported from the United States after being imported from third countries are not treated the same way as exports of domestically produced natural gas for the purposes of federal regulation. LNG re-export volumes are small, but have exceeded U.S. LNG export volumes in recent years due to the steady decline of LNG exports since 2005 ( Figure 4 ).", "Growing U.S. natural gas production, primarily from shale gas, has decreased the demand for both pipeline imports and LNG imports, leaving the import terminals mostly idle.

Some of Canada's \"imports\" of natural gas from the United States are actually from gas produced in Canada's western provinces, imported into the United States, and re-exported to Canada's eastern provinces.

Long-term contracts are needed to finance the liquefaction facilities, usually the most expensive part of the LNG supply chain, which also includes LNG tankers, storage, and LNG import terminals. U.S. natural gas prices are natural gas market-based, which can give U.S. LNG export projects an advantage because the differential with oil-indexed natural gas prices can be large compared to the U.S. price ( Figure 2 ). U.S. LNG exports could add to the pressure for other countries to delink their natural gas exports\u2014either as LNG or by pipeline\u2014from oil-indexed prices. Japanese companies, for example, have been vocal about their interest in a natural gas-based pricing mechanism to reduce costs and exposure to oil prices. Several recent LNG supply contracts with proposed U.S. exporters are of this type. However, recent declines in global oil prices have reduced the oil-indexed versus gas-indexed price differential. Furthermore, U.S. LNG export contracts will still need to be long-term (usually 20 or longer) to obtain financing. For some facilities, this may be a difficult hurdle to overcome given market and financial conditions and recent price volatility. Providing LNG to countries that use oil for heating, industrial processes, or electricity generation could also decrease demand for petroleum products, putting further downward pressure on oil prices.", "The dip in 2012 in Figure 5 is due to major declines in Algeria, Trinidad & Tobago, Oman, and Indonesia.

Although the locations of most of the proposed U.S. export terminals are on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the East Coast, Asia may be the target market for U.S. LNG, as it tends to pay higher prices for its natural gas imports. The widening of the Panama Canal, scheduled to be completed in 2015, would contribute to U.S. competitiveness in Asia. Europe has a lot of LNG import capacity and growing demand, but needs to continue to improve its infrastructure connections to transport gas to markets.

The basic conclusion of the 2012 NERA study was that LNG exports would benefit the overall U.S. economy. The study acknowledged that there would be parts of the economy that would be hurt by LNG exports, mainly large consumers of natural gas, but that on a net basis the U.S. economy would be better off in all export cases. The net benefits would be highest if the United States could produce large quantities of low cost shale gas and global demand for natural gas increases rapidly.

Both reports left enough latitude in their results for supporters and opponents of exports to promote their opinions.

Natural gas markets in the United States balance in response to increased LNG exports mainly through increased natural gas production. Supply from higher domestic production is augmented by reductions in natural gas use by domestic end-users, who respond to higher domestic natural gas prices. Increased LNG exports result in higher total primary energy use and energy-related CO 2 emissions in the United States. Consumer expenditures for natural gas and electricity increase modestly with added LNG exports. Added U.S. LNG exports, and associated investment, result in higher levels of real gross domestic product (GDP), which more than offsets the adverse impact of somewhat higher energy prices when the export scenarios are applied. ", "Like the earlier studies, however, some opponents have focused on the higher ranges of the projected price impacts in the EIA's 2014 study, or have been critical of its methodology.", "Criticism of the DOE's studies is open to debate. For example, in its conditional approval to export to non-FTA countries for the Cove Point LNG terminal, DOE defended its data use from EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2011 due to timing, but also noted that critics often cite the subsequent rise in demand projected in EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2012 and the Early Release data from EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2013 while neglecting to highlight the corresponding rise in domestic production. These studies are predicated upon a predetermined a set of parameters (e.g., volumes of LNG exported) to examine and asked for the impact on the overall U.S. economy.", "A full analysis of the NERA and EIA studies, as well as the myriad of other studies that have also been undertaken by other groups, is beyond the scope of this report. It is important to remember, however, that these price studies are just one part of DOE's criteria for determining whether LNG exports to non-FTA countries are or are not in the public interest.

To date, FERC's evaluation of impacts related to export terminals has involved the preparation of an EA/FONSI or EIS. As required under NEPA, FERC serves as the lead agency responsible for preparing those documents and DOE serves as a \"cooperating agency.\" Once completed by FERC, DOE adopted FERC's final EIS or EA/FONSI to serve as its own NEPA document.

With regard to the first report, DOE stated that it was prepared to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with natural gas exploration and development. DOE did so to be responsive to concerns raised by the public, but asserted that it was not required to do so to comply with NEPA.

Conditional decisions to approve natural gas exports were issued after completion of the public notice and comment process, but before completion of DOE's NEPA review (i.e., adoption of FERC's NEPA document). When it issued such an approval, DOE stated that it considered all factors relating to the public interest, other than environmental factors, and that it would reconsider all relevant issues associated with the conditional approval once the required NEPA documentation is complete. Under this scheme, DOE processed LNG export applications in the following order of precedence:", "1.

More specifically, for projects requiring an EIS, that would be 30 days after publication of a final EIS; for projects requiring an EA, that would be upon publication of a FONSI; or upon DOE's determination that an application may be approved as a CE. DOE has not further specified conditions under which it may have sufficient information to base a public interest determination. The change was made in part because the DOE had concluded that conditional approvals were not necessary for LNG projects to secure financing, as was assumed under the prior process. The department also wished to focus its resources more effectively on those LNG export proposals most likely to proceed.", "Regardless of whether an entity received a conditional authorization from DOE, no applicant can export natural gas until it receives a final order and approval from DOE and, if needed, approval from FERC.

These data include reductions for natural gas extracted during the period and so are net increases. In recent years, the increase in reserves is mostly attributed to development of shale gas, which has grown from 10% of U.S. natural gas reserves in 2007 to 45% in 2013. By comparison, conventional U.S. natural gas reserves declined between 2007 and 2008, and fell again in 2010. Though the decline was marginal, it highlights the importance of shale gas to future U.S. natural gas production.

NGL is a general term for all liquid products separated from natural gas at a gas processing plant including ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. When NGLs are present with methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, the natural gas is referred to as either \"hot\" or \"wet\" gas. Once the NGLs are removed from the methane the natural gas is referred to as \"dry\" gas, which is what most consumers use. Each NGL has its own market and its own value. As the price for dry gas has dropped because of the increase in supply and other reasons such as the warm winter of 2011, the natural gas industry has turned its attention to producing more wet gas in order to bolster the value it receives. Some companies have shifted their production portfolios to tight oil formations, such as the Bakken in North Dakota, to capitalize on the experience they gained in shale gas development. Historically, the individual NGL products have been priced against oil, except for ethane, and as oil prices have remained higher since 2005 relative to natural gas, it has driven an increase of wet gas production, thereby maintaining the amount of dry gas as a production \"byproduct\" despite its low price."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Actions and Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Several bills in the 114 th Congress directly relate to LNG exports, primarily facilitating the approval of exports to non-FTA countries.

Both of these organizations represent firms that use natural gas and would be negatively affected if natural gas prices rose. Natural gas producers and certain local businesses have supported the projects, as they would benefit from access to new overseas markets and higher international prices. Analyses of the price effects of potential natural gas exports likely will receive continued attention as companies move forward with their projects. The Sierra Club has filed against projects on environmental grounds, particularly related to the source of natural gas for export.", "Expectations about the economic impacts of greater U.S. natural gas exports depend on assumptions about the volume of exports, economic growth, market segmentation, and environmental regulations, among other market parameters.

These estimates also projected that U.S. natural gas prices would stay relatively low in historic terms as well as in comparison to global prices. Those in favor of exports add that increased production could result in increased revenue for local, state, and federal governments (through taxes, royalty payments, and economic development), more employment, an improved international trade balance, and reductions in natural gas flaring. Natural gas consumers counter that higher natural gas prices abroad could eventually lead to higher prices in the United States, and possible supply shortages, as producers seek to maximize profits by diverting more and more U.S. natural gas to overseas markets.", "In the near term, increased use of natural gas in the U.S. economy is limited, primarily to electric power generation. Natural gas-fired electric power plants account for a significant and growing share of U.S. natural gas demand. Although coal remains the dominant fuel for U.S. electric power generation, environmental concerns regarding atmospheric emissions are limiting its use and prompting the retirement of older coal plants that are less equipped to curtail emissions. Switching from coal to natural gas in electric power generation may consume incremental U.S. natural gas supply increases before exports do. There are many proposed petrochemicals projects, but these are at various stages of development and will take a number of years to come to fruition. Other sectors such as transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential are not likely to see a substantial rise in natural gas demand in the next couple of years. This could change if technologies can be improved to increase the use of natural gas in transportation, such as gas-to-liquids, natural gas vehicles, or electric vehicles (assuming the electricity is generated by natural gas). Although proponents see strategic value in such fuel-switching as a means to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, high technology costs diminish this prospect in the near term.", "Although much less attention is paid to natural gas exports by pipeline, it is anticipated that these will continue to increase. Canada's natural gas production has been declining, but it is possible this will be reversed as Canada develops its own shale gas resources, which are estimated to be large. However, Canadian consumption may also increase as production from oil sands is projected to rise. Natural gas is heavily used in the extraction of petroleum from oil sands. Canada also has at least two of its own LNG export projects being considered.

Pipeline export projects tend to be less costly and easier to finance than LNG export projects may be.", "As highlighted above, the development of shale gas resources will be a key factor in the United States becoming a net natural gas exporter. Infrastructure constraints within some of the major shale gas producing areas may limit the amount of natural gas that can reach markets and be available for export. Changes to the regulatory environment would also have an impact on natural gas production.", "Environmental groups differ on the desirability of greater natural gas use in general. Although burning natural gas produces less pollution than burning other fossil fuels, it still emits greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. Some environmental groups view natural gas as a necessary bridge fuel to a zero carbon economy, while others want to go to the zero carbon economy directly. Some environmental groups see natural gas exports raising domestic natural gas prices, making renewables more viable. Additionally, there are concerns about risks to water supplies associated with hydraulic fracturing, the technique for extracting shale gas which uses water, sand, and chemicals to create fissures in shale, allowing the trapped natural gas to be cost-effectively extracted.
