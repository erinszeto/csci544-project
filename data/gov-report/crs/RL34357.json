These dollar amounts are increased, beginning in 2011, from year-to-year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers (all items, United States city average), rounded to the nearest $1,000. The Secretary establishes a process for waiving this provision in the case of a demonstrated hardship.

Eligibility for Medicaid's long-term care services, such as nursing home care or a range of home- and community-based supportive services, is limited to beneficiaries who meet state-designed assessments for functional need and financial standards. The assessment for functional need examines physical and/or cognitive functioning that evaluates whether applicants would require the level of care provided in an institution (e.g., a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or a hospital). Financial standards refer to a variety of optional eligibility pathways, including pathways that allow states to cover people with long-term care needs who have income above 74% of the federal poverty level (FPL), which is equivalent to the level of cash payments under the Supplemental Security income program.", "Beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicaid, because they need long-term care services, also are generally entitled to a range of acute care benefits (e.g., hospital care, physician services, rehabilitation, private duty nursing, home health services, case management, among many others) that a state offers, as long as these services are medically necessary. For dual eligibles, individuals enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid, Medicaid covers just those acute care services that are not covered by Medicare, often referred to as wrap around services.", "Proposal. The President's budget would establish a state plan amendment option to allow states to offer a modified benefit package of acute care services for selected long-term care beneficiaries. States would be given the authority under this provision to expand on the DRA-flexibility to adapt private sector health insurance benefit packages to better meet the needs of specific Medicaid beneficiary groups. The DRA option is modeled on benefit packages available under SCHIP (i.e., FEHBP preferred provider option, coverage for state employees, the largest commercial HMO in a state, or Secretary-approved coverage). HHS estimates that by redesigning acute care benefits, Medicaid would save $20 million in FY2009 and $650 million over the FY2009-FY2013 period.", "Reports.

These arrangements can include contracts with health maintenance organizations (HMOs), primary care case management (PCCM) programs, and pre-paid health plans (PHPs), which vary in the comprehensiveness of services they provide and the degree of financial risk assumed in the managed care contracts. Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA, P.L. 105-33 ), federal Medicaid laws contained provisions that limited states' ability to use managed care, including requirements regarding freedom of choice of provider for beneficiaries, statewideness (i.e., all covered services must be available statewide), and comparability (i.e., the amount, duration and scope of any services available to one individual must be available to all individuals in the same eligibility category). Special waivers were required to override these rules.", "BBA added Section 1932 to the Medicaid statute. This provision gave states the option of requiring Medicaid beneficiaries covered under states' Medicaid plans to enroll with a managed care entity without a waiver. Specific groups, identified in Section 1932(a)(2) were exempted from mandatory enrollment in managed care, including children under age 19 with special health care needs, defined as:", "those eligible for the Supplement Security Income or SSI program, children eligible for the Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program, children under 18 who meet the SSI disability standards who require institutional care, but receive care outside the institution, and for whom the cost of that care does not exceed institutional care (also known as Katie Beckett or TEFRA children), and those receiving foster care or adoption assistance under Title IV-E or who are in foster care or otherwise in an out-of-home placement.", "Other exempted groups include individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Indians are also exempted from mandatory enrollment in Medicaid managed care plans, unless the participating managed care entity is the Indian Health Service, or certain Indian Health Programs operated by Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or urban Indian organizations.", "Proposal. The President's FY2009 Budget repeals Section 1932(a)(2). This change would allow states to require the currently exempted populations identified above to enroll in Medicaid managed care programs covered under Medicaid state plans.

Under Medicaid, drug manufacturers that wish to have their drugs available for Medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the Secretary of HHS, on behalf of the states. Under the agreements, pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state Medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. The formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that Medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs. Rebate calculations depend on the type of drug. For single source and innovator multiple source drugs, basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price (AMP) for a drug (the average price paid by wholesalers) to the \"best price,\" which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler, retailer, nonprofit, or public entity. The basic rebate is the greater of 15.1% of the AMP or the difference between the AMP and the best price. Additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of a given manufacturer's single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation. For non-innovator multiple source drugs, basic rebates are equal to 11% of the AMP.", "Proposal.

If a state has determined that probable liability exists at the time a claim for reimbursement is filed, it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of third-party liability (referred to as \"cost avoidance\"). If probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individual's medical expenses, the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount paid (referred to as \"pay and chase\").", "States are generally required to cost avoid claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the pay-and-chase method. However, there are two statutory exceptions to this rule. In the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care, states are required to use pay and chase. In the case of a Medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical support (e.g., health insurance coverage via an employer) as part of a child support order being enforced by the state, the state must use pay and chase if a provider has not been paid under the medical support arrangement within 30 days.", "In some cases, a Medicaid beneficiary may be required to reimburse the state for Medicaid expenses paid on his or her behalf. To facilitate such reimbursement, the state may place a lien on the Medicaid beneficiary's property.

Because of the overlap in eligible populations, states often undertake administrative activities that benefit more than one program. Under the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cash welfare program, AFDC and Medicaid program eligibility were linked, and many AFDC families also qualified for food stamps. As a result, states often collected necessary information for all three programs during a single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full amount of the cost to AFDC as a matter of convenience. Since the federal government reimbursed states for 50% of administrative expenditures for all three programs, total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs' common administrative costs.", "When Congress replaced AFDC with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program in 1996, the 50% federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and Medicaid eligibility was severed. Later, HHS clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for TANF, Medicaid, and food stamps based on the relative benefits derived by each program. A remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that TANF block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre-1996 federal welfare spending, including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs. As a result, TANF block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to Medicaid and food stamps were excluded from block grant calculations. To compensate, Congress has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by a flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative costs attributable to food stamps that are included in states' TANF block grants (the annual reductions total about $200 million). Congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for Medicaid administrative costs in a similar manner.", "Proposal.

One of those provisions requires employer-based health plans to allow for new enrollment into the plan during periods outside of the typical annual open enrollment period for certain special reasons. Examples of those reasons include when an eligible employee (or their dependent) exhausts COBRA continuation coverage, or when an employee gains a new dependent through birth or adoption. Another HIPAA provision limits the ability of private health insurance plans to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions during what are known as \"pre-existing condition exclusion periods.\" The allowable length of such pre-existing condition exclusion periods depends on the amount of time the new enrollee had been covered by prior \"creditable\" health insurance coverage. A beneficiary can prove they have had prior creditable coverage by providing certificates issued by insurers at the end of each year.

Under this program, states with approved Medicaid state plan amendments may extend Medicaid coverage, including LTC benefits (i.e., nursing home and home- and community-based services), to certain persons who have purchased private LTC insurance policies without requiring them to meet the same means-testing requirements applicable to other groups of Medicaid eligibles.

This may result in no Medicaid payments. In addition, the \"free care\" principle precludes Medicaid from paying for Medicaid-covered services which are generally available without charge, and for which no other sources for reimbursement are pursued.", "Both the Clinton and current Bush Administrations provided guidance on these payment principles in the context of school-based services. Services would not be considered to be \"free\" if certain conditions are met. Providers must: (1) establish a fee schedule for the services provided, (2) determine whether other third parties are liable for every individual served, and (3) bill the beneficiary and/or any liable third parties.", "According to Administration guidance, there are exceptions to the \"free care\" principle. Covered services provided to children with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are reimbursable under Medicaid. Also, Medicaid-covered services provided to individuals who qualify for benefits provided under the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, and the Women, Infants and Children's (WIC) program are also exempt from the free care principle. School providers can bill Medicaid for these services even when such services are provided to non-Medicaid eligible children free of charge.

In general, this program allows states to cover targeted low-income children with no health insurance in families with income that is above Medicaid eligibility levels. States may choose among three benefit options when designing their SCHIP programs. They may enroll targeted low-income children in Medicaid, create a separate state program, or devise a combination of both approaches. All states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories have SCHIP programs.", "BBA appropriated nearly $40 billion for SCHIP for the period FY1998 through FY2007. The formula for determining annual state allotments is based on the estimated number of low-income children and low-income uninsured children in the state, adjusted by a state health cost factor. In FY2008, while reauthorization of the SCHIP program was under consideration, there were four continuing resolutions that maintained appropriations through December 31, 2007. For SCHIP allotments in FY2008, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA, P.L. 110-173 , enacted December 29, 2007, appropriated funds to ensure that no state's exhausted their federal SCHIP program funds before March 31, 2009, but did not make other changes to the program.", "States that established SCHIP programs are entitled to federal reimbursement, up to a cap, for a percentage of the incurred costs of covering enrolled individuals. This percentage, which varies by state, is called the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP). E-FMAP is based on states' Medicaid program matching rates (FMAPs), but is higher in SCHIP. In other words, the federal government contributes more toward the coverage of individuals in SCHIP (ranging from 65% to 83.09% in FY2009) than it does for those covered under Medicaid (50% to 75.4% in FY2009).", "States have three years to spend their annual allotment (e.g., states have until the end of FY2007 to spend their FY2005 allotments). At the end of the applicable three-year period, unspent funds are reallocated among states based on year-specific rules. In the early years of SCHIP, both states that did and did not fully exhaust their original allotments received unspent funds. In more recent years, only those states that fully exhausted their original allotments received unspent funds. Some states have experienced shortfalls in SCHIP funds, meaning at the end of a given fiscal year, they have spent all federal SCHIP funds available to them at that point in time, including original allotments and reallocations of unspent funds from other states.", "Proposal. Through a legislative proposal, the President's FY2009 Budget would increase SCHIP state allotments by $19.7 billion through FY2013, on top of the assumed $5 billion per year in the baseline.", "As reported at a Health and Human Services (HHS) press conference on the budget, a CMS FY2009 budget briefing for House staff on February 4, 2008, and discussions with HHS' staff, the Administration proposes to target SCHIP funds at children and pregnant women with annual family income under 200% of the FPL. The SCHIP proposal also sets a \"hard cap\" upper income eligibility threshold at 250% FPL based on families' gross annual incomes. HHS estimates that the proposed SCHIP allotments will cover eligible children below 200% FPL as well as enrollees with income between 200% and 250% FPL. The enhanced SCHIP matching rate would apply to children in families with income below 250% FPL.", "The Administration's policy assumes no new children would be enrolled in SCHIP if their annual family income exceeds the 250% \"hard cap.\" However, children currently enrolled in SCHIP whose annual family income exceeds 250% FPL would be \"grandfathered in\" under current eligibility rules, and state expenditures on their behalf would be matched at the regular Medicaid FMAP. Under the SCHIP budget proposal, children in higher-income families (above 250% FPL) who lose eligibility based on current eligibility policies, but later wish to re-enroll in SCHIP would, after a continuous year off of SCHIP, be subject to the new 250% FPL \"hard-cap\" based on gross family income.", "Further, under the SCHIP budget proposal, HHS plans to continue efforts to prevent the substitution of SCHIP for private insurance. The proposed \"crowd-out\" policy would apply to states seeking to exceed 200% FPL for SCHIP eligibility, rather than 250% FPL as stipulated in an August 17, 2007, letter from CMS's Center for State Operations to state health officials. States would be required to have the \"crowd-out\" strategies in place and meet the assurances listed in the August 17 letter, or face penalties for non-compliance. For example, states with SCHIP income eligibility thresholds greater than 200% FPL would be required to enroll 95% of their Medicaid- and SCHIP-eligible children with annual family income less than 200% FPL. States that do not comply with the 95% enrollment target would be subject to a one percentage point reduction in their federal matching rate (i.e., enhanced SCHIP FMAP for children in families with income between 200-250% FPL, and regular Medicaid FMAP for \"grandfathered\" children in families with income above 250% FPL), subject to annual matching rate changes, but capped at 5 percentage points. States that enroll 95% or more of the SCHIP eligible population below the 200% FPL target would be permitted to expand their SCHIP income eligibility threshold up to 250% FPL.", "Moreover, the Administration proposes to transition adults out of SCHIP into the Medicaid program by December 31, 2008. Finally, the administration proposes to work with Congress to create a new allotment distribution formula that emphasizes enrollment of children in families with income under 200% FPL.

The House passed an amended version of H.R. 2642 on June 19, 2008. The House's amendment included a moratorium until April 1, 2009, on implementation of six Medicaid regulations. The H.R. 2642 amendments covering Medicaid regulations included requirements, similar to H.R. 5613 , for the Secretary to submit reports to the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Finance Committees. In addition, H.R. 2642 included provisions requiring states to implement a program to verify assets held by financial institutions to assess applicants' eligibility for medical assistance benefits (Medicaid). These asset verification programs would be phased in, so that all states and the District of Columbia, but excluding U.S. territories, would have programs by 2013. The Senate passed the House version of H.R. 2642 without changes on June 26, 2008, and the President signed P.L. 110-252 into law on June 30, 2008.", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 ( S. 3101 ) was introduced in the Senate on June 6, 2008. Although this legislation would primarily address Medicare issues, it contains several related Medicaid provisions as well. There are new requirements for Medicare Advantage plans that serve Medicaid beneficiaries through Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under S. 3101 , SNPs would need to nearly exclusively serve beneficiaries with the types of conditions the plans were organized to offer; namely, those with chronic or disabling conditions, institutionalized beneficiaries, or Medicaid-eligible individuals. Plans would also be subject to new quality monitoring and reporting requirements. S. 3101 also would extend transitional medical assistance and abstinence education programs at their current levels through FY2009, as well as continuing special disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii through a portion of FY2010. Other Medicaid provisions of S. 3101 include new rules that address administrative review of federal financial participation dis-allowances under Medicaid, as well as retaining through September 30, 2009, federal upper payment formulas for certain multiple source (mostly generic) drugs.", "A similar but alternative bill, Preserving Access to Medicare Act of 2008 ( S. 3118 ), was introduced June 11, 2008. S. 3118 would address Medicare Advantage SNPs, but unlike S. 3101 , more closely follows rules from a recently released CMS regulation on SNPs and would remove a moratorium on SNPs. In addition, like S. 3101 , S. 3118 would extend transitional medical assistance and abstinence education programs at their current levels through FY2009, as well as continuing special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii through a portion of FY2010. Other provisions of S. 3118 would include creation of a requirement, similar to H.R. 2642 , that states and the District of Columbia implement systems to verify assets held in financial institutions when assessing individuals' eligibility for Medicaid; reduce administrative payments to prevent duplication of administrative payments under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program; and require a state plan amendment to limit inpatient hospital payment rates when certain conditions were acquired during beneficiaries' hospital stays."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
