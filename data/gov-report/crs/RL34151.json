One of these options is a Private Fee-For-Service plan (PFFS), statutorily defined as a plan that (1) reimburses hospitals, physicians, and other providers on a fee-for-service basis without placing the provider at financial risk; (2) does not vary rates for a provider based on utilization relating to that provider; and (3) does not restrict the selection of providers from among those who are lawfully authorized to provide services and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment established by the plan.", "Recently enrollment in PFFS plans has increased dramatically. In April 2003, there were 22,344 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in one of the three available PFFS plans and one PFFS demonstration program. In April 2004, CMS had contracts with six PFFS organizations, with total enrollment of 31,550. By April 2007, CMS had 47 PFFS contracts and enrollment had jumped to 1.5 million, an increase of over 4,000% in three years. Approximately 18% of all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are enrolled in a PFFS plan, and CBO projects this number to grow to approximately one-third of all MA enrollment by 2017. Plans operate in nearly all United States counties, giving every Medicare beneficiary access to at least one PFFS plan.", "The majority of PFFS enrollees reside in urban areas. However, close to half of all rural beneficiaries participating in Medicare Advantage plans are enrolled in a PFFS plan. Unlike coordinated care plans, which tend to serve more densely populated areas, PFFS plans also choose to serve rural areas. PFFS plans may choose their service areas because (1) Medicare private plan payments are higher than the average cost of traditional Medicare in many of the counties a PFFS plan chooses to serve, and (2) PFFS plans are not required to form networks. Establishing and maintaining networks of providers can be costly, particularly in rural areas.", "Congressional attention to these plans has increased this past year for a number of reasons. First, enrollment in these plans has risen significantly. Second, payments to PFFS plans are typically higher than payments to other managed care plans and higher than expenditures in FFS Medicare. Third, the marketing and sales tactics of PFFS plans has raised concerns related to beneficiary protection. Lastly, PFFS plans are subject to different statutory requirements than other Medicare private plans.", "This report examines the differences between PFFS plans and other Medicare private plans, specifically local health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and regional preferred provider plans (PPOs).

Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance program, covers a broad range of complementary medical services, including physician, laboratory, outpatient hospital services, and durable medical equipment. Beneficiaries choosing traditional fee-for-service Medicare may receive covered benefits from any qualified provider who participates in the Medicare program. Alternatively, beneficiaries eligible for Medicare part A and enrolled in part B may choose to enroll in a Medicare private plan, under part C of Medicare (the Medicare Advantage program), and receive all required parts A and B benefits (except hospice services) through a private plan. Medicare part D provides prescription drug coverage available through either a stand-alone drug plan (PDP), or for most Medicare Advantage enrollees through their plan.", "Medicare has offered its beneficiaries enrollment in a private plan as an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program since the 1970s, not long after the establishment of Medicare. Over the years, Congress has continued to legislate an increasing number of private plan options for Medicare. In 1982, Congress created Medicare's risk contract program, allowing private entities, mostly health maintenance organizations (HMOs), to contract with Medicare. In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA, P.L. 105-33 ), creating the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, offering new types of private plans, including private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) changed the name of the program to Medicare Advantage (MA) and further expanded Medicare's private plan options with the addition of new regional preferred provider organizations (PPOs), among others. Further modifications to the MA program were made in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 , DRA) and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-432 ).", "Recently, congressional attention has turned to the MA program, focusing in large part on PFFS plans. There are a number of reasons for this attention. First, enrollment in these plans has risen significantly\u2014increasing from 22,344 beneficiaries in April of 2003 to almost 1.5 million four years later. Second, payments to PFFS plans are typically higher than payments to other MA plans and higher than expenditures in FFS Medicare. Recent analysis conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) demonstrated that in 2006, payments to PFFS plans averaged 119% of FFS expenditures. This is in contrast to payments to all MA plans, which averaged 112% of expected FFS expenditures, and payments to HMOs, which averaged 110%.", "Complaints have also been made related to allegedly aggressive and potentially misleading marketing practices of PFFS plans, leading some to question Medicare's oversight of these plans. Most recently, in an agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), seven health care organizations representing 90% of the non-group PFFS market voluntarily agreed to suspend marketing of their PFFS products because of complaints and accusations of deceptive marketing practices. According to CMS, the suspension for a given plan will be lifted when the plan meets specified conditions.", "Finally, PFFS plans are subject to different statutory and administrative requirements than other Medicare private plans, specifically those related to access, quality, review of plan premiums, Medicare prescription drug benefits, and balance billing. Policy makers and beneficiary advocates are questioning whether beneficiaries fully understand these differences when they enroll in a PFFS plan and what their implications are for beneficiary spending, access to providers, and adequacy of benefits.", "This report focuses on PFFS plans and how they differ from two other widely available MA options, local HMOs and regional PPOs.

Members receive services mainly through the plan's network, although plans may allow out-of-network coverage. HMO's typically serve one county, but are allowed to expand their service area to more than one county if they wish. Each MA participating organization offering a local HMO is required to provide at least one MA plan with qualified Part D prescription drug coverage in its service area. Regional PPO \u2014In addition to requirements for local plans, a regional PPO must provide for reimbursement for all covered benefits, regardless of whether the benefits are provided in or out of the network. At a minimum, a regional PPO must cover an entire region. It must also have a unified part A and B deductible and a catastrophic cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Like MA participating organizations that offer local HMOs, each regional PPO must offer a plan with qualified prescription drug coverage. PFFS plan \u2014In addition to the solvency and other standard requirements for local plans, a PFFS plan (1) must reimburse hospitals, doctors, and other providers at a rate determined by the plan on a fee-for-service basis without placing the providers at financial risk; (2) can not vary rates based on utilization relating to the provider; and (3) can not restrict the selection of providers among those who are lawfully authorized to provide the covered services and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment established by the plan.

While almost all MA plans provide a full range of services to enrollees in exchange for a monthly capitated payment, local HMOs act as both the insurer and provider of health care services. To receive benefits, the enrollee must get medical care through a network of providers managed by the plan, with very few exceptions, such as emergency care.", "In contrast, PFFS plans cover enrollees through a private indemnity health insurance policy. The insurer reimburses hospitals, doctors, and other providers on a fee-for-service basis at a rate determined by the plan. The structure of PFFS plans allows enrollees greater flexibility in choosing a provider than in other MA plans. In HMOs, for example, beneficiaries typically have to visit their primary care physician and get a referral before seeing a specialist. In PFFS plans, beneficiaries can visit a specialist or any provider, who agrees to the terms and conditions of the plan, without prior authorization. Enrollees can also receive services from providers outside of their service area.", "Regional PPOs operate somewhere in between, in that members can choose in or out-of-network coverage. Members, however, save in out-of-pocket costs when selecting in-network providers. While regional plans have a low enrollment compared to other types of MA plans, they are included in this analysis because they are a new option with unique requirements under the statutes, and because they may also have exceptions to network requirements. Also, similar to PFFS plans, regional PPOs are providing access to Medicare managed care plans in areas that traditionally have not been served by managed care in the past.", " Appendix provides a detailed comparison of local HMOs, regional PPOs, and PFFS plans, following the sequence of the Social Security statues for Medicare Advantage, including information on residency requirements, information requirements, required benefits, beneficiary financial liability, access to services and networks, quality, payments to plans, premiums, and prescription drugs.

Although a PFFS plan does not have to establish a provider network, it must meet certain access requirements and demonstrate to the Secretary that professionals and providers are willing to provide services under the terms of the plan. The plan may satisfy this requirement by (1) establishing payment rates that are not less than those under traditional fee-for-service Medicare, or (2) having signed (direct) contracts with a sufficient number and range of providers in a particular category that agree to the plan's fee schedule. Most PFFS plans are meeting access requirements by paying providers at the Medicare rates.", "Most PFFS plans deliver services through \"deemed contracting\" providers. A deemed provider is a provider who, before delivering a service, knows that a beneficiary is enrolled in the PFFS plan and has been given, or has reasonable access to, the PFFS plan's terms and conditions for participation. In general, if a PFFS enrollee notifies the provider that he or she is in a PFFS plan and the provider chooses to furnish services, the provider automatically becomes a deemed provider for that service. If the provider furnishes services to a PFFS enrollee but the deeming requirements are not met, generally because the provider does not know that the patient is a PFFS enrollee (i.e., an emergency situation), the provider becomes a \"non-contracting\" provider. A \"non-contracting\" provider is entitled to receive the same amount the provider would have received under traditional Medicare as payment in full for a given service.", "Local HMOs, in contrast, are required to form provider networks to meet access requirements. Each provider has a written contract or agreement to furnish services to enrollees in the plan's network. Care is generally not covered if received from a provider who is not in the HMO's network. Regional PPOs have less restrictive networks; enrollees can see a provider outside the plan's network but must pay a greater portion of the cost of their care for doing so.

A PFFS plan is subject to the same requirements as other MA plans to provide additional benefits to enrollees if their bid for providing required parts A and B benefits is lower than the benchmark amount determined by CMS. However, unlike other MA plans, the Secretary does not review, approve, or disapprove the PFFS plan's basic or supplemental premiums. Thus PFFS plans could charge their enrollees any premium they choose.

These areas are often referred to as floor counties . Payments in floor counties, which are mainly rural and sparsely populated areas, are among the highest in the country. Local HMOs have typically chosen not to offer managed care plans in these areas because the costs of forming provider networks can be significant.

While HMOs may also have different cost sharing than traditional Medicare, more individuals are familiar with HMOs than with PFFS plans. PFFS plans may be more confusing because beneficiaries expect them to be more similar to traditional Medicare.

Plans do this by developing care coordination, disease management, preventive care, and other quality-related programs. Without networks and contracts, PFFS plans have less control over the numbers and types of services provided by their providers, as well as the quality of those services. The same holds for traditional Medicare, which also pays providers on a fee-for-service basis and does not form provider networks. Furthermore, PFFS plans are exempt from having to establish and monitor a quality improvement program, which provides for the collection and ongoing analysis of quality measures related to health outcomes. Although the evidence that managed care plans produce better health outcomes or deliver more cost-effective care is mixed, without consistent quality reporting across all types of health plans, discerning whether higher payments to PFFS plans result in improved quality will be difficult to assess."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Significant growth in enrollment in PFFS plans raises concerns among policy makers because payments to PFFS plans are higher than payments to other MA plans and costs in the traditional Medicare program. With enrollment in these plans projected to double over the next 10 years, payments to these plans will increase Medicare spending. Furthermore, differences between PFFS plans and other MA plans have important implications for beneficiaries, the impact of which are not yet fully understood.
