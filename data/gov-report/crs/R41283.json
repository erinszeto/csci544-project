First-term membership is divided into two broad categories in each chamber: Members chosen prior to the convening of a Congress, and those chosen after a Congress convenes. The resulting data, combining pre-convening and post-convening first-term Members, provide a count of all Members who served a first term in the House or Senate.", "Since the convening of the 64th Congress, 4,201 individuals have entered the House of Representatives for their first, or \"freshman,\" terms as Representatives. An additional 28 have begun service as Delegates or Resident Commissioners. During the same period, 844 individuals began their first terms in the Senate.", "Data on pre-convening first-term Members provide partial insight into the extent of membership turnover in the House and Senate since 1915. In both chambers, the data suggest that the overall number of first-term Members elected to Congress who take their seats at the convening of a new Congress has declined since the 64th Congress. This appears to be consistent with findings that argue that the duration of Members' careers has been increasing in the past century. Taken on their own, post-convening first-term Member data do not reveal clear patterns within individual Congresses, or over time.

The \"pre-convening\" category includes Members who were elected in the general election, and in any special elections held prior to the convening of a Congress. The 64 th Congress was chosen as the starting point for data collection because it was the first Congress for which Senators were chosen by direct popular election. This provides a single date upon which most Members in both chambers are chosen to serve prior to the convening of a Congress. In the Senate, the pre-convening category also includes any Senators who were appointed to the Senate prior to the convening of a new Congress. ", "The \"post-convening\" category includes Members who joined either chamber after the convening of a Congress. Means by which seats may be filled by a post-convening Member in either chamber include special elections held after a Congress convenes or electoral challenges that result in a new Member being seated. In the Senate, a first-term Member may also join the chamber through appointment or special election.", "Members whose congressional service in one chamber is not consecutive are counted as first-term Members in the first instance of their service as a Member, if that term occurred between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. For example, a Representative who served in the 87 th Congress (1961-1962), and 89 th Congress (1965-1966), but not the 88 th Congress (1963-1964), would be counted as a first-term Representative only for the 87 th Congress. Members with service in the House and Senate are listed in each capacity in which they served a first term, if those terms occurred between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses.", "The resulting data, combining pre-convening and post-convening first-term Members, provide a count of all Members who served a first term in the House or Senate.

All of the smallest changes occurred after the 89 th Congress (1965-1966). The distribution of greater changes occurring earlier in the period between the 64 th -114 th Congresses, and smaller changes happening in the later period may also support contentions regarding the duration of Representatives' careers.

All of those Congresses occurred before the 87 th Congress (1961-1962). The smallest turnover of pre-convening Senators occurred in the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992), with a change of three seats. In the 73 rd Congress (1932-1933), a 15-seat change amounted to a percentage change of 15.63%, since the Senate had 96 seats. Table 4 provides data on the number of seats and percentage change of the seven Congresses that saw the least change between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. Smaller changes appear to be more evenly distributed through the latter half of the Congresses observed. This may be explained in part by electoral patterns. While the entire House stands for election every two years, only one-third of the seats in the Senate are subject to election in the same period; barring change in membership for other reasons, this assures that two-thirds of Senate membership will remain unchanged.
