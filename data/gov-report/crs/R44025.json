Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine \"fair\" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat.", "In response, Congress passed the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-78, Title IX; LMR). The law mandated price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine and allowed USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. USDA issued a final rule in December 2000 that went into effect in April 2001. The final rule included mandatory reporting for lamb.

As in past years, stakeholders proposed changes that were intended to improve mandatory reporting as issues emerged between reauthorizations.", "In response to livestock stakeholders, the act makes several changes to swine reporting, creating a new negotiated formula purchase category and requiring that transactions reported after the day's reporting deadline be reported in the next-day price reports. It revises the definitions of lamb importers and packers by lowering the volume thresholds for determining if an importer or packer is subject to reporting requirements. Lastly, the act requires USDA to conduct a study on LMR ahead of the next reauthorization.", "However, the act did not include a provision to grant emergency authority to USDA to continue price reporting in the event of a government shutdown because of a lapse in appropriations.

AMS market reporters collected and reported prices from livestock auctions, feedlots, and packing plants. The information was disseminated through hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual written and electronic USDA reports on sales of live cattle, hogs, and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals. The goal was to provide all buyers and sellers with accurate and objective market information.", "By the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone many sweeping changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration (firms controlling more than one aspect of production). Fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash; or \"spot\") sales, and more frequently sold under alternative marketing arrangements (e.g., formula sales based on a negotiated price established in the future) with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine \"fair\" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat. USDA had estimated in 2000 that the former voluntary system was not reporting 35%-40% of cattle, 75% of hog, and 40% of lamb transactions.", "During debate on mandatory price reporting, opponents, including some meat packers and other farmers and ranchers, argued that a mandate would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information. Nonetheless, some of these earlier opponents decided to support a mandatory price reporting law. Livestock producers had been hit by very low prices in the late 1990s and were looking for ways to strengthen the markets. Some meat packers also decided to support a national consensus bill at least partly to preempt what they viewed as an emerging \"patchwork\" of state price reporting laws that could alter competition between packers operating under different state reporting laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative and Rulemaking History", "paragraphs": ["The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (LMR, P.L. 106-78 , Title IX; 7 U.S.C. \u00a71635 et seq.) was enacted in October 1999 as part of the FY2000 Agriculture appropriations act. The law mandated price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine and allowed USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. The law authorized appropriations as necessary and required USDA to implement regulations no later than 180 days after the law was enacted. Mandatory price reporting was authorized for five years, until September 30, 2004.", "USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000. Although reporting for lamb was optional in the LMR statute, USDA established mandatory reporting for lamb in the final rule. The rule was to be implemented on January 30, 2001, but USDA delayed implementation for two months until April 2, 2001, to allow for additional time to test the automated LMR program to ensure program requirements were being met.", "The implementation of mandatory reporting did not affect the continuation of the AMS voluntary price-reporting program. AMS continues to publish prices from livestock auctions, and feeder cattle and pig sales, through voluntary-based market news reports.", "LMR authority lapsed briefly in October 2004 before Congress extended mandatory price reporting for one year to September 30, 2005. Authority for LMR lapsed again on September 30, 2005. At that time, USDA requested that all packers who were required to report under the 1999 act continue to submit required information voluntarily. About 90% of packers voluntarily reported, which allowed USDA to publish most reports. In October 2006, Congress passed legislation to reauthorize reporting through September 30, 2010. This act also amended swine reporting requirements from the original 1999 law, by separating the reporting requirements for sows and boars from barrows and gilts, among other changes. Because statutory authority for the program had lapsed, USDA determined that it had to reestablish regulatory authority through rulemaking in order to continue LMR operations.", "On May 16, 2008, USDA issued the final rule to reestablish and revise the mandatory reporting program. This rule incorporated the swine reporting changes and was intended to enhance the program's overall effectiveness and efficiency based on AMS' experience in the administration of the program. The rule became effective on July 15, 2008.", "Mandatory wholesale pork price reporting was not included in the original price-reporting act because the hog industry could not agree on reporting for pork. Section 11001 of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) directed USDA to conduct a study on the effects of requiring packers to report the price and volume of wholesale pork cuts, which was a voluntary reporting activity at the time. The farm bill study on wholesale pork pricing was released in November 2009 and concluded that there would be benefits from a mandatory pork reporting program.", "On September 27, 2010, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-239 ) was enacted, reauthorizing mandatory price reporting through September 30, 2015. The act added a provision for mandatory reporting of wholesale pork cuts, directed the Secretary to engage in negotiated rulemaking to make required regulatory changes for mandatory wholesale pork reporting, and established a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop these changes. The committee was composed of representatives of pork producers, packers, processors, and retailers. The committee met three times, was open to the public, and developed recommendations for mandatory pork reporting.

According to NPPC testimony before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture of the House Agriculture Committee, the total number of hogs that would trade under this new category is not known, but possibly could increase the number of reported negotiated hog sales by 50-100%.

In addition, almost one-third of U.S. lambs are processed by one cooperative that does not report under LMR because its business structure is treated as a packer-owned operation, even though, reportedly, the cooperative is willing to report under LMR.

If a plant has operated for fewer than five years, USDA will determine, based on capacity, if the packer must report. Packers are required to report the prices established for steers and heifers twice daily (10 a.m. and 2 p.m. central time); cows and bulls twice daily (10 a.m. central for current day, and 2 p.m. for previous-day purchases); barrows and gilts three times daily (7 a.m. central for prior-day purchases, and 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. central); sows and boars once daily (7 a.m. central for prior-day purchases); and lambs once daily (2 p.m. central). Besides the established prices, packers report premiums and discounts and the type of purchase (e.g., negotiated, formula, or forward contract). Packers are required to report, depending on the species, the quantity delivered for the day; the quantity committed to the packer; the estimated weight on a live weight basis or a dressed weight basis; and quality characteristics, such as Choice grade. In addition to daily reporting, on the first reporting day of the week, packers file a cumulative weekly report of the previous week's purchases of steers and heifers, and swine. Lamb packers are required to report the previous week's purchases on the first and second reporting day of the week, depending on the data. Steer and heifer and lamb packers are to include data on type of purchase (negotiated, formula, or forward contract), premiums and discounts, and some carcass characteristics (e.g., quality grade and yield, average dressing percentage). Swine packers are required to report the amount paid in premiums that are based on noncarcass characteristics (e.g., volume, delivery timing, hog breed). Also, packers must make available to producers a list of such premiums. In addition to livestock purchase prices, packers are required to report sales data for boxed beef, wholesale pork, and carcass and boxed lamb. Sales are reported twice daily for beef and pork; once daily for lamb. Packers are required to provide price, quantity, quality grade for beef and lamb, and type of cut. Packers report beef and pork domestic and export sales and domestic boxed lamb sales.

Otherwise, the data cannot be published in order to protect the identity of those reporting. AMS found that the \"3/60\" guideline resulted in large gaps in data reporting. For example, during April 2, 2001, and June 15, 2001, 24% of daily reports and 20% of weekly reports were not published because of confidentiality provisions.", "In order to address the data gaps, AMS adopted a \"3/70/20\" guideline in August 2001.
