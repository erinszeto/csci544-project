As noted by GAO and other public and private analysts, Medicare's vulnerability to fraud and abuse arises from the program's size, complexity, decentralization, and administrative requirements. Although a good estimate of the dollar amount lost to Medicare fraud and abuse is open to discussion, analysts agree that billions of dollars are lost. Administering the volume of claims (more than 4.5 million per work day) from Medicare's many providers and suppliers (over 1 million) is a daunting task. Requirements to process and pay provider reimbursement claims quickly have set up a \"pay and chase\" approach that complicates program integrity efforts.", "In general, initiatives designed to fight fraud and abuse are considered program integrity activities. These include processes directed at reducing payment errors as well as activities to prevent, detect, investigate, and ultimately prosecute health care fraud. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for Medicare administration and program integrity, oversees private contractors that perform activities such as provider audits, reviewing claims for medical necessity, and conducting investigations. These contractors develop and refer suspected fraud cases to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS/OIG) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) for further investigation and prosecution.", "CMS has made considerable progress in improving program integrity oversight as well as in reporting on Medicare program integrity. With increased mandatory and discretionary funding, CMS's ability to wage a consistent, coordinated program integrity campaign has improved. Nonetheless, some issues remain, including the need to further improve the identification, monitoring, and reporting of fraud and abuse, and to provide more information on program integrity resource allocation decisions and results.", "Medicare program integrity activities are funded in statute, largely through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) and Medicare Integrity Programs (MIP), which were both established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-191). HIPAA provided CMS and federal law enforcement agencies with dedicated funds to coordinate federal, state, and local activities to fight health care fraud. Beginning in FY2009, Congress approved additional discretionary funds to enhance these efforts. Further HCFAC funding was provided under health care reform\u2014the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended). PPACA increased HCFAC mandatory funding by $350 million over the period from FY2011 to FY2020. PPACA also strengthened and added a number of new tools for CMS to help bolster Medicare's program integrity activities.", "This report provides an overview of Medicare program integrity. A description of key program integrity activities is presented as well as a discussion of the role that private contractors and law enforcement agencies play in maintaining Medicare's integrity. Detailed information on federal funding for program integrity efforts also is presented.

Due to a number of factors such as advances in health care delivery and technology, an aging population, and overall increases in medical costs, Medicare spending has been projected to grow more quickly than spending in the overall U.S. economy. As expenditures continue to rise in the nation's largest health insurance program, efforts to preserve Medicare's program integrity have attracted increased attention.", "As the agency responsible for administering Medicare, CMS contracts with a number of private entities to conduct program integrity activities.

The maximum amounts available for certification are specified in law. ", "HIPAA also established an additional annual Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) appropriation. Mandatory annual MIP appropriations are transferred from the Medicare Trust Funds to the HCFAC Account, and HIPAA specified the maximum amounts available for MIP. The maximum MIP appropriations are adjusted for inflation and are available until expended. HIPAA required that the HHS/OIG and the Attorney General submit an annual report to Congress on selected HCFAC activities, but not MIP activities. GAO submitted four biennial reports on HCFAC-funded activities (not MIP activities) as required by HIPAA. In FY2010 and FY2011 respectively, the HCFAC Account received mandatory appropriations of approximately $1.17 billion and approximately $1.4 billion.

In creating CPI, CMS established an organizational entity intended to have authority to better integrate all program integrity activities across the agency. CPI was designed to consolidate, coordinate, and strengthen existing program integrity activities, carry out new responsibilities created by legislative authority, and better position CMS to respond to emerging program integrity issues. CMS identified CPI's overarching mission to be \"protecting the Trust Funds and other public resources against losses from fraud and other improper payments and to improve the integrity of the health care system.\" To achieve this mission, CPI identified the following four program areas and classified all program integrity efforts into one or more of these areas: ", "Prevention . Current prevention activities include payment system operation, medical review, and provider and beneficiary education. CPI plans to expand prevention by better engaging beneficiaries and other stakeholders in fraud identification; strengthening provider/supplier safeguards; improving payment system accuracy; and better coordination with law enforcement. Detection . CPI plans to implement additional analytical pilots to detect improper payment trends, such as using provider/supplier enrollment risk-based predictive modeling, and geographic \"heat\" mapping based on 1-800-MEDICARE tips. Heat mapping is a process used to identify geographic areas with increased potential of fraud activity. CMS contractors analyze complaints to Medicare toll free numbers and tips from providers and beneficiaries to target certain areas and potential fraud schemes. Recovery . CPI plans to collaborate with program integrity partners, such as the HHS/OIG, DOJ, state survey and certification agencies, and state Medicaid agencies, to increase overpayment recoveries through utilization of restitution, fines, penalties, damages, program suspensions, and exclusions. Additional overpayment recovery tools available to CPI include field investigations, more use of Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs), more use of Medicare Secondary Payer activities, and better coordination with Medicare's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Transparency and Accountability . CPI plans to develop performance measures that can be used to evaluate outcomes and better track, report, and disseminate program integrity information. ", "CPI launched an outreach initiative to build better relationships with other public and private partners and raise overall awareness of CMS's program integrity activities.

These increasing costs as well as concern about proper stewardship of public resources have helped fuel additional interest in finding ways to control rising Medicare costs. Program integrity, particularly initiatives to identify and reduce fraud and abuse, have received substantial emphasis as a potential source of restraining the growth in federal Medicare expenditures. Several recently enacted new laws have provided additional tools and resources to help federal officials improve upon Medicare program integrity activities. These initiatives are discussed in more detail below. ", "Estimates of fraud and abuse often are made separately from estimates of improper payments. Estimates of the dollar amount lost just to health care fraud vary. Fraud analysts and law enforcement officials estimate between 3% and 10% of health care expenditures (for all payers, including Medicare) are lost annually to fraud. CMS estimated that Medicare's FY2010 FFS improper payment error rate was 10.5% and accounted for $34.3 billion in overpayments. Not only do fraud and abuse contribute to rising health care costs, they also can harm patients, particularly when medically necessary services are withheld, or when medically unnecessary services are provided. ", "Fraud and abuse often are integrated together into the discussion of program integrity or activities to protect the Medicare program from these threats. Abuse describes incidents or practices of providers, physicians, or suppliers of services and equipment which, although not usually fraudulent, are inconsistent with accepted sound medical, business, or fiscal practices. These practices may, directly or indirectly, increase Medicare costs, result in improper payment, payment for services below professionally recognized standards, or payment for services that were medically unnecessary. Fraud is intentional deception or misrepresentation that an individual makes, knowing it to be false and that it could result in some unauthorized benefit to them. Typically health care fraud most often is associated with financial misconduct, however, delivering poor or substandard quality care has received increased attention in recent years. For the purpose of this paper, the discussion of abuse focuses on improper payments and not the improper provision of health care services. ", "Although health care fraud encompasses many different types of erroneous behavior, the types of schemes committed today share certain characteristics. According to law enforcement officials, fraud perpetrators often target public health insurance programs (Medicare and Medicaid) and private health plans simultaneously. Fraud schemes can span multiple states and involve both providers of services, many with little health care experience, and beneficiaries. For example, in several recent cases, fraud perpetrators paid both providers and senior citizens kickbacks to obtain their billing numbers in order to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare. Other examples of recent fraudulent activity include billing for unnecessary services or tests provided to patients, submitting claims for services provided by unlicensed providers, and illegally marketing drugs or products for higher reimbursements. Further, recent fraud investigations revealed evidence of organized crime activity in health care. At a recent hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the HHS/OIG Deputy Inspector General testified that health care fraud is attractive to organized crime because penalties are lower than for other organized crime-related offenses, there are low barriers to entry, fraud schemes are easily replicated, and a lack of data hampers detection efforts.", "Even though there is overlap, the types of fraud committed against Medicare's FFS program can differ from the types of fraud committed against Medicare's Parts C and D plans. These differences stem largely from differences in Medicare's payment structure. In FFS, Medicare pays providers directly for a specified unit of service delivered to a beneficiary (i.e., procedure, visit, test, or group of services). This can create provider incentives to overstate the health care services provided to patients or actually to provide more care to beneficiaries than is necessary in order to increase reimbursement. Examples of fraudulent overstatement and over-billing activities in Medicare's FFS program include the following:", "Billing for services not furnished and/or supplies not provided; Altering claim forms, electronic claim records, medical documentation, etc., to obtain a higher payment amount (i.e., upcoding); Billing for services already provided (i.e., duplicate payments); Soliciting, offering, or receiving a kickback, bribe, or rebate, for example, paying for a referral of patients in exchange for the ordering of diagnostic tests and other services or medical equipment; Billing for services provided to deceased beneficiaries or provided by deceased providers; Billing non-covered or non-chargeable services as covered items; and Billing separately for services or equipment included in global rates (i.e., unbundling).", "In contrast, under Parts C and D, Medicare pays private health plans and prescription drug plans (PDPs) a fixed monthly payment amount per enrollee, otherwise known as a capitated payment. Capitated payments are made in advance for a pre-determined set of benefits either to an MA plan for Parts A and B benefits or to a PDP for prescription drug benefits. Under capitation, the monthly payment amount is fixed, regardless of the amount of services provided. Therefore, providers have incentives to limit health services or provide fewer services to beneficiaries to maximize their profit. In Medicare Parts C and D, types of fraudulent activities may include", "Engaging in fraudulent marketing practices (i.e., offering beneficiaries a cash payment to enroll, enrolling beneficiaries without their consent, conducting unsolicited door-to-door marketing, or using unlicensed agents); Selectively enrolling healthy beneficiaries (\"cherry picking\" beneficiaries who will need fewer health services); Failing to provide medically necessary services; Inappropriately overestimating or underestimating bid amounts for payment; and Collecting excessive beneficiary premiums.", "Historically, Medicare program integrity has focused on combating FFS fraud in Medicare Parts A and B with less emphasis on Part C (Medicare Advantage) and Part D. However, as private Medicare plan enrollment increased and Medicare added an outpatient Part D drug benefit, there was a need to expand program integrity activities to address fraud in capitated payment systems as well as FFS.

Since 2004, GAO has issued 12 products (including reports and testimony) that have identified strategies to reduce Medicare fraud and abuse. ", "To protect the Medicare Trust Funds from improper payments, CMS contracts with private companies to review claims to determine whether the services provided are medically reasonable and necessary. In Medicare, improper payments include both provider under- and overpayments. Improper payments largely result from provider billing mistakes or inadvertent claims processing errors. Although Medicare's claim review strategies identify some instances of fraud, they are not specifically designed to do so. The majority of claims are screened and reviewed after payment has been made or post-payment. ", "CMS also contracts with private organizations that are directed to identify fraud. CMS typically classifies these anti-fraud functions as benefit integrity activities. Examples of benefit integrity include performing ongoing claims data analysis to identify aberrant billing patterns, conducting fraud investigations, auditing providers, contacting Medicare beneficiaries and providers to verify that medical services were actually provided, and referring suspected cases of fraud to law enforcement personnel for prosecution.

The Medicare program's size makes management of the program complex, requiring automation and predictable rules and procedures to ensure efficient operation. Medicare's predictability and rules driven payment systems ensure that providers will receive prompt payment, but also provide opportunities for individuals to exploit the system.

The vast majority of claims are paid quickly, within the 30-day prompt payment window, and as a result claims are subject to limited review before payment (prepayment review).

Under the pay and chase approach, unscrupulous individuals could enroll as Medicare providers/suppliers, receive payments, and CMS subsequently would detect, or chase, overpayments or fraudulent bills to seek recoveries. Fraudulent providers/ suppliers often bill large sums quickly, then disappear, but even for legitimate providers that have received an overpayment in error, it is expensive to identify and recover improper payments.

CMS strives to use a more flexible approach that combines both traditional MIP tools with other approaches, such as the Health Care Fraud Prevention & Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), where a team that includes medical experts, law enforcement, data analysts, and policy staff collaborates to identify suspicious activity and quickly investigate and prosecute criminal behavior.

In addition, an October 2009 HHS/OIG report found that MEDICs relied on external sources, such as complaints, rather than proactive methods to identify fraud and abuse incidents to refer or investigate. Some administrative barriers hindered MEDICs ability to fully engage in data analysis and other more proactive fraud and abuse monitoring methods.

PPACA also required CMS contractors to track and report performance statistics, such as overpayments identified, fraud referrals, and return on investment. Similarly, PPACA requires the Secretary to evaluate program integrity contractors at least every three years. Further, PPACA required the RAC program to be expanded to Medicare Parts C and D (and Medicaid).

CMS intends to expand an Integrated Data Repository (IDR) to include claims and payment data from other federal programs such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Social Security Administration, and the Indian Health Service. CMS expects that the new PPACA authorities will help CMS to migrate more quickly from a pay and chase approach to a deterrent approach. ", "As shown in Table 8 , PPACA increased appropriations for HCFAC by a total of $350 million over the period FY2011-FY2020.

Predictive analytics technologies have been compared to technologies used in private sector financial services industries, such as banking, insurance, and credit cards, to reduce fraudulent billing. Combining data and information from multiple sources, including Medicare FFS claims history (aberrant billing patterns), enrollment information, background checks, and other public and private information (links to questionable affiliations), complaints, predictive analytics technologies would help to determine if a claim was legitimate before it was paid. Among other advantages, predictive analytics technologies could reduce the Medicare FFS pay-and-chase dynamic where claims are quickly paid, only to later be reviewed to discover the providers were fraudulent or the claims should not have been paid for other reasons. With predictive analytics technologies, CMS can develop scoring models that would rate the potential that a claim is inappropriate based on past known fraudulent activity. Claims that had similar characteristics to past fraudulent claims could be denied pending further verification. ", "The SBJA required CMS to award predictive analytics technologies contracts by April 2011. CMS indicted that the schedule has encountered delays, but the predictive modeling contracts would be awarded soon.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that BCA initially would reduce federal deficits by $917 billion over the period FY2012-FY2021 (total reduced federal spending was estimated to be $2.1 trillion). CBO estimated that other BCA provisions would further reduce federal spending by as much as $1.2 trillion between FY2012 and FY2021.

However, BCA exempts certain specific programs from the discretionary funding caps, including Medicare program integrity. Starting in FY2012 and continuing through FY2021, BCA authorizes increased discretionary appropriations for Medicare program integrity activities funded through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account. BCA specifically identified the maximum amounts that appropriation committees could authorize for HCFAC program integrity activities.

To carry out the six main types of program integrity activities, CMS contracts with a number of private organizations. The effectiveness of these efforts depends on close collaboration and coordination between CMS, its contractors, OIG, and federal and state law enforcement agencies.", "The implementation of HCFAC and MIP in 1996 provided CMS and Medicare enforcement agencies with dedicated funding to coordinate health care fraud-fighting activities. As documented in HCFAC reports, from 1999 through 2010, program integrity and anti-fraud resources increased from an estimated $0.8 billion in FY1999 to approximately $1.9 billion in FY2010, and the number of new civil and criminal fraud enforcement actions more than quadrupled (through FY2010). Furthermore, activities of health care fraud enforcement also have steadily increased recoveries transferred to the Medicare Trust Funds. GAO reports have raised questions about how MIP funding is used and have recommended CMS develop more quantitative measures to assess the impact of MIP-funded program integrity activities.", "Protecting Medicare from fraud and abuse is a complex and challenging undertaking for a number of reasons. Reliable estimates of the amount lost to health care fraud are unavailable, making it difficult for policymakers to determine the extent of resources needed to respond to the issue and where best to direct resources. In addition, fraud perpetrators are quick to adapt to investigative techniques and continually devise new and more sophisticated Medicare fraud schemes. Therefore, to reduce Medicare's vulnerability, CMS and its partners need to utilize a diverse mix of preventive and investigative program integrity methods. CMS has migrated to more preventive program integrity techniques, such as increasing the volume of claims it reviews on a pre-payment basis, applying stricter standards when reviewing provider enrollment applications, and conducting background checks on providers prior to allowing them to bill the Medicare program.
