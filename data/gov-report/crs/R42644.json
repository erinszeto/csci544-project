From October 1, 2012, through March 26, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under the terms of P.L. 112-175, a part-year continuing resolution. While operating under this resolution, two major events impacted the DHS budget. First, Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast of the United States, which started a legislative process that resulted in enactment of legislation that provided $50.7 billion in disaster relief and emergency appropriations, including $12.072 billion for DHS, and $9.7 billion in additional borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program. Weeks later, On March 1, 2013, an across-the-board reduction in budget authority, or sequestration, was ordered as required under the terms of the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25). The Office of Management and Budget's sequestration report indicated that DHS would lose $3.191 billion as a result of sequestration.", "On March 26, 2013, the President signed into law P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act.

In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. Subsequently, these amounts are allocated among the appropriations committees, usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution. These amounts are known as the 302(a) allocations. They include discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the development of the bills. In the second stage of the process, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills. These amounts are known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must add up to no more than the 302(a) discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline, since any bill reported with a total above the ceiling is subject to a point of order. 302(b) allocations may be adjusted during the year by the Appropriations Committee by issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the various appropriations bills progress towards final enactment.", "The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first appropriations bills that were affected by the Budget Control Act (BCA), which established discretionary security and nonsecurity spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, and overall caps that will govern the actions of appropriations committees in both houses. For FY2013, the BCA had set a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending, defined to include the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, Budget Function 150 for all international affairs programs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Intelligence Community Management Account that funds the offices of the Director of National Intelligence. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of the total of $1.047 trillion. In addition, the BCA allows for adjustments that would raise the statutory caps to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, emergency spending, and, to a limited extent, disaster relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and for controlling health care fraud and abuse. In the absence of a budget resolution for FY2013, these levels became the basis for enforcement in the Senate. In the House, the lower levels agreed to in the House-passed budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 112 ) were made effective for purposes of enforcement in the House by H.Res. 614 and H.Res. 643 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reductions from the Stated Funding Levels in P.L. 113-6 and the Accompanying Senate Explanatory Statement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sequestration", "paragraphs": ["The Budget Control Act (BCA) tasked a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan for Congress and the President to enact by January 15, 2012.

The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding at a percentage to be determined after enactment, under terms specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended by the BCA.

Overstays are identified, and high-priority overstays (i.e., persons with derogatory information in one of the database checks) are quickly flagged for follow-up investigations. Under the integrated U.S.-Canadian system, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (the Canadian immigration agency) provides DHS with biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports of entry on the Canadian border; and DHS treats these Canadian entry data as records of U.S. exits for purposes of the U.S. entry-exit system. Some Members of Congress have expressed frustration that a biometric exit system has not been implemented, and both chambers' appropriations reports directed DHS to report on the department's plans for a more comprehensive exit system.", "The entry-exit system's place in the DHS organizational structure has changed several times since it was created.

The Senate report warned of adverse long-term consequences if DHS preserves high staffing levels during a period of budget tightening by cutting its investments in infrastructure; and also expressed concern that inspection fees have not increased in about ten years, which limits funds available for CBP officer salaries. The House report encouraged CBP to consider a number of changes to reduce OFO staffing requirements at POEs, including by reengineering POE processes to make them more automated, by improving risk-based targeting, by better managing short-term staffing demand surges, by exploring public-private partnerships, by expanding trusted trade and traveler programs that facilitate low-risk entries, and by relying on technology to increase officer efficiency. The House report also would have directed CBP to provide a more specific staffing and deployment plan for border patrol agents; and the Senate report would have requested a plan for OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry.

Some people argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has encouraged illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through POEs.

Two recent examples of this have drawn Congressional interest.

Section 601 of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-42 ) also eliminated a passenger fee exemption for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and certain other Western Hemisphere states, resulting in an estimated increase in COBRA fees of $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 and thereafter. In both these cases, funds were directed (and in the case of Section 601, still are being directed) to the Customs User Fee Account but have not yet been obligated for customs revenue collection, as the provisions that raised this revenue stated that the funds\u2014in contrast with other COBRA passenger fees\u2014are available only to the extent provided in appropriations Acts.", "Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the disposition of these fees. The House Appropriations Committee report directed CBP to report to the committee about whether the Department has access to the $639 million identified by GAO, and how the department will eliminate those funds from its books. With respect to fees collected pursuant to P.L. 112-42 , CBP's budget justification for FY2013 included these fees in its budget for CBP officer salaries and expenses, but neither chamber included language in its appropriation bill to make these funds available to CBP, resulting in a shortfall for the agency. The House would have addressed this shortfall by shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to CBP officer salaries, and would have relied on other increasing fee revenues to fill the remaining gap. The Senate report awaited a resolution to the shortfall to be proposed by the department.

This is due in part to ongoing recovery efforts from major events such as the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. However, in recent years it has been argued that the reliance on supplemental funding has primarily been due to underfunding the DRF. For example, between 2005 and 2011, the average regular appropriation for the DRF was $1,749 million. Yet, the average monthly expenditures for the DRF were $383 million (which would extrapolate to $4,596 million annually).", "The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF through the regular appropriations process for FY2013.

First, $608 million was requested for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act (including activities such as assistance provided to states for emergencies and fires). This is sometimes referred to as the DRF's \"base\" funding. The second (and significantly larger) category is for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act, for which the administration requested $5,481 million.

The Administration requested funding for the DRF based on what FEMA planned to spend on all past declared catastrophic events, plus the 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a $500 million reserve to prevent shortfalls.

Appropriations Terms and Concepts", "Budget Authority, Obligations, and Outlays", "Federal government spending involves a multi-step process that begins with the enactment of budget authority by Congress. Federal agencies then obligate funds from the enacted budget authority to pay for their activities. Finally, payments are made to liquidate those obligations; the actual payment amounts are reflected in the budget as outlays.", "Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts that are available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was enacted by Congress. Budget authority may also be indefinite, as when Congress enacts language providing \"such sums as may be necessary\" to complete a project or purpose. Budget authority may be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year; any unobligated funds at the end of that year are no longer available for spending. Multi-year budget authority specifies a range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending; no-year budget authority is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time.", "Obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel, enter into contracts, receive services, and engage in similar transactions in a given fiscal year. Outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year. Because multi-year and no-year budget authorities may be obligated over a number of years, outlays do not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year. Additionally, budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year, especially with certain contracts.", "In sum, budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. Discretionary agencies and programs, and appropriated entitlement programs, are funded each year in appropriations acts.", "Discretionary and Mandatory Spending", "Gross budget authority, or the total funds available for spending by a federal agency, may be composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority, but it excludes appropriations for entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year. However, some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending.", "Offsetting Collections", "Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, as part of a business-type transaction such as offsets to outlays or collection of a fee. These funds are not counted as revenue. Instead, they are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority, or the total funds that are appropriated by Congress each year, is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending.", "Some collections offset a portion of an agency's discretionary budget authority. Other collections offset an agency's mandatory spending. These mandatory spending elements are typically entitlement programs under which individuals, businesses, or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts (pensions). Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, others by annual appropriations. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation and as such is not annually appropriated, whereas the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. In addition to these entitlements, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds. These funds are not appropriated by Congress. They are available for obligation and included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority.", "Appendix B. DHS Appropriations in Context", "Federal Government-Wide Homeland Security Funding", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts. The Office of Management and Budget, as originally directed by the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, has published an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism. Beginning with the June 24, 2002, edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table B -1 is presented in such a way as to allow year-to-year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 accounted for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense comprised the next highest proportion at nearly 26% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, the Department of Justice at nearly 6%, and the Department of State at more than 3% rounded out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security related. Therefore, while the enacted FY2012 budget bills and existing law included total homeland security budget authority of $35.1 billion for DHS, the total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion. Moreover, the amounts shown in Table B -1 will not be consistent with total amounts shown elsewhere in the report. This same inconsistency between homeland security budget authority and requested total budget authority is also true for the budgets of the other agencies listed in the table.
