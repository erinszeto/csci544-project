Telehealth generally refers to the use of information and communication technology to deliver a health care service. It is a mode of health care delivery that extends beyond the \"brick-and-mortar\" health care facilities of the VHA. VA telehealth services are generally provided on an outpatient basis and supplement in-person care. Such services do not replace VA in-person care. The VA copay requirements for telehealth are the same as for VA in-person care, but in some cases may be lower than the copays for VA in-person outpatient health care services delivered through the VHA. President Trump and Congress have recently enacted measures such as the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks of 2018 (VA MISSION Act; P.L. 115-182 ) that aim to address the access barriers that veterans may experience when accessing VA telehealth services across states lines.

The VA has developed VA mobile applications (apps), which refer to software programs that run on certain operating systems of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and computers that transmit data over the internet that veterans can access as telehealth applications. Veterans can access VA mobile apps on cellular and mobile devices that operate using either a web-based platform, an iOS platform, or an Android operating platform.", "VA Telehealth Partnerships and Access", "According to the VA, it cannot meet the health care demands of veteran patients in-house and therefore, it has established partnerships with private sector vendors to help address veterans' demand for VA care.

The VHA is composed of nearly 1,700 VA medical facilities. VA care is not a health insurance program; it is primarily a direct provider of care. ", "Meeting veterans' demand for care has been challenging for the VA. Some veteran patients who seek health care services from the VHA experience barriers to receiving in-person care; for example, by being unable to schedule VA medical appointments in a timely manner or having to travel long distances to reach health care facilities. In conjunction with the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), the recently enacted VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (VA MISSION Act; P.L. 115-182 ), and other measures that aim to expand veterans' access to care, the VA has attempted to address barriers to in-person care using telehealth in VA health care facilities.

A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that neither the Veteran Appointment Request System nor the On-line Patient Self-Scheduling System (OPSS) had the capability to allow veterans to schedule their own telehealth appointments. According to the VHA, access to VA telehealth services is a joint decision between the veteran and his or her care team of VA providers and clinical staff. The care team tells the veteran which clinically appropriate VA care services he or she can access through the VHA. There may be instances when it is clinically appropriate for a veteran to receive in-person care rather than a telehealth service.
