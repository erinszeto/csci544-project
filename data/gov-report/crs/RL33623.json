On the other hand, long-term measures have their own limitations. On the positive side, they indicate the magnitude of long-term budget imbalances resulting from the gap between future federal tax revenues and the costs of providing retirement and health care for the baby-boom generation. However, long-term projections are subject to substantial uncertainties for two reasons. First, statistical theory implies that expected forecasting error is larger for more-distant events because errors accumulate over each period into the future. Second, the structure of the economy changes over time, so that assumptions based on the past behavior of the economy may not hold in the future. Thus short-term measures, which are relatively certain but which ignore future imbalances, must be used in conjunction with long-term measures, which indicate the size of future imbalances, but with more variability, in order to gain an accurate picture of the fiscal challenges facing the federal government. Long-run fiscal projections depend on determinants of economic growth\u2014such as productivity, and increases in capital stock and labor force\u2014and the growth of health care costs.", "This report describes and analyzes several measures of the long-term fiscal condition of the federal government. The strengths and limitations of long-term, short-term, and medium-term fiscal measures are discussed. The report then provides an overview of the federal government's long-term fiscal situation.", "Most independent analysts believe the federal government's fiscal position is more accurately summarized by projections that modify the Congressional Budget Office baseline by assuming the reach of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) will be capped at present levels, that tax cuts slated to expire in 2010 will in fact be extended, and that discretionary spending will keep pace with overall economic growth. Seventy-five-year projections employing these alternative assumptions put the long-term fiscal gap between revenues and spending at 7%-8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Fiscal gap is defined as the size of the immediate and permanent increase in tax revenues or decrease in non-interest expenditures needed to ensure that the public debt to GDP ratio at the end of the budget window is the same as the initial public debt to GDP ratio. These modified-baseline projections indicate that putting federal fiscal policy on a sustainable path for the next 75 years requires substantial increases in taxes, decreases in spending, or both. Changes needed to maintain a permanently sustainable fiscal stance would be even greater.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Long View of Fiscal Policy", "paragraphs": ["Federal government programs and policies have financial effects that stretch far into the future. Nevertheless, the overwhelming focus of federal fiscal policy is short term in nature. Discussions of federal fiscal policy typically center on deficits in the current fiscal year or 10-year budget windows. Short-term accounting or budget measures, however, provide only a partial view of the costs of federal programs and policies, and they frequently offer a potentially misleading view of the federal government's ability to pay its bills in the long term. Short-term measures, such as annual budget estimates, or medium-term measures, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 10-year baseline estimates, do not reflect long-term fiscal imbalances, and in particular they do not reflect the large anticipated costs needed to finance the baby-boom generation's retirement. Therefore, if short- and medium-term measures are not used in conjunction with long-term fiscal measures, then long-term fiscal effects of current policy will be understated or hidden.", "Budget measures are useful to the extent they permit governments and their citizens to make better decisions. Economic theory suggests that budget deficits can be a useful tool to smooth out short-run fluctuations, so that households are not subjected to sharp fluctuations in taxes and program benefits. In the long run, however, budgets must balance. Furthermore, deficits that persist beyond the short run will redistribute wealth among generations, and will thus have important distributional consequences. In addition, most economists believe long-term deficits have important negative effects on capital accumulation and economic growth. Therefore long-term budget measures provide valuable information about intergenerational equity and about prospects for long-term economic growth.", "Investors use both income statements, which show cash flows in a given year, and balance sheets, which show assets and liabilities, to understand a business's financial condition. Similarly, understanding a government's fiscal position requires more than one set of accounts. Long-term projections or measures are particularly important for understanding the growth of entitlement programs, where the full consequences of policy decisions take decades to emerge. Government programs and tax law provisions often have effects that stretch well beyond the end of standard budget windows. That being said, it is also true that short-run budget estimates have the advantage of providing far more detail. Furthermore, short-term forecasting, which exploits momentum in economic activity to predict future economic indicators, gives more reliable estimates than long-run forecasting, which depends on the presumption that key economic parameters will match historical values or values considered \"reasonable\" by analysts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why 10 Years is Not Enough", "paragraphs": ["Discussions of fiscal policy usually start with the annual budget deficit or medium-term estimates such as the 10-year CBO budget outlook projections.

However, the annual budget deficit estimates provide limited and potentially misleading information for several reasons. First, while the consequences of government spending and tax policies extend well into the future, annual deficit numbers only give information about cash flows for a single year. For example, a government sale of an income-producing asset reduces the deficit in one year and increases deficits in future years. Deciding whether the sale is penny wise in the short run but pound foolish in the long term (or not) requires multiyear budget information. Medium-term budget estimates, such as 5-year and 10-year budget projections, can provide more information about future taxes and spending and give a better guide to the total effects of changes in fiscal policy than annual deficit estimates. However, if the effects of a policy change extend beyond the end of a medium-term budget window, then a longer-term measure will be needed.", "Medium-term projections provide an accurate picture of fiscal policy only when conditions in the years beyond the medium term resemble years within the medium term. For this reason medium-term budget estimates currently provide a misleadingly optimistic impression of the financial condition of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The baby-boom generation's retirement and rising costs of medical care signal the federal government's fiscal position will worsen substantially after the next decade unless significant changes are made. This deterioration in the federal government's finances does not show up in 10-year budget projections, such as the CBO baseline projections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CBO Baseline", "paragraphs": ["The CBO baseline projections, by law (Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985), estimate the fiscal consequences of current laws and policies and are meant to serve as a neutral benchmark to assess the probable fiscal consequences of new laws or changes in programs. The CBO baseline projects a 10-year trajectory of the future fiscal effects of current law. It is not intended to anticipate future policy or legislative responses.", "Current law is not the same as the current situation. Current law may include provisions that take effect many years in the future and which may bring about conditions far different from the current situation. Current law specifies that some future policies that some analysts consider implausible will be implemented. In particular, independent analysts focus on three assumptions widely considered to be unrealistic. First, discretionary spending is assumed to continue at a constant inflation-adjusted level that does not reflect growth in population and per capita income. Projected discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP falls by the end of the baseline's 10-year window to levels unprecedented in modern times. According to the CBO baseline, defense spending will fall from 4% in 2005 to 3% of GDP in 2016, the same as the historical minimum reached in 1999. The baseline non-defense discretionary spending total drops from 3.8% to 2.9% of GDP over the same period, below the 3.2% level reached in 1998 and 1999, which was the lowest level in the past four decades. Figure 1 shows historical data for 1987 through 2005 and CBO baseline projections for 2006 through 2016 for defense and non-defense discretionary spending. Non-defense discretionary spending has risen as a share of GDP in the years leading up to 2006. Defense spending has risen even more sharply. According to the CBO baseline, discretionary spending will decline after 2006. While the CBO baseline assumption of constant discretionary spending in real terms provides a reasonable benchmark for determining what is or what is not a spending increase, it is not a plausible basis for predicting the actual path of spending. Most independent analysts assume discretionary spending will grow at the same rate as GDP.", "Second, the current law CBO baseline projects that individual income tax revenues will rise sharply in coming years due to the effects of the alternative minimum tax. Most independent analysts believe that changes will be enacted to limit revenues collected by the AMT to levels far below CBO baseline projections. The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has grown in recent years because the AMT is not indexed to keep pace with inflation. In addition, the 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA, P.L. 107-16 ) and the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA, P.L. 108-27 ) reduced taxes under the regular income tax so that many upper-middle-class households were suddenly subject to AMT provisions. Congress has enacted a series of one-year \"fixes\" of the AMT that increased exemptions and changed treatment of certain tax credits. However, the CBO baseline assumes that the AMT fix will expire at the end of 2006, so if Congress does not act the proportion of taxpayers subject to AMT provisions will continue to grow. The CBO estimates that about 2 million taxpayers paid higher taxes due to the AMT in fiscal year (FY) 2002, and around 30 million taxpayers will pay more in FY2010 under current law. Further, under current law, which assumes the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire, more than 22% of filers in 2016 will be subject to the AMT, according to projections. If the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended, about 32% of filers in 2016 will be subject to the AMT. This implies that political pressure to extend AMT fixes will be substantial.", "Most other projections assume individual income tax revenues will be lower than CBO baseline projections. Auerbach, Gale, Orszag, and Potter (2003) assume in future years 3% of taxpayers will be subject to the AMT, which was the proportion in 2005. The CBO long-term forecasts, which are not constrained by baseline assumptions, assume that tax revenues will rise over the next eight years from current levels to 18.3% of GDP for its \"lower revenues\" scenarios, whereas in the \"higher revenues\" scenarios revenues are calculated using current law assumptions regarding individual income taxes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) makes no explicit assumption about the AMT, but assumes tax revenues will be limited to 19.7% of GDP beginning in 2016. As a practical matter, without radical changes in the income tax system, this would be possible only with some cap on the AMT.", "Third, most independent analysts have assumed the Bush tax cuts and other tax provisions, with minor exceptions, will not expire as scheduled under current law. The 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 tax cuts according to current law are scheduled to expire by the beginning of 2011. The Bush Administration has sought to make these provisions permanent, and many analysts therefore believe fiscal projections should reflect that intention. Several other provisions of the tax law, collectively referred to as \"tax extenders,\" such as the 10% income tax bracket, higher child tax credits, lower top tax rates, and repeal of the estate tax, are all slated to expire at the end of 2010. Congress has repeatedly extended these provisions, and many argue that for the purposes of budgetary projections they should be considered permanent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manipulation and Budget Measures", "paragraphs": ["Congress generally focuses most of its attention on the budgetary impact of revenue and mandatory spending during the 10-year period used for cost estimates, and pays less attention to the longer-range costs of such legislation. The budgetary impact of revenue and mandatory spending legislation considered in the House and Senate generally is assessed for a period encompassing the fiscal year in progress (the \"current year\") and 10 future fiscal years\u2014the upcoming fiscal year (the \"budget year\") and the nine fiscal years after the budget year (the \"outyears\"). For years, CBO has provided the House and Senate with 10-year cost estimates of mandatory spending measures, and the Joint Tax Committee has provided both chambers with 10-year estimates of revenue measures.", "In some cases, legislation can be crafted so that the budgetary costs of policies that Congress intends to establish over the longer term, or even permanently, may be accommodated in revenue and mandatory spending legislation, despite budget enforcement procedures. Specific revenue or spending policies in legislation may be adjusted so that the budgetary impact of the legislation complies with the applicable budget enforcement procedures. Techniques used to ensure compliance include, among others, phase-in and sunset dates and offsets. These techniques may allow Congress to include in legislation long-term revenue or spending policies that otherwise might not comply with budget enforcement procedures.", "Phase-in dates (i.e., future dates when a policy first takes effect) may be used to delay the implementation of a policy beyond the effective date generally applicable to the legislation, such as the date of enactment, thereby helping to keep the overall cost of the measure within the appropriate limits. Delaying the implementation of a policy that costs $300 million per year for four years, for example, would save $1.2 billion over the life of a 10-year bill. Similarly, sunset dates (i.e., future dates when a policy terminates) could be used for the same purpose. Sunsetting a policy that costs $300 million per year after eight years, for example, would save $600 million over the life of a 10-year bill. Further, sunset dates may be used to terminate costs altogether for periods when no net costs are allowed (e.g., after the budget window applicable to reconciliation legislation).", "Revenue reconciliation legislation enacted in 2001 and 2003 employed a mix of phase-in dates and sunset dates to keep the overall revenue reduction in the measures within the limits set by the budget resolutions for those years. Further, the legislation used sunset dates so that the net revenue losses would not extend beyond the 10-year window used by reconciliation in those instances.", "Offsets may be used to counter costs so that the net budgetary effect of the legislation is neutral or otherwise complies with budget enforcement requirements. In 2005 and 2006, for example, Congress considered and enacted revenue reconciliation legislation that complied with the budget resolution requirement that the revenue reductions not exceed $70 billion over a five-year window. The legislation included changes in capital gains and dividends policy (among other policy changes) that was scored as incurring significant revenue losses in the remaining five years of the 10-year cost estimating period. In order to avoid violating a procedural prohibition against net revenue losses in those remaining five years, the legislation included various revenue increases that kept the net revenue reductions in the measure under $70 billion for the full 10-year period.", "Legislation allowing otherwise ineligible households to convert regular individual retirement accounts (IRAs) provides a concrete example of how offsets work. Converting traditional IRAs, which are funded with pre-tax dollars, into Roth IRAs, which are funded with post-tax dollars, generates revenue gains in the short run due to conversion penalties and fees. Unlike withdrawals from regular IRAs, withdrawals from Roth IRAs are not taxed. Therefore, allowing conversions of regular IRAs to Roth IRAs creates revenue losses in the longer run. By a careful choice of the year in which IRA conversions are first allowed, most estimated revenue gains will fall within a 10-year baseline window and most of the revenue losses will fall outside. If a congressional budgetary procedure considers only costs within the 10-year window, then those revenue losses are ignored, even though they constitute a deterioration in the federal government's fiscal condition. The Tax Policy Center estimates that provisions in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA; P.L. 109-222 ) allowing these conversions loses more than $4 billion in present value, even though the provision appears to raise $8.6 billion in the 10-year budget window. Gravelle discusses budget estimation of the effects of changing IRA requirements and gives other examples of changes in the tax code whose short-term costs, as measured using a five-year budget window, are only a third or a fourth as much as long-term costs beyond that window.", "Long-term budget estimates can be improved by creating tax increases or spending cuts in distant years. While future legislators may be likely to reverse those actions before they take effect, the improvements in long-term budget measures will appear now. Those measures will then provide an overly optimistic picture of the long-term fiscal situation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The \"Moving Window\" Problem", "paragraphs": ["Multi-year estimates of federal deficits will increase over time when the gap between revenues and spending is widening. When a new fiscal year arrives, the previous year's deficit is replaced with a much larger deficit from the first fiscal year beyond the old budget window. Therefore, a 10-year or a 75-year budget deficit estimate may appear to deteriorate in each successive year even if nothing in the real economy changes. Even if the present 10-year deficit were eliminated now, in following years 10-year deficit totals would still rise because deficits are expected to rise rapidly in what were the \"out\" years of the original 10-year estimate.", "For example, according to the CBO intermediate spending/lower revenue projections, the total 10-year deficit for fiscal years 2005-2014 will be $3.95 trillion, in constant 2005 dollars. Moving the 10-year deficit estimate one year forward to cover 2006-2015 period requires dropping the FY2005 deficit of $324 billion and adding the estimated FY2015 deficit of $516 billion, thus increasing the 10-year total deficit by $193 billion (all amounts in constant 2005 dollars). The solid line in Figure 2 shows the estimated increases in 10-year budget totals due to shifting the budget window, and the dashed line shows the 10-year deficit in present value terms. This present value estimate is a lump-sum amount in today's dollars, having the same economic value as a stream of deficits over the 10-year period. Present value measures take into account the fact that having a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future because of the time value of money.", "The 75-year projections, which have been the focus of the Social Security and Medicare Trustees' report, suffer from the same moving window problem, and therefore provide an overly optimistic view of the long-term financial condition of Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs. For example, the 1983 Social Security reforms instituted in the wake of the Greenspan Commission were projected to balance benefits and revenues over the next 75 years. The 2004 Trustees' report, however, projected a $3.7 trillion shortfall. This change was largely the effect of shifting the window for projections. The projection window in 1983 ended in 2057, while the projection window in 2004 ended in 2078. Because large deficits are forecast for the mid-21 st century and beyond, shifting the projection window forward made it appear as if Social Security's financial situation had worsened over time. This is mostly the result of an insufficiently long horizon, rather than bad news.", "In recent years the Social Security Trustees' Reports have resumed the calculation of infinite horizon forecasts, which do not share this problem. The Social Security Administration reported infinite horizon estimates until 1965. Estimated shortfalls over the infinite horizon may change over time as a result of unexpected changes in the streams of revenues and costs or due to unexpected changes in the path of interest rates. However, infinite horizon estimates change due to bad news or good news, not because of the moving window problem.", "The difference between 75-year and infinite horizon estimates of Social Security's sustainability is substantial. The 2006 Social Security Trustees' Report estimates the infinite horizon unfunded liability (3.7% of future payroll or 1.3% of future GDP) is nearly twice the 75-year estimate (1.9% of future payroll or 0.7% of future GDP).

Short-term budget forecasts have several technical advantages. First, short-term forecasts generated by sophisticated macroeconomic models exploit the predictability of the momentum that determines most short-run economic movements to forecast growth, unemployment, and interest rates. The reliability of forecasts from these models worsens for time periods farther in the future for two reasons. First, the state of the economy in a distant year will be determined by a longer sequence of random shocks than the state of the economy in the near future, which creates more variability in forecasts that extend farther forward in time. Second, the structure of the economy changes over time in unpredictable ways. The introduction of new technologies and industries, such as automobiles, the Internet, or automatic domestic appliances, affect the economy significantly and persistently in ways that are not easily foreseeable. In the short run the effects of such changes are negligible; in the long run such changes have profound effects, affecting key economic parameters such as productivity growth rates and labor participation rates.", "Second, academics, private consulting firms, financial institutions, and government organizations have put considerable effort into improving short-run economic forecasting models. Less effort has gone into constructing long-term forecasting methods. Third, short-term budgetary forecasts rely on highly detailed information about government expenditures and programs, while many long-term forecasts are based on information about broad categories of spending. Fourth, information used for short-run budget estimates is subject to a rigorous review process, and computations are based on procedures developed over many decades of experience.", "Finally, short-run budget accounting using the cash accounting approach provides Congress with strong tools to control spending of government agencies and to provide incentives which reinforce oversight powers. Keeping federal spending on a short leash requires budget numbers with a short horizon.", "By contrast, long-term models lack much of the detail and sophistication of short-run models. Long-term models rely upon assumptions about long-run averages for annual growth, interest rates, and other key parameters. Long-term forecasting models are much simpler than those used for short-term forecasting. The interaction of macroeconomic variables in long-term forecasting models is much less sophisticated than that incorporated in short-term models. After-the-fact evaluation is easy for short-term forecasts and difficult for long-term forecasts. Less research has been done on long-term forecasting because it is harder and less financially rewarding than short-term forecasting.", "The long-term imbalances in the federal budget complicate building of long-term models that forecast the path of the federal government's finances. Standard macroeconomic models are built on the presumption that, over time, individuals and governments balance their budgets, and so these models are not easily applied when it is not clear how a government will balance its budget. Models can be built that assume federal deficits crowd out private investment, in which case the nation's projected capital stock eventually collapses. Otherwise, models can assume that in the future the government will impose large tax increases or spending cuts or that it will reduce the real value of the debt by printing money and sparking rapid inflation. In the latter case, the model must predict or assume when and how policy makers take these actions. Models may also assume the government can borrow indefinitely from the rest of the world at a set interest rate, which implies that foreign lenders will eventually own essentially all assets of the U.S. economy. All of these approaches present technical and conceptual difficulties.", "While short-term forecasts rely upon more sophisticated models and more detailed data, that does not imply long-term forecasts are less valuable. Rather, even though long-term forecasts by their nature must be simpler and less precise than short-term forecasts, they provide information about the financial implications of policy that short-term forecasts cannot provide.

Second, as incomes grow people increase their consumption of most goods, and most economists believe higher incomes lead to demands for higher levels of goods and services provided by governments. Economists often assume growth in non-defense discretionary government spending will grow at the same rate as incomes.

One modeling approach treats the United States as a \"small open economy,\" which implies that the United States can borrow on world markets at a fixed market rate of interest, regardless of how much is borrowed. At the other extreme, the United States is viewed as a closed economy, so that interest rates are determined by the domestic capital markets. The international position of the U.S. economy lies between these extremes, being integrated into world goods and capital markets and being large enough to influence markets. However, modeling this intermediate and more realistic case is technically more difficult. Therefore most long-term models assume real interest rates will follow historical long-term averages.", "For small changes in borrowing, the small open economy assumption that interest rates are constant is reasonable. Recent research suggests that a 10% increase in the ratio of federal debt to GDP raises long-term interest rates by 0.3-0.6%.

Assuming world economic growth runs at 4% per year, a rate slower than the experience of the last few years (but slightly above the 1970-2007 average of 3.8%), the inflation-adjusted size of the global economy will quintuple by 2050. If the investment ratio stays the same as in recent years, so that about 22% of GDP is invested, then the flow of new funds into global capital markets would be $55 trillion (2005 dollars). Of this, the federal government would need to borrow $6.4 trillion (according to CBO's intermediate spending/lower revenues projections), or over one-ninth of all new capital flowing into the world market.

For instance, the December 2005 CBO long-run projections subsumes these items into a broader \"other mandatory spending\" category, which is then extrapolated.", "Social Security's long-term financial imbalance has significant implications for intergenerational equity. Early cohorts of Social Security beneficiaries received far more in benefits than they paid in OASDI taxes, an inevitable consequence of starting a pay-as-you-go pension system. However, future generations will pay more in taxes than they will receive in benefits, which was not inevitable in the design of the Social Security program. Generational consequences of Social Security's financial problems are shown in Table 6 .", " Table 6 indicates that the cost of benefits and taxes for future participants will essentially balance, with a discrepancy of less than one-twentieth of 1% of GDP. This simply presumes that future generations will neither receive nor pay subsidies. Past and current participants, however, enjoyed a bonus of $13.3 trillion in present value, representing the benefits they received above and beyond the taxes they paid. Eliminating Social Security's financial imbalance either means that living generations must reduce benefits or increase taxes, or future generations must pay this above and beyond the costs of their own retirement. The monetary magnitudes needed to solve Social Security's financial problems are large. However, the infinite horizon estimate of the OASDI fiscal gap of 1.4% of GDP is smaller than shifts of resources associated with major policy initiatives in the past."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Long-Term Fiscal Situation", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces large fiscal imbalances.

As with icebergs, the largest and most dangerous parts of long-term fiscal imbalances are less visible.", "Although all serious fiscal analysts acknowledge the magnitude of future fiscal imbalances, major legislative changes of the scale necessary to address these imbalances have not been enacted\u2014or yet proposed. The political choices needed to reduce these imbalances in a significant way will be painful, which explains some of the reluctance of policy makers to tackle this issue. Other reasons for the delay in confronting the issue of fiscal imbalances include the belief that economic growth will solve these problems, avoiding the need for difficult allocational decisions, and a belief that the costs of delay are relatively small."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Will The Economy Outgrow the Deficits?", "paragraphs": ["Some journalists assert that accelerated economic growth will allow the U.S. economy to outgrow fiscal imbalances. The consensus of professional economists is that the economy is unlikely to outgrow the current looming fiscal imbalance. CBO concludes there is essentially no chance that growth in total factor productivity will be high enough to avoid large future shortfalls. Auerbach, Gale, and Orszag conduct a simulation that assumes the economy will grow 3.8% per year over 2006-2016 instead of the 2.8% pace used by the CBO in its January 2006 forecasts. The U.S. economy has not had sustained growth at that pace since the 1960s. Using assumptions outlined below, which many independent analysts consider reasonable, Auerbach, Gale, and Orszag estimate the unified budget deficit over the 2006-2016 period to be $2.1 trillion or 1.2% of GDP. The deficits excluding Social Security and other trust funds would be $5.1 trillion or 3.0% of GDP.", "Large budget deficits can slow economic growth in the long term. Government borrowing will push up interest rates unless foreign investors are willing to buy enough bonds to offset the reduction in the domestic pool of savings. Thus deficits either reduce the capital stock or induce foreign investors to own a larger share of the capital stock, reducing the future stream of profits and interest payments to domestic investors.", "Reducing large future deficits or paying off existing public debts requires either substantial cuts in entitlement benefits or higher taxes (which also reduce incentives to work). Cutting the real value of debt by rapid inflation hinders the ability of consumers and businesses to respond to price signals, thus reducing economic efficiency. Moreover, bringing inflation to heel after a large and rapid monetary expansion requires large reductions in growth for at least a few years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is the Cost of Delay?", "paragraphs": ["Spending cuts or tax increases large enough to address future fiscal imbalances will be painful, which may provide policymakers with incentive to delay attempts to address those imbalances. Delaying policy changes that address major fiscal imbalances has four major costs. First, as time passes, the opportunity to address generational imbalances by reducing the burden on younger cohorts by increasing taxes or lowering benefits of older cohorts, is lost. Not cutting benefits or increasing taxes for older cohorts now means imposing larger benefit cuts or tax increases on younger cohorts later. Second, gradual adjustments are less costly, because individuals have more time to adapt their consumption and retirement plans. Third, delaying reform measures increases the political risk associated with Social Security and Medicare. That is, delay increases the probability that retirees' incomes will be disrupted because of major financial problems in entitlement programs. Enacting reforms now reduces the chance that promised benefits will be cut in the future.", "Fourth, delay increases the average excess burden caused by federal taxes. Excess burden is the social cost of raising tax revenue minus the amount of taxes collected, and is a measure of economic distortions caused by taxes. To the extent that tax increases will be needed to reach fiscal sustainability, delaying tax increases means that the future tax increases will be higher than if those measures were enacted earlier. Having a period of low taxes followed by a period of high taxes imposes a greater burden on the economy than a tax at an intermediate level that raises the same amount of revenue. This is because marginal excess burden of taxes increases at an increasing rate with the tax rate. Marginal excess burden is the cost of economic distortions caused by raising an extra dollar of tax revenue. Maintaining a steady tax rate minimizes excess burden over time. Thus, delaying reform increases the overall cost of economic distortions caused by the tax system.", "In addition, having a period of low taxes followed by a period of high taxes will also have general equilibrium effects on asset markets, which will have significant distributional effects among different classes of taxpayers, as compared to a steady tax rate at an intermediate level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Short- and medium-term budgetary measures, such as the current-year estimates and CBO's 10-year forecasts, are not useful tools in understanding the nature and magnitude of the federal government's long-term financial imbalances, although they are essential tools for managing federal operations and for effective congressional oversight. Several measures of long-term financial fiscal stance developed in the recent past have become increasingly influential among budgeting experts, although so far they have had limited influence on wider public debates. Any single summary indicator of the federal budgetary situation provides too little information, so a combination of short- and long-term measures is needed to understand the federal government's fiscal stance.", "Recent estimates of future federal imbalances that were not constrained by CBO baseline assumptions and which were computed using different technical models, fall in a narrow range. Estimates of the 75-year imbalance run roughly from 7% to 8% of GDP, and estimates of the infinite horizon imbalance are around 10%. The similarity of these estimates does not imply a lack of substantial uncertainty about the exact size of long-run imbalances. That similarity does imply a consensus among analysts that these imbalances are not mere computational artefacts, but are real and, by historical standards, large.", "The International Monetary Fund, the Comptroller General, leading academics, and prominent policy analysts, among others, have stated that the U.S. government fiscal policy is proceeding on an unsustainable path. Other advanced countries such as Belgium, Italy, and Japan face fiscal problems which are even more severe than those of the United States. Many other major European countries are also running sizeable deficits and face severe demographic challenges. Citizens and policy makers in the United States and in these countries will face unpleasant choices, involving either sharp cuts in benefits or major tax increases. Wider use of long-term fiscal measures, along with more commonly used short- and medium-term measures, may help focus attention on these important issues.", "The federal government has run large deficits during major wars as well as during the Reagan Administration, and past generations of policy makers have managed to steer fiscal policy back towards a sustainable path. Debts accumulated during World War II were in large part paid off in the 1950s and 1960s. More recently, large Reagan-era deficits in the 1980s were eventually tamed during the 1990s through the discipline of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, PAYGO, and other budget processes. The 1983 Greenspan Commission introduced several important reforms which, if they did not fix Social Security's problems, at least extended its viable life by decades. Many analysts, however, conclude that financing the retirement and health care of the baby-boom generation presents financial challenges of a larger magnitude."], "subsections": []}]}}
