Since the mid-2010s, Congress also has directed the consideration of natural and nature-based features (NNBFs). Examples of potential NNBFs for reducing flood risk include wetlands; oyster, mussel, and coral reefs; and the combination of these natural features with hard components, such as rock and concrete. Various factors are shaping how USACE is incorporating NNBFs into its flood risk reduction projects and post-flood repair activities.", "NNBFs in Flood Risk Reduction Projects", "Congress specifically included NNBFs as a planning requirement for USACE flood risk reduction projects in 2016. In 2018, Congress required that USACE feasibility reports for flood risk reduction projects consider using traditional and natural infrastructure, alone or in conjunction with each other. In recent feasibility reports, USACE primarily has proposed using NNBFs (other than engineered dunes and beaches) in combination with traditional structural measures rather than having the NNBFs as the primary means for reducing flood risk. To be recommended for congressional construction authorization, a USACE flood risk reduction project generally must have national flood risk reduction benefits that exceed the project's costs.

Congress allowed for the program to fund nonstructural alternatives in lieu of USACE making repairs if a nonfederal entity requests and assumes responsibility for the nonstructural alternative. In 2016, Congress defined the program's nonstructural alternatives to include restoring and protecting natural resources (e.g., floodplains, wetlands, and coasts), if those alternatives reduce flood risk.

Following widespread flooding in the Midwest in 1993, many experts encouraged USACE, other agencies, and policy decisionmakers to support greater use of nonstructural approaches to mitigate flooding. In 1996, Congress amended USACE's authority to repair damage to certain nonfederal flood control works to allow use of nonstructural alternatives in lieu of repairs. In 2016, in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act; P.L. 114-322 ), Congress defined such nonstructural alternatives to the repair of nonfederal flood control works to include restoring and protecting natural resources (e.g., floodplains, wetlands, and coasts), if those alternatives reduce flood risk.", "Although nonstructural measures (including natural features as part of nonstructural measures) have been part of the discussion of and authorities for USACE flood risk reduction for decades, the focus on natural processes and use of terms such as NNBF or natural infrastructure are more recent developments.

For purposes of planning a USACE flood risk reduction project, an NNBF may be structural or nonstructural, depending on whether the NNBF affects the character of the flood. USACE considers most NNBFs to be structural measures because the NNBFs alter the flood hazard and are cost shared as structural measures (see \" Cost Sharing of USACE Flood Risk Reduction Measures \"). Nonstructural NNBFs could include the restoration or expansion of a floodplain through acquisition of structures and lands, especially when combined with an aquatic ecosystem restoration project.", "Engineered dunes and beaches also have a role in NNBF discussions. USACE considers engineered dunes and beaches as NNBFs. However, traditional engineered dunes and beaches and other types of NNBFs may not face the same challenges when it comes to being incorporated into USACE planning and construction as more novel NNBFs, such as living shorelines. USACE has more than half a century of involvement in constructing engineered dunes and beaches (sometimes referred to as dune-and-berm beach nourishment systems ) as components of coastal storm risk reduction projects. The agency has long-standing approaches for calculating the flood risk reduction benefits of engineered dunes and beaches, which is not the case for other NNBFs (see section entitled \" Evaluation of NNBFs' Benefits \"). In addition, unlike other NNBFs, engineered dunes and beaches often are not designed to rely primarily on natural processes (e.g., engineered dunes and beaches often require regular renourishment of sand to maintain storm damage reduction benefits). Additionally, while engineered dunes and beaches may support habitat for certain species, some researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential for environmental harm associated with some engineered dune and beach projects (see \" Incorporating More Natural Processes in Engineered Dunes and Beaches \" for further discussion).

This means that for an NNBF to be found economically justified as a stand-alone flood risk reduction feature, the NNBF's effect on economic benefits (which for flood risk reduction projects is principally quantified as reduced flood damages to structures) would have to be quantified and found to exceed the cost of the NNBF.

For nonstructural projects, if the nonfederal costs exceed 35%, the remainder of the costs are federal. Although Congress has established how costs of structural and nonstructural measures are to be shared, Congress has not enacted cost sharing that applies specifically to NNBFs. USACE considers most NNBFs to alter the flood hazard and treats those features as structural measures in its planning processes. Therefore, the cost-sharing requirements for structural measures apply to the use of most NNBFs, like those in the coastal storm risk reduction projects in Norfolk, VA, and East Rockaway Inlet to Rockaway Inlet and Jamaica Bay. Some stakeholders have expressed interest in having NNBFs be eligible for nonstructural cost sharing.

The P.L. 84-99 program does not fund repairs associated with regular operation, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation. As of 2018, around 1,200 nonfederal entities operating roughly 2,000 levee systems participate in the P.L. 84-99 program, and the nonfederal levees in the P.L. 84-99 program cumulatively span nearly 10,000 miles.

Most repairs would require few or no new LERRDs. Nonstructural alternatives may require significant new LERRD acquisition by the nonfederal sponsor. Also, if a nonstructural alternative is pursued, USACE will provide no further flood-related assistance anywhere within the formerly protected area, except for rescue operations, with some exceptions.

ER 500-1-1 includes nonstructural alternatives to repair, pursuant to the 1996 amendment to the repair authority, but, in practice, the P.L. 84-99 program appears to remain a \"repair-in-place\" program or for minor adjustments in levee alignments to avoid repeated erosive damage to a levee segment often referred to as scour . Repair-in-place planning often is more expeditious for USACE than the planning required for a nonstructural alternative. USACE does not appear to track the use of the nonstructural alternative authority within the P.L. 84-99 program. Selected uses of the nonstructural alternative authority include examples following the 1997 floods in California and the 2008 floods in the upper portion of the Mississippi River.

USACE does not consider levee setbacks as nonstructural alternatives. Because levee setbacks are considered as structural realignments for the repair of the damaged levee, the levee setbacks as part of the P.L. 84-99 program are designed for purposes of the levee's functioning and integrity (e.g., to decrease scour) rather than to enhance floodplain capacity or reduce peak flows. If a nonfederal entity pursues a nonstructural alternative, such as the acquisition of floodplain lands, the nonfederal sponsor also may choose to setback the levee. It appears that USACE would consider the setback of the levee not as part of the nonstructural alternative but as a complementary investment by the nonfederal entity.

Although USACE has not finalized the strategic research plan referenced by GAO, USACE has research activities directed toward improving understanding of NNBF performance, directly or indirectly. Several of these research programs are developing numerical and analytical tools that can estimate performance (e.g., reduced erosion, wave impacts, and flood/storm surge inundation) for NNBF so trade-offs can be estimated in the planning, design, and maintenance process in the future. In addition to USACE, other researchers are attempting to document NNBFs' flood risk reduction benefits, limitations, and costs. ", "Under the Administration's current guidance for the NNBF authority, the identification, evaluation, and justification of NNBF alternatives (other than engineered dunes and beaches) appears to remain a case-by-case process. Part of the challenge is how a feature's location may affect an NNBF's performance, which consequently may influence the NNBF's benefits and costs. Congress may consider how USACE's case-by-case approach to evaluating NNBFs may shape consideration and adoption of the features (e.g., adapting the NNBFs to local conditions) in a planning process that is constrained by time and funding. ", "Another challenge to valuing the flood risk reduction benefits of NNBFs may be NNBFs' dynamic nature as the result of their use of natural processes, as compared to traditional flood control structures. For example, NNBFs consisting of mangroves or other wetlands may shift their extent and location in response to changing conditions. Other NNBFs may change over time as the living components\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as vegetation or oyster reefs\u00e2\u0080\u0094mature or their area expands or contracts. Floods or storms may temporarily or permanently damage some NNBFs and lessen their role in reducing flood risks.", "USACE is participating in interagency and international efforts aiming to fill knowledge gaps and develop best practices and concepts for NNBFs and to understand their benefits and limitations. For example, USACE is leading an international effort to develop and publish international guidelines on NNBFs, as discussed in the box titled \"International and Interagency Efforts on Natural and Nature-Based Features.\" The extent to which the agency may be able to incorporate into its own planning some of the international guidance remains to be seen and may depend on the extent to which the guidance helps address questions of performance and economic benefits in various environmental and flood/storm conditions.

The question of whether to incorporate, in the planning process and related decisions, certain environmental and social benefits and costs of flood risk reduction measures is a recent development in a long-standing debate on federal water resource investments. ", "USACE has adapted its project planning process before to meet changes in the agency's authorities. In the late 1990s, following Congress's enactment of various authorities for USACE ecosystem restoration projects, the agency developed procedures to evaluate ecosystem restoration investments (see box titled \"Evaluation of an Ecosystem Restoration Project\"). Whether and to what extent consideration of environmental and social benefits and costs of NNBFs, or for flood risk reduction projects more broadly, may be considered in the USACE planning and decision process is unclear.", "In addition to the use of NNBFs as part of USACE flood risk reduction activities, the agency, through its regulatory program, has authorized a general permit for the use of one NNBF type\u00e2\u0080\u0094coastal living shorelines. The permitted activities are not performed or funded by USACE; they are performed by the entities that apply for the permit, such as a town or a landowner.

NNBFs classified as structural measures are cost shared differently than those classified as nonstructural measures. Some stakeholders have proposed that legislation require NNBFs to be cost shared as nonstructural measures regardless of the NNBFs' effect on the flood hazard. This would cap the nonfederal construction costs at 35% rather than up to 50% for structural measures, thereby shifting more of the NNBF costs to the federal government.", "Levee setbacks, although not generally categorized as NNBFs by USACE, illustrate some of the challenges for NNBFs that are classified as structural measures. Examples of USACE's use of setback levees as part of the agency's flood risk reduction projects remain limited. Many potential levee setback projects do not have a sufficient benefit-cost ratio to be an economically justified investment as a structural measure for flood risk reduction, in part because of the costs associated with the additional land and other real estate interests that would need to be acquired. Nonfederal project sponsors generally would be responsible for 100% of these LERRD costs.", "The designation of an NNBF as a structural measure could require the nonfederal sponsor to pay a greater share of the cost than if the NNBF were considered nonstructural (as shown in Table 1 ). Classification of an NNBF as a structural measure also results in a difference between the cost sharing for the NNBF and the cost sharing for nonstructural measures (e.g., elevating structure in the floodplain).

Traditional USACE engineered dunes and beaches may not face the same challenges of being incorporated into USACE planning and construction as other features that USACE classifies as NNBFs. Although traditional engineered dunes and beaches may have social benefits and provide habitats for some species, engineered dunes and beaches have been shown in some circumstances to have some negative effects. For example, the construction and replenishment of these features can disrupt existing biological communities, such as benthic, fish, and shorebird communities, at the project site and where the sand is sourced. The cumulative effect of the projects and resulting environmental changes remains poorly understood. USACE has taken some steps to address these effects (e.g., the agency considers the compatibility of some sand characteristics, and for some projects, it avoids nourishing during ecologically significant periods), but some suggest that engineered dunes and beaches could incorporate natural processes or elements with more environmental benefits. For example, some researchers have suggested leaving gaps in sand placement or nourishing smaller areas at a time to allow species to recolonize from the edges of the nourishment area. ", "Efforts to integrate resilience into approaches to flood risk reduction can raise questions about the role of traditional engineered dunes and beaches that rely heavily on regular renourishment through the engineered placement of sand on the beaches and dunes. NNBFs generally are intended to be developed by or to use natural processes. NNBFs are meant to be as self-sustaining as possible; that is, they are expected to recover, often without or with minimal human intervention, following a flood event. For example, natural dune and beach systems may experience large waves during storm events, which move sediment from the front of the beach (the foreshore) to the back of the beach system, effectively maintaining or raising the elevation behind the dune over time. The foreshore is built up by normal wave activity over time, thereby maintaining through natural processes the dune system, including its potential flood risk reduction benefits. Some dune and beach systems may recover quickly after a damaging storm; however, others may take decades to rebuild to previous heights and widths through natural processes. Conversely, engineered dunes are often built to not be overtopped and moved. Some engineered dunes also have cores or components that provide stability (e.g., synthetic membranes or clay) and may not allow for dune migration. To allow this natural movement to continue, some stakeholders have suggested that USACE consider constructing lower dunes and providing space behind dunes to accommodate sand movement. Other options may include designing dunes to be naturally shaped by the wind while decreasing overall sand loss by using features such as vegetation, screens made of natural materials, and variations in terrain elevation. Furthermore, dunes could be designed to specifically include habitat features, such as those that enable wetland development.", "Some stakeholders argue that USACE and its nonfederal partners could consider other ways to promote natural processes and their benefits into USACE coastal storm risk reduction projects, such as by allowing dune systems to spread out, limiting the raking or grading of incipient dunes, and restricting driving on the beach. These measures would allow dunes to widen or for additional dunes to form in front or behind the primary dune, providing some environmental and social benefits (e.g., greater protection for structures behind dunes and greater variety in available habitats) but could limit other social benefits (e.g., space for beach recreation).", "Although USACE has long-standing approaches for calculating the flood risk reduction benefits of engineered dunes and beaches, the agency's procedures for incorporating more natural processes and features (e.g., vegetation) into engineered dunes and beaches are being reconsidered in the context of the additional NNBF considerations. Incorporating more natural processes into engineered dunes and beaches may require additional efforts to secure the LERRDs for a dune that shifts. ", "Statute not only allows for federally cost-shared periodic nourishment of USACE-constructed dunes and beaches over 50 years but also provides for the possibility of extending renourishment for an additional 15 years. It is unclear if USACE's evaluations for extending a project's federally cost-shared renourishment timeframe consider the role of more natural processes and elements (e.g., vegetation) in future renourishments. It also remains unknown whether more natural processes would be considered a reformulation, requiring congressional authorization, rather than an administrative extension.

However, various challenges to the adoption of NNBFs as part of USACE projects remain.", "Among recently completed feasibility reports, USACE has recommended a few flood risk reduction projects that use NNBFs. Typically, the recommendation is to use the NNBFs in combination with structural measures if the combined alternative can be economically justified. ", "The limited use of NNBFs in USACE flood risk reduction activities to date is shaped by various factors ranging from what is known about NNBF performance to how NNBFs are evaluated. In some circumstances, NNBFs may not be able to provide levels of flood risk reduction similar to traditional structural and nonstructural measures. In other circumstances, NNBFs may be able to reduce flood risks, but the ability to quantify the effectiveness and reliability of NNBFs as flood risk reduction measures in different environmental conditions and for different flood and storm conditions remains limited. In circumstances where NNBFs may be effective alone or in combination with traditional flood risk reduction measures, they can provide a suite of environmental and social benefits. The extent to which USACE considers NNBFs' environmental and social benefits, as well as their flood risk reduction potential, in agency feasibility reports and their recommendations and in decisions on repairing damaged flood control works remains unclear.
