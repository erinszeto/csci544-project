In the nearly four years since 9/11 many experts agree the FBI has made progress in some areas (dissemination of raw intelligence), but some believe that the FBI has shown little progress in other areas (establishing an integrated and proactive intelligence program) while the FBI's budget increased by 68% from FY2000 to FY2005. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission has recommended, and the White House has approved, the establishment of a National Security Service within the FBI. This Service would integrate the FBI's Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence Divisions with the FBI's Directorate of Intelligence (DI). Whether this organizational change will yield substantive results is an open question.", "There are at least two schools of thought with respect to how the FBI has performed in implementing its intelligence reform initiatives. The \"optimists\" believe there is a critical synergy between the law enforcement and intelligence disciplines, and that the FBI has successfully made changes throughout its history to respond to the threats of the time. Since the FBI's vision for intelligence reform is sound, success is simply a matter of implementing that vision. Alternatively, the \"skeptics\" believe that law enforcement and intelligence are distinct disciplines demanding different skill sets to achieve different ends. They argue the FBI's vision is fundamentally unsound, and its ongoing implementation has not yielded an integrated intelligence program. According to this group, intelligence collection remains effectively separated from intelligence analysis at the FBI.", "This report analyzes the FBI's overall intelligence reform effort, focusing on the implementation of intelligence reform initiatives in the field. Reform policies designed at FBI Headquarters, with field input, may be of marginal utility unless they are fully and effectively implemented across the 56 FBI field offices. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) examined the FBI's reform initiatives with a focus on the implementation of the field intelligence group concept, at five field offices. Allowing for varying levels of progress across field offices, a central tenet of a high-order functioning intelligence organization is its ability to harness collection resources to nationally developed intelligence priorities and gaps. While areas of promise exist, field research indicates that the FBI's ability to formally harness intelligence collection (including systemic accountability mechanisms) to analytically identified intelligence gaps, remains nascent.", "In addition, this report discusses several overall options for Congress in addressing FBI intelligence reform. Organizationally and structurally, Congress could establish a stand-alone domestic intelligence agency. Alternatively, it could codify the recently announced National Security Service within the FBI. Potential areas are outlined for functional oversight, including the FBI-CIA relationship, and the FBI's efforts to stanch terrorism finance.

The report covers a number of issues of interest to Congress relating to how well the FBI is progressing with its reform efforts.

He will work for the Director of the FBI....He will have a relationship with the (Director of National Intelligence) because he will be the person the (Director of National Intelligence) will look to on budget issues.\" Another anonymous law enforcement official, citing the broad language in the White House memorandum reportedly stated, \"It says 'communicate with' not 'issues orders to'\" in describing the authority the DNI will exercise over the FBI's new intelligence chief.", "If the relationship between the DNI and the new FBI EAD for National Security approximates that described by Deputy DNI Hayden, it could represent a significant change from past practice, where the former Director of Central Intelligence largely deferred to the FBI director with respect to FBI intelligence operations.

It is more likely that the true meaning of \"procedures\" and DNI \"communication\" with FBI field offices will not be known in practice until months after the procedures are disseminated to the field, and the EAD for National Security or the Office of the DNI audits the procedures to monitor their implementation.

Although Bureau reforms are a work in progress, there are indications that the FBI may be falling short of this particular goal. For example, the 9/11 Commission noted that analysts continue to be assigned menial tasks, including covering phones at the reception desks and emptying the office trash bins. The WMD Commission in its 2005 report concluded that there is evidence of analysts' continuing subordinate role. CRS's recent field research largely confirmed those observations. Although the picture is mixed, and pockets of promise exist, CRS research indicated that FIG analysts often continue to lack the institutional standing and authority to direct special agents to collect needed intelligence. One senior FIG analyst said that the Bureau eventually would accomplish its goal of analytically driven intelligence collection, but cautioned that \"the FBI is still an investigations driven agency,\" where the Bureau's special agents, rather than its analysts, effectively determine what intelligence will be collected.

A central tenet of a high-order functioning intelligence organization is that it is able to harness its collection resources to nationally developed and coordinated intelligence priorities and gaps. The intelligence cycle is just that, a cycle, in which analysts and collectors interact regularly to incorporate new information and refine intelligence collection requirements; analysts and collectors are central to the cycle.", "The 9/11 Commission noted with concern that it found gaps between some of the announced reforms and the reality in the field.

Acceptance of the intelligence requirements process appears to be mixed. While pockets of promise exist, field research indicates that the FBI ' s ability to formally harness intelligence collection ( including systemic accountability mechanisms) to analytically identified intelligence gaps, remains nascent. Although some found the formal intelligence collection requirements document to be useful, the prevailing view was that special agents, rather than intelligence analysts, were best positioned to determine what intelligence needed to be collected. Referring to the new formal collection requirements, one federal official stated, \"We do it intuitively ... I know what the information requirements are.\" Another official said, \"If I have a piece of information, I'll find the requirements that it fits.\" The latter sentiment, could be a troubling indication that some agents continue to rely on reactively collecting intelligence in response to an event, than fit into an existing collection requirement.

According to the WMD Commission, \"... even now, only nine of the heads of the FBI's 56 field offices come from divisions other than the Criminal Division.\" While it is arguable how much national security expertise a senior level executive should have, in today's complex threat environment, leaders with an expertise in national security matters may prove the most useful.", "Supporters counter that Director Mueller has made it clear that his priorities are intelligence and terrorism prevention.

That is, for example, the consumers are accountable to those drafting collection requirements because their feedback and view of global threats feed directly into the establishment of additional, or refinement of existing, intelligence requirements.

First and foremost, will the creation of a new structure tangibly affect the cultural changes that, arguably, need to made at the FBI? For example, will the FIGs now become empowered and more capable of managing and directing intelligence activities in the field because they now have at least an indirect reporting chain to the DNI?

The sheer magnitude of intelligence analyst hiring, from 1,023 on-board in FY2001, to a requested level of 2,700 in FY2006 is of considerable concern given certain attrition factors and the apparent lack of well-developed internal training infrastructure to support such an increase.
