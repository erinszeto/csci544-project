Mississippi . The Brown case established the basis for the FourteenthAmendment \"voluntariness\" standard as the due process test for assessing the admissibility ofconfessions in State cases. Under this standard, the admissibility of a confession was evaluated ona case by case basis which would be governed by the \"totality of the circumstances,\" which includedthe facts of the case, the background of the accused, and the behavior of the police during theinterrogation.", "In Miranda v. Arizona , the Court established several procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment rights of persons during custodial interrogations. The Court reasoned that the suspectsneeded the safeguards because \"[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operatevery quickly to overbear the will of [the suspect...\" and without them no statement can be consideredthe product of his/her free will.", "Miranda was controversial among policy-makers and academics who debated its legitimacy and desirability over thirty years after its judicial creation. One of the major arguments offered foroverruling Miranda was that it had caused great difficulty to law enforcement efforts in controllingcrime. The ruling in Dickerson v. United States , 530 U.S. 428 (2000), struck down 18 U.S.C. 3501,a federal law that allowed confessions elicited without a police advisory to be used at trial as longas the \"totality of circumstances\" demonstrated that they were given voluntarily.", "Dickerson made Miranda 's constitutional status clear. The Miranda decisions announced duringthe Court's 2003-2004 term, however, suggest that continued vitality of seemingly confictingpre- Dickerson caselaw is less clear. United States v. Patane , divided the Court so that nosinglerationale united a majority of its members, although five Justices joined in a plurality decision thatdeclined to overrule its pre- Dickerson decisions concerning the admissibility of physical derivateevidence. On the other hand, Missouri v. Seibert likewise resulted in a plurality opinion, but in spiteof contrary suggestions in the pre- Dickerson caselaw five Justices found inadmissible a confessionintentionally wrung from the defendant before Miranda warnings and re-elicited thereafter. FiveJustices did agree in Yarborough v. Alvarado that the state courts did not unreasonably apply federallaw when -- without considering the inexperienced suspect's age (17 years old) -- they determinedthat Miranda 's custodial threshold had not been crossed.

(4) Nonetheless, the Bram \"voluntariness\" approach was affirmed in Zhang Sung Wan v.United States, (5) and it influenced the Court tostate the rule of exclusion more broadly, so that it wasnot merely a matter of whether the confession was reliable or whether a forbidden inducement hadbeen used, but rather whether the confession \"was in fact, voluntarily made.\" (6) According to thisdoctrine, confessions were admitted only if they had been given voluntarily; confessions wereexcluded if the suspect's will was subject to police duress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Due Process Prior to Miranda", "paragraphs": ["It was not until Brown v. Mississippi (7) that the Supreme Court applied the due process standardfor use of a confession in State criminal proceedings. Prior to that time, the Court had consistentlyheld that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to the states, and considered the admissibility ofincriminating statements in state proceedings as a issue of Fourteenth Amendment due processrelative to those standards regarding the conventional rule of evidence which prohibits involuntaryconfessions. (8) In Brown , three Blackdefendants were beaten by sheriff's deputies investigating themurder of a White male. The deputies hung one of the suspects from a tree, let him up and downseveral times and then beat him twice (while tied to a tree and subsequently on the roadside) untilhe confessed. (9) The deputies arrested the other twosuspects, stripped and placed them over chairs,and then beat both suspects with buckled leather straps until they confessed. (10) Since the FifthAmendment privilege was then not deemed applicable to the states, the Court struck down theconfessions based on the theory that interrogation is part of the process by which a state acquires aconviction and thus is subject to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment due processclause. (11) The Court unanimously reversed theconvictions of all three suspects, deciding that thepolice tactics violated the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. (12)", "Having established in Brown that due process was violated when a conviction rested exclusively upon a confession which was obtained in this manner, later cases made it clear that the admissionat trial of such a confession was unconstitutional. (13) In Brown , the Court held that although a Statemight be able to do away with the privilege against self incrimination completely, a State could notexact a confession by torture. (14) Subsequently,this was commonly referred to as the \"FourteenthAmendment due process voluntariness test\" requirement, and it was the standard used by the Courtin articulating the due process requisites for its admissibility. (15) Under this standard, the admissibilityof a confession was evaluated on a case by case basis according to the \"totality of thecircumstances,\" (16) surrounding each confession.", "Four years after Brown , the Court in Chambers v. Florida , (17) reversed a State conviction basedon confessions obtained after five days of interrogation, during which the suspects had no contactwith their friends, advisers or counselors. (18) TheCourt went further than Brown and held that evenwhere there was no physical violence, (19) continuous questioning and \"other ingenious forms ofentrapment of the helpless\" could constitute compulsion. (20) Justice Black noted that it has beensuggested that the use of these coercive tactics \"has lowered the esteem in which [the] administrationof justice is held by the public and has engendered an attitude of hostility to unwillingness tocooperate with the police....\" (21)", "Two years later, in Ward v. Texas , where the defendant, an Afro-American, under interrogation had been threatened with mob violence, taken by night and day to strange towns in several counties,incarcerated in several jails, and by persistent questioning, coerced to confess, the Supreme Courtagain ruled for reversal. (22) In these and othersimilar cases, (23) where the convictions werereversed,the Court indicated its concern for the integrity of the process used for extracting the confession andnoted that there was almost no evidence against the defendants. The Court therefore relied on theFourteenth Amendment to reverse the convictions of what it believed were innocent men. The Courtwas also protecting minorities from brutality which was being tolerated by the States. (24)", "Between the time of Brown v. Mississippi (25) and Miranda v. Arizona , (26) the due process standardwas applied in dozens of cases. During these years, the Court designated certain police practiceswhich weighed the \"totality of the circumstances\" against a finding of voluntariness andadmissibility--including physical force, threats of harm or punishment, lengthy periods of unlawfuldetention, solitary confinement, denial of food or sleep, and promises of leniency--and thereforewere constitutionally impermissible.

However, in Hamilton v. Alabama, (52) a 1961 capital case, the Court ruled that an indigent defendantwas entitled to appointed counsel at an arraignment where the Alabama law viewed certain defenses,such as insanity, which if not raised at that point as abandoned. Likewise, in White v. Maryland , (53) a 1963 decision reversing a murder conviction, the Sixth Amendment right was held to apply wherethe defendant was asked to enter only a non-binding plea at the preliminary hearing, but hisnon-binding plea of guilty, though later withdrawn, was still used against him at trial. Subsequentto the Hamilton v. Alabama and White v. Maryland decisions, which recognized the rightto counselin well defined situations in pretrial judicial proceedings at the State level, the Court took aconsiderable step by extending the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to solely non-judicial pretrialsituations.

The Court reversed Massiah's conviction on the ground that obtaining information from him in thismanner violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The central point behind the decision wasthat statements obtained by federal agents from an indicted defendant who has counsel are, as amatter of course, inadmissible against him if obtained without counsel present. (56) The decision issignificant inasmuch as it is the initial expansion of the right to counsel to police interrogations andinvestigations.", "In Escobedo v.

Inthe course of questioning, Escobedo's repeatedly requested to consult with his attorney, who hadcome to the police station but was barred from seeing him. After the police arranged a confrontationbetween DiGerlando and Escobedo, Escobedo incriminated himself in the killing which wasadmitted at his trial.

(92) The Court in rejecting thestrict application of the Miranda safeguards to bar newinterrogations, reviewed the circumstances leading to the incriminating statements to determine whena suspect waives his rights. (93) The Court \"...concluded that the admissibility of statements obtainedafter the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under Miranda on whether his 'rightto cut off questioning' was 'scrupulously honored.'\" (94) As for the application of the \"scrupulouslyhonored\" test, the majority concluded it was met on the facts of the case because \"... the police hereimmediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significantperiod of time and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogationto a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.\" (95) Hence, the Court appeared tomove towards a less rigid approach, permitting limited renewed interrogations rather than an allinclusive Miranda coverage.", "In 1977, the Court appeared to extend the Miranda rights in Brewer v. Williams . (96) In decidingthat the police violated the suspect's rights to counsel under Miranda , the Court stated that \"... courts[should] indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver....\" (97) The Court noted that \"... theright to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person isentitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiatedagainst him-'whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, orarraignment.'\" (98) Being aware that a warrant hadbeen issued for his arrest, he had been arraignedon that warrant before a judge, and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail, theCourt concluded \"[t]here can be no doubt in the present case that judicial proceedings had beeninitiated ....\" (99) The State has the burden ofproving that a suspect actually relinquished his rights,and not merely that he comprehended them. (100) Hence, the Court appeared to be giving expanded Miranda protection by making waiver of the right to counsel more difficult.", "In 1979, the Court appeared to change its position again in North Carolina v. Butler . (101) Ratherthan making waiver more difficult, the Court appeared to make it easier by allowing implicitwaivers. (102) Disregarding the rule that onlyexplicit waivers, either written or oral, are effective, theCourt placed emphasis on whether the accused waived his rights \"knowingly and voluntarily\" ratherthan the form of the accused's waiver. (103) Therefore, according to Butler , words and action may besufficient to waive a suspect's rights but the presumption by the courts must still be against waiver. (104) However, the Court ultimately decided that all the circumstances will be reviewed in order todetermine if the waiver was voluntary. (105)", "In 1981, the Court once more in Edwards v. Arizona , (106) redefined the requirements for aneffective waiver. The Arizona Supreme Court, in deciding the issue of voluntariness, applied thetotality of the circumstances test in finding that Edwards waived his rights when he voluntarily spokewith police after he had invoked his right to counsel during an interrogation the day before. (107) TheCourt reversed, holding \"... that an accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with police onlythrough counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been madeavailable to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges orconversations with the police.\" (108) The Courtfurther stated that police cannot \"... reinterrogate anaccused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel.\" (109) It would appear as if the \"clearlyasserted\" language was an indication that there will be a requirement for a clear and precisestatement in order to invoke the right to counsel, which has the effect of overruling the \"in anymanner\" guidelines in Miranda . It also reveals the significance that the Court attaches to protectingthe right to counsel by requiring more than an incognizant waiver of that right; \"... the accusedhimself [must] initiate[] further communication.\" (110) Opting for the stricter knowing and intelligentwaiver over the broader totality of circumstances test, the Court appeared to be seeking a way toaffirmatively protect the accused's right to have counsel during the interrogation. (111)", "In 1983, the Court had another opportunity to review the Edwards test in Oregon v. Bradshaw . (112) The Court agreed in Bradshaw that the admissibility of a confession given by adefendant who earlier invoked his Miranda right to counsel is to be determined by a two-part test. It first must be determined whether the defendant \"initiated\" further conversation as required by Edwards . (113) This means that theimpetus must come from the accused, and not the officers. (114) Underthis test, any previous police-initiated interrogation must have ended prior to the suspect's allegedinitial remarks, since he/she cannot \"initiate\" an ongoing interrogation. (115) Second, if it is found thatthe defendant \"initiated\" further conversation, it must then be determined if the accused waived hisright to counsel and silence, \"... that is, whether the purported waiver was knowing and intelligentand found to be so under the totality of the circumstances, including the necessary fact that theaccused, not the police, reopened the dialogue with the authorities.\" (116)", "In 1984, in Smith v. Illinois , (117) the Supreme Court was presented with its first opportunity toaddress an equivocal request for counsel. The Court noted that the issue was whether the accusedhad invoked his right to counsel so as to come within the Edwards test. (118) The Court recognized thethree approaches for determining the consequences of such ambiguities but declined to adopt one. (119) The Court stated that \"Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading upto the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.\" (120) Hence, there appears tobe the implication that only unambiguous requests will be sufficient for the recognition of the rightto counsel. (121) However, the Court did notanswer the question.", "In 1986, the Court in Michigan v. Jackson , (122) held that when the Sixth Amendment right tocounsel has attached, \"... if police initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion, at anarraignment or similar proceeding of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant's right tocounsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\" (123) The Court appeared to move toward alower limit for invoking the right to counsel. (124) The Court stressed the need for protecting asuspect's rights, stating that \"... we presume that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at everycritical stage of the prosecution.\" (125) TheCourt's opinion that \"... questions of waiver requires us togive a broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation to a defendant's request for counsel...\" (126) appearsto have been an additional indication of the Court's willingness to accept ambiguous requests forcounsel.", "In 1987, the Court in Connecticut v. Barrett , (127) acknowledged for the first time the issue of theambiguous request for counsel. (128) Though theConnecticut Supreme Court ruled that the ambiguousrequest for counsel amounted to an invocation to counsel for all purposes, the Supreme Courtconcluded otherwise stating: \"Barrett's limited requests for counsel ... were accompanied byaffirmative announcements of his willingness to speak with the authorities. The fact that officialstook the opportunity provided by Barrett to obtain an oral confession is quite consistent with theFifth Amendment. Miranda gives the defendant a right to choose between speech and silence, andBarrett chose to speak.\" (129) Inasmuch as Barrettrefused to provide a written statement but would talkto the police, the Court said he only invoked a limited right to counsel. (130) The Court further statedthat \"... Barrett made clear his intentions,\" he invoked his right to have counsel present during awritten statement, but waived his right to have counsel present while speaking with the authorities. (131)", "In 1988, the Court in Arizona v. Roberson , (132) provided what appears to be its current approachto the issue of ambiguous request for counsel. The holding in this case suggests that the approachtaken in Edwards v. Arizona (133) rather than Michigan v. Mosely (134) governs even when a subsequentinterrogation deals with a different and unrelated crime.

Mississippi , (139) the Court clarified the \"available to him\" language in Edwards which means \"... that when counsel is requested, interrogation must cease, and officialsmay not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present, whether or not the accused has consultedwith his attorney.\" (140)", "In 1994, the Court held in Davis v. United States , (141) that the privilege against furtherquestioning does not extend to a suspect whose request for counsel is ambiguous. (142)", "Before Davis , the Court had not decided what police officers should do when the initial request for an attorney is ambiguous. (143) The lowercourts developed and followed one of threeapproaches. (144) Regarding thethreshold-of-clarity standard, \"... an attempted invocation of the rightto counsel [would have to] satisfy a certain threshold of clarity before it [could] be consideredeffective.\" (145) The other standard, was the\" per se invocation standard.\" (146) Under this standard, eachpost-warning reference to an attorney by the suspect was considered a per se invocation of the rightto counsel, and any questioning initiated by the police had to cease. (147) The third approach was theclarification standard. (148) Here, the courtspermitted the police to pursue the interrogation for thepurpose of clarifying the accused's intent following an ambiguous invocation of the right tocounsel. (149)", "2. The Miranda Rules (Non-Constitutional Status).", "Although the Miranda rules appear to be inflexible and unyielding, neither the Court nor the lower courts appear to have applied a strict approach in their application. While compliance with Miranda is constitutionally required under all circumstances, the Court stated in Michigan v.Tucker (150) that:", "\"The [ Miranda decision] recognized that these procedural safeguards were not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were insteadmeasures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was protected. ... Thesuggested safeguards were not intended to 'create a constitutional straightjacket,' ... but rather toprovide practical reinforcement for the right against compulsory self-incrimination.\" (151)", "Miranda", "Tucker", "Miranda", " (152)", "Tucker", "Miranda", "Miranda", "In New York v. Quarles, (153) police officers were approached by a woman who informed themthat she had been raped by an armed man, who had gone into a nearby supermarket. The policelocated the suspect in the supermarket where they arrested him; a frisk uncovered an empty shoulderholster, and the arresting officer asked him, \"Where is the gun?\" The suspect gestured toward astack of soap cartons and said, \"The gun is over there,\" and the police found the revolver behind thecartons. The state courts excluded Quarles' response identifying the location of the gun he haddiscarded because he had not been given the Miranda warnings. (154) The Court reversed andconcluded that \"... on these facts there is a 'public safety' exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given ....\" (155) Similar to Michigan v. Tucker , the Court rejected the notion that the lackof Miranda warnings implied that a violation of the Fifth Amendment had occurred. (156) The Courtdescribed Miranda as a majority which was willing to impose procedural safeguards \"... when theprimary social cost of those added protections is the possibility of fewer convictions,\" which shouldbe distinguished from the Quarles case whereby the harm would be the incapability \"... to insure thatfurther danger to the public did not result from the concealment of the gun in a public area.\" (157) Thusthe Court concluded \"... that the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to thepublic safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment'sprivilege against self-incrimination.\" (158) Tohold otherwise, the Court in Quarles said police officerswould be \"... in the untenable position of having to consider, often in a matter of seconds, whetherit best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions without the Miranda warnings andrender whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible, or for them to give the warnings inorder to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroytheir ability to obtain that and neutralize the volatile situation confronting them.\" (159)", "In Oregon v. Elstad, (160) the Court rejected the narrow interpretation of the Tucker case and heldthat Tucker's \"... reasoning applies with equal force when the alleged 'fruit' of a noncoercive Miranda violation is neither a witness nor an article of evidence but the accused's own voluntarytestimony.\" (161) In arriving at this conclusion,the Court once more rejected the concept that aviolation of Miranda necessarily involves a violation of the Fifth Amendment. (162)", "As in Michigan v. Tucker, the Court in New York v. Quarles rejected the contention that theabsence of warnings implied that compulsion in violation of the Fifth Amendment had taken place. Hence, these cases suggest that circumstances may exist such as \"public safety\" which may justifyan exception or repudiation of the doctrinal basis of the Miranda decision.", "3. Pretrial Silence.", "In Harris v. New York , (163) the defendant upon direct examination denied having made thecharged sale of heroin to the undercover agent. He countered the officer's testimony as to the salewith testimony that he had sold the officer what appeared to be heroin, but the bags contained onlybaking powder. The prosecutor was allowed to impeach the defendant's credibility by referring toa statement made by him to the police which concededly made that statement inadmissible under Miranda . The Court held that the pretrial statements obtained in violation of Miranda canbe usedat trial for impeachment regardless of the contrary dictum in the Miranda case. (164) This raised theissue of whether a defendant's silence during custodial interrogation can be used for impeachmentpurposes, in view of the dictum in Miranda (165) advancing the concept that the prosecution cannot usethis silence at trial.", "In Doyle v. Ohio , (166) the Court held that impeachment by the defendant's post-arrest silence afterhe had received the Miranda warnings was impermissible. The Court said not only is \"... everypost-arrest silence ... insolubly ambiguous because [it] ... may be nothing more than the arrestee'sexercise of [his/her] Miranda rights,\" (167) but also, use of the silence to impeach \"... would befundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process....\" considering the fact that the warnings carrythe implicit \"... assurance that silence will carry no penalty ....\" (168)", "The Court distinguished Doyle v. Ohio in three subsequent cases. In Anderson v. Charles , (169) the Court allowed impeachment by prior inconsistent statements which were given after the Miranda warnings. The Court said, Doyle bars the use against a criminal defendant of his silence after receiptof governmental assurances that he will suffer no adverse consequences of any sort for remainingsilent. (170) However, \"... Doyle doesnot apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into priorinconsistent statements.\" (171) This \"questioning[process] makes no unfair use of silence, because adefendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving Miranda warnings has not been induced to remainsilent.\" (172)", "In Jenkins v. Anderson , (173) where at his murder trial, the defendant claimed self defense, theCourt decided that it was permissible to impeach that story by the defendant's prearrest silence innot reporting the murder to the police for at least two weeks. Likewise, in Fletcher v. Weir , (174) theCourt followed the rationale of Jenkins and made a distinction between Doyle in allowingimpeachment by the use of post-arrest silence which was not proceeded by Miranda warnings,reasoning that this was not \"... a case where the government had induced silence by implicitlyassuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\" (175) In effect, the Court heldthat the silence of a suspect in custody prior to his receipt of Miranda warnings can be admitted forimpeachment based upon the following reasoning:", "\"The significant difference between the present case and Doyle is that the record does not indicate that respondent Weir received any Miranda warningsduring the period in which he remained silent immediately after hisarrest....

(185)", "[The Miranda ] decision was an abrupt departure from precedent extending back at least to the earliest days of the Republic. Up to the time of the renditionof this 5-to-4 opinion, the \"totality of circumstances\" had been the test in our State and Federalcourts in determining the admissibility of incriminating statements.... Mr. Justice White's dissent...demonstrates beyond question that ... warnings as to constitutional rights were not required by theConstitution, and that the sole test of admissibility should be \"totality of circumstances\" as bearingon voluntariness. (186)", "The committee is of the view that the [proposed] legislation ... would be an effective way of protecting the rights of the individual and would promoteefficient enforcement of our criminal laws. By the express provisions the proposed legislation thetrial judge must take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances in determining the issueof voluntariness, including specifically enumerated factors which historically enter into such adetermination. Whether or not the arrested person was informed of or knew his rights beforequestioning is but one of the factors. (187)", "The committee is aware that a few have expressed the view that legislation by Congress restoring the voluntariness test to the admissibility of confessionsand incriminating statements would be declared unconstitutional, on the ground that the provisionsdo not measure up to the rigid standards set forth in Miranda. The committee is also aware that theopinions of the four dissenting Justices clearly indicate that neither of them would consider theseprovisions unconstitutional. (188)", "The committee feels that it is obvious from the opinion of Justice Harlan and other dissenting Justices... that the overwhelming weight of judicial opinionin this country is that the voluntariness test does not offend the Constitution or deprive a defendantof any constitutional right. No one can predict with any assurance what the Supreme Court mightat some future date decide if these provisions are enacted. The committee has concluded that thisapproach to the balancing of the rights of society and the rights of the individual served us well overthe years, that it is constitutional and that Congress should adopt it, After all, the Miranda decisionitself was by a bare majority of one, and with increasing frequency the Supreme Court has reverseditself. The committee feels that by the time the issue of constitutionality would reach the SupremeCourt, the probability rather is that this legislation would beupheld.

Instead, Congress provided for a six-hourperiod in which the confession must be made or given following the arrest or other detention.

(191) It should also be noted that whenCongress enacted the statute, it did not intend for every confession made after the six-hour periodto be inadmissible.

In the 2-1 ruling, the paneldecided that the statute superseded the landmark ruling in Miranda. The Fourth Circuit identifiedthe principal issue as whether the Miranda warnings are required by the Fifth Amendment. If theyare not according to the panel, they would be more like Federal Rules of Evidence or \"prophylactic\"warnings which are not protected by the Constitution for which Congress can modify or eliminateas it sees fit.

(219) As a result, the practice raised theissue of whether the rule established in Oregon v.Elstad, (220) that a suspect who has onceresponded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is notthereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite Miranda warnings, is abrogated when the initial failure to give the Miranda warnings wasintentional?", "Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, in a plurality opinion, concluded that, the postwarning statements were not admissible. The test used by the plurality waswhether the intervening Miranda warnings, when considered in conjunction with the police officer'sprewarning questions and the admissions already made by the defendant, were effective in advisingthe suspect regarding her postwarning rights.", "In applying this test, the plurality focused on the defendant's position and emphasized several of the most excessive events during the \"two-step interrogation\": the interrogation took place in thestation house; the questioning was \"systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill\";the prewarning interrogation caused the suspect in a substantial manner to incriminate herself; andthe interrogating police officer did nothing to remedy the defendant's likely misimpression that herprewarning statements would be used against her. These facts, said the plurality, served todistinguish this case from Oregon v. Elstad . (221)", "The plurality held that their approach was not an application of the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine.

If the deliberate two-stepstrategy has been used, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarningstatements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statementis made. Curative measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect'ssituation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver.\" (226) In other words, the Court left thedoor open for police to use some confessions obtainedafter double interviews by proving the interrogation was not done \"... in a calculated way toundermine the Miranda warning.\" (227)", "Justice O'Connor, with whom Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices Scalia, and Thomas joined dissenting, agreed with the plurality in two areas: the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does notapply; and the subjective intent of the interrogating officer cannot be easily determined and may bemore complicated in other situations which are likely to occur and therefore should be irrelevant. (228) This would make it difficult for lower courts to determine if officers had gone too far. Future courtsdeciding on admissibility of such statements, she wrote, \"... will be forced to conduct the kind ofdifficult, state-of-mind inquiry that we normally take pains to avoid.\" (229) As opposed to the testadopted by the plurality, the dissent would adopt a different test. If the prewarning admissions wereinvoluntary, the postwarning admissions should only be excluded under two circumstances: (a)following Elstad, if the first statement is shown to have been involuntary \" the court mustexaminewhether the taint dissipated through the passing of time or a change in circumstances\" and (b) if thepostwarning statements were involuntary despite the Miranda warnings.

The Court considered the issue of whether the failure to properly Mirandizethe defendant requires the suppression of the physical evidence which was obtained as a result of theinadmissible, though uncoerced, questioning. The 10th Circuit ruled in Patane's favor, concludingthat the confiscated gun could not be used as evidence in court. The 10th Circuit based its decisionon the landmark 2000 Supreme Court ruling in Dickerson v.

(235) Because the failure toprovide Miranda warnings is not itself a constitutionalviolation, there is no justification for fashioning a \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine in thiscontext in order to deter a non-Mirandized questioning. (236)", "Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment, opined that the practical justifications for admitting the physical evidence in this case were stronger than thejustifications for admission in prior cases in which the Court had permitted the admission ofevidence obtained during an unwarned interrogation. However, unlike the plurality, Justice Kennedyfound it \"unnecessary to decide whether the detective's failure to give [the defendant] the full Miranda warnings should be characterized as a violation of the Miranda rule itself, orwhether thereis '[any]thing to deter' so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial.\" (237)", "Dissenting, Justice Souter writing for Justices Stevens and Ginsburg described as \"beside the point\" the majority's denial that the Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause addresses theadmissibility of nontestimonial evidence. (238) The real issue, Justice Souter wrote, is whether a \"fruitof the poisonous tree\" doctrine should be applied lest we create an incentive for the police to omit Miranda warnings.

During this time, Comstock questioned Michael about the night of September22, 1995, which left Francisco Castaneda dead from a bullet wound. Comstock never told Michaelthat he was under arrest and did not give him Miranda warnings explaining his 5thAmendmentprivileges against self-incrimination. Nor was Michael given a statement to sign indicating that hewas voluntarily participating in the interview.", "When Michael first explained his version of the events of the night in question, he did not mention the shooting or his role in hiding the gun. When Comstock \"expressed disbelief\" atMichael's story and told him she had witnesses who had said \"quite the opposite,\" Michael startedrelaying details of the shooting and the hiding of the gun. It was only after Michael began divulgingthis information that Detective Comstock informed him he would be free to go home after theinterview.", "Michael eventually explained the events that took place after midnight on September 22. He, Paul Soto and some others went to a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. There, they sawCastaneda's truck and attempted to steal it. Soto went to the driver's side of the truck while Michaelapproached the passenger's side and Soto fired a shot killing Castaneda.", "Two months later, Detective Comstock again called Maria Alvarado at work, this time to inform her that Michael had been charged with second-degree murder and attempted robbery.", "Before trial, Alvarado moved to have the court exclude from trial the statements he made to Detective Comstock because his parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Theprosecution stated that Miranda warnings were not required because Alvarado was not \"in custody\"during the interview. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, held that because Alvarado was a juvenilewho had never been arrested and had no prior experience with law enforcement officials, andbecause his parents brought him to the sheriff's station and were not allowed to be present duringthe interrogation, Alvarado was objectively \"in custody\" when he was questioned. The court did notbelieve that \"a reasonable 17-year-old in Alvarado's position would have felt free to terminate theinterview and leave, and ruled that the improper admission of Michael's incriminating statementsby the state court had a substantial and injurious affect on the subsequent jury verdict. (243)", "The Court upheld the police interrogation by a vote of 5-4, in deciding that the California courts had considered the proper factors in reaching its conclusion that Michael Alvarado was not incustody for Miranda purposes during his police interview.", "Since the case was in the context of a federal habeas corpus petition, the issue was not directly whether Michael Alvarado was in custody or not but whether the state court's decision that he wasnot was \"unreasonable.\" The majority, in considering all of the facts, believed that it was notunreasonable for the courts to conclude that he was not in custody: The police did not transport himto the station, require him to appear at a particular time, threaten him or suggest he would be placedunder arrest; Alvarado's parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that theinterview would be brief; police appealed to Alvarado's interest in telling the truth and being helpfulto a police officer; police twice asked Alvarado if he wanted to take a break; and, at the end of theinterview, he went home. (244)", "Although the Court concluded that the state failed to consider Alvarado's age and inexperience in deciding that the interview was not custodial, that in itself, it said, would not make the state'sdecision unreasonable. (245)", "The dissent, written by Justice Breyer, concluded that Alvarado was clearly \"in custody\" when the police questioned him and therefore entitled to Miranda warnings. Justice Breyer posed thefollowing question and facts: \"what reasonable person in the circumstances-brought to a policestation by his parent at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid twohours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a seriouscrime, could have thought to himself, 'well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walkout?'\" (246)", "In Fellers v. United States , (247) the Supreme Court was contending with standards governing theadmissibility of statements that emerge from two different constitutional protections: (1) a \"custodialinterrogation\" standard applicable to Fifth Amendment self-incrimination cases (the typical Miranda situation and (2) the Sixth Amendment right to counsel standard which is used to determine theadmissibility of statements made in the absence of counsel or a waiver of counsel. The Court heldthat officers who went to the home of an indicted defendant to execute an arrest warrant violated hisright to counsel by discussing the charge against him in the absence of his counsel. The petitioner,Fellers, was arrested at his home on an arrest warrant following a federal indictment. He madeincriminating statements before being advised of his rights, in response to comments by the policeofficers that he had been indicted and they were there to discuss both the amphetamine indictmentin which he was charged and his association with other suspects. He was later Mirandized at thepolice station and reiterated his admissions. The Eighth Circuit, while acknowledging that thedefendant's incriminating statements made in response to questioning at the time of the arrest mustbe suppressed, held that subsequent confirming statements, made after the defendant received Miranda warnings at the police station, did not have to be suppressed. ", "The Eighth Circuit concluded that even though the defendant, \"responded by stating that he had associated with the named persons and that he used amphetamine,\" the police conduct did notamount to \"a post-indictment interview\" with the defendant (in violation of his Sixth Amendmentright to counsel) and that the second Mirandized statement, reiterating these inculpatory admissions,was voluntary.", "The issues presented to the Supreme Court were: (a) did the Eighth Circuit err when it concluded that Feller's Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Massiah v. United States (248) was notviolated because he was not interrogated by government agents when the proper standard underSupreme Court precedent is whether the government agents deliberately elicited information fromhim, or must a formal \"interrogation\" take place in order to establish the right to counsel; and (b)should the second statements, preceded by Miranda warnings, have been suppressed as fruits of anillegal post-indictment interview without the presence of counsel.", "Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Sandra O'Connor said the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the absence of an \"interrogation\" foreclosed petitioner's claim that hisjailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from him at hishome. (249) Under the Sixth Amendment,\"deliberate elicitation\" is the proper standard, not whetherthere was \"interrogation.\" (250) Here, the officersdeliberately elicited a response by Fellers after hehad been indicted, outside of his counsel's presence, and without any waiver of his SixthAmendment rights. (251) This violates Massiah v. United States . (252) Asa result, the correct exclusionaryrule analysis is under Massiah, and not Miranda . (253) The difference between Massiah and Oregonv. Elstad (254) appears to be that while Elstad would permit statements that are knowing and voluntary,even if they are poisonous fruits of any earlier Miranda violation, the Court has yet to allow Elstad to be applied under the same circumstances to a Massiah infraction or breach. The Eighth Circuitwas directed to consider the issue of whether the Sixth Amendment's exclusionary rule allows anexception similar to the Fifth Amendment's exclusionary rule recognized in Oregon v. Elstad . (255) The Court's decision also upholds the rule that law enforcement officers' contact with a defendantwho has been formally charged outside of his counsel's presence does not have to rise to the levelof a formal \"interrogation\" for the contact to violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.", "Regarding the second issue of whether the second statement, preceded by Miranda warnings should have been suppressed as fruits of an illegal post-indictment interview without the presenceof counsel, the Court said the Court of Appeals should address this issue on remand, considering theruling that the first questioning was unconstitutional. (256) The Court appears to recognize that indictedindividuals have special rights but chose not to decide how far those rights extend."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Since the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination did not apply to the states until1964, (257) its relevance to the admissibility ofpretrial statements was limited to federal proceedings. In the earliest cases, beginning in the late nineteenth century, issues of admissibility were decidedon the basis of the rule excluding involuntary confessions. During the early 1940s to the late 1950s,these issues were viewed in terms of an exclusionary rule that the Court created to enforce therequirements of federal statutory law that the accused be brought promptly before a magistrate.", "The inapplicability of the Fifth Amendment to the states prior to 1964 did not mean that the interrogation process was free of federal judicial scrutiny. Those coercive practices that wereconsidered extreme were held to be inadmissible pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment due processclause. The germinal case, Brown v. Mississippi , in which the Court overturned a murder convictionbased upon a confession that had been obtained through torture (hanging and whipping) wasconsidered a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.", "In the area of police procedures, two decisions had a very close and significant relationship to the Miranda decision ( Massiah v. United States and Escobedo v. Illinois ). The Massiah decisionwas notable for the extension of the right to counsel to police interrogation. The Escobedo case,while grounded upon the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, spoke without reservation of \"the rightof the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self-incrimination.\"", "Two of the most famous elements of Miranda are the Court's creation of a per se right toconsult with counsel during interrogation, and its creation of a per se right to be informed that theprivilege applies at the police station. The third most famous element of Miranda is the Court'sdetermination that \"prophylactic\" rules are necessary to reduce the inherent coercion which isprevalent in a majority of the custodial interrogations.", "Since the Miranda decision set forth the right to counsel in 1966, the Court had not defined with sufficient clarity what was required in order to invoke the right to counsel. The lower courtshave adopted one of three approaches: the threshold-of-clarity standard, the \" per se invocationstandard,\" and the clarification standard. (258) When the Court addressed the issue in Davis v. UnitedStates , many observers were surprised when it chose the clarification standard which allowed thepolice to ignore an ambiguous request for counsel and continue their interrogation.", "Section 3501 of 18 U.S.C. was enacted as a result of the congressional reaction to Miranda . The legislation was designed to overrule Miranda and certain other decisions that were perceivedto be detrimental to law enforcement.", "The Court's decision in Michigan v. Tucker appeared to declare that the Miranda safeguardsare no longer viewed as rights protected by the Constitution; they were considered as Court imposedprocedural rules. In view of the Court's decisions in Dickerson v. United States , which held that Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively nor may\"strategists\" drain the substance out of the warnings by training instructors, (259) the Miranda warningsappeared to be stronger than at any time in their controversial history. However, considering thedecisions in the four cases (Seibert, Patane, Fellers, and Alvarado) which were decided during the2003-2004 term of the Court (with two favoring law enforcement and the other two placingadditional restrictions on the police), it is difficult to determine what the current limits are withregards to the guarantees under the Miranda decision."], "subsections": []}]}}
