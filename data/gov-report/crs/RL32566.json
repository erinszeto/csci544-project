The Customs functions administered by DHS, inconjunction with the U.S. Coast Guard, are expected to effectively secure all commercial trafficentering the nation's ports. The Directorate also assumes responsibility for inspecting andmonitoring plants and animals entering the United States to minimize the risk that noxious pests anddiseases will be introduced into the country.", "The activities for which BTS has assumed responsibility are organized into three bureaus: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP); the Bureau of Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE); and the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). The inspection and borderpatrol functions of legacy Customs, INS, and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),were merged into CBP. The investigative and interior enforcement functions of legacy Customs andINS were merged within ICE. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), the Federal Law EnforcementTraining Center (FLETC), and the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) were also included underBTS by the Homeland Security Act. Subsequently, the Federal Air Marshals have been transferredfrom TSA to ICE; the US-VISIT program has been transferred from ICE to be managed at the BTSdirectorate level; and ODP has been reconfigured and renamed the Office of State and LocalGovernment Coordination and Preparedness (OSLGCP) and is managed at the DHS level.

While the transfer of functional lines of authority andthe personnel to carry out those functions was relatively straightforward, problems arose with initialattempts to ascertain the exact amount of appropriated funds actually transferred. Comparisons ofresponsibilities and analyses of requests for increased budget authority proved difficult to develop. This was due to the fact that functions now performed by DHS were previously performed bypredecessor agencies which often had somewhat different purposes than homeland security. Thefunding lines between FY2003 and FY2004 were not identical to lines of functional responsibilitybefore and after transfer, a problem made more difficult because the basic documentation ofappropriations in the President's FY2004 Budget was prepared after the formation of DHS but beforefinal enactment of appropriations for the remainder of FY2003. However, with the completion ofappropriations for FY2004, a baseline has been established, making future appropriations decisionsmore easily compared to the previous year's levels.

On the other hand, this functionalgrouping does include the activities of the Coast Guard, a separate agency in DHS which is not partof the Directorate for Border and Transportation Security, but which has an essential role inproviding \"border and transportation security\" as those words are commonly understood.

The term \"in-bond\" is used to describe shipments which are being provisionally admittedinto the United States under CBP supervision without having to immediately pay the dutiesassociated with the shipment (the shipments are not entered into the commerce of the United States). The shipment must be destined for storage in a bonded warehouse or for transshipment. Duties onin-bond shipments are collected when the merchandise is withdrawn from the bonded warehouse(entered into the commerce of the United States). The importer or the broker must put up a customsbond to cover the amount of duty that will eventually be due on the shipment.

", "Targeting and Risk Assessment. CBP uses a risk assessment tool, the Automated Targeting System(ATS) to focus inspections on high-risk shipments.ATS automatically sorts shipments according to risk based on specific weighted rule sets, andassigns each shipment a risk score. The higher the score, the more attention a shipment requires, andthe greater the chance it will be targeted for inspection. As noted above in note (a) to Table 5 ,boththe House and Senate indicated full funding for the National Targeting Center and the ATS; thoughthere is an apparent discrepancy as to how that requested amount is scored. While many observersnote the importance of developing sophisticated targeting mechanisms others have raised concerns,including GAO which recently noted that while CBP's targeting strategy incorporated some elementsof risk management, it lacked a comprehensive set of criticality, vulnerability and risk assessments,and does not follow certain recognized modeling practices.

The conference report, H.Rept. 108-774 , provides$145 million for inspection and detection technology investments, of which $50 million is forradiation detection technology, and up to an additional $30 million shall be available for eitherradiation detection technology or NII. The House report had recommended an additional $50 millionabove the request ($100 million total increase) for additional detection and inspection equipment,noting the need for an additional 1,000 RPMs, and that the request included funding for existingsystems, but not for replacement or acquisition of additional systems. The Senate initially provided$50 million for the \"purchase and deployment of radiation detection equipment\" (9) , but during floordebate on H.R. 4567 , adopted an amendment providing an additional $50 million forradiation detection technology.", "The House report also indicated its support for the Immigration Security Initiative (ISI) and provided an additional $3 million above the request for the program. The conferees provide anadditional $2 million for ISI. The ISI is, according to comments by CBP Commissioner Bonner,intended to be a CSI for people. The program builds off the legacy Immigration and NaturalizationService program which stationed immigration control officers abroad, and will station small teamsof CBP officers at the world's largest airports to target and intercept high-risk and inadmissabletravelers from continuing on to the United States. Like the CSI program, ISI officers will have nolegal authority in host countries, but will work in an advisory capacity with host country authorities.", "Finally, the conferees note that DHS should work with the Department of Defense to allow the New Mexico National Guard to continue preforming vehicle and cargo inspections in support ofCBP and ICE missions, and that CBP should submit a report no later than March 1, 2005 on whatactions are planned.", "Commercial Entry and Trade Enforcement.

The House report voices concern over the continued high level of illegal immigration within the USBP's Tucson sector and stronglysupports the Arizona Border Control (ABC) initiative, an administrative initiative aimed atconcentrating more USBP resources along the Arizona border. However, the committee expressesdisappointment at the apparent lack of progress in ABC's implementation. The committee believesABC will reduce the Arizona border's vulnerability, stop the violence associated with humantraffickers, limit the cost and danger to area residents, and ameliorate the risk of serious injury or lossof life faced by aliens due the inhospitable terrain. In addition, the House Committee report requiresCBP to conduct a study of locations for permanent checkpoints within the Tucson sector. Additionally, the committee includes restrictions that tactical checkpoints must be relocated at leastan average of once every 14 days, and that funds may not be used for the construction of permanentcheckpoints in the Tucson Sector. Lastly, the House Committee directs CBP to submit a detailedstaffing plan that includes staffing by position at each port of entry, USBP station, or other borderlocation.

A study done by DOJ's Inspector General foundthat almost 94% of those detained with final orders of removal were deported while only 11% ofthose not detained who were issued final orders of removals left the country. (15) Concerns have beenraised that decisions on which aliens to release and when to release the aliens may be based on theamount of detention space, not on the merits of individual cases, and that the amount of space mayvary by area of the country leading to the disparate application of policies in different geographicareas. (16)", "Likewise, the overall increase in the number of noncitizens in DHS detention has raised questions about the cost of detaining noncitizens, and whether ICE is using their resources in themost efficient manner. For FY2004, DHS budgeted $80 a day for each detainee held in detention. (17) This cost does not include transportation or the cost of deporting the alien.

The confereesprovide $45 million in addition to the $250 million statutory allocation of the ASCF. However, dueto budgetary constraints the House Committee notes that the federal government cannot provide a90% federal share to the eight LOI airports; as such the committee waives language in section 605of the Vision 100 Act ( P.L.108-176 ) that distributes the ASCF by formula. The conferees fund theLOI commitment at a 75% federal share.", "Air Cargo Security. Both the House and Senate Committee reports recommended additional funding for air cargo security. The Senate Committeerecommended $13 million over the budget request, while the House Committee recommended $10.4million above the budget request. Both the House and Senate noted that $10 million of theirrespective additional funding is provided for TSA to hire 100 additional air cargo inspectors. TheSenate Committee recommended that the remaining $3 million in additional funding to expand thenumber of explosives detection canine teams, while the House Committee's additional $400,000would have been spent on continuing TSA's participation in the C-TPAT program. The SenateCommittee also recommended some additional funding for developing technologies to secure aircargo within the \"Research and Development\" account. The conferees provide a total of $115million for air cargo of which $40 million is for 100 additional inspectors and enforcement activities,and $75 million for research and development of technologies to more effectively detect air cargothreats.", "The Senate Committee also recommended continued funding for maintaining the \"knownshipper\" database, which centralizes data provided by known shippers and indirect air carriers inorder to immediately verify the status of a specific shipper, and encourages TSA to continuecoordinating this program with CBP's C-TPAT program to develop the ability to better targetdomestic air cargo for inspection. The House Committee notes that it is encouraged by TSA's workto develop ETD system protocols to inspect air cargo on passenger and cargo aircraft, and directsTSA to issue the protocols as soon as possible. The House Committee also would have continuedand modified section 513 of P.L. 108-90 , requiring the Secretary to research, develop, and procurecertified systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. Until these systems aredeveloped, the House Committee directs TSA to enhance the known shipper program to prohibithigh-risk cargo from being loaded on passenger planes. Additionally, the language added to section513 requires the TSA to, at a minimum, double the percentage of air cargo currently being screened. The conferees direct TSA to work more aggressively to strengthen air cargo security by: strengthening the known shipper program to include regular checks; working with indirect carriersto ensure their compliance with security directives; and validating indirect carriers' security measureswhere the carriers consolidate freight and transport it to passenger and all cargo aircraft.", "Transportation Worker Identification Card. The conferees decreased funding for this program because of delays in prototyping and evaluatingcredentials. TSA is directed to report back to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriationsabout the results of the prototyping before moving into the next phase. The conferees provide $15million for the program ($5 million in direct appropriations, and $10 million offset through fees). Both the House and Senate Committees supported this program and recommended additionalfunding over the President's request. The House Committee recommended $15 million above thePresident's request of $50 million and would have directed $15 million of the total to developingand installing necessary hardware and software at the sites that produce and personalize the ID cards. TSA is directed, as specified in FY2004, to develop a centralized personalization system that usesan existing government card production facility. The House committee expected the remaining $50million which is appropriated to be offset during the fiscal year through the fees people will pay forapplying for an ID card. The Senate Committee recommended $55 million for infrastructureinvestments and for implementation of this program for targeted high-risk populations oftransportation workers.", "Rail Security. The conferees provide $12 million for rail security under TSA to support the deployment of 100 federal rail compliance inspectors andincludes $2 million for the deployment of explosive detection teams. The conferees also provide$150 million through the Office of State and Local Government Preparedness' Urban Area SecurityInitiative for rail security grants; Science and Technology Directorate for research and design of railsecurity requirements; and Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection to improve railcorridor security. The conferees also direct TSA to implement projects that demonstrate and advancenew train control technology.", "Both the Senate and House Committees recommended additional funding over the President's budget request for rail security. The Senate Committee recommended $15 million, $10 million ofwhich is to be spent on deploying 100 Federal compliance inspectors for mass transit and passengerrail to conduct on-site inspections in order to ensure compliance with minimum standards andrecently issued security directives. The remaining $5 million is would have been provided for thedeployment of canine explosives detection teams. The House Committee recommended $11 millionfor rail security within TSA and would have added $100 million through the Urban Area SecurityInitiatives grant program. The House report also recommended an additional $12 million for railsecurity available through the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. TheHouse Committee voices concern about the vulnerability of the rail and transit systems and directsTSA to work with other agencies such as the Office for State and Local Government Coordinationto develop a comprehensive rail and transit security program. The Committee requires TSA tosubmit a report by March 1, 2005 on this effort which will identify possible research and designrequirements that could enhance nationwide rail security. The House Committee would haverequired TSA to spend $1 million on a prototype program to perform risk assessments on domesticfreight cargo; the remaining $10 million will be spent to accelerate the testing and evaluation oftechnologies that will permit the TSA and transit operators to better screen rail passengers andbaggage. ", "Other Reports/Directions. In addition to the above mentioned reports, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees request the following reports. The House Committee requests TSA to provide a report on the merits and results of various pilotprograms underway which are testing remote off-site baggage screening systems, noting that it isencouraged by TSA's interest in developing efficient baggage screening pilot programs. The HouseCommittee also directs TSA to work with the Federal Aviation Administration to evaluate whetherrequiring passenger aircraft to incorporate deployable flight incident recorders would improvesecurity analysis in aviation accidents. The House Committee requires TSA to submit a report byJanuary 31, 2005 that contains plans for developing and implementing uniform screening standardsfor vetting airport workers with access to secure areas; presents an assessment of availabletechnologies that may be applied to securing airport perimeters; and develops and implements astandardized approach to conducting airport vulnerability assessments and compliance inspections.

The Deepwater program is a planned 22-year, multibillion-dollar project to replace or modernize 93 aging Coast Guard ships and207 aging Coast Guard aircraft. The Deepwater program presents several potential issues forCongress.", "One potential issue concerns the mission requirements to be met by the program, which were established in the late 1990s and reflect a pre-9/11 understanding of the Coast Guard's future missionrequirements. A 2004 RAND Corporation report on the Deepwater program states that the baselineDeepwater program \"will not provide the USCG with adequate assets and capabilities to fulfilldemands for traditional missions and emerging responsibilities. To satisfy these demands, the USCGwill need the capabilities of twice the number of cutters and 50% more air vehicles than it has beenplanning to acquire over the next two decades.\" The Coast Guard is reassessing the program'smission requirements to take post-9/11 mission demands into account. Coast Guard officials havestated that existing deepwater-capable assets are wearing out more quickly than anticipated,suggesting that new assets might need to be procured sooner than planned.", "The Senate Committee report fully funds the Deepwater program. The House Committee is \"deeply concerned\" about the direction and focus of the Deepwater program, given the number ofstudies that have concluded that massive changes to the program are necessary and the fact that onlya few aspects of the initial system concept are still intact. The House Committee has thereforeincluded bill language requiring the Coast Guard to re-baseline the program and submit its findingsas part of the President's FY2006 budget. The FY2006 budget submission should include specificacquisition timetables for all previously identified assets the Coast Guard believes are still necessaryand a time-line for all new assets needed to fulfil homeland security functions or multi-agencyprocurements. All funding levels in the submission must be identified by fiscal year. The confereesadopt this House report language. Additionally, the House Committee recommends less than therequested sum for Maritime Patrol Aircraft due to questions about whether the aircraft meet the airintercept and rapid cargo lift and deployment capabilities required by the revised Deepwaterproposal. Until the ongoing evaluations of these aircraft are completed and clearly identify whichaircraft the Coast Guard will need in the future, the committee cannot fully support the budgetrequest. ", "Legacy and Replacement Assets. Both the Senate and House Committee reports voice concern over the condition of Coast Guard legacy assets. TheSenate cites a Governmental Accountability Office report which notes that Coast Guard assets arebeing used 40% more than originally anticipated when the Deepwater program was conceived,resulting in an accelerated deterioration. The Senate report notes that the Coast Guard is expendingmore Deepwater funding on maintaining legacy assets and less on acquiring replacement assets. TheSenate Committee directs the Coast Guard to submit a report on its increased operationalrequirements post 9/11 and the impact that this is having on its legacy asset inventory by March 1,2005. The report is expected to include the costs associated with sustaining each legacy asset anda timetable of all Deepwater replacement assets. The House Committee, conversely, is concernedthat the Coast Guard is having problems maintaining its legacy assets due to a perceived need toexpend all available funding on Deepwater procurement. The House Committee requires the CoastGuard to report, within 30 days of enactment of the Appropriations Act, its plans for maintenanceof all legacy vessels and aircraft, including the entity responsible for the maintenance and theestimated costs. Further, the Coast Guard is directed to submit quarterly reports on its legacymaintenance plan beginning with the submission of the President's FY2006 budget. The confereesadopt this House Committee report language.", "Automatic Identification System. A potential issue for Congress concerns the Automatic Identification System (AIS) -- a vessel-tracking system thatthe Coast Guard wants to implement as a key part of its strategy for achieving maritime domainawareness (MDA). AIS is a system that will identify the ship, its size, and its cargo before it entersan American seaport. Questions include the availability of a radio frequency needed for AIS andwhether the system as currently planned will adequately cover all categories of ships that might posea threat to U.S. homeland security. Both the House and the Senate conference reports voice supportfor the AIS program. The House committee is concerned that by the end of FY2004 only nineseaports will be able to receive AIS signals from entering vessels and disappointed that only $5million was requested for this program even though a national plan to outfit the 55 largest seaportswith this technology is scheduled to be completed by the end of the calendar year. The HouseCommittee is therefore providing $24 million to fund this effort in FY2005. The conferenceprovides $24 million for AIS.", "Non-Homeland Security Missions. A key potential issue is whether the Coast Guard's resources are sufficient to adequately perform both its homelandand non-homeland security missions. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, increased CoastGuard requirements for homeland-security missions without obviously reducing requirements forother missions. After September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard significantly increased homelandsecurity operations while reducing operations in other missions. GAO, in reports and testimony onthis topic, have noted reduced number of Coast Guard operating hours devoted to non-homelandsecurity missions, and have expressed concerns regarding the Coast Guard's ability to linkapplication of resources to performance levels achieved for various missions.", "The House and Senate reports support many non-homeland security Coast Guard initiatives. The House Committee has included an extra $13 million for the Coast Guard to hire additional staffto ensure that it is in compliance with the U.S. Code [Title 14 sec. 676 (b)] watch standards at theirSearch and Rescue Command Centers. According to the code, individuals on duty are not allowed,except in emergencies, to work more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period, but staffing studies haveshown the Coast Guard is unable to meet the standard at all facilities at all times. The SenateCommittee encourages the Coast Guard to continue its cooperative programs in the Marine Vesseland Cold Water Safety Education area which provides education and outreach on maritime safetyto fishermen and children.

The Ballast Water Program aims to prevent the introduction of alien nuisance species into American waters from the ballasttanks of foreign ships. Both the House and Senate reports support this program. The SenateCommittee fully funds the request in order to assist the Coast Guard in transitioning the programfrom a voluntary to a mandatory enforcement policy. The House Committee also fully funds therequest and notes that because invasive species spread readily once they have entered U.S. water thisprogram is of critical importance to all states with water resources regardless of their proximity tocommercial ports.", "The committee believes that there is a void in the CG's medium to short range aerial surveillance assets which limits the CG's ability to cost-effectively perform its homeland securityrelated aerial surveillance missions. The committee directs the Coast Guard to procure, test, andevaluate aircraft that can perform MDA missions. ", "Icebreakers. The House Committee is very supportiveof Coast Guard efforts to renegotiate the memorandum of understanding with the National ScienceFoundation (NSF) regarding the costs each agency shares for icebreaking, especially in the Antarcticregion. The House Committee continues to believe that the NSF is not adequately reimbursing theCoast Guard for its icebreaking services in support of scientific research and notes that the currentfleet of icebreakers is approaching the end of their service life. The House Committee directs theCoast Guard to evaluate and determine the present and future needs for polar icebreakers. The CoastGuard should consider all appropriate national defense, homeland security, scientific, economic, andenvironmental interests of the United States. The review should be completed and reported to theHouse Committee by March 1, 2005. ", "The Senate directs the Coast Guard to enter into an agreement with the national Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the role Coast Guard icebreakers play in supportingUS operations in the Antarctic and Arctic. The study should include different scenarios forcontinuing operations including the replacement of current assets and alternative methods that donot involve the Coast Guard. The study should also address possible changes in icebreakingmissions due to environmental change. The study should be submitted to the Senate Committee bySeptember 30, 2005. The conferees adopt this report language.", "Other Reports. In addition to the reports requested above the House and Senate Appropriations Committees request the Coast Guard to submit thefollowing reports. The House Committee is concerned that the Coast Guard has not presented areport with the staffing and resource implications of the February, 2004 decision to move to a sectorcommand structure. They direct the Commandant to submit such a report no less than 30 days priorto restructuring, including before and after staffing levels, sector organizational structures, sectorchains of command, and sector infrastructure and other issues that may require additional resourcesto implement. The conferees adopt this House report language and requirements concerning thesector commands. The House Committee also directs the Coast Guard to submit a report on thefeasibility, practicality, and cost-effectiveness of establishing a permanent West Coast helicoptersquadron by October 1, 2004. Lastly, the House Committee fully funds the budget request toaggressively implement the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. The committee isconcerned, however, that the Coast Guard plans to rely on foreign governments to review foreignvessel security plans, especially in light of the fact that some of these plans may not even betranslated into English. The committee directs the Coast Guard to review all vessel security plansand report their findings by October 15, 2004. The conferees express similar concerns, and directthe Coast Guard to use the Port State Control Programs to ensure that foreign vessel security plansare adhered to and in place. The conferees direct the Coast Guard to report no later than March 1,2005, on the progress of the foreign vessel security oversight process including required resources.", "The Senate Committee voiced concern that, based on quarterly reports, Coast Guard hoursdedicated to non-homeland security missions remain significantly below pre 9/11 levels. Thecommittee does note, however, that in most cases the Coast Guard continues to meet or exceed itsperformance goals in these operational areas. The committee directs the Coast Guard to submit areport on plans to develop a system that can provide accurate representations of the costs necessaryto meet performance goals.

The U.S. border security system should be expanded and integrated into a larger network of screeningpoints. This network should include the transportation system and access to vital facilities such asnuclear reactors. DHS should design this comprehensive screening system and set common standardsthat can be applied system wide. Additionally, DHS should complete its implementation of abiometric entry/exit screening system as quickly as possible and expand the screening of passengersand baggage for explosives.
