Some of the mortgages that Fannie and Freddie purchase must meet certain affordable housing goals. Despite the explicit denial in their charters of any federal backing, for many years, it has widely been believed that there is an implicit federal guarantee backing the GSEs. Because the guarantee is not explicit, it has been unclear exactly what actions the government might take to relieve financial stress on the GSEs and in many ways it is similar to the implicit guarantee behind financial entities that are \"too big to fail.\" Nevertheless, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA; P.L. 110-289 \u00a71117) temporarily authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase securities from the GSEs \"in such amounts as the Secretary may determine.\" This implicit guarantee has allowed the two GSEs to borrow money from institutional investors at interest rates lower than other companies may pay; these rates are slightly higher than the Treasury pays.", "In September 2008, as a result of losses and insufficient capital reserves, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed with their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to go into conservatorship with the goal of returning the GSEs to financial health.

To date, however, Congress has not explicitly made the FOIA applicable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, as private companies, nor has there been a judicial decision applying FOIA to either of these publicly traded, shareholder-owned companies. FOIA applies only to agencies in the executive branch of the federal government. FOIA defines \"agency\" to include \"any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\"", "Determining whether an entity is an \"agency\" for purposes of FOIA has involved the courts in \"comparing the powers and characteristics of the disputed entity with the statute and other agencies in lieu of adopting a standard test.\" Under the case law applicable in the District of Columbia federal circuit, an array of factors are considered including \"[t]he performance of governmental functions by the entity, the presence of substantial government control over the entity's day-to-day operations, [the] authority of the entity to make and implement decisions, the nature of the government's financial involvement with the entity, the existence of a federal charter, and the status of the entity's employees.\" As an \"independent regulatory agency,\" FHFA must comply with FOIA. Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are regulated by FHFA and, since September 2008, have been under an FHFA conservatorship, it appears that they are not directly subject to FOIA. ", "Since the two housing GSEs were placed in conservatorship in 2008, there has been one federal court case involving a FOIA request for their records. In it, the plaintiff, Judicial Watch, Inc., sought access to campaign contribution records which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had created prior to the conservatorship. On May 29, 2009, Judicial Watch filed the FOIA request with FHFA, which, on July 1, 2009, declined to provide the requested documents on the grounds that the two housing GSEs were private companies and that their records were not FHFA records because the FHFA had never looked at them. The court upheld the FHFA's argument, viewing the case to involve \"the central issue ... [of] whether the requested documents are 'agency records' within the meaning of the FOIA.\" It found that they were not \"agency records\" by relying on a test derived from a Supreme Court case as interpreted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. ", "Under the Supreme Court test, two factors are relevant: whether the agency has obtained the records in question and whether that agency has control of the records. The district court found that although the FHFA had obtained the records of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae as their conservator and, thus, succeeding to title to the records, it did not have control of the records as required by FOIA. The appellate court upheld the district court on this issue. To determine whether FHFA had control of the documents, both courts applied a four-part test derived from an earlier case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that records held by researchers commissioned by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to do research were \"agency\" records because the \"NCI ordered creation of the materials, ... [planned] to take physical possession of [them] ..., indicated it will disclose the information ...[,] prohibited ... independent disclosures, and ... read and relied significantly on the information in writing articles and developing agency policies.\" The crucial requirement was that \"[a]gencies must use or rely on the document[s] to perform agency business, and integrate it into their files, before it may be deemed an 'agency record.'\" Applying this test to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac campaign contribution records, the district court found that although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac voluntarily agreed to the conservatorship and, thus, to FHFA's taking control of their records, and although FHFA has \"virtually unrestricted ... use of the records,\" \"the records ... are not relevant to the supervisory mission of the FHFA and ..., for that reason, no agency employees have read or relied on the requested records\" and \"the FHFA ... plans to return the records to the Enterprises once the conservatorship ends....\" For the appellate court, because the FHFA did not use the records, access to them would in no way further the objectives of the FOIA: ", "[t]he public cannot learn anything about an agency decisionmaking from a document the agency neither created nor consulted, and requiring disclosure under these circumstances would do nothing to further the FOIA's purpose of 'open[ing] agency action to the light of public scrutiny.... Satisfying curiosity about the internal decisions of private companies is not the aim of FOIA, and there is no question that disclosure of the requested records would reveal nothing about decisionmaking at the FHFA.\"", "There appears to be an analogy between the facts of this case and cases involving FOIA requests for documents held by failed banks under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receivership. The language concerning the FHFA's acquisition of rights to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by virtue of being appointed conservator parallels that respecting FDIC's appointment as receiver or conservator of a failed insured depository institution. Just as the FHFA, as conservator, succeeded to the title of the records of the two housing GSEs, the FDIC, as conservator or receiver of a failed bank, succeeds to the title of its records. Examination of FOIA cases with respect to a FDIC receivership or conservatorship, however, reveals no case in which the FDIC claimed that the requested records were not \"agency\" records. Because the FDIC generally uses conservatorship infrequently and then only on a temporary basis before determining how to resolve a failed institution, no FOIA case involving a FDIC conservatorship was discovered. Most of the receivership cases, moreover, involved records prepared by the failed institution for the FDIC or records which the FDIC, itself, had created in its handling of claims against the failed institution. The one case that was slightly different involved a request for information relating to a real estate development project of a subsidiary of a bank being operated by the FDIC as its receiver. Rather than claiming that the documents did not qualify as \"agency records,\" the FDIC chose to defend its refusal to release the documents by claiming that the FDIC was under no obligation to disclose them because they were exempt from disclosure as \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\" under FOIA's Exemption 4.

FHFA reported that it employed the equivalent of 1.6 \"full-time FOIA staff,\" and incurred $200,000 in FOIA processing costs and $20,000 in litigation costs in FY2010. For FY2009, FHFA reported receiving 118 requests, and processing 116.

Some FOIA exemptions, notably Exemption 4 for \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information,\" likely would apply to possible records requests to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. As in the case of costs, examining FHFA's annual FOIA reports may provide some insight into what exemptions may apply to FOIA requests filed with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac if H.R. 463 were enacted. In FY2010, for example, out of the 109 total requests processed by FHFA, the agency applied 36 exemptions to withhold certain information or records from release.
