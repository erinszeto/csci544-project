In general, this law extends health insurance coverage to many currently uninsured Americans. It also has provisions to reduce expenditures, increase care coordination, encourage more use of health prevention, and improve quality of care. PPACA will reform the private health insurance market, impose a mandate for most legal U.S. residents to obtain health insurance, establish health insurance \"Exchanges\" that will subsidize health insurance coverage for eligible individuals; expand Medicaid eligibility; address healthcare workforce issues; and implement a number of other Medicaid and Medicare program and federal tax code changes. Key Medicaid and CHIP provisions in PPACA are summarized below.", "E ligibility-related reforms. PPACA will require states to expand Medicaid to certain individuals who are under age 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). This reform not only expands eligibility to a group who is not currently eligible for Medicaid (low income childless adults), but also raises Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups from 100% to 133% of the FPL. M aintenance of effort provisions . PPACA will require states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP coverage levels\u2014through 2013 for adults and 2019 for children. O utreach and enrollment provisions. PPACA includes provisions to encourage states to improve outreach, streamline enrollment, and coordinate with the proposed American Health Benefit Exchanges (Exchange). B enefit reforms . PPACA will add new mandatory and optional benefits to Medicaid. Such mandatory benefits include premium assistance for employer-sponsored health insurance, coverage of free-standing birth clinics, and tobacco cessation services for pregnant woman. The law also authorizes states to offer new optional benefits such as preventive services for adults, health homes for persons with chronic conditions, and additional options for states to expand home- and community-based services as an alternative to institutional care. F inancing reforms . PPACA introduces measures to reduce the growth of Medicaid expenditures and increases federal matching payments for the eligibility expansions. C ost control reforms . Some of the PPACA's cost control measures include (1) proposed reductions in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, (2) expenditure reductions for prescription drugs, and (3) payment reforms to reduce inappropriate hospital expenditures for health care-acquired conditions. P rogram integrity reforms. PPACA creates enforcement and monitoring tools and imposes new data reporting and oversight requirements on states and providers. States will also be required to implement initiatives used by the Medicare program, such as a national correct coding initiative and a recovery audit contract program for their Medicaid programs. N ursing home accountability . PPACA adds a number of requirements to improve the transparency of information within facilities and chains, as well as provides long-term care (LTC) consumers with information on the quality and performance of nursing homes. D emonstrations, pilot programs, and grants. PPACA will provide the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) and state Medicaid and CHIP programs with opportunities to test models for improving the delivery, quality, and payment of services. CHI P - related provisions . PPACA requires states to maintain the current CHIP structure through FY2019, but does not provide federal CHIP appropriations beyond FY2013. M iscellaneous Medicaid and CHIP reforms. PPACA adds several offices within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to better coordinate care across the Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP programs. One of these offices will be dedicated to improving coordination for beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). Another will add a Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center to develop and test new payment and service delivery models to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP expenditures, while preserving and enhancing quality of care for beneficiaries.

Additional guidelines specify how states should calculate these amounts. The specific income and asset limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through a combination of federal parameters and state definitions. Consequently, these standards vary across states, and different standards apply to different population groups within states. Of the approximately 50 different eligibility \"pathways\" into Medicaid, some are mandatory while others may be covered at state option.", "The federal government's share of Medicaid costs is determined by a formula in statute. This formula, referred to as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita income relative to the national average (and vice versa). FMAPs have a statutory minimum of 50% and a maximum of 83%, although some Medicaid services receive a higher federal match rate. In February 2009, with the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), states received temporary enhanced FMAP rates for nine fiscal quarters beginning with the first quarter of FY2009 and running through the first quarter of FY2011 (December 31, 2010).

MGI is defined as gross income decreased by trade and business deductions, losses from sale of property, and alimony payments, but including tax-exempt interest and income earned in the territories and by U.S. citizens or residents living abroad.
