Three would have affected the availability of funds for certain purposes that were provided by H.R. 240 , as well as in any other act in any fiscal year (these appeared as Sections 579, 580, and 581 in the House-passed bill).

This amendment went on to state that the prohibition would extend to future similar policies, expressed that such policies would have no legal effect and that no funds may be used to grant any federal benefit to any alien as a result of those policies. The second of these three was an amendment to prohibit any federal funds from being used to consider new, renewal, or previously denied applications for temporary relief for removal under the deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) program. The third amendment would have required, through a restriction on the use of funds, that DHS treat aliens convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, sexual abuse, child molestation, or child molestation as being among the group of aliens that are the highest priority for deportation.", "After adopting these five amendments, the bill passed the House on January 14, 2015, by a vote of 236-191.
