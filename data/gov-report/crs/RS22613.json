It might do nothing, allowing the 35 legislative days to pass. By its inaction, Congress would allow the outcome of the referendum to take effect. It could pass legislation waiving the 35 legislative days review period, thus expediting the effective date of the charter amendment. Congress passed such a waiver in 2000, after voters approved, by referendum, an amendment to the home rule charter governing the composition of the Board of Education. It could use the appropriations process to demonstrate its opposition to measures approved by the city council and the citizens of the District if it were unable to pass a resolution of disapproval during the 35-day congressional review period.
