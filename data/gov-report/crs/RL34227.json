Both bills, which would establish U.S. farm policy for 2008 through 2012, contain a trade title (Title III) that authorizes and amends U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agricultural export programs and U.S. international food aid programs.

Both bills modify the export credit guarantee programs to make them compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules limiting export subsidies. Both bills also provide increased funding for export market promotion and for addressing sanitary and phytosanitary (food safety) barriers to U.S. agricultural exports.

If these forecasts hold, the U.S. agricultural trade balance in FY2008 would be $15.5 billion. Since FY1991, high value exports (intermediate products such as wheat flour, feedstuffs, and vegetable oils or consumer-ready products such as fruits, nuts, meats, and processed foods) have outpaced such bulk commodity exports as grains, oilseeds, and cotton. In FY2008, high value agricultural exports are forecast to account for 60% of the value of total agricultural exports. Much of the growth in U.S. agricultural exports in 2007 and 2008 is expected to come from strong demand for bulk commodities such as wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, and cotton.", "Agricultural exports are important both to farmers and to the U.S. economy. Production from almost a third of U.S. cropland moves into export channels, according to USDA. USDA estimates that from 21% to 23% of U.S. agricultural production (crops and livestock) is exported. Exports account for almost half of wheat production, more than one-third of soybeans, and a fifth of corn. The share of exports of specialty crops such as almonds is 70%, while for other specialty crops such as walnuts or grapefruit, the export share is as high as 40%. Export share of livestock products is lower than for crops, as most meat and dairy products are consumed domestically. U.S. agricultural exports generate employment, income, and purchasing power in both the farm and nonfarm sectors. According to USDA, each $1 received from agricultural exports stimulates another $1.64 in supporting activities to produce those exports. Recent data show that agricultural exports generate an estimated 806,000 full-time civilian jobs, including 455,000 jobs in the non-farm sector.", "Many variables interact to determine the level of U.S. agricultural exports: income, population growth, and tastes and preferences in foreign markets; U.S. and foreign supply and prices; and foreign import barriers and exchange rates. U.S. domestic farm policies that affect price and supply, and trade agreements with other countries, also influence the level of U.S. agricultural exports. While many of these factors are beyond the scope of congressional action, farm bills have typically included a trade title (Title III in the 2002 farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002) that authorizes programs that guarantee the private financing of U.S. agricultural exports, subsidize agricultural exports, promote U.S. farm products in overseas markets, or address foreign trade barriers.

The effectiveness of EEP also has been an issue. Several studies of the use of EEP found that wheat exports would have declined if EEP were eliminated, suggesting that the EEP program increased wheat exports. Other analysts, however, found that subsidizing wheat exports under EEP resulted in displacing exports of unsubsidized grains.
