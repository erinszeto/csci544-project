U.S. policymakers have emphasized different strategic interests in the region at different times, from combating Soviet influence during the Cold War to promoting democracy and open markets since the 1990s.

That would have been $617 million, or 36%, less than the $1.7 billion of U.S. assistance the region received in FY2017. The proposal would have cut funding for nearly every type of assistance and would have reduced aid for every Latin American and Caribbean nation. The Trump Administration also proposed the elimination of the Inter-American Foundation, a small, independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that promotes grassroots development in the region.", "The Administration's efforts to scale back U.S. assistance could have significant implications for U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Faced with potential cuts, U.S. agencies could accelerate efforts to transition countries in the region away from traditional development assistance and toward other forms of bilateral engagement. Reductions in State Department-managed security assistance could lead to the Department of Defense taking on a larger role in U.S. security cooperation. Moreover, reductions in foreign aid, combined with other policy shifts, could contribute to a relative decline in U.S. influence in the region.", "Legislative Developments", "On March 23, 2018, nearly six months after the start of FY2018, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).

Some countries receive the full range of U.S. assistance as they struggle with political, socioeconomic, and security challenges.

Between 1946 and 2016, the United States provided the region with nearly $86 billion ($176 billion in constant 2016 dollars) of assistance. U.S. assistance to the region spiked in the early 1960s following the introduction of President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, an antipoverty initiative that sought to counter Soviet and Cuban influence in the aftermath of Fidel Castro's 1959 seizure of power in Cuba. After a period of decline, U.S. assistance to the region increased again following the 1979 assumption of power by the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, the United States provided considerable support to Central American governments battling leftist insurgencies to prevent potential Soviet allies from establishing political or military footholds in the region. U.S. aid flows declined in the mid-1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Central American conflicts (see Figure 2 ).", "U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean began to increase once again in the late 1990s and remained on a generally upward trajectory through the past decade. The higher levels of assistance were partially the result of increased spending on humanitarian and development assistance. In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the United States provided extensive humanitarian and reconstruction aid to several countries in Central America. The establishment of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in 2003 and the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2004 provided a number of countries in the region with new sources of U.S. assistance. The United States also provided significant assistance to Haiti in the aftermath of a massive earthquake in 2010.", "Increased funding for counternarcotics and security programs also contributed to the rise in U.S. assistance through 2010. Beginning with President Bill Clinton and the 106 th Congress in FY2000, successive Administrations and Congresses provided substantial amounts of foreign aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors to combat drug trafficking in the region and end Colombia's long-running internal armed conflict. Spending received another boost in FY2008 when President George W. Bush joined with his Mexican counterpart to announce the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a package of U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance for Mexico and Central America. In FY2010, Congress and the Obama Administration split the Central American portion of the M\u00e9rida Initiative into a separate Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and created a similar program for the countries of the Caribbean known as the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).", "After more than a decade of generally increasing aid levels, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean began to decline in FY2011. Although the decline was partially the result of reductions in the overall U.S. foreign assistance budget, it also reflected changes in the region. As a result of stronger economic growth and the implementation of more effective social policies, the percentage of people living in poverty in Latin America fell from 46% in 2002 to 31% in 2016. Likewise, democracy has spread and taken hold throughout the region, despite some recent setbacks. Some nations, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay, are now in a position to provide technical assistance to other countries in the region. Other nations, such as Bolivia and Ecuador, have expelled U.S. personnel and opposed U.S. assistance projects, leading to the closure of USAID offices.

As nations have achieved more advanced levels of development, the U.S. government has reduced the amount of assistance it provides to them while attempting to sustain long-standing relationships through other forms of engagement. Budget cuts often have accelerated this process by forcing U.S. agencies to refocus their assistance efforts on fewer countries. In the mid-1990s, for example, budget constraints compelled USAID to close its field offices in Argentina, Belize, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. Similarly, budget cuts in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 U.S. recession contributed to USAID's decision to close its field offices in Guyana and Panama.", "The Trump Administration's desire to reduce foreign assistance funding could contribute to a new round of aid transitions. The FY2018 budget request would have zeroed out traditional development assistance for Brazil, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Paraguay and would have reduced it significantly for several other countries in the region. Although many of those assistance cuts were not enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, it appears as though the Administration may push for further cuts in the coming years. The Administration's National Security Strategy, released in December 2017, asserts that the United States \"will shift away from a reliance on assistance based on grants to approaches that attract private capital and catalyze private sector activity.\" Likewise, the Administration's FY2019 budget request includes many of the same cuts that were proposed in FY2018.", "Some development experts caution that such transitions should be done in a strategic manner to ensure that partner countries are able to sustain the progress that has been made with past U.S. investments and to prevent ruptures in bilateral relations that could be exploited by competing powers and/or compromise U.S. interests. These experts argue that successful transitions require careful planning and close coordination across the U.S. government, as well as with partner-country governments, local stakeholders, and other international donors. In their view, a timeline of three to five years, at a minimum, is necessary for the transition process.", "A decision to no longer appropriate new foreign aid funds for a given country would not necessarily lead to an abrupt end to ongoing U.S. assistance programs. In recent years, Congress has appropriated most aid for Latin America and the Caribbean through foreign assistance accounts that provide the State Department and USAID with up to two fiscal years to obligate the funds and an additional four years to expend them. As a result, U.S. agencies often have a pipeline of previously appropriated funds available to be expended on assistance programs.", "If aid transitions do occur, the United States could remain engaged with its partners in the region in several ways. As large-scale development programs are closed out, the U.S. government could use smaller, more nimble programs, such as those managed by the IAF, to maintain its presence in remote areas and continue to build relationships with local leaders. As grant assistance is withdrawn, the U.S. government could help partner countries mobilize private capital by entering into trade and investment agreements or by providing loan guarantees and technical assistance through agencies such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. As former aid recipients look to share their development expertise with other nations, the U.S. government could enter into trilateral cooperation initiatives to jointly fund and implement programs in third countries that remain priorities for U.S. assistance.

The Administration asserted that \"loans provide an opportunity for the U.S. government to both promote U.S. industry and build key partners' defense capabilities while minimizing the burden on U.S. taxpayers.\" Some analysts disagreed; they argued that converting FMF assistance from grants to loans would damage U.S. relations with foreign militaries and hinder partner countries' efforts to build and sustain the capabilities needed to contribute to U.S. and global security. For example, some argued that the discontinuation of FMF grants to Colombia would affect the country's ability to maintain its helicopter fleet, which is used to combat organized crime in remote areas.

For example, 10 U.S.C. 333 authorizes DOD, with the concurrence of the State Department, to train and equip foreign security forces for counterterrorism operations, counter-weapons of mass destruction operations, counter-illicit drugs operations, counter-transnational organized crime operations, and maritime and border security operations, among other purposes.", "Given the number of security challenges the United States faces around the globe, however, it is unclear whether DOD would devote increased funding to security cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean. DOD currently does not publish information on the total amount of funding it has allocated, or intends to allocate, to security cooperation activities in the region. Looking only at counternarcotics support, DOD's preliminary estimates indicate that total assistance for the region will fall slightly from $198.8 million in FY2017 to $194.6 million in FY2018.", "As a result of a provision (10 U.S.C. 381) enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017 ( P.L. 114-328 ), DOD is required to submit formal, consolidated budget requests for security cooperation efforts beginning with the FY2019 budget. These budget requests could provide Congress with a better understanding of the scope of DOD security cooperation activities in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the extent to which those activities overlap with the State Department's security assistance programs. They also could provide Congress with greater control over the relative balance between security and non-security assistance to the region.

Other analysts note that most Latin American and Caribbean nations are no longer dependent on foreign aid. They maintain that significant cuts would be damaging to Haiti, which receives the equivalent of nearly 10% of its budget from U.S. assistance, but would have limited impact in countries such as Colombia, where U.S. assistance accounts for 0.4% of the budget. In Central America, budgetary dependence on U.S. aid tops out at 2.3% in Honduras. Proponents of the Administration's efforts to scale back foreign aid argue that an overhaul of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean is \"long overdue\" and that the region would benefit from cuts that improve the focus and efficiency of aid programs.", "In the view of some observers, the Administration's efforts to cut foreign aid are part of a broader trend of U.S. disengagement from Latin America and the Caribbean. Noting that the Administration has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and the Paris Agreement on climate change, threatened to withdraw from the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and sought to sharply curtail immigration, they argue that the Administration \"has only pursued a 'negative agenda' toward the region.\" They contend that this has created a leadership vacuum in the region that other powers have begun to fill. China, which has become the top trading partner of several South American countries, reportedly has offered the region $250 billion in investment over the next decade.
