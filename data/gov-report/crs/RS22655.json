The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974, P.L. 93-415, was the first comprehensive juvenile justice legislation passed by Congress. Since 1974, the act has undergone several key amendments, including a significant reorganization enacted by P.L. 107-273 in 2002. The juvenile justice appropriation includes funding allocated within the purview of the JJDPA, as well as other grant programs that are administered by OJJDP but that are not within the JJDPA.", "After the restructuring of juvenile justice grant programs in 2002, their funding, which had generally been above $500 million, began to decline. For FY2010, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) provided $424 million for juvenile justice programs within DOJ. This was the largest amount appropriated to juvenile justice programs since FY2003. From FY2010 through FY2015, juvenile justice funding declined each subsequent fiscal year. Most recently, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), Congress increased juvenile justice funding to its highest level in five years and appropriated nearly $270.2 million for these programs for FY2016."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has no juvenile justice system of its own.

The JJDPA as originally enacted had three main components: it created a set of institutions within the federal government that were dedicated to coordinating and administering federal juvenile justice efforts; it established grant programs to assist the states with setting up and running their juvenile justice systems; and it promulgated core mandates that states had to adhere to in order to be eligible to receive grant funding.

", "Prior to FY2002, overall funding for juvenile justice within the DOJ appropriation gradually increased, peaking at $565 million in FY2002. From FY2002 to FY2007, however, overall juvenile justice funding fell by 38% to $348 million. The majority of this reduction came from the JABG program. Appropriations for JABG fell from a high of $250 million in FY2002 to $49 million in FY2007.

Of these funds, $199 million was for JJDPA programs. Funding for juvenile justice programs continued to decline in FY2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-55 ) provided $262.5 million for juvenile justice programs. Of this $262.5 million, $138 million was for JJDPA programs. Additionally, more than 25% of the juvenile justice program funding provided for FY2012 was designated for activities that had not been funded previously under the juvenile justice programs account (including funding for missing and exploited children programs, child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners, and grants and technical assistance in support of the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention). ", "The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) provided $279.5 million for juvenile justice programs for FY2013. Of note, Section 3001 of the act provided for a series of rescissions of FY2013 budget authority. After applying these rescissions and the sequestration ordered by President Obama on March 1, 2013, DOJ reports that juvenile justice programs were funded at nearly $261.0 million for FY2013. Juvenile justice funding continued to decline in FY2014; through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ), Congress appropriated $254.5 million for juvenile justice programs. One notable change to the juvenile justice funding pattern was an elimination of JABG funding in FY2014. Funding for juvenile justice programs dropped again in FY2015; through the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), Congress appropriated $251.5 million for these programs.

However, this block grant has not been appropriated since its inception. Instead, the appropriators have continued to fund some of the pre-existing grant programs (chiefly, the Victims of Child Abuse, Gang-Free Schools and Communities Grant, and Juvenile Mentoring Programs grants) either as separate line-items or with funding set aside from the Title V Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention.", " Table 1 also shows that appropriations for specific programs can vary from year to year and that some programs are specifically appropriated in one year but may not be specifically identified in other years, such as the Community Based Violence Prevention Initiative and the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention, which have received stand-alone appropriations some fiscal years and have been set aside from the Title V Incentive Grants program in other years.
