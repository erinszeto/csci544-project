The most comprehensive of these statutes is the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA; P.L. 89-665). NHPA created a grant program for state historic preservation, established the federal National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the procedures by which historic properties are placed on the Register, funded the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP), established the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and designated a process for federal agencies to follow when their projects may affect a historic property (known as the Section 106 process). Congress also has amended and expanded NHPA multiple times since its passage, most recently in 2016.", "In addition, Congress often considers bills to designate specific properties or areas as historically important, under various designations. These designations include national monuments, national historical parks, national historic sites, national historic landmarks, and properties listed on the NRHP, to name a few. Such historic designations may bring few management changes to a site or may involve significant changes, depending on the individual designating laws and/or general authorities that may apply to a type of designation. Some historic designations are applied to federally owned lands (including lands already under federal administration and those that the designating law may authorize for federal acquisition), but many federal designations are conferred on lands that remain nonfederally owned and managed.", "Because of these various legislative and oversight activities, historic preservation is of perennial interest to Congress. For example, some Members of Congress support proposals to eliminate a federal government role in financing historic preservation programs, leaving such programs to be sustained by other levels of government or by private support. Others state that a federal role in supporting historic preservation should be maintained or expanded. In particular, lawmakers and administrations pay significant attention to funding levels for various historic preservation programs that are subject to the annual appropriations process.", "The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) is the primary source of funding for federal preservation. Appropriations for the HPF totaled $118.7 million in FY2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ), a nearly 16% increase from the FY2019 appropriation (excluding emergency supplemental funding) and a roughly $86 million increase over the FY2020 Administration request. For FY2021, the Trump Administration requests a roughly 66% reduction in funding for the HPF compared with FY2020 levels.

In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened a special committee on historic preservation in 1965.

Members of Congress as well as both current and past Administrations have expressed various opinions as to how federal funding for these programs should be allocated and at what levels. Both the FY2020 and the FY2021 budget requests from NPS would have significantly reduced funding for the HPF and would provide no funding for African American civil rights grant programs, grants to underrepresented communities, the Save America's Treasures program, or historic revitalization grants. ", "In response to the FY2020 budget proposal, the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands of the Committee on Natural Resources held oversight hearings in April 2019 on the spending priorities and mission of NPS. During these hearings, some Members expressed concern that the proposed reduction in grant funding would impact the ability of communities to protect and maintain culturally and historically important resources. Others\u00e2\u0080\u0094including witnesses from NPS\u00e2\u0080\u0094expressed the position that \"core\" NPS priorities such as infrastructure and the NPS maintenance backlog should take priority over historic preservation when considering the appropriation of federal funds.", "Other issues Congress may consider are specific to NHPA and current historic preservation laws and regulations. For instance, some have argued that the \"stop, look, and listen\" approach under Section 106 of NHPA does not provide adequate protection for historic resources, since the law only establishes a procedural requirement for federal agencies. According to a study commissioned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2010, NPS reported to Congress that only 2% of all SHPO reviews for Section 106 compliance included findings of adverse effects to historic properties. For those undertakings that are deemed to have an adverse effect on a given historic property, the agency in question is only required to consider these effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094with no explicit legal mandate requiring them to address these potential impacts. In other words, although agencies are compelled to consult with the SHPO/THPO to develop solutions to mitigate effects, agency officials are not required to pursue the solutions, regardless of any adverse effects. As a result, some preservation advocates have charged that NHPA fails in its purported mission to protect cultural and historic sites.", "Others suggest that Section 106 compliance results in unnecessary and costly delays and have suggested that in some cases, opponents of specific federal projects may invoke Section 106 procedural steps in the hopes of delaying approval for a project\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes to the point of impacting a project's feasibility. Although federal regulations provide certain ways for agencies to tailor the Section 106 process to their needs, some stakeholders have asserted that these options are time-consuming to implement and not flexible enough for undertakings that involve new or emerging technologies. Multiple bills have been introduced to exempt or limit NHPA reviews for certain projects, such as rail and transit infrastructure projects and Federal Communications Commission construction projects for communications facilities following a major disaster.", "Many of the programs that directly or indirectly support historic preservation also have received attention in recent years. For example, in 2013, the Federal Railroad Administration published a study that concluded \"there is no consistent approach on how to address the National Register eligibility of railroad corridors.\" Although federal regulations outline the criteria for inclusion of a property on the National Register, the report states that inconsistent standards still abound, due to the multitude of entities conducting National Register evaluations. Another program of congressional interest has been the National Heritage Areas program. Legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to establish a National Heritage Areas System governing the designation, management, and funding of NHAs, to replace the stand-alone approach currently in place. Additionally, some Members\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as past and current Administrations\u00e2\u0080\u0094have expressed interest in ensuring that NHAs eventually become financially self-sufficient and in limiting the federal funding for long-standing areas.", "In addition, Congress often considers bills to designate specific properties or areas as historically important, under various designations. For example, in the 116 th Congress, P.L. 116-9 included provisions that designated three new historical sites as units of the National Park System and six new national heritage areas, as well as stand-alone provisions that recognized the historical importance of sites across the United States. Although many of the programs described in this report provide for properties to receive historical designation administratively, Congress has at times conferred individual designations in law. Certain programs or designations require congressional action to establish new areas or to designate properties as historically significant."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Selected Federal Grant Programs for Historic Preservation", "paragraphs": [" Table A-1 is an overview of selected federal historic preservation grant programs. This overview focuses on programs with the primary mission of historic preservation and is not a complete representation of all federal grant programs that support historic preservation activities. Most of the programs listed here are subject to annual appropriations and therefore may not be currently funded, despite some programs having congressional authorization to administer grants. Programs authorized or funded in FY2020 for the first time may not be listed below. For example, as part of the FY2020 funding bill ( P.L. 116-94 ), Congress provided funding for a new civil rights grant program that would preserve and highlight the sites and stories associated with women, American Latino, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and LGBTQ Americans. NPS has not yet published eligibility requirements or program guidelines. P.L. 116-94 also authorized two new grant programs as part of the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP): a battlefield interpretation modernization grant program and a battlefield restoration grant program. As these new programs have yet to receive appropriations from Congress, they are not listed below."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
