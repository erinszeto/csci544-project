R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities. Partly in response to concerns in the scientific community about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences, the FY2007 appropriation provided increased funding for the physical sciences. Research in the physical sciences often leads to advances in other disciplines. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA) and is a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. It also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. In FY2006, responsibility for funding the costs of icebreakers that support scientific research in polar regions was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to NSF. The NSF will continue to operate and maintain the three icebreakers. The OPP is funded at $485 million in the FY2007 appropriation, 24.2% above the FY2006 level.

SJI had requested an appropriation of $4.5 million for FY2007, a 30.2% increase. By contrast, the Bush Administration, as in its budgets for the previous four years, proposed the complete elimination of federal funding for the institute in FY2007. In its passage, on June 29, 2006, of H.R. 5672 , the SSJC appropriations bill for FY2007, the House (following the recommendation of its Appropriations Committee) provided $2 million for SJI, $1.46 million less than the FY2006 funding amount.

In response to a directive from House-Senate conferees for the FY2006 appropriations act, SJI, in its FY2007 request, noted that it has adopted a 50% \"cash match requirement\" from its grantees. Also in its request, the institute stated that it continues to pursue grant-making partnerships with the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), and other public and private entities, looking to \"pool its resources with OJP, LSC, and others to fund innovations in areas of mutual concern.\"", "In the FY2006 appropriations process, the House Appropriations Committee endorsed an approach of providing some directly appropriated funds to SJI, but with the institute as well seeking additional funding from Department of Justice grant programs. The House committee (in H.Rept. 109-118 , p.154) stated that it understood that SJI had \"been unable to generate stable sources of non-Federal funding\" and that the SJI had contacted bar associations and court organizations as possible alternative sources of funding. However, the committee noted, these groups were \"not inclined to contribute to operations of the SJI beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects.\" For this reason, the committee said, it continued to recommend funding for SJI even though the President's FY2006 request did not.

In its report, the committee's discussion of recommended funding for SJI simply noted that the institute had been created in 1984 to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts.", "After the House passed (but prior to Senate passage of) the FY2007 continuing appropriations resolution, SJI's newsletter characterized the $3.46 million approved by the House for FY2007 as a \"'hard freeze' at our fiscal year (FY) 2006 funding level.\" It commented that although \"the 'glass is half empty' crowd might lament that figure, we are very comfortable with it,\" adding. \"We are grateful to Congress for their continued support and look forward to continuing to meet their high expectations of us.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Commission on Civil Rights53", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (Commission), established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, investigates allegations of citizens that they were denied the right to vote based on color, race, religion, or national origin; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws; assesses federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights; and submits reports on its findings to the President and Congress when the Commission or the President deems it appropriate.", "For FY2007, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution provided $8.9 million for the Commission compared with President Bush's request of $9.31 million for the agency.
