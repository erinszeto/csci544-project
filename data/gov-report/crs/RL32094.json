", "The House Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee voted 9-7, on July 15,2004, to approve an amendment by Representative John Culberson to H.R. 5025 ,Transportation-Treasury Appropriations for FY2005, to prohibit the use of funds by the Secretaryof the Treasury \"to publish, implement, administer, or enforce regulations that permit financialinstitutions to accept the matr\u00c3\u00adcula consular identification card as a form of identification.\" Representative Culberson claimed that his amendment had the support of the Department ofHomeland Security, the FBI, the Justice Department, and a U.S. Attorney in Texas. He argued thatthe amendment was aimed at ending the use of a totally unreliable form of identification that couldbe obtained by criminals and terrorists. Those opposing the amendment argued that the consularcards were safe and that the Subcommittee was acting precipitously and without adequateinformation. (17) ", "The full Appropriations Committee approved the overall measure on July 22, 2004, aftervoting 25-26 to defeat an amendment by Representative Ed Pastor that would have stricken thelanguage of the Culberson amendment described above. This action left intact the previouslyapproved prohibition on Treasury funding for implementation of regulations permitting financialinstitutions to accept the matr\u00c3\u00adcula consular cards. Representative Culberson argued that the cardsare unreliable and could be used by terrorists to falsify their identities. Representative Pastor andothers argued that the cards were reliable and that the Department of Homeland Security could writeregulations to deal with their concerns, without blocking the use of the cards for financialtransactions. (18) ", "When the House considered the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations for FY2005( H.R. 5025 ) on September 14, 2004, Representatives Oxley and Frank, Chairman andRanking Member of the House Committee on Financial Services, offered an amendment that wasapproved 222-177 to strike the Culberson amendment described above, thereby restoring fundingfor the Treasury Department so that it could continue to implement regulations on identity cards forbanking services in effect since May 2003. The sponsors of the amendment argued that the existingregulations were working effectively and that they had the support of the Administration. Opponentsof the amendment argued that the Treasury regulations were too lax in that they permitted the useof documents that are easily forged, that might be used by terrorists, and that are largely used bypersons who are illegally in the United States. After consideration of other amendments, the overallmeasure was passed by the House on September 22, 2004, thereby restoring previous authorities withrespect to consular ID cards. Since the Senate never completed action on the separate appropriationmeasure, the act was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005( H.R. 4818 ) that was approved by both houses of Congress on November 20, 2004, and,after passage of a corrective measure, was signed into law ( P.L. 108-447 ) on December 8, 2004.

In the mentioned House floor action on the ForeignRelations Authorization Act for FY2004-2005 ( H.R. 1950 ), the lower house voted, 226to198, to accept House Amendment No. 246, which was added to the bill as Section 232. Theamendment would establish a series of restrictions on the issuance of consular identification cardsby foreign missions. It would direct the Secretary of State to issue regulations requiring foreignmissions to: (1) notify the Secretary of each consular identification card issued in the United States,including the name and address of each recipient; (2) issue cards only to bona fide nationals of thecountry; (3) maintain complete and accurate records of all cards issued and do so in an automatedsystem that can be accessed to prevent duplicate or fraudulent issuance; (4) require card recipientsto notify the mission of any change of address; and (5) make available the records of all cards issuedfor audit and review at the request of the Secretary. If the Secretary of State determined that aforeign mission had violated these regulations and that such violation threatened national securityor facilitated fraudulent or criminal acts, the Secretary would notify the relevant government that themission must suspend issuance of consular identification cards until it was in compliance. If theforeign mission failed to suspend issuance of the cards, the State Department would cease issuanceof immigrant or non-immigrant visas, or both, to nationals of that country until the mission was incompliance with the regulations. (19) ", "Supporters of these proposed restrictions argued that foreign governments have been issuingconsular identification cards in the United States for purposes other than those intended by theVienna Convention on Consular Relations, namely to circumvent U.S. immigration law, and that theissuance of the cards should be subject to U.S. regulation. They argued that the cards are not areliable form of identification because the Mexican government has no automated and secure systemto assure that the cards are not forged or shared, or issued to more than one individual or toindividuals relying on fraudulent documents. They further argued that the cards are susceptible tobeing used to establish false identities that may facilitate money-laundering, alien smuggling, andterrorist activity.", "Opponents of the proposed restrictions argued that the restrictions are directed againstconsular identification cards in general, the Mexican matr\u00c3\u00adcula consular in particular, and personsof Hispanic heritage. They argued that the requirements, especially the requirements that the recordsbe given to the United States and be subject to audit by the United States, pose unreasonablerestrictions on a foreign government's right under the Vienna Convention to register and monitor itsnationals abroad. They further argued that the penalties for non-compliance were extremely onerous. To the extent that the issuance of the matr\u00c3\u00adcula consular has been viewed as improving Mexico-U.S.bilateral relations, the House-passed restrictions would likely be seen as harming the bilateralrelationship. The restrictions would also be viewed by opponents as making consular notificationmore difficult, and raising the possibility that reciprocal action by other nations might harm the U.S.government's ability to register and monitor U.S. nationals abroad."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measures on Acceptance of Consular Cards as Identity Documents by U.S. Federal Entities", "paragraphs": ["Three bills would have restricted acceptance of consular identification cards by federalentities.

S. 2845, as originally passed by the Houseon October 16, 2004, contained a number of related provisions. Section 3006 would have providedthat for the purpose of establishing identity to any federal employee, an alien in the United Statescould present (1) any document issued by the U.S. Attorney General or the Secretary of HomelandSecurity under the authority of an immigration law, (2) a domestically issued document that theSecretary of Homeland Security had designated as reliable and that could not be issued to an alienunlawfully present in the United States, or (3) any unexpired, lawfully issued foreign passport asdetermined by the Secretary of State. This provision would likely have precluded the presentationof the Mexican consular ID as an identity document to federal officials. Section 3052 would havebarred Federal agencies three years after enactment from accepting drivers licenses or otheridentification unless such licenses satisfied standards set by the Secretary of Homeland Security,including verification of the authenticity of the documents and proof that the person possesses or isineligible for a social security account. It would also have prohibited states from issuing driverslicenses to individuals who could not prove legal residency in the United States.

Opponents argued mostly thatthe measures were not central to the main purpose of the legislation, namely reform of theintelligence services, and that the measures had not been adequately considered.", "Some of the mentioned provisions were among the most difficult to resolve in conference,however.
