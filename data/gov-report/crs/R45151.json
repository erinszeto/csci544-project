And certain criminal offenses may preclude an alien outside the United States from being either admitted into the country or permitted to reenter following an initial departure. Further, criminal conduct may disqualify an alien from certain forms of relief from removal or prevent the alien from becoming a U.S. citizen. In some cases, the INA directly identifies particular offenses that carry immigration consequences; in other cases, federal immigration law provides that a general category of crimes, such as \"crimes involving moral turpitude\" or an offense defined by the INA as an \"aggravated felony,\" may render an alien ineligible for certain benefits and privileges under immigration law.", "The INA distinguishes between the treatment of aliens who have been lawfully admitted into the United States and those who are either seeking admission into the country or are physically present in the country without having been lawfully admitted.

Although the INA designates certain criminal activities and categories of criminal activities as grounds for inadmissibility or deportation, the respective grounds are not identical. Moreover, a conviction for a designated crime is not always required for an alien to be disqualified on criminal grounds from admission into the United States. But for nearly all criminal grounds for deportation, a \"conviction\" (as defined by the INA) for the underlying offense is necessary. Additionally, although certain criminal conduct may disqualify an alien from various immigration-related benefits or forms of relief, the scope of disqualifying conduct varies depending on the particular benefit or form of relief at issue.", "This report identifies the major criminal grounds that may bar an alien from being admitted into the United States or render an alien within the country removable.

Originally enacted in 1952, the INA unified the country's immigration laws under one umbrella framework. A number of federal agencies possess distinct responsibilities relating to the administration of the country's immigration laws, including the Department of Justice, the State Department, and, following the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "Before Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act most U.S. immigration laws\u2014particularly as they related to enforcement activities and providing relief or services to aliens within the United States\u2014were primarily administered by the Attorney General, who largely delegated his power to two agencies within the Department of Justice (DOJ): the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which carried out enforcement and service activities, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which carried out adjudication activities. ", "The Homeland Security Act, as relevant here, dismantled the INS, created DHS, and transferred many of the Attorney General's immigration administration responsibilities to the DHS Secretary. Thus, the DHS Secretary is now \"charged with the administration and enforcement of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens, except insofar as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers, functions, and duties conferred upon the President, Attorney General\" and other executive officers. ", "Three components of DHS\u2014Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\u2014carry out the major functions of the former INS. In particular, ICE is the primary investigative arm of immigration enforcement within the United States. When ICE determines that an alien located within the U.S. interior has violated the immigration laws\u2014for example, by committing certain crimes\u2014DHS typically apprehends the alien and initiates removal proceedings against him before an immigration judge (IJ) within DOJ's EOIR. CBP, on the other hand, is authorized to enforce immigration laws at the border, which involves responsibilities including the inspection and admission of aliens seeking entry into the United States and the expedited removal of certain inadmissible aliens apprehended at or near the border while seeking entry to the United States.", "DHS, through USCIS, also plays a role in determining eligibility and approving applications for certain forms of relief and immigration benefits (e.g., granting asylum, adjusting status, or naturalizing). ", "Despite the transfer of most enforcement functions to DHS, removal proceedings are primarily conducted by EOIR within DOJ. During those proceedings, an IJ typically assesses an alien's removability and eligibility for relief from removal. At the removal hearing\u2014a civil proceeding \u2014aliens generally have a right to legal counsel at their own expense. An IJ makes an initial removability determination, which may be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the highest administrative body charged with interpreting and applying federal immigration laws. (The Attorney General is vested with discretion to review those appeals as well.) Additionally, as was the case before enactment of the Homeland Security Act, Attorney General rulings \"with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.\" ", "Federal circuit courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate petitions for review of final removal orders issued in proceedings before EOIR. However, the INA limits what issues the appellate courts may review. For instance, the INA limits federal courts' jurisdiction over cases involving an alien ordered removed based on certain criminal activity, unless the alien raises a constitutional claim or question of law (e.g., whether particular conduct an alien allegedly committed is of the type of conduct covered by a particular removal ground in the INA).", "Another executive branch agency, the State Department, takes the lead role in processing the visas that aliens must generally obtain (with notable exceptions) to travel to, and be admitted into, the United States. Immigrant visas are granted to aliens seeking lawful permanent residency in the United States, whereas nonimmigrant visas are issued to aliens seeking temporary admission into the United States. In both cases, the alien seeking a visa must submit supporting documentation to, and interview with, a consular official who generally must be located in the country where the alien resides.

Neither the INA nor any earlier immigration law defines the term. Some federal appellate courts have opined that the term's legislative history, or lack thereof, \"leaves no doubt ... that Congress left the term 'crime involving moral turpitude' to future administrative and judicial interpretation.\" According to the BIA, moral turpitude \"refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons and to society in general.\" In addition, moral turpitude, according to the BIA, involves \"malicious intention\" and actions \"contrary to justice, honesty, principle, or good morals.\" ", "The federal courts generally agree that a crime that is inherently fraudulent or involves an intent to defraud is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is less settled, however, when other, nonfraudulent crimes constitute crimes involving moral turpitude. Indeed, before Attorney General Michael Mukasey's 2008 opinion in Matter of Silva-Trevino ( Silva - Tr e vino I ), which set forth a standard for assessing whether a crime involved moral turpitude, there had been an \"absence of an authoritative administrative methodology for resolving moral turpitude inquiries [which had] resulted in different approaches across the country.\" In Silva-Tr e vino I, the Attorney General ruled that a crime involving moral turpitude must involve both reprehensible conduct and a culpable mental state, such as specific intent, deliberateness, or recklessness.

The Court noted that under current immigration law, removal is \"nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders.\" Thus, the Court reasoned, \"[t]he importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.\" Recognizing that \"[i]mmigration law can be complex, and ... some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges ... may not be well versed in it,\" the Court added that \"[w]hen the law is not succinct and straightforward ... a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.\" But when the INA is clear about the deportation consequences of a particular crime, the Court admonished, \"the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Constitutes a Conviction?", "paragraphs": ["Numerous criminal grounds for inadmissibility and deportability require the rendering of a conviction for a particular crime to be applicable. INA \u00a7\u00a0101(a)(48)(A) provides two definitions for what constitutes a conviction for INA purposes. First, INA \u00a7\u00a0101(a)(48)(A) defines a conviction as a formal judgment of guilt entered by a court. Generally, in federal cases, the final judgment ordered by the district judge contains the formal judgment of guilt. A state court's written judgment and sentence would qualify as well. If a conviction is vacated or set aside because of substantive or procedural defects in the criminal proceedings, the conviction no longer qualifies as a \"conviction\" under INA \u00a7\u00a0101(a)(48)(A). However, a conviction that is vacated or set aside for rehabilitative purposes (e.g., under state laws that permit a judge to expunge convictions for simple drug possession) or solely for the purpose of avoiding immigration consequences, still qualifies as a conviction under the INA. The same is true for expunged convictions: INA \u00a7 101(a)(48)(A) has been interpreted to exclude expunged convictions, unless the expungement was allowed solely for rehabilitative purposes.", "A second definition of conviction exists for situations in which adjudication of guilt has been withheld: There is also a \"conviction\" if (1) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty, or the alien pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or the alien has admitted sufficient facts to be found guilty, and (2) the judge has ordered some sort of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty. Qualifying nonconfinement judicial orders can include probation and restitution. Thus, even for crimes requiring a conviction for immigration consequences to attach, there need not be, necessarily, a formal judgment of guilt or a sentence of imprisonment imposed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Determine Whether a Criminal Conviction Triggers Immigration Consequences", "paragraphs": ["Although the INA, on some occasions, expressly identifies conduct referenced in a criminal statute that would render an alien removable or ineligible for certain relief, in many instances the INA simply refers to a general category of criminal behavior that carries immigration consequences. Accordingly, reviewing courts and immigration authorities must sometimes determine whether the range of conduct covered by an alien's criminal conviction falls within the scope of criminal conduct proscribed by the INA.", "The Supreme Court has instructed that, to make such a determination, reviewing courts should apply a \"categorical approach,\" in which they compare the elements of the offense of conviction to the generic federal definition of the predicate crime. Under this approach, reviewing courts may look only to the statutory elements of the crime of conviction, rather than the particular facts of the case, in analyzing whether the crime \"categorically fits\" within the corresponding federal generic offense. In doing so, the courts must presume that the conviction was based on the least culpable conduct under the criminal statute. If the crime of conviction \"sweeps more broadly\" than the generic offense identified by the INA as grounds for an alien's removal, the criminal conviction cannot serve as a basis for removal.", "In some cases, however, the courts may look beyond the statutory definition of a criminal offense when the statute lists multiple, alternative elements of a crime, and only some of those alternatives correspond to the generic offense identified by the INA as carrying immigration consequences. Under this \"modified categorical approach,\" courts may examine the underlying conviction documents, such as the charging papers or plea agreement, to determine which statutory elements a defendant was convicted of, and compare those elements to the federal generic offense. The Supreme Court has held, though, that a court may not apply this approach merely when a statute contains a \"single, indivisible set of elements\" that cover \"a broader swath of conduct than the relevant generic offense.\" Instead, \"[a] court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant's conviction.\"", "The strict limitations of the categorical and modified categorical approaches do not apply, however, when a comparison between the criminal statute and a generic offense requires an examination of the \"particular circumstances in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion.\" Applying this \"circumstance-specific\" exception, a number of reviewing courts have held that an adjudicator may consider evidence outside the conviction record to determine whether a criminal conviction involved factors specified in a generic offense that are not tied to the elements of a criminal statute. For example, the courts have considered evidence as to whether a fraud offense met a $10,000 loss threshold (a monetary threshold that must be exceeded for the offense to constitute an aggravated felony under the INA), or whether a drug conviction involved the personal use of 30 grams or less of marijuana (in which case the drug conviction would not be a deportable offense).", "In practice, the BIA employs the categorical and modified categorical approaches to determine whether a criminal conviction meets the definition of a predicate offense for immigration purposes. Following the Supreme Court's guidance, the BIA generally limits its analysis of criminal convictions to the statutory elements of the crime, rather than the specific facts underlying the conviction. The BIA will turn to the record of conviction only in cases in which the statute has a divisible structure that lists alternative elements of an offense, only some of which categorically match the generic offense identified by the INA as carrying immigration consequences.", "Previously, however, in analyzing whether a criminal conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude, the BIA adopted a less restrictive form of the categorical approach that merely examines \"whether there is a 'realistic probability,' as opposed to a 'theoretical possibility,' that the statute under which the alien was convicted would be applied to reach conduct that does not involve moral turpitude.\" Under that analysis, if the criminal statute realistically could reach conduct not involving moral turpitude, an adjudicator could look to the record of conviction as well as \"any additional evidence the adjudicator determines is necessary or appropriate to resolve accurately the moral turpitude question.\"", "Ultimately, after several reviewing courts rejected this formulation, the BIA ruled that the categorical and modified categorical approaches\u2014as outlined by the Supreme Court\u2014are the proper methods for determining whether an alien was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The BIA, however, stated that it would continue using the realistic probability test when applying the categorical approach analysis; but, noting the circuit disagreement as to its appropriateness, announced that it would apply the controlling law of circuits that have expressly disavowed that approach. The BIA also held that application of the modified categorical approach was limited to circumstances in which the statute is divisible and lists offense elements in the alternative. And using this approach, the BIA clarified, adjudicators may look to only the record of conviction to determine which element formed the basis for the alien's conviction. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interpreting the INA Predicate Offense", "paragraphs": ["In many instances Congress did not incorporate a statutory definition when defining a predicate offense that carries immigration consequences, leaving it up to the courts to carve out a generic definition. For example, the INA includes as an aggravated felony \"a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\" for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year, but does not define that phrase. To fill that gap, the appellate courts have generally eschewed the more restrictive, common law definitions of \"theft\" or \"larceny\" for a broader and more modern construction: The \"taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\"", "In defining the scope of other undefined predicate offenses, the courts have been less consistent. For example, the INA also includes as an aggravated felony \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" Until the Supreme Court's decision in Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions , there was some disagreement among reviewing courts and the BIA over the scope of offenses constituting \"sexual abuse of a minor\" under the INA, with the BIA broadly interpreting the phrase to cover any sexually explicit conduct with a person under 18. In Esquivel-Quintana , however, the Supreme Court construed the phrase as having a more limited scope and held that, for statutory rape offenses based solely on the age of the participants, the term \"sexual abuse of a minor\" requires the age of the victim to be less than 16. ", "Even in cases that involve interpreting an INA provision in which Congress has expressly incorporated a federal statutory provision to define a predicate offense, the courts sometimes have struggled to interpret that definition consistently. As mentioned above, INA \u00a7 101(a)(43) includes as an aggravated felony a \"crime of violence\" as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, and for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016 defines a crime of violence as either (1) \"an offense that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"; or (2)\u00a0\"any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"", "Initially, a question raised was whether a \"crime of violence,\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016, requires a particular mens rea , or mental state. Lower courts had reached varying conclusions over the state of mind that a person must possess in order to commit a crime of violence. Some courts, for example, had ruled that grossly negligent behavior was sufficient to meet the definition, whereas other courts required a showing of recklessness or specific intent. Eventually, in its 2004 ruling in Leocal v. Ashcroft , the Supreme Court held that a crime of violence requires an \"active employment\" of force with \"a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.\"", "More recently, in October 2017, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Session s v. Dimaya to address the circuit split about whether the second clause in the definition of a crime of violence\u2014\"any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense\" \u2014is unconstitutionally vague.

For instance, Congress may legislate to expand or constrict criminal grounds for inadmissibility and deportability. Congress also could add or subtract crimes from those listed as aggravated felonies and clarify what crimes involve moral turpitude. Additionally, Congress could modify the number of crimes that would render an alien statutorily ineligible for relief from removal or those that preclude a finding of good moral character. Further, Congress could clarify certain terminology in the INA that some courts have deemed ambiguous, like crime of moral turpitude and crime of violence. In short, given the immigration consequences that may follow from criminal activity, Congress may consider various legislative options that would modify the standards employed by the courts and relevant immigration authorities to determine whether an alien may be excluded or deported from the United States due to criminal conduct.
