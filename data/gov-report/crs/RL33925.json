{"id": "RL33925", "title": "Drug Safety: A Side-by-Side Comparison of Bills in the 110th Congress", "released_date": "2007-03-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["Members of Congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the drugs sold in the United States are safe and effective. In November 2004, FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to assess the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety and to make recommendations to improve risk assessment, surveillance, and the safe use of drugs. IOM released The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public in September 2006, and FDA issued its response in January 2007. The following drug safety bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress: S. 468 / H.R. 788, S. 484, and H.R. 1165.", "Although the legislation and the IOM report address many of the same drug safety issues, the bills differ in their treatment of FDA authority to require action and to enforce compliance, comparative effectiveness studies, and how to fund any additional agency activities. For example, S. 468 / H.R. 788 would strengthen FDA's post-approval drug safety activities by creating a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics. The other bills would leave these activities where they currently reside in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. All the bills would allow the FDA to penalize (through civil fines, injunctions, or withdrawal of marketing approval or licensure) drug manufacturers who did not conduct required postmarket studies or who failed to report study results.", "The IOM committee recommended that Congress provide substantially increased resources to FDA to bolster its drug safety activities. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would authorize appropriations to carry out the bill's provisions, S. 484 would rely on user fees, expanding FDA's existing authority to use such fees, and H.R. 1165 does not address funding."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Members of Congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the drugs sold in the United States are safe and effective. Legislators, industry, the public, and FDA scientists have raised questions about FDA's collection and release of safety data, and whether the agency has the authority and resources to ensure adequate research over the marketing life of the pharmaceutical products it regulates.", "In 2004, the regulatory, medical, and industry debate became very public with reports of cardiovascular hazards posed by the pain medicine Vioxx (one of several COX-2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs then on the market), and of children facing increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actions when taking certain antidepressants (such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Paxil and Zoloft). Not only was Congress asking whether the manufacturers knew of these risks while continuing to market the drug, but also whether FDA should have known of the risks and done more to protect the public.", "At the height of public and Congressional attention, FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to \"conduct an independent assessment of the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety postmarketing and make recommendations to improve risk assessment, surveillance, and the safe use of drugs.\" IOM released its report in September 2006. FDA issued its response in January 2007 and noted relevant activities the agency has begun and others it has planned. Among the planned activities are those in its proposal for a reauthorization of the prescription drug user fee program (PDUFA IV).", "In the meantime, several Members of Congress have introduced bills to address drug safety and FDA's role in protecting the public's health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Highlights", "paragraphs": ["This report provides a side-by-side comparison of:", "Institute of Medicine: recommendations in its September 2006 report, The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public ; Food and Drug Administration: announced actions and plans to address problems identified in the IOM report; S. 468 / H.R. 788 (the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2007), introduced on January 31, 2007, by Senators Grassley, Dodd, Mikulski, and Bingaman, and Representatives Tierney and Ramstad; S. 484 (the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007), introduced on February 1, 2007, by Senators Enzi and Kennedy; and H.R. 1165 (the Swift Approval, Full Evaluation (SAFE) Drug Act), introduced on February 16, 2007, by Representative Markey.", "The bills and the IOM report address many of the same issues, often with similar approaches though at times with major differences. The IOM report addressed only drugs, not biological products (e.g., vaccines), in keeping with the charge FDA gave it. FDA's response to the IOM recommendations, therefore, relates to drugs, but also states that the approach to drug safety is relevant to all medical products. All the bills would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (regarding the regulation of drugs); S. 484 would also amend the Public Health Service Act (regarding the regulation of biologics). Highlighted below are a few of the more significant items regarding drug safety."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA organization", "paragraphs": ["S. 468 / H.R. 788 would remove the post-approval drug safety activities from FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and create a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics (the Center).
