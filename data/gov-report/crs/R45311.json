Although PBGC is projected to have sufficient resources to provide financial assistance to multiemployer DB plans through 2025, the projected insolvency of many multiemployer DB pension plans will likely result in a substantial strain on PBGC's multiemployer insurance program. In a report released in June 2017, PBGC indicated that the multiemployer insurance program is highly likely to become insolvent in 2025.

When a multiemployer pension plan becomes insolvent, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a federally-chartered corporation that insures private-sector DB pension benefits, provides financial assistance to the plan so the plan can continue to pay promised benefits, up to a statutory maximum. Currently, plans that receive PBGC financial assistance can provide up to $12,870 per year for an individual with 30 years of service in the plan. The guarantee is not indexed for changes in the cost of living and was last increased in 2000.", "At the end of FY2017, PBGC reported a deficit of $65.1 billion in the multiemployer insurance program. 7FThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided several estimates (using different accounting methods) of PBGC's financial condition. 8FCBO's cash-based estimates account for spending and revenue in the years when they are expected to occur. CBO estimates that from 2017 to 2026, PBGC will be obligated to pay $9 billion in claims but will only have sufficient resources to pay $6 billion. From 2027 to 2036, CBO cash-based estimates indicate that claims to PBGC will be $35 billion but PBGC will only have sufficient resources to pay $5 billion. CBO also provided fair-value estimates, which are the present value of all expected future claims for financial assistance, net of premiums received. CBO's fair-value estimate of PBGC's future obligations was $101 billion. There is no obligation on the part of the federal government to provide financial assistance to PBGC.", "Because of the projected plan insolvencies, PBGC has projected that it will likely not have the resources to provide sufficient financial assistance to insolvent plans at the maximum guarantee level beginning in 2025. In such a scenario, most participants would receive less than $2,000 per year because PBGC would be able to provide annual financial assistance equal only to its annual premium revenue, which was $291 million in FY2017. ", "In addition, employers in plans that are projected to become insolvent might exit such plans based on concerns that they may have to pay increasingly larger amounts of withdrawal liability if they remain. 12FSome experts refer to a multiemployer plan \"death spiral\" as an increasing number of employers leave financially-troubled multiemployer plans in order to avoid larger future obligations to the plans.", "This report is not intended to be an exhaustive presentation of the many policy options that stakeholders have offered.

PBGC indicated that most participants would receive less than $2,000 per year. Further, some policy analysts have raised concerns about possible contagion effects that may exacerbate an already large problem: The insolvency of a multiemployer plan could cause large withdrawal liability assessments for the employers in that plan. If these increased withdrawal liability assessments cause financial distress for some of these employers, it could affect their contributions to other multiemployer plans in which they participate.
