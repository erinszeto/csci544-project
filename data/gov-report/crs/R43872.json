The other two principal responsibilities are providing assistance to nonfederal forest owners and conducting forestry research. Most NFS lands are concentrated in the western United States, although the Forest Service administers more federal land in the East than all other federal agencies combined.", "The original forest reserves were established to improve and protect federal forests and watersheds and provide a source of timber. Today, the statutory mission of the National Forest System is to provide a variety of uses and values\u2014timber production, watershed management, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, outdoor recreation, fish and wildlife habitat management, and wilderness\u2014without impairing the productivity of the land. Although there is not a statutory mandate to do so, many of the uses and services available on NFS lands generate revenue. The revenue may be used to offset agency costs, shared with the local communities containing the NFS lands, or returned to the Treasury. Growing demands for the various uses, values, and services have led to conflicts over the location and timing of activities.", "In FY2016, the Forest Service received $1.5 billion to fund National Forest System management, approximately 24% of the $6.4 billion the agency received in discretionary appropriations. The NFS account includes several subaccounts, programs, and activities, many of which reflect the different ways in which national forests are used. These uses include activities related to recreation and wilderness, grazing, wildlife and fish habitat management, forest products and timber sales, and energy and minerals management. However, in FY2012, Congress authorized a pilot budget structure that consolidated several of the budget line items for three Forest Service regions. The Forest Service asserts that the budget flexibility provided in this Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR) program will facilitate various land and resource management objectives across the NFS.", "Reducing the risk and expense of catastrophic wildfires on National Forest System lands has been a major focus of Congress, the Forest Service, and the public. Reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires involves land and resource management activities to restore the resilience and resistance of the forest ecosystem, such as reducing accumulated levels of biomass (which fuels fires) through timber sales, stewardship contracts, or prescribed burns. Many are also concerned about the cost of wildfires. Although wildfire management is funded separately from NFS management, some are concerned about the rising proportion of fire suppression costs on the rest of the Forest Service budget. In FY2006, wildfire management activities accounted for 44% of the agency's total discretionary appropriations; in FY2016, the $3.9 billion appropriated to wildfire management is 61% of the agency's total discretionary appropriation.", "This report provides an overview of the history and management of the National Forest System, including a discussion of the statutory framework for making land management plans and decisions as well as for acquiring or disposing of system lands.

The other two principal responsibilities are providing assistance programs to nonfederal forest owners and conducting forestry research programs.", "In 1906 and 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt more than doubled the acreage of the forest reserves. In response, Congress limited the authority of the President to add to the system in certain states in 1907.

The plans must also be developed and revised with public involvement and must be prepared in accordance with NEPA. Regulations (often called the planning rules) to establish the procedures to develop, amend, and revise plans were issued in 1979 and then revised in 1982, 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2012.

The Bush Administration promulgated final rules in 2005 (\"2005 planning rule\") to balance ecological sustainability with economic and social considerations. The rules would have also exempted NFMA plans from NEPA and ESA. Interests successfully challenged the 2005 planning rule, arguing that the new rules reduced environmental protection without adequate public comment and ESA consideration. The Administration reissued the 2005 rule as a proposed rule to provide for the court-ordered public comment and issued new final rules in April 2008.

However, FS timber sales and revenue generation were negligible until the 1950s, when the post\u2013World War II housing boom, combined with declining competition from private timber sales, led to increasing NFS timber sales (see Figure 3 ). For many years after, the FS was a major provider of timber for the wood products industry, generally selling between 10 billion and 12 billion board feet of timber annually (about 20%-25% of total U.S. wood supply). Since the 1990s, FS timber harvests have fallen, totaling around 2 billion board feet\u2014less than a quarter of the historic level\u2014annually since 1999. The decline in harvest levels and value in the 1990s is attributable to a multitude of factors, including (but not limited to) changing legislative directives and related forest management policies and practices\u2014such as increased planning and procedural requirements\u2014as well as changing market dynamics for wood products, public preferences, and litigation. For the last 15 years, harvest volume has remained relatively constant around 2.0 billion board feet harvested annually, with a slight upward trend over the last few years. Starting in FY2005, the price of lumber dropped significantly, mostly in response to instability in the U.S. housing market. This drop contributed to the value of FS harvests declining annually from FY2005 through FY2010, although the value has been modestly increasing since then. In FY2015, the FS harvested a reported total of 2.5 billion board feet of timber\u2014the largest production since FY2000\u2014for a total of $162.7 million. ", "The FS is increasingly using timber harvests as a tool to achieve various land and resource management objectives or in the context of larger restoration objectives\u2014such as enhancing ecosystem or watershed conditions\u2014in addition to timber production. For example, the FS has permanent authority to enter into stewardship contracts\u2014contracts with private parties for stewardship activities (e.g., thinning to reduce potential wildfire fuels) that include commercial timber to offset some of the stewardship costs. The FS may also harvest trees damaged or killed in fires or other disturbance events\u2014called salvage harvesting\u2014in part to facilitate forest restoration and recovery and also to capture some of the economic value of the federal resources and generate revenue to fund other restoration activities.

", "Some recreation uses, such as the use of off-highway vehicles and snowmobiles in the national forests, have generated controversy. In 2004, the FS chief identified unmanaged recreation \u2014\"increasing use of the national forests for outdoor activities ... including the use of off-highway vehicles\"\u2014as one of the four major threats to the ecological integrity of NFS lands. In response, the agency has been conducting a travel management planning process to designate which national forest roads and trails are available for motorized use and prohibiting their use outside the designated system.", "Recreation on NFS lands also generates significant revenue for the FS. In FY2014, recreation receipts totaled $72.0 million (30% of the total revenue generated). In 2004, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a recreation fee program for the FS (and the other federal land management agencies). The program was set to expire in 2014 but was extended until September 30, 2016. The act authorizes different kinds of fees, outlines criteria for establishing fees, prohibits certain fees, and allows the FS to use collections without further appropriation.

Questions persist over the extent to which FS should manage to protect the wilderness characteristics of the approximately 58.5 million acres of roadless areas by prohibiting or permitting certain uses to occur. In 2001, President Clinton proposed a new rule to prohibit most road construction and timber harvesting in these areas. President George W.

Often, though, the acquisitions are restricted to land within or contiguous to the proclaimed exterior boundaries of a national forest. The first and broadest authority is in the Weeks Act of 1911, which allows the Secretary to purchase \"such forested, cut-over, or denuded lands within the watersheds of navigable streams ... the regulation of the flow of navigable streams or for the production of timber.\" ", "Additional authorities are provided by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937, which authorized the Secretary to acquire submarginal lands and lands not suitable for cultivation. Under this authority, the FS acquired and established the 20 national grasslands and six land utilization projects that account for 2% of the NFS. Other laws authorize land acquisition for the national forests, typically in specific areas or for specific purposes. For example, the Secretary is authorized to acquire access corridors to national forest lands across nonfederal lands. ", "The Secretary also has numerous authorities to dispose or convey national forest land out of federal ownership, all constrained in various ways and seldom used. Often, the authority requires the federal government to dispose of the land at fair market value. The 1897 Organic Act and the 1911 Weeks Act authorize the disposal of land better suited for other uses, such as agriculture or mining. Other authorities include the following:", "The 1958 Townsites Act authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 640 acres adjacent to communities in Alaska or the 11 western states for townsites if the \"indigenous community objectives ... outweigh the public objectives and values which would be served by maintaining such tract in Federal ownership.\" The 1983 Small Tracts Act authorizes the Secretary to dispose of certain lands by sale or exchange if they are valued at no more than $150,000 and meet certain size specifications. Congress authorized the FS to transfer up to 80 acres of NFS land for a nominal cost upon written application of a public school district. The lands may revert back to the federal government, however, if not used for the educational purposes for which they were acquired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Congress considers many issues regarding NFS management. Current debates tend to focus more on particular issues that involve land and resource allocation and valuation, such as balancing increasing demands for commodity and non-commodity uses and services from the national forests. Simultaneously, public interest in how these resource allocation decisions are made and the lands are used has increased. NFS management and administration has thus become more complex and contentious. However, these controversies often derive from questions about the fundamental management principles of multiple use and sustained yield. ", "The meaning and application of the dual concepts of multiple use and sustained yield have been debated since Congress first authorized the reservation of federal land. The debates generally revolve around questions such as these:", "Is multiple use achieved through adjacent or sequential allowance of single resource uses or by simultaneous application of several uses? Is sustained yield management to provide a regular flow of products for human use or to assure the maintenance of the biological productivity of the forest resources? ", "When these management principles were established, Congress conferred considerable discretion on the FS to make those decisions. As concerns arose and persisted about the agency's interpretation of multiple use and sustained yield, Congress began to restrict that discretion by enacting legislation specifying that certain uses occur (or not occur) in specified areas. However, Congress has not enacted legislation directly addressing the concepts of multiple use or sustained yield. ", "Therefore, conflicts arise as users and land managers attempt to balance multiple uses and services and produce a sustained yield of resources from the national forests. Congress often considers legislation to prioritize various national forests uses over others or to define or specify levels of production. For example, Congress has considered legislation to prioritize timber production over other uses or to specify a certain annual output of timber production. In contrast, Congress has also considered legislation that would prioritize recreation, hunting, and fishing over other uses. ", "There are several ongoing concerns regarding wildfire management, including the total federal costs of wildfire management, the strategies and resources used for wildfire management, and the impact of wildfire on both the quality of life and the economy of communities surrounding wildfire activity. Fire control expenditures continue to climb, affecting the implementation of other programs (and thus affecting national forest uses) through personnel and funds transferred to fire control. It is unclear when, whether, and how this cost spiral can be contained."], "subsections": []}]}}
