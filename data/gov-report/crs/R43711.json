Perhaps most prominently, the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110), which amended and reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), marked a dramatic expansion of the federal government's role in supporting standards-based instruction and test-based accountability, thereby increasing the federal government's involvement in decisions that directly affect teaching and learning.", "Under the ESEA, states are required to have standards in reading and mathematics for specified grade levels in order to receive funding under Title I-A of the ESEA. In response to this requirement, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted and implemented standards that meet the requirements of the ESEA. Since the ESEA was last comprehensively reauthorized by NCLB, three major changes have taken place that have possibly played a role in the selection of reading and mathematics standards by states: (1) the development and release of the Common Core State Standards; (2) the Race to the Top (RTT) State Grant competition and RTT Assessment Grants competition; and (3) the ESEA flexibility package provided by ED to states with approved applications. As of August 2014, 43 states, the District of Columbia, 4 outlying areas, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) had at some point adopted the Common Core State Standards. Indiana and Oklahoma recently became the first states to adopt and subsequently discontinue use of the Common Core State Standards. South Carolina has indicated that the Common Core State Standards will be fully implemented for the 2014-2015 school year but will be replaced by new standards in the 2015-2016 school year.", "This report examines each of the aforementioned changes and discusses how they are interrelated. More specifically, it provides (1) background information on current law, (2) a discussion of the development of the Common Core State Standards and state adoption of the standards, (3) an analysis of the RTT State Grant competition and how the structure of the grant application process may have incentivized state adoption of the Common Core State Standards, (4) an examination of the RTT Assessment Grants competition and the federal funds provided to support the development of assessments aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and (5) an analysis of the ESEA flexibility package and how the conditions that states had to meet to receive waivers of ESEA accountability provisions may have incentivized state implementation of the Common Core State Standards. This report also examines prohibitions in the ESEA and the General Education Provisions Act related to standards, assessments, and curriculum. Additionally, it includes a brief discussion of the relationship between teacher and school leader evaluation systems that are being developed by states and the Common Core State Standards.", "Finally, the report examines issues that have arisen in relation to the Common Core State Standards, including the following:", "whether states were incentivized by the Administration to adopt and implement the Common Core State Standards; whether state adoption and implementation of the Common Core State Standards could result in a national assessment and national standards; whether state adoption and implementation of the Common Core State Standards could lead to the development of a national curriculum; possible issues that may need to be addressed if a state chooses to discontinue its use of the Common Core State Standards; possible issues related to teacher evaluation and the Common Core State Standards; possible technology issues related to implementation of the Common Core State Standards; and possible issues related to the long-term maintenance of the Common Core State Standards."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of the nation's schools is a concern at all levels of government.

As Congress contemplates the reauthorization of the ESEA, it may grapple with issues related to standards and assessments and the extent to which requirements related to assessments and standards should be prescribed at the federal level versus determined by the states.", "In the last few years, there has been a grassroots movement spearheaded by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) to develop a common set of standards for mathematics and English/language arts (ELA), known as the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI). Numerous states participated in the process to develop these standards and many agreed to adopt and implement the standards.

Section 9527(b) prohibits ED from using any funds provided to the department under the ESEA \"to endorse, approve, or sanction any curriculum designed to be used in an elementary school or secondary school.\" That is, ED is prohibited from requiring states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools to use specific curricula, and states, LEAs, and schools do not need ED's approval of their curricula in order to receive funds under the ESEA.", "There is also a more general prohibition placed on the federal government with respect to curriculum.

For example, although ED is prohibited from mandating, directing, or controlling a state educational agency's (SEA's), LEA's, or school's adoption of specified standards and assessments, the statutory language does not prevent states from voluntarily establishing such standards or assessments in response to incentives offered by ED. Thus, the statute does not appear to limit the federal government's authority to require states to maintain content standards, performance standards, or assessments as a condition of receiving funding under the ESEA, as occurred under the RTT program, nor does the statutory language prevent ED from imposing similar requirements as a condition of receiving an ESEA waiver. ", "Furthermore, although these provisions do appear to prevent ED from requiring states to adopt specific standards or assessments or to win federal approval of the standards and assessments that states select, ED does not appear to be barred from participating in the development of such standards. It is also important to note that standards and curriculum are not the same thing.

Thus, unless Congress acts to support a federally sponsored national test in a subject area, the Secretary is prohibited from using funds for this purpose.

This flexibility has led to the development of different accountability systems in each state. Concerns related to the diversity of accountability systems as well as concerns related to student mobility, consistent expectations for students, preparation of students for global competition, and skills students need for employment spurred a grassroots movement led by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to develop common standards for ELA and mathematics in grades K-12 (referred to as the Common Core State Standards). This effort is referred to as the Common Core State Standards Initiative. According to the CCSSI, \"The purpose of this state-led initiative ... is to create a rigorous set of shared standards that states can voluntarily adopt. The standards are crafted to 'define the knowledge and skills students should have within their K-12 education careers so they graduate from high school able to succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing academic college courses and workforce training programs.'\"", "The initial discussion of the need to have a common set of high standards began in November 2007 at a meeting of the state education chiefs in Columbus, OH, where the chiefs discussed developing a single-set of standards that would be benchmarked to college- and career-readiness. The following year, the CCSSO, NGA, and Achieve published a report, Benchmarking for Success: Ensuring U.S. Students Receive a World-Class Education , which recommended that state standards be upgraded by adopting a \"common core\" of internationally benchmarked standards in language arts and mathematics for grades K-12. In April 2009, CCSSO and NGA convened chief state school officers and governors' education policy advisors to discuss the CCSSI. By September 2009, governors and chief state school officers from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories were participating in the CCSSI.", "The work to develop the Common Core State Standards was conducted in two phases. During the first phase, which began in summer 2009, two work teams (one for ELA and one for mathematics) developed the first drafts of college- and career-readiness Common Core State Standards. These drafts were reviewed by content experts and subsequently revised in July 2009. In August 2009, the second draft of the standards was provided to state and national organizations for review and comments. The work teams made subsequent revisions to the standards based on these comments. The revised draft of the standards was then released for public comment from September 21, 2009, though October 21, 2009. The standards were revised based on comments received from the public. They were then submitted to the Validation Committee. In September 2009, the CCSSI announced the members of a validation committee that was \"tasked with reviewing and verifying the standards development process and the resulting evidence-based college- and career-readiness standards.\"", "The second phase of work on the standards began in November 2009 with the announcement of the Work Group that would develop the K-12 ELA and mathematics standards that would be aligned with the college- and career-readiness standards. The K-12 Work Group was composed of individuals with varied expertise and experience in areas such as assessment; curriculum design; early childhood education; child development; and elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The Work Group developed multiple drafts of the standards that were shared with a wide range of stakeholders including states, content experts, teachers, professional organizations, civil rights groups, and members of the higher education community. On March 10, 2010, the draft K-12 ELA and mathematics standards were posted for public comment. Nearly 10,000 people provided feedback on the drafts. Based on this feedback, subsequent revisions were made to the standards. Following these revisions, the Validation Committee met to review the standards. The final Common Core State Standards were released on June 2, 2010. ", "Adoption of the standards is optional. However, according to the Common Core State Standard Initiative, a state is considered to have adopted the Common Core State Standards only if (1) a state adopts 100% of the standards in ELA and in mathematics (word for word), \"with the option of adding up to 15% of standards on top of the core\" standards, and (2) the standards-authorizing body in the state has taken formal action to adopt and implement the standards. As of August 2014, 43 states, the District of Columbia, 4 outlying areas, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) had adopted the Common Core State Standards. This total does not include Indiana and Oklahoma, who recently became the first states to adopt and subsequently discontinue use of the Common Core State Standards. South Carolina has indicated that the Common Core State Standards will be fully implemented for the 2014-2015 school year but will be replaced by \"new, high-level College and Career Ready standards\" in the 2015-2016 school year. Minnesota has adopted the ELA Common Core State Standards but not the Common Core State Standards for mathematics. Alaska, Nebraska, Texas, Virginia, and Puerto Rico have not adopted either the Common Core State Standards for ELA or mathematics. ", "It should be noted that the CCSSI did not develop assessments aligned with the standards. While having a set of common standards could arguably lend itself to the development of a single set of assessments that could be used to compare student performance across states, the CCSSI did not develop such assessments.

Different ranges were established for high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality responses. Of a possible 500 maximum points overall, a state could receive up to 40 points for its responses related to developing and adopting common standards and up to 10 points for implementing common, high-quality assessments.

Reviewers were to assign \"medium\" or \"low\" points if the consortium included 50% or fewer of the states in the nation. It should be noted that aside from the Common Core State Standards, there was no other set of standards being developed by a consortium of states that included enough states to meet the criteria to receive \"high\" points.

Reviewers were also given scoring guidance with respect to the date by which the state committed to adopting common standards. \"High\" points were to be awarded to states that committed to adoption by August 2, 2010, for Phase 1 applicants and states that had actually adopted the standards by August 2, 2010, for Phase 2 applicants. \"Low\" points were to be awarded to any state that indicated common standards after August 2, 2010, but before the end of the 2010 calendar year.

Overall, 34 states and the District of Columbia were involved with one or both consortia as of July 30, 2014. State participation in this grant competition was voluntary, and, as noted by ED, the funds awarded support the development of common assessments based on common standards by non-federally affiliated groups. However, a recent survey conducted by Education Week indicates that not all of these states are still planning to use the consortia-developed tests. For example, 17 states are still planning to use the assessments developed by the Smarter Balanced assessment consortium and 9 states and the District of Columbia are still planning to use the PARCC assessment. Of these states, some are considering using a non-consortium test for either grades 3-8 or high school.", "Both the PARCC and Smarter Balanced consortia are using the Common Core State Standards as the common standards to which their assessments will be aligned. All states associated with these consortia are required to use the standards to which the assessments are being aligned and to adopt the assessments being developed by the consortium to which they belong. While states voluntarily joined a consortium knowing that they would be using the Common Core State Standards as their common standards upon which to align their assessments, the availability of RTT funding to develop the assessments may be further incentivizing the adoption and implementation of the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments.

As a result, the RTT program and ESEA flexibility waivers could both be characterized as incentivizing the adoption of Common Core. Such incentives, however, are a common feature of federal grant programs, and they do not appear to violate any current education statute.

Generally, a state's participation in programs that rely on such incentives is viewed as voluntary by the courts. The latter interpretation may be supported by the fact that several states have declined to adopt the Common Core State Standards or to seek flexibility waivers. This view may also be bolstered by Supreme Court doctrine on congressional authority under the spending clause of the Constitution. Under the Court's jurisprudence, a state's participation in a grant program that conditions receipt of federal funds on compliance with federal requirements has traditionally been treated as voluntary, and such conditions have been deemed unconstitutionally \"coercive\" only in rare instances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Standards and National Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Concerns have been expressed that adoption and implementation of the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments will result in national standards and national assessments.

For example, states that adopt the Common Core State Standards are permitted to add additional standards of their own choosing to the Common Core State Standards. Thus, each state adopting and implementing the Common Core State Standards could continue to have a unique set of state standards that share common elements with other adopting states. As a result of the RTT common assessment competition, there will be at least two different assessments linked to the Common Core State Standards, and based on a recent survey conducted by Education Week , it appears that at least 17 states are planning to use something other than the assessments being developed by PARCC and Smarter Balanced.

The state legislature passed legislation that required the state board of education to adopt new college- and career-readiness standards before July 1, 2014. In response, Indiana developed new standards that analysts have found to be similar, \"if not identical,\" to the Common Core State Standards in many areas. The Secretary did not act to revoke Indiana's ESEA flexibility package.

Oklahoma also received a letter from ED indicating that it needed to submit an amendment to its approved ESEA flexibility package. ED has since denied Oklahoma's request for an extension of the approval of its ESEA flexibility package because the state can no longer demonstrate that is has college- and career-ready standards in place. South Carolina has also announced changes in its use of the Common Core State Standards.

Other states, such as Alabama, have considered dropping the Common Core State Standards.", "In general, if a state agrees to adopt and implement the Common Core State Standards and subsequently decides not to use these standards, the consequences of this action will differ depending on whether the state received a RTT grant based on an application that included the use of the Common Core State Standards, had an application approved for the ESEA flexibility package that included use of the Common Core State Standards, or has opted to use the Common Core State Standards only to meet the requirements of ESEA Title I-A. It should be noted that states that are using the Common Core State Standards for the purposes of a RTT grant or the ESEA flexibility package are also using them to meet the requirements of ESEA Title I-A.", "First, if a state received a RTT grant that included use of the Common Core State Standards and the state is no longer going to use those standards, the state would be out of compliance with the terms of its grant agreement. ED could take any action permitted under law in response, including withholding grant funds. For example, ED labeled Hawaii as a \"high-risk\" state for failure to meet its grant commitments. Under the designation of \"high risk,\" Hawaii was able to access grant funds on a cost reimbursement basis only, meaning the state had to submit receipts for all expenditures for ED approval prior to drawing down any funds. In addition, the state was required to notify ED prior to obligating funds. ED also conducted an extensive on-site review in Hawaii, and the state was required to submit extensive monthly reports. ED also threatened to withhold RTT funds from Hawaii if it did not begin to demonstrate progress in meeting the terms of its grant agreement. ", "There is precedent for ED to withhold funds from states for failing to comply with the requirements of their RTT state grants. In January 2014, ED informed Georgia that it was withholding $9.9 million of the state's $400 million RTT grant for failure to implement a performance-based compensation system. The state opted not to ask for an administrative hearing, as the state has until September to resubmit a performance-based compensation plan and possibly recoup some of the RTT funds. Thus, if a state were to be out of compliance with the requirements of its RTT state grant because it had decided to no longer use the Common Core State Standards, there are several actions that ED could take, including the withholding of funds.", "Second, if a state has an approved ESEA flexibility package application that is based on using the Common Core State Standards to meet the principle related to college- and career-ready expectations for all students, ED could revoke the state's ESEA flexibility package if the state ceased using these standards. If this were to occur, the state would revert to operating under the requirements of ESEA current law requirements. For example, this would include making adequate yearly progress (AYP) determinations and applying a specified set of outcome accountability requirements to LEAs and schools that failed to make AYP for at least two consecutive years. As waivers of ESEA requirements are granted at the sole discretion of the Secretary, the actions and the timing of the actions the Secretary may take in response to a state dropping its use of the Common Core State Standards are difficult to predict. The Secretary could choose to discuss the change with the state and consider next steps to either meet the principle in a new way or to revert back to the current law provisions. In addition, a state could act at a future time to comply with the requirements of the ESEA flexibility package and be re-approved.", "There is also precedent for the Secretary to rescind an ESEA flexibility package in an instance where a state has failed to adhere to the plan detailed in the state's application for a waiver. For example, Washington State's request to extend its ESEA flexibility package through the 2014-2015 school year was recently denied by ED as the state had failed to submit final guidelines for its teacher and principal evaluation and support system that met the requirements associated with the approval of its ESEA flexibility package application. This means that the state and its LEAs must resume compliance with ESEA current law requirements starting with the 2014-2015 school year, unless Washington is able to meet the ESEA flexibility package requirements before the start of the school year. ", "More generally, if a state chooses to adopt and implement the Common Core State Standards as its state standards to meet the reading and mathematics standards requirements included in ESEA Title I-A and the state later opts to change its standards, the state would need to adopt and implement a new set of state standards to meet the requirements of Title I-A. This would be the case even if the state were using something other than the Common Core State Standards to meet the requirements of Title I-A and opted to change its standards. The failure to adopt and implement new standards could jeopardize the state's Title I-A funding and funding for any program that bases its funding on the amount of Title I-A funding received (e.g., School Improvement Grants).", "It should also be noted that ED has broad enforcement authority under GEPA. GEPA contains statutory provisions that are applicable to the majority of federal education programs administered by ED (including Title I-A programs), as well as provisions related to the powers and responsibilities of ED. Under GEPA, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient of funds under any applicable program is failing to comply substantially with any legal requirement applicable to the funds, the Secretary may withhold further payments; issue a complaint to compel compliance through a cease and desist order; enter into a compliance agreement with the recipient; or take any other action authorized by law.

Similarly, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the National School Boards Association also expressed their support for the Common Core State Standards, but argued that schools have not had sufficient time to prepare teachers to incorporate the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments into their teaching and that principals lack the preparation to lead efforts to implement the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments, including being able to evaluate teachers' use of the new standards and determining the best professional development to support their teachers in implementing the standards.

The SEA must continue to implement its teacher and principal evaluation systems using multiple measures of student growth and must calculate student growth data based on state assessments during the \"transition year\" (i.e., year of additional flexibility) for all teachers of tested grades and subjects.

One option would be for Congress to amend the ESEA in such a way as to require states to use the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments of either their own choosing or developed by one of the two consortia. Requiring adoption and implementation of a specific set of standards, however, would be more prescriptive than current law which allows states to select their own standards and assessments. Another option would be for Congress to amend the ESEA in such a way that states could choose to, but would not be required to, use the Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments to meet the requirements of Title I-A. Similarly, Congress could opt to not make changes to the current ESEA requirements related to standards and assessments, which would allow states to continue to use the Common Core State Standards. Congress could also choose to eliminate incentives used by the Administration to encourage the use of the Common Core State Standards by prohibiting ED from conditioning the receipt of grants, preferences, or waivers on a state's adoption of common standards.", "Regardless of the option selected, Congress may also wish to make related changes to current law. For example, Congress could alter existing accountability requirements by strengthening or weakening outcome accountability requirements. Related to these issues is whether Congress would modify the current statutory language that requires the adoption and implementation of \"challenging\" academic content standards and academic achievement standards to require the use of \"college- and career-ready standards,\" as has been required by the Administration under the RTT grants and ESEA flexibility package.
