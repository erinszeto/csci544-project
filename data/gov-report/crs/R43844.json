While the issue had been relatively dormant since a proposal offered by the Clinton Administration in the 1990s failed to gain the support of Congress, interest reemerged following budget sequester-related funding cuts to FAA in FY2013. In the 114th Congress, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee ordered H.R. 4441, an FAA reauthorization bill that proposed to establish a government-chartered air traffic services corporation, to be reported. However, the bill was never reported in the House, and the FAA extension act passed by Congress in July 2016 (P.L. 114-190) did not make any organizational reforms regarding air traffic services. Authorizations under that extension expire at the end of FY2017, and debate over air traffic services reform has arisen once more.", "Many other countries have established government corporations, quasi-governmental entities, or private firms to perform air traffic services. While none of these air traffic service organizations are comparable to FAA in terms of their size or complexity, they represent a broad array of organizational models including a large number of wholly government-owned corporations, a public-private partnership model in the United Kingdom, a government-controlled joint stock company in Switzerland, and a fully private nonprofit entity controlled by aviation industry stakeholders in Canada.", "Direct comparisons among these models have been limited. There does not appear to be conclusive evidence that any of these models is either superior or inferior to others or to existing government-run air traffic services, including FAA, with respect to productivity, cost-effectiveness, service quality, and safety and security. Certain corporate and private air traffic service providers have improved cost-effectiveness and performance as a result of access to financial markets to fund large-scale acquisition projects, and of faster implementation of technologies. In this regard, the tax status of a potential air traffic entity's debt could become a significant issue in the United States, as a privatized or a government-owned corporation could end up paying more to borrow in the financial market than the federal government does.", "The prospect of reforming FAA air traffic services raises many unique challenges for congressional consideration, including", "the framework and governance of a future air traffic services corporation; its organizational structure and elements; corporate financing and FAA funding mechanisms; measures to ensure a smooth transition; labor provisions to address legal rights of labor organizations while minimizing potential system disruptions; safety regulation and oversight of the corporation; measures to address corporate liability; and safeguards to assure equitable treatment to the wide array of system users."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For four decades, Congress has intermittently debated whether the public would be better served if air traffic services currently provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were instead provided by an independent entity.

Delays in implementing the satellite-based NextGen air traffic control system have renewed interest in corporate or private models for providing air traffic services. A November 2016 audit report issued by the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General found that costs and timelines for delivering core NextGen transformational technologies remain unclear and that several key elements of NextGen will provide only limited benefits to users for the foreseeable future. In August 2016, the Office of Inspector General found that FAA lacks a clear process for identifying and coordinating high-priority research and development projects to support NextGen development, and ongoing efforts have not be aligned with any long-term vision for NextGen.", "While a proposed privatized model was offered as part of the FAA reauthorization bill considered by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the 114 th Congress (see H.R. 4441 ), Congress included no such proposals in reauthorizing FAA through the end of FY2017 ( P.L. 114-190 ).

Revenue sources for the trust fund include a 7.5% passenger ticket tax, a 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on commercial jet fuel, a 21.8-cent-per-gallon tax on general aviation jet fuel, and other taxes on cargo, frequent flyer awards, international departures and arrivals, and fuel used by planes with fractional ownership. FAA also collects user fees from aircraft that fly in U.S.-controlled airspace but do not take off from or land in the United States.

Although the government was to pay certain transition and startup costs, the corporation's ongoing costs were to come from user fees and other charges imposed by USATS, set so as to satisfy the corporation's obligations without restraining competition or violating obligations under international agreements. The corporation was to carry out a cost allocation study to determine the appropriate fee structures based on air traffic service categories and user categories, including commercial aviation, general aviation, and public-use aviation. The bill, however, would have specifically restricted the corporation from imposing fees on public or military aircraft, as well as on general aviation aircraft not used to provide transportation for compensation or hire. As a government corporation, the proposed corporate entity was to be exempt from corporate taxes.", "General aviation interests largely rejected the proposal, despite specific language exempting general aviation users from air traffic service fees. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) argued that fees charged to general aviation could eventually become a means for funding the proposed USATS. More immediately, however, general aviation groups expressed concern over the airlines' influence on the USATS board.

He argued that organizational disruption could erode safety, and that having airlines participate in the ATC board could lead to decisions that would not put safety first, such as reducing aircraft spacing to increase capacity or cutting back on staffing to control ATC costs and related airline fees. Representative Oberstar also expressed concern that airlines could come to dominate the board and the shaping of corporate policy. He argued that as a natural monopoly, an ATC corporation would not be subject to competitive pressures that would promote efficiency. He pointed to mismanagement among government contractors as a significant factor in delays and cost overruns in air traffic modernization projects like the Advanced Automation System.", "A particularly scathing assessment of the USATS proposal came from May 1994 testimony by the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office, or GAO). GAO rejected the Clinton Administration's conclusion that procurement regulations were a significant factor impeding FAA's progress on ATC modernization initiatives, finding that technical and managerial factors were the root causes of modernization delays and cost overruns. GAO's analysis attributed some of the blame for these problems to poor performance by private contractors. GAO also expressed skepticism that the proposed corporation could achieve financial self-sufficiency, pointing to Amtrak as an example of a corporatized government agency that had responded to financial problems by deferring maintenance and putting off equipment upgrades.

Proposals to replace or augment U.S. aviation taxes with user fees linked to air traffic services have met with considerable opposition. The George W. Bush Administration's proposal to establish user fees for commercial jets and certain other aircraft using busy terminal airspace was not accepted by the 110 th Congress. In both the 110 th and 111 th Congresses, a Senate proposal to impose a $25-per-flight surcharge on commercial flights and general aviation jet traffic was sharply criticized by general aviation interests and was not approved. A proposal by the Obama Administration for a per-flight user charge of $100 on commercial and general aviation jets and turboprops that fly in controlled airspace, first introduced in 2011 and reintroduced in each subsequent FAA budget submission, has not been acted upon by Congress.", "General aviation groups have argued that they would have a relatively small stake in the governance and oversight of an air traffic corporation, and that the concerns of private pilots, corporate jet operators, and noncommercial airports would be overshadowed by those of the airline industry and the major passenger airports. Additionally, general aviation users have often raised concerns that the funding mechanisms for a privatized or corporatized air traffic system could cost them more than the current system of fuel taxes. After indicating its openness to proposals that could lower the costs of flying for general aviation users and address inefficiencies at FAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation group, opposed the 2016 reform proposals because they would have shifted the financing of air traffic services to a system that is user fee-funded. Business aviation interests also raised concerns that the proposed scheme would replace congressional oversight of FAA with a privatized corporate \"board dominated by big airlines,\" warning that \"[g]iving the airlines the unbridled power over our air traffic system, as they have long sought is a dangerous proposition\" offering \"no means for recourse over the decisions of the board.\"", "Labor organizations representing air traffic controllers and FAA technicians had historically favored a move away from FAA to a corporate structure for air traffic control. This sentiment, however, largely shifted to general support of the FAA-managed system after labor gained collective bargaining rights following personnel reforms made in the 1990s. Under these reforms, controllers and other FAA employees were able to bargain collectively for pay, a situation unique in the federal government. Despite contentious contract negotiations between FAA and controllers during the George W. Bush Administration, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) did not advocate for corporatization or privatization. Instead, in 2003 it commissioned a study highlighting the pitfalls of corporatization or privatization. ", "In 2016, NATCA reversed its position and came out in support of H.R. 4441 , indicating that, in its opinion, the proposed legislation addressed its ongoing concerns by offering stable, predictable funding that would address staffing needs to promote safety, efficiency, and innovation and provide services to all segments of the aviation community. Controller support for the proposal was likely bolstered by the inclusion of labor provisions in the bill that would allow employees transferred from FAA to the corporation to continue coverage under federal retirement systems, health benefit programs, and other federal employee benefit programs, and would have provided unions with statutory dispute resolution requirements to smooth collective bargaining negotiations with the corporation.", "Airlines for America, an advocacy group representing several airlines in the United States, has also expressed concern that progress on NextGen, FAA's initiative to modernize the air traffic system by converting to satellite-based navigation and aircraft tracking and digital voice and data communications, has lagged and that Congress has been unable to \"'fix' NextGen through annual appropriations bills, the FAA Reauthorization bill, or additional oversight.\" Airlines for America supported H.R. 4441 , finding that similar reforms have been successful in other countries and would promote funding stability and greater accountability, and would \"make NextGen a reality instead of an unrealized dream.\" Congressional reluctance to accept aviation user fees leaves unanswered the question of how a corporatized or privatized air traffic control system would be funded. In the 114 th Congress, H.R. 4441 would have limited the applicability of user fees to commercial airline operations, thus excluding general aviation and business aviation in particular.

It was expanded further after gaining the attention of the National Performance Review, which endorsed FCT as an effective means of lowering government costs. In 1999, Congress mandated an FAA study to examine further expansion of the program to include all FAA-operated towers without radar capability.

Small propeller planes do not pay additional fees for using traffic control services, except when they fly to or from certain international airports.", "For larger private planes and commercial aircraft, on the other hand, NAV CANADA charges fees that take into account aircraft weight and distance flown through controlled airspace. Rates, based on the maximum operating weight of each type of aircraft, are applied to a formula to assess each flight's costs for air traffic services. For example, a Boeing 737 flying from Toronto to Winnipeg may incur the following charges:", "E n route C harge = En route Rate (0.03194) x En route Weight Factor (8.24621) x En route Distance (1,374 km) = C$ 3 61.89 ; plus Terminal Services Charge (Toronto and Winnipeg) = Terminal Rate (24.14) x\u00a0Terminal Weight Factor (29.242) = C$705.90.", "The total user fee for air traffic services provided for this hypothetical flight (excluding temporary adjustments) would therefore be C$1,067.79.

Operators of smaller jets are permitted to pay a daily use charge that covers both en route and terminal services rather than fees based on weight and distance, and may find this more advantageous. For example, a 15,000-pound business jet making a round trip from Toronto to Winnipeg in a single day would incur charges totaling approximately C$460 based on the aircraft's weight and distance flown, but the operator could elect to pay a flat daily charge of C$331.34 instead.", "The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act ( H.R. 1441 , 104 th Congress) would have authorized the USATS corporation to impose fees on commercial air traffic for its services.

Currently, AATF revenue collections fund these activities, while FAA operations are funded in part by Treasury general fund appropriations. Under a system in which an air traffic services corporation is funded by user fees, the AATF could be retained and the fee collection schedule revised to provide funding for airport improvements and FAA aviation safety and research and development functions. Alternatively, additional fee structures and funds could be established for these activities. However, attempting to encompass FAA funding in the user fee structure for an air traffic services corporation poses several challenges, as outlined below.", "A 2016 GAO report offered several suggestions on transitioning to a user fee-funded structure based on input from officials in selected countries that had implemented user fee systems and transitioned to corporate models for providing air traffic services. Those suggestions included communicating with stakeholders early in the transition about the changes to the financing structure; adopted a transitional or phased approach for moving from current revenue streams such as taxes to user fees; and incorporating risk mitigation mechanisms, such as a dedicated reserve fund, into the finance structure.

The bill stipulated that the fees must comport with the International Civil Aviation Organization's Policy on Charges for Air Navigation Services. It would have prohibited fees on military aircraft, piston engine aircraft, noncommercial jets and turboprops, and air taxi flights servicing remote locations.", "H.R. 4441 did not specify any FAA Operations and Maintenance or any Facilities and Equipment funding derived from the Airport and Airway Trust fund beyond FY2019, the point at which the proposed corporation was to take over air traffic services. The bill, however, sought to authorize Treasury general fund amounts of roughly $1.7 billion annually for FAA Operations and Maintenance in FY2020, 2021, and 2022. This would presumably have allowed for the continued funding of FAA aviation safety programs, including safety oversight or airlines and other aircraft operators as well as safety oversight of the proposed ATC Corporation, included in its Operations and Maintenance portfolio. For FY2019, H.R. 4441 specified $8.374 billion from the trust fund for Operations and Maintenance, and $3,048 for Facilities and Equipment. Beyond FY2019, activities funded under this authorization were to be carried out by the corporation and the costs for conducting those activities were to be recovered through user fees. ", "The bill was silent with respect to how the underlying tax scheme that currently funds the Airport and Airway Trust fund might be modified to reflect that trust fund revenue would no longer be required to provide for providing air traffic services and for related facilities and equipment costs. While it was not addressed in the bill, one option would be to eliminate or reduce passenger ticket taxes and cargo taxes that currently provide substantial revenue to the Airport and Airway Trust fund. This could, in effect, act as an offset to the proposed user fee for commercial operators. If fuel taxes were to remain, revenue collected from these taxes could be used to offset the cost of FAA safety and airport grant programs rather than being applied to the costs of air traffic services. H.R. 4441 did specify funding authorizations for airport grants of more than $3.6 billion annually in FY2020, 2021, and 2022, suggesting that some modification of the current aviation tax scheme would be sought to continue airport grant funding while adjusting tax revenues to reflect the transfer of air traffic services and associated costs to the proposed ATC corporation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal Stability", "paragraphs": ["Funding stability has been one of the key challenges facing corporate air traffic entities, whose operations and fee structures fall under varying degrees of governmental economic regulation. In some cases, government overseers have blocked proposed fee increases, notably in cases where they perceived economic factors contributing to revenue declines to be temporary. Such restrictions can in some case have a destabilizing effect. For example, at its inception, NATS UK was restricted from raising rates beyond a certain level tied to retail price index. This proved problematic following the 9/11 attacks in 2001, when significant declines in commercial aviation activity led to revenue shortfalls for NATS UK.", "Various countries have adopted different approaches to addressing the challenge of maintaining fiscal stability for air traffic service providers while controlling rates. NAV CANADA is required to set rates at reasonable levels commensurate with current and future financial requirements, but has been permitted to establish a formal rate stabilization account so it need not raise or lower rates every time air traffic declines or increases. New Zealand has approached this issue quite differently by giving Airways NZ more autonomous self-regulation with regard to fee setting. Under this arrangement, Airways NZ has entered into agreements with stakeholders to create a structure under which Airways NZ sets rates in a stabilized manner, applying excess revenues as adjustments or credits to reduce user charges in subsequent years. This approach, which yielded minimal increases in user charges during the post-2001 decline in air traffic, was lauded by the International Air Transport Association, an international trade organization for airlines, in 2003.", "The 2016 GAO report concluded that building risk mitigation mechanisms into the financial structure of a stand-alone air traffic services corporation may help establish fiscal resilience to downturns in air traffic that reduce user fee revenues. To avoid situations in which a highly leveraged company may become troubled if faced with an unanticipated drop in air traffic and user fee revenues, GAO pointed to NAV CANADA's establishment of its rate stabilization account as a means to provide reserve funds to offset decreased revenues, maintain strong liquidity for covering operating costs and servicing debt, and help stabilize user fees so that they are less likely to rise significantly during economic downturns, when fee increases would most likely impose a larger burden on system users.

Similarly, the United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act ( H.R. 1441 , 104 th Congress) would have given the proposed USATS corporation specific authority to incur debt through notes or other obligations either to the U.S. Treasury or to private entities through instruments such as corporate bonds. The bill would have capped the corporation's total outstanding balance on all debts at $15 billion. Plans to incur debt would have required the review and approval of the Secretary of Transportation under the proposal.", "If it wished to give an independent air traffic control corporation the ability to issue bonds, Congress would face consideration of the tax status of those instruments. Publicly owned airports generally issue tax-favored municipal bonds to meet their capital needs; as investors are not liable for taxes on the interest payments, the issuers can obtain lower interest rates than are available with taxable bonds.", "Privately owned companies and U.S. government entities, however, generally do not have access to the tax-exempt bond market. Unless Congress were to dictate otherwise, debt issued by an air traffic control corporation owned by private investors or by the U.S. government would be taxable to investors, requiring the corporation to pay higher interest rates than borrowers of similar credit quality in the municipal bond market. In addition, the corporation might have to pay higher interest rates on borrowings than the U.S. government itself, unless the government pledged its full faith and credit to servicing the corporation's debt. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act ( H.R. 1441 , 104 th Congress) would have specifically exempted the proposed USATS and interest on its debts from any state and local taxes, although the bill was silent with respect to federal taxes imposed on holders of the corporation's debt.", "H.R. 4441 (114 th Congress) included language specifying that any debt assumed by the proposed ATC Corporation would not have any implied or explicit backing or guarantee from the federal government. While the bill sought to establish the ATC Corporation as a not-for-profit entity exempt from corporate taxes under the provisions of section 501(a) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, this would not create any particular tax-related incentives for investors owning the corporation's bonds. The legislation did not provide any explicit tax-preferred treatment to debt issued by the proposed corporation. The lack of government backing or tax incentives may make debt instruments issued by the corporation less attractive to investors. Therefore, the corporation may need to repay money at higher interest rates than, for example, municipal bonds that may offer tax-related incentives for investing or government-backed bonds that may be regarded as less risky investment alternatives.

Anecdotal accounts of fiscal problems faced by corporate and private air traffic service providers suggest that the availability of start-up capital or other mechanisms to stabilize funding during the transition period may be important considerations. During the transition, a start-up fund or similar instrument may help assure that the entity has sufficient operating funds to stabilize itself in the case of unforeseen external events that could significantly impact revenues. Transition plans may therefore want to consider explicit provisions regarding financing for startup and transition costs and mechanisms to ensure the corporation's fiscal stability during the early years.

In general, those provisions allow for lawful strikes or lock-outs as a measure of last resort once collective bargaining obligations have been met. A special provision in law requires a labor organization to give notification 10 days prior to striking, picketing, or engaging in any other concerted refusal to work at any health care facility. No similar provision currently exists for air traffic facilities. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act ( H.R. 1441 , 104 th Congress) would have given corporation employees the right to form a union and bargain collectively, but would have expressly prohibited strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns. Airlines are generally covered under the Railway Labor Act, which bars strikes over minor disputes and permits them over major disputes only after all other negotiations and mediation procedures have been exhausted.

All experts polled by GAO agreed that aviation safety oversight and regulation should remain an FAA responsibility. However, experts were split on whether a newly formed ANSP should play a role in defining navigational procedures and other flight operational standards regarding airspace users' interactions with and use of air traffic services. Most experts surveyed expressed the view that global harmonization efforts should be a responsibility of both the safety regulator and the ANSP. GAO emphasized the importance of clearly delineating and documenting roles, noting that current FAA orders and directives would need to be codified to clearly document regulatory requirements of any new stand-alone ANSP that was completely separate from the safety regulator. It also concluded that a defined transitional period would likely be needed to clearly establish roles and responsibilities, noting that during the transition in Canada, the safety regulator (Transport Canada) and the ANSP (NAV CANADA) agreed not to make any changes regarding operations during the first two years, keeping procedures and manuals of operation consistent during that time.
