They also argue that it will encourage economic reform and strengthendemocracy in affected countries. Many regional officials favor the pact because it provides newaccess to the U.S. market and makes permanent many of the temporary one-way duty-free tradepreferences currently in place. Critics argue that the environmental and labor provisions areinadequate, that the pact will lead to the loss of jobs for workers in the United States and forsubsistence farmers in Central America, and that provisions relating to textiles/apparel and sugar willbe harmful to U.S. producers.

These five countries were linked during colonial times and formed a confederation for a number ofyears following independence in 1821. Two other countries in Central America have distinctivebackgrounds. Panama was a part of Colombia until it achieved independence in 1903, and hadspecial links to the United States because of the Panama Canal. Belize was a British territory knownas British Honduras until it achieved independence in 1981, and has close ties to theEnglish-speaking countries of the Caribbean Community (Caricom). ", "In a first wave of regional integration in the 1960s, the five core countries formed the CentralAmerican Common Market (CACM) in 1960 to encourage economic growth. The CACM performed extremely well in the first decade of its existence, but it largely collapsed in the 1970s and1980s as the countries, many with military-controlled regimes, were embroiled in long and costlycivil conflicts that exacerbated the region's economic and social problems.", "A second wave of regional integration developed in the 1990s, following peace initiativesin El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala that eventually led to peace accords and democraticallyelected governments. In 1991 and 1993, the presidents of the Central American countries, includingPanama, signed two protocols that created a new integration mechanism known as the CentralAmerican Integration System (SICA) that is designed to facilitate the creation of a customs unionamong the countries and to encourage cooperation in a range of activities. Belize joined the regionalintegration system in December 2000, and the Dominican Republic became an associate member inDecember 2003.

Under the pact, over80% of U.S. consumer and industrial products will receive duty-free treatment from regionalcountries immediately, and that percentage will rise to 85% within five years and to 100% withinten years. More than 50% of U.S. farm products will have immediate duty free status, and tariffs onmore sensitive products will be phased out within 15-20 years. Textile and apparel will be duty-freeand quota-free if they meet the rules of origin. Consumer and industrial goods from regional partnersalready entering the United States duty free under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act willhave consolidated and permanent treatment so that nearly all industrial goods will enter the UnitedStates duty free immediately. The agreement also contains provisions on services, intellectualproperty rights, government procurement, and labor and environmental protections. (7) ", "Views of the agreement vary considerably. According to U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick,the original CAFTA agreement \"will streamline trade; promote investment; slash tariffs on goods;remove barriers to trade in services; provide advanced intellectual property protections; promoteregulatory transparency; strengthen labor and environmental conditions; and, provide an effectivesystem to settle disputes.\" (8) The U.S. Business Roundtable said that \"this agreement can serve as a model of how developing andindustrial nations can work together to find consensus on trade liberalization.\" (9) In early January 2005, theNational Association of Manufacturers in announcing its agenda for the 109th Congress urgedapproval of the DR-CAFTA agreement. On January 26, 2005, 151 companies and associationsforming the Business Coalition for U.S. Central America Trade sent letters to House and Senateleaders urging action on the pact to provide \"full and reciprocal access\" for U.S. producers, ratherthan the unilateral access that presently exists. (10) In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee and theHouse Ways and Means Committee in mid-April 2005, Acting USTR Peter F. Allgeier restatedAdministration arguments that the agreement involved small countries with large and importantmarkets, and USTR-nominee Rob Portman reiterated those arguments in his confirmation hearingbefore the Senate Finance Committee on April 21, 2005. They also argued that the agreement willstrengthen economic reform and democracy in the affected countries.", "On the other hand, labor and environmental groups and some members of Congress foundthe labor and environmental provisions to be inadequate. (11) The Alliance for Responsible Trade, a coalition ofnon-governmental organizations, criticized the CAFTA for having weak labor and environmentalprovisions while containing strong investor and intellectual property rights for businesses. (12) The DominicanParticipation and Consultation on Free Trade, a coalition of Dominican church and cultural groupsin New York City, expressed similar concerns about the integration of the Dominican Republic intothe CAFTA agreement. (13) On the eve of the signing of the CAFTA pact with CentralAmerican countries on May 28, 2004, several Democratic Members from the House and the Senatecriticized the labor and environmental provisions of the agreement. (14) About the same time,presumptive Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry indicated that he would renegotiatethe agreement if he were elected President to strengthen the labor and environment provisions. (15) In mid-December 2004,a number of labor unions and non-governmental organizations filed petitions with the USTRclaiming that Central American countries should be denied GSP benefits because of the failure torespect internationally recognized labor rights. (16) More recently, Representative Sander Levin and Senator JeffBingaman argued that the reports of the International Labor Rights Fund, funded by the U.S.Department of Labor, demonstrate that the countries' labor protections fall short of ILO standards,but the Department of Labor countered that the reports were biased. (17) ", "Major Issues. The four most contentious issueswhen Congress considered the agreement were agriculture, apparel/textiles, and the labor andenvironment provisions.", "Agriculture. Under the agreement, more than 50%of U.S. farm products will have immediate duty free status in Central American markets, and tariffson more sensitive products will be phased out within 15-20 years. For white corn, recognized as themost sensitive product for Central America because it is produced by subsistence farmers and is usedas a staple in the making of tortillas, a quota equal to the current import level will increase about 2%each year, while the high over-quota tariff will remain in force. While nearly all Central Americanfarm products will have permanent duty-free status in U.S. markets, quotas for more sensitiveproducts (sugar, beef, peanuts, dairy products, tobacco, and cotton) will increase gradually. Forsugar, recognized as the most sensitive product for U.S. negotiators, the regional countries receivedan immediate 107,000 metric tons increase in their current sugar quota and regular yearly increases,but the high over-quota tariffs remain fully in force. USTR notes that the permitted increases insugar imports from regional countries would be equal to about 1.3% of U.S. sugar production in thefirst year, and would grow to only 1.9% in 15 years. While many U.S. commodity organizationssupport the DR-CAFTA agreement, the U.S. sugar industry opposes it on grounds that the increasein the quota sets a precedent for other free trade agreements and would result in a substantial increasein sugar imports that would be damaging to U.S. producers. (18) In mid-June 2005, theAdministration offered to consider ways to ameliorate any possible damage to sugar producers, butmajor sugar growers associations announced on June 23, 2005, that no acceptable agreement hadbeen achieved. (19) Othercritical groups argue that it is unfair to pit highly subsidized U.S. agricultural interests against thepoor subsistence farmers in Central America, and they argue that the result will be that these ruralfarmers will lose their livelihoods as they did in Mexico under NAFTA. (20) On January 27, 2005, theRanchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America (R-CALF USA)representing cattleman and ranchers in 46 states joined the Americans for Fair Trade in calling forCongress to reject the DR-CAFTA pact, primarily because the agreement lacks safeguard provisionsfor U.S. producers in the event of a rapid increase in Central American imports. In conjunction withthe votes in the relevant committees and in the Senate in late June 2005, the Administrationpromised to take measures to limit sugar imports from the region and to study the feasibility of usingsugar for the production of ethanol, but the sugar industry reasserted its opposition to theagreement. (21) ", "Apparel/Textiles. Under the agreement, textiles andapparel will be duty-free and quota-free immediately under more liberal rules of origin, and thecoverage will be retroactive to January 1, 2004. Duty-free treatment will be accorded to someapparel produced in Cental America and the Dominican Republic that contains certain fabrics fromNAFTA partners Mexico and Canada, or from other countries in the case of fabrics and materialsdeemed to be in \"short supply\" in the United States and Central America. Some U.S. textile groupsannounced early on that they would oppose DR-CAFTA because of the more liberal rules of originthat, in their view, would lead to the closure of more textile mills in the United States. (22) In early May 2005, withindications from the USTR of modifications in provisions dealing with pocketing and linings, theNational Council of Textile Organizations voted to support DR-CAFTA. In conjunction with the lateJuly vote in the House, the Administration promised more favorable provisions for apparel and sockproducers. (23) ", "Labor. According to the USTR, DR-CAFTA laborprovisions go beyond the provisions in the Chile and Singapore free trade agreements to create athree-part strategy to strengthen worker rights. Under the agreement, the countries are required toenforce their own domestic labor laws and that obligation is enforceable through the regular disputeresolution procedures. In addition, the countries agree to work with the International LaborOrganization (ILO) to improve existing laws and enforcement, and technical assistance is providedto enhance the capacity of Central American countries to monitor and enforce labor rights. TheEmergency Committee for American Trade, composed of leading U.S. international businessenterprises, argues that the labor rights protections in the CAFTA pact are as strong or stronger thanthose found in the U.S.-Jordan FTA. (24) ", "The AFL-CIO has argued that the FTA labor provisions are deficient, because they wouldrequire only the enforcement of current domestic labor laws, which are viewed as woefullyinadequate, and would lead to continuing job losses in the United States. The U.S. labororganization argues that the provisions in the agreement are weaker than the existing beneficiaryrequirements under the Generalized System of Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Trade PromotionAct that require that a country be taking steps to afford workers \"internationally recognized workerrights.\" (25) A numberof members of Congress have argued that the agreement should include an enforceable commitmentby the countries to implement internationally recognized labor standards. (26) ", "Seeking to bridge the gap between the critics and the proponents, a scholar at the Center forGlobal Development has argued for greater enforcement of existing laws while continuing tostrengthen workers rights. (27) In keeping with this approach, the Ministers responsible fortrade and labor in the DR-CAFTA countries met in Washington, D.C. on July 13, 2004, andcommitted to strengthen and enhance labor law compliance and enforcement. (28) With assistance from theInter-American Development Bank, the U.S. Department of Labor, and USAID, the countries arestriving to build labor and environmental law enforcement capacity through a $20 million assistancepackage provided by the United States. ", "In mid-December 2004, a number of labor unions and non-governmental organizations filedpetitions with the USTR claiming that Central American countries should be denied GSP benefitsbecause they had failed to make progress in respecting internationally recognized labor rights. (29) More recently, as indicatedabove, Representative Sander Levin and Senator Jeff Bingaman argued that the reports of theInternational Labor Rights Fund, funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, demonstrate that thecountries' labor protections fall short of ILO standards, but the Department of Labor countered thatthe reports were biased. (30) In conjunction with the votes in the relevant committees and inthe Senate in late June 2005, the Administration promised to support assistance of $40 million peryear in FY2006 through FY2009 for regional countries to strengthen the enforcement of labor andenvironmental standards as well as assistance for regional farmers who might be adversely affectedby the pact. (31) ", "Environment. USTR claims that DR-CAFTAcontains an innovative environmental chapter that goes beyond the Chile and Singapore agreementsto develop \"a robust public submission process to ensure that views of civil society are appropriatelyconsidered.\" It also includes provisions on cooperative actions and the establishment of anEnvironmental Cooperation Commission. A number of members of Congress have argued that theenvironmental provisions are weaker than those found in the NAFTA pact, and they have beenarguing for a more effective citizen petition process that could be used to encourage a country'scompliance with environmental laws. (32) Seeking to strengthen environmental monitoring, the sevenDR-CAFTA countries signed two supplemental agreements in February 2005, one to establish anindependent multilateral secretariat to administer public submissions under the pact, and the otheran Environmental Cooperation Agreement (ECA) to encourage regional cooperation onenvironmental matters. (33) As indicated above, the U.S. Congress approved $20 million inFY2005 assistance to enhance the capacities of the DR-CAFTA countries to strengthen and enforcelabor and environmental standards, and the Administration promised in June 2005 to supportassistance of $40 million per year in FY2006 through FY2009 for the same purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Pact Approvals", "paragraphs": ["Early Approvals of Pact.

Submission was complicated as well by U.S. disputes with theDominican Republic and Guatemala and by the vacancy in the leadership of the USTR whenAmbassador Robert Zoellick became the Deputy Secretary of State. The dispute with the DominicanRepublic over the country's October 2004 tax on soft drinks sweetened with imported high fructosecorn syrup (HFCS) was resolved in early January 2005 when that tax was repealed. The dispute withGuatemala over a December 2004 law that limited test data protection for pharmaceutical productswas resolved in early March 2005 when the Guatemalan Congress modified the legislation.

During a regional recession in the 1980s,Costa Rica borrowed heavily, to the point that it defaulted on its foreign debt in 1983. Succeedingstructural adjustment agreements with the International Monetary Fund and other internationalfinancial institutions brought about a liberalization of the economy, and the privatization of most ofits state-owned enterprises.

In recentdecades, the country has pursued foreign direct investment, the development of its export sector, anddiversification from agriculture-based exports. GDP amounted to $18.5 billion in 2004, with agrowth rate of 4%, despite a downturn in prices for two of its major agricultural exports -- bananasand coffee -- and a decrease in demand for computer components.

Disagreements withthe United States with regard to opening the state-owned telecommunications and insurance sectorsled Costa Rica to withdraw from the initial CAFTA negotiations one day before the final agreementwas announced. Following bilateral negotiations between the United States and Costa Rica inJanuary 2004, Costa Rica was included in the CAFTA agreement. Costa Rica also has signed freetrade agreements with Canada, Chile, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Trinidadand Tobago. The countries of Central America now have tariff-free access to the U.S. market onapproximately three-quarters of their products through the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act( P.L. 106-200 , Title II) which expires in September 2008.

While the five Central American nations agreed to present a unifiednegotiating position to the United States, each had its own interests and objectives. Costa Ricasought greater foreign investment in certain strategic areas, such as electronics assembly, health careproducts and business service centers. While agricultural products have been important to itseconomy, their decreasing export value has meant that the focus instead has shifted tomanufacturing. Costa Rica also anticipated that an FTA with the United States would have apositive impact both on tourism and the productivity of its export sector. (51) ", "Telecommunications and Insurance. Thetelecommunications sector is the most sophisticated in Central America, but unlike its neighboringcountries, it is state-owned, and proposals for privatization have been very controversial. The useof the Internet and electronic commerce is relatively advanced, but the system is inadequate giventhe demand. Although most of the country's state-owned companies were privatized in the 1990s,Costa Ricans strongly oppose privatizing the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE), which operatesboth power and telecommunications. President Pacheco is interested in restructuring ICE in someform in order to reduce its burden on the national budget and to modernize its infrastructure to attractmore high technology firms to the country. Intel's General Manager has stated that the lack ofmodernization, especially Internet connections and speed, were directly hindering the company'sgrowth in Costa Rica.

Costa Rica's has long resisted calls to liberalize its telecommunications and insurancesectors. This disagreement came into sharper focus during U.S. Trade Representative RobertZoellick's trip to the region in early October 2003 during which he stated to Costa Rican officials thatan open telecommunications sector was necessary in order to conclude an agreement, and that aCAFTA agreement could proceed without Costa Rica. These comments were met with displeasurefrom both Costa Rican union leaders and business executives who argued that the NAFTAagreement allows Mexico to maintain state ownership of oil and the U.S.-Chile Free TradeAgreement allows Chile the same privilege in regard to copper. They contend that this sets aprecedent for Costa Rica to keep its state monopoly.", "At the final round of CAFTA negotiations, Costa Rica decided that the agreement, as it stood,was not in its best interests, and its negotiators withdrew. Later comments from U.S. officialsclarified that complete privatization of the telecommunications sector would not be necessary as longas the private sector could participate in some telecommunications activities, such as mobile phoneand internet service.

Nonetheless, Costa Rica supported the region's singlenegotiating position of wanting a more liberal rule than is now included in the Caribbean BasinTrade Preference Act, which provides for a \"yarn forward\" rule in which U.S. made fabrics must befrom U.S. produced yarn. For a CAFTA agreement, the Central Americans preferred that apparelmakers could acquire yarn from the United States, Central America, or third countries that have tradeagreements with either. This means that potential suppliers could also be from Mexico, Canada, orChile. U.S. negotiators proposed a rule allowing for the use of third country providers wherecomponents are in short supply. The Central Americans wanted tariff preference levels to provideduty-free access, under a negotiated cap, for apparel that is assembled in the region from fabric thatis made elsewhere. This position was opposed by the U.S. textile industry. (54) ", "Agriculture. Agricultural issues presented somedifficulties in negotiations, as the Central Americans wanted the United States to address its farmsubsidies, while they wanted unhindered access to the U.S. market for their agricultural products. Costa Rica's two main agricultural exports, bananas and coffee, have experienced declining priceson the world market in recent years. In the final agreement, Costa Rica is to eliminate tariffs onnearly all agricultural products within 15 years, on chicken leg quarters within 17 years, and on riceand dairy products within 20 years. Costa Rica also negotiated an increase in its sugar export quotathat will reach 14,860 tons by the 15th year of the agreement and won general protection for freshonions and potatoes in the agreement. Trade of these latter two products will be liberalized throughexpansion of a tariff-rate quota.", "Environment. With the signing of twoenvironmental agreements on February 18, 2005, at least one Costa Rican environmentalorganization, the Global Alliance for Humane Sustainable Development, has endorsed theDR-CAFTA agreement.

The report estimates that 12% of the laborforce is unionized, and that some 80% of all union members are public sector employees. Unionsoperate independently of the government. The International Labor Organization (ILO) noted delaysin addressing workers' formal grievances and the enforcement of reparations. A recent report byCentral American trade officials reported that the Constitution and labor code provide strongprotections for fundamental labor rights.

The State Department reports that the minimum wage was not sufficient toprovide a worker and his family at the lower end of the wage scale with a decent standard of living. Costa Rican law on health and safety in the workplace requires industrial, agricultural andcommercial firms with ten or more workers to establish a joint management-labor committee onworkplace conditions, and allows the government to inspect workplaces and to fine employers. TheState Department reports that insufficient resources have been provided to the Ministry of Labor toenforce health and safety legal requirements.

Costa Rica is party to theWTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) and has enacted oramended its regulations to harmonize them with its international obligations. The U.S. TradeRepresentative's 2004 Foreign Trade Barriers Report noted that enforcement remains a problem withregard to the protection of copyrights, patents, and trademarks and that the country's criminal codelimits effective deterrence of intellectual property crimes. Despite this, USTR placed Costa Rica onits less severe Special 301 Watch List in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The International IntellectualProperty Alliance, a U.S.-industry organization, also cites Costa Rica's insufficient enforcementactivities and levels of fines, which they argue do not deter the infringement of intellectual property. The group estimates that trade losses due to piracy in Costa Rica totaled $17.6 million in 2002, thelatest year for which an estimate is provided. (57) ", "Approval Status. In September 2005, PresidentPacheco announced that he would send the DR-CAFTA agreement to the unicameral Costa RicanLegislative Assembly for consideration.

During the 1990s, the DominicanRepublic underwent rapid economic growth and developed stronger democratic institutions.

A second positive step for the Salvadoran laborforce occurred when El Salvador was selected as one of the first countries to get Department ofLabor funding (through the ILO) for a program to stop the worst forms of child labor. On July 14,2004, El Salvador's Ministers of Trade and Labor, along with their counterparts from the otherDR-CAFTA countries, formed a Working Group that, with support from the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, would ensure that progress is made on improving labor standards in the region.

The Law of Trademarks and Other Distinctive Signs (2002) was established in order to bring ElSalvador into better compliance with TRIPS. The Attorney General's office is charged withenforcement of these laws, conducting periodic raids against manufacturers and distributors ofpirated goods. As of 2002, the focus of these raids has shifted from software to pirated CDs. Despite better laws protecting intellectual property and increased raids, U.S. companies in ElSalvador incurred trade losses of $4.0 billion in 2003 due to software privacy and $1.5 millionbecause of music piracy.

President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os, of the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC), was electedto a five-year term in November 2001, in elections widely regarded as being free and fair. Bola\u00c3\u00b1os,a businessman in the agricultural sector, defeated Daniel Ortega, a prominent figure in Nicaraguanpolitics for over 25 years. During the 1980s, Bola\u00c3\u00b1os's farm service company was nationalized, andhe was jailed for his opposition to the Sandinista government. During the 2001 presidentialcampaign, Bola\u00c3\u00b1os emphasized the importance of maintaining positive relations with the UnitedStates. He faces the challenges of stimulating economic growth in the hemisphere's second poorestcountry, and promoting democratic reform while pursuing prosecutions for corruption in theprevious administration. The Bush Administration has praised and supported Bola\u00c3\u00b1os'santi-corruption efforts. Others have criticized Bola\u00c3\u00b1os for employing a \"confrontational route\" offighting corruption by going after top officials, including Aleman, rather than seeking allies whowould help him make long-term reforms in the country's corrupt political system.

He served as President from 1985-1990, having wonelections which much of the international community deemed fair, but which were boycotted bymuch of the opposition and deemed unfair by the Reagan Administration. Ortega's administrationwas marked by a bloody civil war with the U.S.-backed \"contras,\" and charges of corruption. In thecontext of the Central American Peace Plan, Ortega's Sandinista government agreed tointernationally monitored democratic elections in February 1990. Ortega ran for president, and lost,in 1990, 1996, and 2001. The Sandinistas control 38 of the 92 seats in the National Assembly. Theyappear to have capitalized on divisions between President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os and the PLC, which is controlledby imprisoned former president Arnoldo Aleman, to garner important victories in the municipalelections held on November 7, 2004. The Sandinistas swept those polls, winning some 87 of 152municipal seats. In March 2005 the FSLN named Ortega its candidate for 2006 presidentialelections.

The United Nations recently named Aleman as one of the world's five most corruptliving ex-leaders. (188) The effort is particularly notable, because Bola\u00c3\u00b1os and Aleman not only belong to the same politicalparty, but Bola\u00c3\u00b1os also served as Aleman's Vice-President until he stepped down to run for president. Aleman was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2003 for fraud and money-laundering; heis currently under house arrest. His supporters are still trying to negotiate his release, however.

President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os denies those charges, and thelegislative committee dropped its initial investigation. In October 2004, the Comptroller General'soffice, whose panel consists of members of the Sandinista and Liberal parties in opposition toBola\u00c3\u00b1os, issued a report renewing charges of fraud against the President. The opposition has usedthe report to promote impeachment efforts, despite the Supreme Electoral Council's having earliercertified that Bola\u00c3\u00b1os had not committed election finance irregularities.

In late 2004, renegotiationof the pact included a demand for Aleman's release. In January 2005, their two parties adopted aseries of constitutional amendments that transferred presidential powers to the legislature and furtherdivided up government institutions as political patronage. The Central American Court of Justiceruled the amendments illegal. The ruling is non-binding, and the Nicaraguan Supreme Court, whichis dominated by pacto party members, ignored it. After meeting with President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os, DanielOrtega announced on October 16, 2005, that he had broken the pact with the Aleman faction of theLiberal party.

Some observers say these protests areorchestrated by the opposition and not supported by public opinion. The government negotiated anend to the fare increase protests in late April. Polls published in May (La Prensa, May 2, 2005)showed 68% of the population opposed the call for Bola\u00c3\u00b1os' resignation, and the highest portion, almost 35%, believed Daniel Ortega was primarily responsible for the violent protests in the capital.
