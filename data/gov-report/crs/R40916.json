The House has passed a comprehensive bill, H.R. 2749, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has reported its comprehensive proposal, S. 510. The ultimate goal of both bills is to reduce the burden of foodborne illness, which is a considerable and persistent public health problem in the United States. However, an understanding of the true burden of illness caused by foodborne hazards, the risks associated with various types of foods, and the types of regulatory and other approaches that can effectively address these problems has been elusive.", "Public health officials monitor and investigate foodborne illnesses in a number of ways. For example, active surveillance is used to track trends in the incidence of several common bacterial and parasitic foodborne illnesses. Outbreaks of foodborne illness are tracked to help improve approaches to investigation and to identify the foods that cause illnesses, among other things. Genetic \"fingerprinting\" is used to identify infections from a common source, including large multistate outbreaks, and can also help identify the foods that cause illnesses. These systems are administered jointly by various federal agencies, in partnership with state health officials. Collectively, these tools and others can shed light on the burden of foodborne illness in the United States, and ways to decrease it. However, these systems also have two significant shortcomings. First, because they monitor a limited number of known food safety threats, and because foodborne illnesses are substantially underreported, these systems do not, individually or collectively, capture the magnitude of foodborne illness that occurs each year. Second, these systems often detect or track the contaminant that causes illness, rather than the type of food that was contaminated, although it is the latter that government officials actually regulate.", "Consumers and the media often focus on recalls\u2014particularly those that are extensive and/or that involve widely consumed products\u2014as indicators of the safety of the U.S. food supply. In many but certainly not all cases, products subject to a recall may have sickened or killed people or other animals. It is not always clear, however, how useful recall data are as a measure of the burden of foodborne illness or the effectiveness of federal food safety programs. For example, does a relatively high number of recalls signify a failure of the system to keep unsafe products from being consumed? Or is it actually an indication that the safety net is working by finding and getting tainted products off the market? Conversely, is a relatively low number of recalls an indication of the system's effectiveness, or simply of not reporting or finding all defective food products? Because of these questions, caution should be exercised in using recall data as the basis for concluding that certain changes are needed in the nation's food safety systems.", "This report describes several systems to monitor foodborne illnesses, discussing their strengths and the gaps that remain in understanding the burden of foodborne illness in the United States. Next, this report presents recent data on more serious recalls of FDA-regulated foods, also discussing the strengths and gaps associated with the information.

FDA has lead responsibility for ensuring the safety of all human and animal foods except those from the major meat and poultry species, catfish, and some egg products. These latter types of foods are within the purview of FSIS. According to GAO, FDA-regulated foods account for 80% of at-home U.S. food spending. In addition to federal activities, states may play a substantial role in food facility inspections, outbreak investigations, and other food safety activities, particularly with respect to FDA-regulated foods.", "The 111 th Congress is considering legislation to revise the U.S. food safety system, focusing primarily on those laws and programs administered by FDA. Both the House and Senate have introduced comprehensive bills that address a number of perceived problems with the current food safety system.

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has reported S. 510 , the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The bills cover much of the same material, although they differ somewhat in their specific approaches. Among other things, both bills would expand registration requirements for food facilities and require facilities to implement food safety plans based on assessments of risk. Also, both bills would require FDA to conduct periodic safety inspections, expand the agency's access to industry records, and allow the agency to mandate that companies conduct recalls of unsafe products. Both bills would also set new standards for produce safety and place more scrutiny on imported foods.", "The FDA faces considerable challenges in assuring the safety of the foods for which it is responsible. The complexity of the food distribution system is steadily increasing. Processed foods, in particular, may contain dozens of ingredients with domestic and imported origins. Similarly, a contaminated ingredient may find its way into dozens of seemingly unrelated products, including foods for both humans and animals. The ultimate goal of the House and Senate food safety bills is to reduce foodborne illness, which is a considerable and persistent public health problem in the United States. However, a comprehensive understanding of the burden of illness caused by foodborne hazards, the risks posed by different types of foods, and the types of safeguards that can effectively address these problems has been elusive.", "This report describes several systems to monitor foodborne illnesses and define the burden of this public health problem in the United States.

However, these tools also have two significant shortcomings. First, because they monitor a limited number of known food safety threats, and because foodborne illnesses are substantially underreported, these systems do not, individually or collectively, capture the magnitude of foodborne illness that occurs each year. Second, they often detect the contaminant that causes illness, rather than the type of food that was contaminated, although it is the latter that government officials actually regulate. These concepts are discussed below, followed by descriptions of three key federal foodborne illness monitoring systems: FoodNet active surveillance of individual cases of foodborne illness; surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks; and PulseNet genetic \"fingerprinting\" of certain foodborne pathogens. Key definitions are provided in a text box, below.", "Because the existing foodborne illness surveillance systems do not identify all cases of foodborne illness, health officials can only estimate the true burden of illness in the population. In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published such an estimate for the United States, saying that on average, about 76 million people become sick, 325,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 die each year from foodborne illnesses caused by one or more of a number of microbial pathogens and other contaminants. The authors noted that most foodborne illnesses are not reported to authorities, and are therefore not reflected in foodborne illness surveillance data. They also reported that", "many pathogens transmitted through food are also spread through water or from person to person, thus obscuring the role of foodborne transmission. Finally, some proportion of foodborne illness is caused by pathogens or agents that have not yet been identified and thus cannot be diagnosed. The importance of this final factor cannot be overstated. Many of the pathogens of greatest concern today (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni , [E. coli] O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes , [and] Cyclospora cayetanensis ) were not recognized as causes of foodborne illness just 20 years ago. ", "CDC's estimate was derived from a variety of data sources, dating from 1997 and earlier. The agency is in the process of revising the estimate.", "As noted earlier, foodborne illness surveillance generally identifies illnesses by their etiology , that is, the pathogen or other contaminant responsible for illness, such as Salmonella or the toxin that causes botulism. It is more difficult to identify the vehicle , that is, the type of food that bears the contaminant. For example, foodborne illness surveillance systems track cases of human Salmonella infection. It can be difficult to attribute these infections to one or more of a variety of possible vehicles, which may include poultry, eggs, produce, and dairy products, among others. When a vehicle is identified, it can then be difficult to identify the practice that caused the contamination, such as an on-farm or processing practice, or cross-contamination in the home or food-service establishment. Because regulators are responsible for the safety of food vehicles and food production and handling practices, and not the etiologies per se , the gap between identification of an illness or outbreak and implication of a food vehicle and/or practice remains a substantial challenge in reducing the burden of foodborne illness in the United States.", "Following are presentations of three important monitoring systems for foodborne illness: FoodNet active surveillance of certain pathogens; passive surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks; and PulseNet genetic \"fingerprinting\" of certain foodborne bacteria. These and other monitoring systems together provide information about the nature of foodborne illnesses in the United States, and, increasingly, information about the means to prevent them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FoodNet: Active Surveillance of Foodborne Illness", "paragraphs": ["Since 1996, the FoodNet system has been used to monitor the incidence of certain foodborne illnesses. FoodNet is a population-based active surveillance system chiefly administered by CDC in partnership with FDA, USDA, and 10 states. FoodNet tracks the incidence of individual laboratory-confirmed infections caused by several bacteria and parasites, in sites in the 10 states. Because FoodNet tracks only laboratory-confirmed infections, it does not capture foodborne illnesses that do not involve a health care visit, testing with a positive result, and reporting of that result. Figure 1 presents the \"burden of illness\" pyramid, showing that FoodNet data capture only the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Also, the bacteria and parasites monitored by the FoodNet system account for only a portion of the causes of foodborne illness each year.", "For the reasons noted above, FoodNet does not provide information about the overall burden of foodborne illness in the United States. Also, FoodNet data do not capture information (if it is known) about the food vehicle(s) that caused reported illnesses. However, because FoodNet monitors illnesses in the same population and in the same way from year to year, capturing most or all laboratory-confirmed cases through active surveillance, the system can be used to track trends in the incidence of foodborne illness. FoodNet data can indicate whether the problem of illnesses caused by a specific pathogen appears to be getting better or worse over time, which can provide general information about the effectiveness of food safety programs, among other things. Prior to the implementation of FoodNet, it was not possible to track the monitored foodborne illnesses in this way.", "Based on FoodNet data, CDC reported that in 2008 the incidence of several of the illnesses under surveillance since 1996 had reached a plateau, instead of declining, and that national Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) health targets for these illnesses may not be met. For example, Figure 2 presents the FoodNet incidence of Salmonella infections from 1996 through 2008, and the HP2010 target. CDC has said that of all the FoodNet pathogens, the incidence of Salmonella is farthest from the HP2010 target, and that meeting the target in the future will likely require new approaches to prevention. CDC also commented on efforts at FSIS to reduce levels of Salmonella contamination in poultry, a common vehicle for Salmonella infection. But CDC also noted the growing recognition that several types of food vehicles regulated by FDA, such as peanut products and leafy greens, may also contribute considerably to the burden of illnesses caused by the FoodNet pathogens, including Salmonella ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passive Surveillance of Foodborne Disease Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to FoodNet, CDC also partners with FDA, USDA, and state and local health officials to coordinate national passive surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs), which are groups of illnesses that result from a common exposure. Outbreaks may involve as few as two or as many as thousands of people. Outbreak reporting differs from FoodNet reporting in several ways. First, FoodNet tracks individual cases of illness only for a handful of specific etiologies, such as Salmonella , and only when infections are laboratory-confirmed. In contrast, for some outbreaks the etiology is never identified; the recognition of an outbreak may hinge only on the finding of common symptoms among individuals with an obvious common exposure. For example, if a group of people experience acute vomiting after eating at the same function, and no etiology is identified, states authorities could report the incident to CDC as an outbreak, but FoodNet would not capture any of the cases. Also, most foodborne illnesses are \"sporadic;\" that is, they are not associated with outbreaks. Finally, as with individual cases of illness, many outbreaks, particularly those that are small, are not reported to authorities. Therefore, outbreak data provide limited information about the incidence or overall burden of foodborne illness.", "A strength of outbreak data is that it may provide attribution information that is not captured by FoodNet. Investigating outbreaks may allow health officials to attribute them to specific types of foods and/or food handling practices, as well as to identify the types of techniques that are most effective in responding to and controlling a FBDO. A food safety advocacy group maintains a database of foodborne outbreaks (involving two or more people) in the United States for which the outbreak was attributed to a specific food vehicle(s), compiled largely from CDC and state health department outbreak listings, reports by the CDC's Foodborne Outbreak Response and Surveillance Unit, and peer-reviewed journal articles. The group identified a total of 5,778 outbreaks of illness linked to specific foods between 1990 and 2006, reporting hundreds of outbreaks each attributed to seafood, meat, poultry, produce, and eggs. It also noted the problem associated with attribution of outbreaks to multi-ingredient foods, namely, that it can be more difficult to identify the contaminated ingredient in these situations. ", "In summary, FBDO data capture passive reports of outbreaks based on symptoms of foodborne illness among groups of people. Reported outbreaks may or may not be accompanied by information about an identified etiology and/or an attributed food or food handling practice. Outbreaks vary considerably in size, from small ones linked to social gatherings, to large ones involving commercial products consumed by thousands of people across the country. FBDO data may be most useful when considered qualitatively (e.g., saying that produce continues to be a source of multiple large FBDOs each year), but may not support quantitative conclusions (e.g., saying that produce is a leading cause of foodborne illness, compared with other vehicles)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PulseNet: Genetic \"Fingerprinting\"", "paragraphs": ["In the last two decades, technologies to link foodborne illnesses that have a common bacterial etiology have revolutionized the ability to identify large multistate outbreaks and mount an urgent response. The PulseNet program, coordinated by CDC, links state and local health departments and federal agencies (including CDC, FDA, and FSIS) to a common database to determine whether bacteria that are associated with illnesses or found on foods are related. By its nature, PulseNet analyzes only laboratory-confirmed illnesses caused by several specific pathogens.", "Although the PulseNet system can greatly improve the speed of detection of an outbreak, the tools used subsequently to attribute the responsible food vehicle(s) remain cumbersome. Epidemiologists often must still rely on time-consuming patient interviews. Especially for those foodborne infections with long incubation periods, patients' recollection of foods eaten may be imperfect. Also, if interviews suggest a suspicious subset of foods, the foods may no longer be available for testing. In addition, especially for FDA-regulated foods, information about common contaminants that may be present during production and in commerce, as well as how to test for them, is limited. For these reasons, attribution of illnesses and outbreaks to a specific food vehicle remains a significant challenge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA-Announced Food Recalls", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of infant formula, FDA does not have the authority to order a recall of an unsafe or potentially unsafe food. Rather, the agency relies on food companies to voluntarily recall adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise unsafe products, either on their own initiative or upon regulators' request. Some in the food industry assert that the industry rarely if ever fails to conduct a recall when necessary, although the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified some instances of non-cooperation. ", "FDA has stated that a company recall is generally the most effective current means for protecting consumers, but the FDA's principal statute, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), does provide the agency with other legal enforcement tools, such as the power to seize adulterated and misbranded products. Such tools can be employed if a recall is not undertaken or is found to be ineffective.", "A recall is \"a firm's removal or correction of a marketed product that the [FDA] considers to be in violation of the laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action, e.g., seizure.\" The FDA categorizes recalls into three classes, as follows:", "Class I recalls, the most serious, involve \"situation[s] in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\" Class II recalls involve \"situation[s] in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" Class III recalls involve \"situation[s] in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\"", "FDA compiles information about recalls primarily via two publicly accessible formats. The first is a regularly updated listing, in reverse chronological order, of each major recall or related action regarding products it regulates (i.e., drugs, biologics, medical devices, cosmetics, and most foods). This listing consists primarily of Class I recalls. Each item on the list is hot-linked to a press release announcing the recall, with additional details on the type of product, the reason for the recall, its geographical extent, and other basic information. The agency currently offers an online archive for these recalls dating back to 2004, and the database is searchable. Second, FDA publishes weekly enforcement reports that generally contain the same information, also dating back to 2004. The information in these reports appears to be less current than that in the first source, but is said by FDA to be more complete in that it includes all Class I, II, and III recalls.", "Recalls\u2014particularly those involving large numbers of widely consumed products\u2014cause consumers to question not only the safety records of the recalling companies but also the ability of health officials to protect the food supply. In many, but certainly not all, cases, products subject to a recall may have sickened or killed people or animals. It is not clear, however, how useful FDA recall data are as a measure of the burden of foodborne illness or the effectiveness of federal food safety programs. For example, does a relatively high number of recalls signify a failure of the system to keep unsafe products from being consumed, or does it indicate that the safety system is working by finding unsafe products and removing them from the market? Conversely, is a relatively low number of recalls an indication of the system's effectiveness, or simply of not finding and/or reporting all unsafe food products? Because of these questions, care should be exercised in using recall data as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of food safety efforts. With these caveats in mind, CRS presents, in Table 1 , the total number of Class I and Class II recalls of FDA-regulated foods for each of FY2005 through FY2009, by type of product, as categorized by FDA. (The data do not include Class III recalls, which, according to the definition, are not likely to involve problems that could cause foodborne illness.)", "These tabulations do not include the several hundred recalls, which occurred during the same time period, of various meat and poultry products regulated by FSIS. Like FDA, FSIS also does not have mandatory recall authority and thus relies on private firms to voluntarily withdraw products from commerce when problems arise. However, FSIS's recall policies and its other enforcement authorities differ from those of FDA in some other ways.", "The data in Table 1 show a spike in the number of products recalled in the first 11 months of FY2009. Most of this increase appears to be linked to two major food safety incidents in 2009. The first was a widespread outbreak of Salmonella linked to consumption of contaminated peanut ingredients from a single company's plants. Peanut butter, peanut paste, and related ingredients from this company, Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), were used by hundreds of other companies in thousands of products that collectively constituted hundreds of the FY2009 recalls. In Table 1 , increases in the following categories are likely to reflect PCA-related products that were recalled: bakery products, doughs, bakery mixes, icings; nuts and edible seeds; snack food items; chocolate and cocoa products; ice cream and related products; and candy without chocolate. See the subsequent section of this report, \" Salmonella Outbreak from Peanut Products (2008\u20132009) ,\" for more information about this recall.", "The second incident\u2014 Salmonella contamination of pistachio nuts that were also provided to many other companies by a single supplier\u2014led to another 100 or more recalls. Although the number of peanut- and pistachio-related recalls appears to be particularly high, multiple recalls traced to a single common problem source are not surprising given the organization of the U.S. food system, where a single supplier may provide products or ingredients to hundreds of processors and distributors nationwide.", "Also of note in Table 1 is that nine food product types, out of nearly 35 categories logged by the FDA, accounted for approximately 75% of all recalls during the FY2005-2009 period. The leading category (as designated by FDA) was bakery products, doughs, bakery mixes, and icings, which accounted for 13.4% of all recalls. This was followed by the category of multiple food dinners, gravies, sauces, specialties, with 10.3% of all recalls during FY2005-2009. Snack foods and chocolate products, respectively, constituted 7% and 6.8% of all recalls. It may not be surprising that all four of these categories involve diverse product lines that combine many different ingredients. The other five categories among the nine leaders were fishery and seafood products, and nuts and edible seeds, each with 8.5% of the total recalls; fruit and fruit products, 7.5%; vitamins, minerals, proteins, and unconventional dietary items, 6.5%; and vegetables and vegetable products, 5.7%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected FDA Food Recalls: Information and Implications", "paragraphs": ["Following are discussions of three recalls involving FDA-regulated foods.

The company said Salmonella had been found in a five-pound tub of the product, manufactured for the firm by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA). The first PCA recall of its own products was announced on January 13, 2009, and by the end of the month had been extended several times to include all PCA peanuts and peanut products (including meal, butter, paste, and granulated). Over the ensuing months, the number of PCA-related recalls grew to approximately 475, involving more than 200 companies and 3,900 individual human or animal food products.", "The recalls stemmed from public health investigations of a Salmonella outbreak that eventually would involve at least 714 confirmed cases of illness in 46 states. According to CDC, related illnesses were determined retrospectively to have begun as early as September 2008, and the outbreak may have contributed to nine deaths. (The CDC noted in its final update in April 2009, that the outbreak was \"expected to continue at a low level for the next several months since consumers unaware that they have recalled products in their home continue to consume these products, many of which have a long shelf-life.\")", "Two months had elapsed between the first recognized cluster of illnesses and the King Nut recall. The CDC on November 10, 2008, had first noticed what it said was a small and highly dispersed multistate cluster of Salmonella infections having the same PulseNet \"fingerprint\" among patients in multiple states. A related cluster of Salmonella infections from 17 states was identified by late November. The two investigations were merged in December 2008.", "Early efforts to identify the causative food vehicle proved inconclusive; initially chicken was suspected as the source. Peanut butter became the focus after a national case-control study conducted by CDC and public health officials in multiple states in January 2009, which compared foods reported eaten by ill and well persons. Subsequently, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory found the outbreak-associated Salmonella strain in an opened tub of King Nut peanut butter. At least two other states isolated the same strain in unopened tubs of King Nut peanut butter, which PCA had produced at its plant in Blakely, GA. By mid-January 2009, preliminary studies indicated an association between the Salmonella infections and consumption of pre-packaged Austin and Keebler brand peanut butter crackers. The crackers were produced by the Kellogg Company in North Carolina, using peanut paste from PCA.", "FDA began an investigation of the Blakely PCA facility on January 9, 2009, which continued until January 27, 2009. This involved sampling and testing, as well as collection of documents deemed necessary to support product recall activities. Environmental sampling (i.e., sampling in the plant rather than the actual product) found two Salmonella strains other than the one involved in the outbreak. This investigation also found plant records revealing numerous instances in 2007 and 2008 in which the plant distributed products in commerce even though samples they had submitted to outside testing laboratories had been positive for Salmonella . According to FDA, other samples of the product had been resubmitted by the company to other laboratories to obtain a negative result for Salmonella .", "The PCA recall highlights a number of issues under debate in food safety legislative proposals. Following are examples of these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Registration of Food Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, FDA requires domestic and foreign food facilities to register once, with no renewal requirement, although they must also report in a timely manner any relevant changes in their registration information. Failure to register is prohibited, but as a practical matter the agency relies on each facility to take that initial step, as well as to report changes. Also, it does not appear that food from unregistered facilities would be considered adulterated or misbranded, and therefore prohibited from being introduced into interstate commerce. (FDA's authority to deem food adulterated or misbranded, and its relationship to \"prohibited acts\" and associated penalties, is explained in the Appendix .) Exactly how many facilities may fail to register is unknown. In the course of its investigation of PCA, FDA reportedly learned about 20 additional facilities making peanut products without the agency's knowledge. (For example, investigators also found Salmonella at a PCA facility in Plainview, TX, that opened in 2005. Texas public health officials had not previously inspected the plant because it had not been registered for a state manufacturer's license.)", "Both H.R. 2749 and S. 510 contain provisions to expand federal facility registration requirements, in different ways. Among the key differences, H.R. 2749 would require annual registration renewal and would impose registration fees, while S. 510 would require biennial registration renewal and would not impose registration fees. Both bills would authorize processes by which FDA could suspend a facility's registration. Under H.R. 2749 , food products from unregistered facilities (including due to suspension) would be deemed misbranded, so their introduction into interstate commerce would be prohibited. S. 510 would prohibit the importation, the offer to import, and the introduction into interstate commerce of food products from facilities whose registration had been suspended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The \"Attribution Gap\"", "paragraphs": ["This incident illustrates that the PulseNet genetic fingerprinting system quickly identified a multi-state outbreak caused by a specific strain of Salmonella , but that it took about two months of subsequent epidemiologic investigation, including patient interviews, before food vehicles were identified. FDA noted during its investigation that it had not previously considered peanut products to be at high risk of bacterial contamination, but that such products would likely be considered for greater scrutiny in the future.", "Food safety officials often lack good information about the kinds of hazards and contaminants that may be present in different kinds of foods. This is particularly true for FDA-regulated foods. Epidemiologic investigation is often needed during outbreak investigation to focus in on suspected food vehicles for testing. This results both in a delay in identifying the contaminated food vehicle (if one is identified at all), and the risk of false attribution, in which investigators erroneously implicate a product based on epidemiologic findings that are later contradicted by laboratory findings.", "Economic consequences for producers of the misidentified commodity can be substantial. In addition, a product type may be implicated by the consuming public more broadly than is necessary. (In the case of the peanut products recall, makers of retail peanut butter products reported marked declines in sales of their products, although the products were not found to be contaminated and were not included in the recalls.) As a result, those in the food industry are skeptical about the possible effects of expanding FDA's access to industry food testing results, especially if the parameters governing the agency's disclosure of such information are unclear or subject to agency discretion.

With certain exceptions, the provision requires persons who register a food facility to report to the FDA within 24 hours after they have determined that an article of food is a \"reportable food,\" defined as a food \"for which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\" The requirements were to have been implemented within one year of enactment, or by September 27, 2008. FDA implemented the provision as the Reportable Food Registry in September 2009. Hence, the requirement was not in effect during the PCA outbreak.", "It has been argued that PCA would not have been legally required to inform the FDA of the results of testing that found Salmonella even if the Reportable Food Registry had been implemented at the time, because the statute leaves the determination of what is reportable up to the registrant. It is unclear whether the company would have had an obligation to report what it called \"presumptive\" findings of Salmonella if it did not determine that there was a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death associated with the consumption of its products.", "H.R. 2749 would amend the authority for the Reportable Food Registry to explicitly require companies to report test results on reportable food products and facilities to the HHS Secretary.

Milk used in the formula was implicated as the source of the melamine, which was added to watered-down bulk milk at collection points in China to inflate the protein content.

However, as public health officials acknowledge, outbreaks associated with the consumption of fresh produce have become more common in recent years. Spinach in particular had not been identified as a source of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks before the 2006 incident, but other leafy greens were implicated in a number of outbreaks, several of them traced to California. Consumers have responded to dietary advice that they consume more fresh produce, and are buying and consuming it in pre-washed and packaged forms that generally were not available 20 years ago.
