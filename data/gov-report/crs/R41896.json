", "Previously, the appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies provided funds for several activities within the Department of Energy (DOE), including research, development, and conservation programs; the Naval Petroleum Reserves; and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, at the outset of the 109 th Congress, these DOE programs were transferred to the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water, to consolidate jurisdiction over DOE. These programs currently are funded in the annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. At the same time, jurisdiction over the EPA and several smaller entities was moved to the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering Interior and related agencies, and they are now funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. This change resulted from the abolition of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies, which previously had jurisdiction over EPA.", "Since FY2006, appropriations laws for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies have contained three primary titles. This report is organized along these lines. The first section (Title I) provides information on Interior agencies; the second section (Title II) discusses EPA; and the third section (Title III) addresses other agencies, programs, and entities. A fourth section of this report discusses selected cross-cutting topics that encompass more than one agency.", "Entries in this report are for major agencies (e.g., the National Park Service) and cross-cutting issues (e.g., wildland fire management) that receive funding in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. For each agency or issue, we discuss some of the key funding changes that appear to be of interest to Congress. We also address related policy issues that occur in the context of considering appropriations legislation. Appropriations are complex, and not all issues are summarized in this report. For example, budget submissions for some agencies number several hundred pages and contain innumerable funding, programmatic, and legislative changes for congressional consideration. Further, appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts, activities, and subactivities, and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information. For information on programs funded in the bill but not directly discussed in this report, please contact the key policy staff members listed at the end of the report.", "In general, in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, as well as rescissions, transfers, and deferrals, but excludes mandatory spending authorities. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report.

In general, appropriations in these laws are available only for the fiscal year covered by the act, unless otherwise specified. In recent practice, Interior appropriations laws have provided such one-year appropriations for several accounts. For instance, the appropriation in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ) for the National Park Service, for the National Recreation and Preservation account, was for FY2012 only, as the law did not specify a different period of availability: \"For expenses necessary to carry out recreation programs, natural programs, cultural programs, heritage partnership programs, environmental compliance and review, international park affairs, and grant administration, not otherwise provided for, $59,975,000.\"", "However, many accounts within the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws have contained appropriations for longer periods of availability, involving multiple fiscal years. Some of these have been for two years. For these accounts, appropriations may be carried over from the first fiscal year to the second, and must be obligated by the end of the second year. For example, the appropriation in P.L. 112-74 to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, for the Regulation and Technology account, was provided for FY2012 and FY2013. The law provided, in part: \"For necessary expenses to carry out the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Public Law 95\u201387, as amended, $122,950,000, to remain available until September 30, 2013.\"", "Many other accounts have contained appropriations that were available for obligation without fiscal year limitation, often referred to as \"no-year appropriations.\" Such appropriations typically were \"to remain available until expended.\" For these accounts, appropriations may be carried over from fiscal year to fiscal year with no deadline for obligation. In P.L. 112-74 , the appropriation for the Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Construction account, provides an example of no-year appropriations: \"For construction, improvement, acquisition, or removal of buildings and other facilities required in the conservation, management, investigation, protection, and utilization of fish and wildlife resources, and the acquisition of lands and interests therein; $23,088,000, to remain available until expended.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2012 Overview", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FY2012 Enacted Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["On December 23, 2011, Congress enacted H.R. 2055 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ).

One directed the DOI, EPA, and FS to report on actions taken to address management weaknesses and to implement reforms identified by each agency's Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. A second reporting requirement pertained to the costs of litigation related to agency actions. Specifically, conferees directed DOI agencies, EPA, and FS to report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and make publicly available, information on payments of attorney fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, as detailed in the report of the House Appropriations Committee.

An authorizing measure can establish, continue, or modify an agency or program for a fixed or indefinite period of time. It also may set forth the duties and functions of an agency or program, its organizational structure, and the responsibilities of agency or program officials. Authorizing legislation also authorizes the enactment of appropriations for an agency or program. The amount authorized to be appropriated may be specified for each fiscal year or may be indefinite (providing \"such sums as may be necessary\"). The authorization of appropriations is intended to provide guidance regarding the appropriate amount of funds to carry out the authorized activities of an agency.", "To achieve economies of scale, the House Appropriations Committee encouraged agencies to downsize and restructure. An emphasis was on consolidation of regional offices across agencies, such as in cities where three or more agencies have offices or in offices with one or two employees.

The increase was intended in part for hiring seasonal employees, completing the grazing permit renewal process, and monitoring grazing allotments. The House Appropriations Committee had referred to the program as \"significantly underfunded in the past,\" and noted an increasing cost to BLM of grazing-related litigation.

For cultural resources management, the appropriation was $16.1 million. This was a $0.7 million decrease from FY2011 and a $9.5 million decrease from the Administration's request. The Administration had sought the increase to enhance the preservation and protection of cultural, historical, and paleontological resources. Some of the requested increase was for the inventory and stabilization of cultural resource sites. To date, roughly 21 million acres (8%) of BLM lands have been inventoried for cultural resources. For recreation management, the appropriation was $67.6 million, $1.2 million below FY2011 and $9.2 million less than the Administration's request. The Administration's proposed increase was intended primarily for interpretation, visitor services, managing off-highway vehicles, and developing and implementing travel management plans.

The BLM is required by law to transfer ownership of about 150 million acres of federal lands to the State of Alaska, Alaska Natives, and Alaska Native corporations, most of which have already been conveyed. For energy and minerals management, the appropriation was $107.8 million. This was an increase of $17.3 million from the FY2011 level and $33.0 million from the FY2012 request. The differences in appropriations among the three levels resulted primarily from differences in the amount of funds to be derived from other sources, namely (1) a higher expected amount of collections in FY2011 from fees for processing applications for permits to drill, and (2) the inclusion in the President's request only of a proposal to shift the cost of oil and gas inspections from appropriations to a proposed industry inspection fee. Further, the FY2012 law did not include a provision recommended by the House Appropriations Committee to prevent about a million acres of BLM and Forest Service land in Arizona near the Grand Canyon from being withdrawn from development under the General Mining Law of 1872 except as authorized by law. The Secretary of the Interior had withdrawn the lands from new development under that law due to concerns about the potential impact of uranium mining on the Grand Canyon watershed.

For FY2012, including FLAME funds (see below) and rescissions, the appropriations law provided a total of $2.63 billion for Wildland Fire Management ($2.05 billion for the FS and $576.5 million for DOI). This was a decrease of $207.4 million (7%) from the $2.84 billion provided for FY2011 and $22.5 million (1%) less than the Administration's request of $2.65 billion.

This included a decline of $13.5 million for DOI and an increase of $332.4 million for the FS.

This included a decrease of $128.3 million for DOI and of $456.8 million for the FS. For the FS, some of this decline resulted from a shift in costs to preparedness. However, the declines also reflect reduced needs as a result of the past three relatively mild fire seasons (2008-2010).

The increase over the FS request was largely due to the Administration's proposal to transfer $192.0 million of FS fuel reduction funding for activities not in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) to a new Integrated Resource Restoration line item under the National Forest System account; this proposed transfer was not agreed to. (See \" Department of Agriculture: Forest Service \" above.) The conferees directed both the FS and DOI to remove the requirement that 75% and 90%, respectively, of hazardous fuels funding be spent in the WUI and instead \"be spent on the highest priority projects in the highest priority areas.\" The FY2012 appropriation for fuel reduction equaled the FY2011 appropriation for DOI, but was a decline of $32.0 million from FY2011 for the FS due to a decline in the Hazardous Fuels Base Program and a transfer of funding for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund to the National Forest System.

The requirements are the same for the two accounts. Each Secretary may transfer funds from the FLAME fund into the respective Wildland Fire Management account, for suppression activities, upon a secretarial declaration. The declaration may be issued if the fire covers at least 300 acres or threatens lives, property, or resources, among other criteria. The conferees on the FY2010 bill stated their intent that the money in the FLAME funds, together with appropriations through the Wildland Fire Management accounts, should fully fund suppression needs and prevent borrowing funds from other programs. They directed the Secretaries to develop new methods of estimating fire suppression funding needs as part of their budget requests.", "For FY2012, the appropriations law provided $407.9 million ($315.9 million for the FS and $92.0 million for DOI).
