The total FY2016 enacted appropriations of $8.14 billion for EPA was the same as enacted for FY2015 but $451.8 million (5.3%) below the President's FY2016 request of $8.59 billion.

The House and Senate committee-reported bills (H.R. 2822 and S. 1645) proposed decreases for all of the EPA appropriations accounts for FY2016 compared to the President's request and were generally less than or equal to FY2015 enacted appropriations for the nine accounts.

The grants are subject to a 10% matching funds requirement (including in-kind contributions). Of the $12.7 million proposed by the House committee, $11.0 million was to be allocated for training and technical assistance on a national level or multi-state regional basis, and $1.7 million was allocated for technical assistance to individual private well owners. Of the $15.0 million proposed by the Senate Committee, $13.0 million was to be allocated for assistance on a national and multi-state level and $2.0 million for private well owners.", "Although Congress has dedicated funding for these \"national\" or \"congressional\" priorities, they have not been categorized as \"earmarks\" by the House or Senate generally because the language would not direct the funding to one specific entity or specific location, and the funding would be awarded on a competitive basis. Since the 112 th Congress, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have adhered to a moratorium as put forth by the leadership in both chambers generally precluding the inclusion of earmarks in annual enacted appropriations bills for FY2011 through FY2016.", "While there is no consensus on a single earmark definition among all practitioners and observers of the appropriations process, in 2007 the Senate and House adopted separate definitions for purposes of implementing new earmark transparency requirements in their respective chambers. In the House rule, such a funding item is referred to as a \" congressional earmark (or earmark ),\" while in the Senate rule, it is referred to as a \" congressionally directed spending item (or spending item ).\"", "Appendix A. Historical Funding Trends and Staffing Levels", "The Nixon Administration established EPA in 1970 in response to growing public concern about environmental pollution, consolidating federal pollution control responsibilities that had been divided among several federal agencies. Over three decades following EPA's creation, Congress enacted an increasing number of environmental laws, as well as major amendments to these statutes.", "Annual appropriations provide the funds necessary for EPA to carry out its responsibilities under these laws, such as the regulation of air and water quality, use of pesticides and toxic substances, management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and cleanup of environmental contamination. EPA also awards grants to assist state, tribal, and local governments in controlling pollution in order to comply with federal environmental requirements and to help fund the implementation and enforcement of federal regulations delegated to the states.", " Table A-1 presents FY2009 through FY2015 enacted appropriations for EPA by each of the nine accounts.", "EPA Staff Levels", " Figure A-1 below presents a trend in EPA's authorized \"full-time equivalent\" (FTE) employment ceiling from FY2001 through FY2015 and as requested for FY2016 as reported in the EPA FY2016 Congressional Justification. The President's FY2016 request proposed a total of 15,373 FTEs. EPA reported that the FY2015 enacted level of 15,335 FTEs was the lowest since FY1989. Information prior to FY2001 is available on EPA's budget and planning website at http://www2.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget . In March 2000, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had reported that EPA FTEs increased by about 18% from FY1990 through FY1999, with the largest increase (13%, from 15,277 to 17,280 FTEs) occurring from FY1990 though FY1993. GAO indicated that from FY1993 through FY1999, EPA's FTEs grew at a more moderate rate of less than 1% per year.", "Appendix B. Descriptions of EPA's Nine Appropriations Accounts", "From FY1996 to FY2013, EPA's funding had been requested by the Administration and appropriated by Congress under eight statutory accounts. A ninth account, Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund, was added during the FY2014 budget process. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act (P.L. 112-195) authorized the development of an electronic system to track hazardous waste shipments and a fund to finance it that would be supported with start-up appropriations and user fees thereafter. Table B-1 describes the scope of the programs and activities funded within each of these accounts. Prior to FY1996, Congress appropriated funding for EPA under a different account structure, making it difficult to compare funding for the agency historically over time by the individual accounts.", "Appendix C.

Funding Prohibitions Proposed in H.R. 2822 and S. 1645 as Reported but Not Retained in P.L. 114-113", "As noted earlier in this report (see \" EPA Regulations: Prohibitions/Restrictions on Use of FY2016 Appropriations \"), relatively few of the administrative and general provisions that would have restricted or prohibited the use of FY2016 funds proposed in the House and Senate committee-reported bills were retained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ). The proposed provisions, if enacted, would have generally restricted or prohibited the use of funds as appropriated in the bill (and in some cases \"other Acts\") to carry out certain EPA activities (e.g., permitting), as well as requirements to conduct analyses and/or report on certain activities and funding expenditures across the various environmental pollution control statutes.", "Some of these provisions were included in the initial House and Senate appropriations subcommittees' recommendations, while others were added as amendments during full committee markup. Additionally, a number of provisions affecting EPA actions were among amendments introduced and adopted prior to the suspension of consideration of H.R. 2822 in the House on July 8, 2015. The majority of the prohibitions were in the form of general provisions under Title IV in both committee-reported bills, although some were included among the EPA administrative provisions in Title II of both committee-reported bills.", "Directives and restrictions were also included in the reports ( H.Rept. 114-170 and S.Rept. 114-70) accompanying the House and Senate committee-reported bills. For example, the House and Senate committee-reported bills would not have provided funding as requested within the S&T account for EPA hydraulic fracturing research activities in conjunction with the Departments of Energy and the Interior. Within the EPM account, for example, the House committee report would not have provided funding for \"EPA's greenhouse gas rules for stationary sources\" or for EPA's Smart Growth Program. The Senate committee report did not include \"the Administration's requests for funding increases and for additional employees related to the Clean Power Plan.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
