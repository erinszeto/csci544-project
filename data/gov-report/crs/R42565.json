The act allowed an SBIC licensed on or after October 1, 2009, to elect to have a maximum leverage amount of $175 million instead of $150 million (later increased to $175 million) if that SBIC has invested at least 50% of its financings in low-income geographic areas, as defined under the NMVC program, and certified that at least 50% of its future investments will be in low-income geographic areas. ARRA also increased the maximum amount of leverage available for two or more licenses under common control to $250 million from $225 million if these requirements are met.", "In addition, on April 7, 2011, the SBA announced a $1 billion impact investment SBIC initiative (providing up to $150 million in leverage in FY2012 and up to $200 million in leverage per fiscal year thereafter until the limit is reached). ", "Under this initiative, SBA-licensed impact investment debenture SBICs are required to invest at least 50% of their financings, \"which target areas of critical national priority including underserved markets and communities facing barriers to access to credit and capital.\" To receive an impact investment, a small business must meet at least one of the following criteria: ", "be located in or, at the time of the initial investment, have at least 35% of its full-time employees residing in an LMI zone as defined in 13 C.F.R.

On June 6, 2013, the SBA announced that it was increasing the maximum leverage available to impact investment SBICs to $150 million.", "On September 25, 2014, the SBA announced several changes to the impact investment program designed to \"broaden access to the fund.\" The agency announced that it was continuing the program beyond FY2016. Additionally, effective October 1, 2014, among other changes, the SBA eliminated the program's $200 million collective, per-fiscal-year leverage cap; added advanced manufacturing to the list of eligible sectors; provided eligibility to businesses that receive Small Business Innovation Research or Small Business Technology Transfer grants; and permitted, through December 1, 2014, existing debenture SBICs to apply to opt into the program if they meet the program's requirements. Subject to the SBA's approval, impact investment SBICs may devise a customized definition of an \"impact investment\" during the licensing process. ", "On February 3, 2016, the SBA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to provide regulations for impact investment SBICs regarding licensing, leverage eligibility, fees, and reporting and compliance requirements. The proposed regulations were an indication of the SBA's intent at that time to continue the impact investment SBIC initiative indefinitely.", "At the end of FY2018, there were nine licensed, impact investment SBICs (two in 2011, one in 2012, two in 2014, two in 2015, and two in 2016).

The letter indicated that the SBA was also terminating the 2011/2012 Impact Investment Fund Policy letter that the SBA had used to form the initiative's impact investment fund. The OII's letter indicated that the SBA was taking these actions for several reasons, including that \"few qualified funds applied to be licensed as Impact SBICs,\" that \"many of these SBICs would have applied to the SBIC program regardless of the existence of the Impact Policy,\" and \"the results produced were not commensurate with the time and resources expended by SBA to maintain it.\" In addition, on June 11, 2018, the SBA published a notice in the Federal Register withdrawing the proposed rule published on February 3, 2016, that would have created regulations for the impact investment SBIC initiative because the \"SBA has determined that the cost is not commensurate with the benefits.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The SBA's LMI and impact investment initiatives are designed to encourage SBIC investments in LMI areas. In recent years, the amount of SBIC program investments in LMI zones has generally increased (see Table 1 ). The NMVC program is no longer active (it does not have any active unpaid principal balance) and the amount and number of its financings were lower than anticipated by its original sponsors and below levels desired by its advocates. Some argue that the increased levels of SBIC investments in LMI areas in recent years, coupled with the SBA's efforts to encourage SBIC investments in such areas, may diminish the need for the NMVC program. NMVC advocates disagree.", "In FY2018, SBICs provided 609 financings totaling $1.026 billion to small businesses located in a LMI income area, an average investment of $1.685 million. NMVC advocates argue, as Senator Bond did when the NMVC program was proposed, that the NMVC program targets small businesses seeking much smaller investments.", "The debate over the NMVC program's future, particularly whether the program should be provided additional funding, is, in many ways, reflective of broader disagreements about the role of government, and the SBA, in private enterprise. Some believe the federal government and the SBA should take an active role in assisting small businesses to access capital\u2014through the provision of loan guarantees, equity financing, and management training\u2014to further the economic recovery. In their view, the SBA's programs fill a market niche by providing loans to small businesses unable to get credit elsewhere, equity financings to small businesses often overlooked by private investors, and training for new and aspiring entrepreneurs unable to find affordable training elsewhere. They assert that increasing funding for the NMVC program will create jobs by making capital available to entrepreneurs unable to find it in the private marketplace.", "Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of the federal deficit. Instead of supporting increased funding for federal spending programs, they advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses, generate economic growth, and create jobs. They are particularly interested in achieving greater government efficiency by eliminating federal spending programs, such as the NMVC program, that they perceive are duplicative of others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
