Certain VA benefits are available to current servicemembers, and the eligibility requirements for those benefits are not a component of this report.", "The VA uses a two-step process to evaluate claims for benefits. First, the claimant must demonstrate eligib i l ity for veterans' benefits in general. That is, the claimant must prove that he or she is a bona fide veteran and verify certain related matters.

In addition, the document must contain data regarding the length, time, and character of the service, and the VA must believe that the document is genuine and accurate.

For example, if on authorized travel to and from the performance of active duty training or inactive duty for training, a person is disabled or dies, the duty will be considered to be active duty for training or inactive duty for training.", "The determination of whether a claimant has met the active service requirement may not be a simple process. The claimant and the VA may have to scrutinize the claimant's service records to determine whether the claimant's service fits into one of the many categories of active service, or whether an exception has been made for his or her service, so that it is considered to be active service for the purposes of veterans' benefits.

For example, service-connected disability compensation benefits are exempt from the length of service requirement. Thus, a veteran with a disease or injury incurred during active service generally may receive service-connected compensation for that disability. Other exceptions to the minimum service requirements include claims for VA life insurance benefits, hardship discharges, and persons retired or separated from service because of a service-related disability.", "If the former servicemember did not serve for the full period of active duty and served less than 24 months, and none of the statutory exceptions apply, then the veteran did not complete a minimum period of active duty and is \"not eligible for any benefit under Title 38, United States Code or under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs based on that period of active service.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discharge Criteria for Veteran Status", "paragraphs": ["The statutory definition of veteran requires that the individual be discharged or released from military service \"under conditions other than dishonorable.\" There are currently five types of discharges issued by the military services: ", "1. honorable discharge (HD), 2. discharge under honorable conditions (UHC) or general discharge (GD), 3. discharge under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC) or undesirable discharge (UD), 4. bad conduct discharge (BCD), and 5. dishonorable discharge (DD).", "The statutory definition of veteran does not precisely match those five categories of the discharges, and the VA often determines on a case-by-case basis whether the claimant's discharge qualifies as under conditions other than dishonorable. In most cases, the VA considers honorable discharges and discharges under honorable conditions (the first two of the five categories) to be conditions other than dishonorable and will usually qualify a claimant as a veteran under the first step of the eligibility test, which usually qualifies a veteran for most benefits.", "A bad conduct discharge from a special court-martial and other discharges made under other than honorable conditions do not always disqualify the claimant from being considered a veteran for purposes of benefits eligibility. In the case of such a discharge, the VA makes a special \"character of service determination,\" based on the facts of the case. The VA reviews the entire period of the claimant's enlistment to assess the quality of the service and to determine whether it is sufficient to qualify the discharge as being under conditions other than dishonorable. If a claimant has served more than one period of enlistment, different discharge categories may be specified for each period.", "Dishonorable and bad conduct discharges issued by general courts-martial may bar VA benefits. Veterans in prison and parolees may be eligible for certain VA benefits and must contact the VA to determine eligibility. VA benefits are not provided to any veteran or dependent wanted for an outstanding felony warrant.", "Benefits are awarded in some cases even when the character of the discharge would ordinarily make the individual ineligible. For example, if the claimant is found to have been insane at the time of the offense leading to the discharge, VA benefits may be granted.
