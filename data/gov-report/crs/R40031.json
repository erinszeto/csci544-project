Therefore, they do not count for calculation of a federal employee's retirement annuity.", "The advent of \"pay for performance\" for some agencies and workforces has, to some extent, blurred the distinction between pay, on one hand, and awards and incentives, on the other. The term pay for performance typically refers to the linkage of performance appraisals to salaried pay. This blurring arguably raises the possibility that a discrete analysis of awards and incentives only, separate from pay, may provide only a partial picture. With this caveat noted, this report nonetheless focuses on awards and incentives.", "Because awards and incentives have different purposes and requirements, the report discusses each topic separately.

Part 451. The subchapter authorizes distinct types of awards that may be granted to an \"employee,\" as that term is defined at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4501(2). Employees in executive agencies and some legislative branch agencies may receive awards. Awards may be granted by the head of an agency (\"agency award,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4503; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.101) and by the President (\"presidential award,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4504; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.201; see also Executive Order 10717, as amended), as well as to former employees (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505).

Groups of employees also may receive awards. OPM has authority, by regulation, to permit agencies to grant employees time off from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4502(e)). These statutory authorities grant agencies considerable discretion to design and implement their award programs, and implementing regulations allow agencies to customize their award programs, to suit agency circumstances (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.103).", "In general, each of these Subchapter I cash awards may not exceed $10,000, unless the head of an agency certifies to OPM that the award is based on conduct that is \"highly exceptional and unusually outstanding.\" In that case, a cash award may, with OPM's approval, be in excess of $10,000, but not in excess of $25,000 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4502). Performance-based cash awards are available to employees paid under the General Schedule (GS) and non-GS employees covered by Chapter 45 whose most recent performance rating was at the \"fully successful\" level or higher, or the equivalent thereof (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505a(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.101(e)). However, at the request of the head of an executive agency, the Director of OPM may authorize the payment of performance-based cash awards to \"any category of employees within such agency\" who otherwise would not be covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505a (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505a(d) and \u00a7 4505a(e)). Performance-based cash awards may not be more than 10% of an employee's annual rate of basic pay, unless performance is so exceptional that an agency head specifically authorizes a cash award exceeding 10%, but not exceeding 20%, of the employee's annual rate of basic pay (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505a(a)(2)).", "Chapter 45, Subchapter II separately provides for two types of \"cost savings disclosure\" awards (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4511-4513).

This type of agency award may not exceed the lesser of $10,000 or an amount equal to 1% of the total savings attributable to the employee's disclosure, as determined by the IG. The second type of disclosure award may be granted by the President (\"presidential award,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4513). The President may pay a cash award in the amount of $20,000 to any employee \"whose disclosure of fraud, waste, or mismanagement has resulted in substantial cost savings for the Government,\" taking into account cost savings projected for subsequent fiscal years that will be attributable to the disclosure. The President is prohibited from making more than 50 such awards during any fiscal year.", "Separately from Chapter 45 of Title 5, the head of an agency also may grant a one-step increase to basic pay to recognize GS employees \"in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily found in the type of position concerned\" (\"quality step increase\" or QSI, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5336; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.501). A QSI may be granted only to an employee who receives a rating of record at the highest summary level used by a performance appraisal program, and may not be granted to an employee who already received a QSI within the preceding 52 weeks. A QSI increases an employee's basic pay. For a senior career employee in a Senior-Level (SL) or Scientific-Professional (ST) position that is classified above GS-15, paid under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5376, and also subject to OPM allocations under 5 C.F.R.

However, as is the case with most large sources of data in the public and private sectors, the resources that are available for easily extracting and presenting data can be limited. For example, some information from the CPDF is available in an online database that is administered by OPM. CPDF data about awards, however, appear to be available only from (1) special runs on the CPDF performed by OPM or other entities that have a copy of the CPDF or (2) publications issued by OPM. In addition, in light of current methods of recording and reporting data and existing information technology infrastructure, the accuracy of some data in these databases cannot be guaranteed. Otherwise, Members and committees of Congress have sometimes relied for access to this information on direct requests of agencies or field studies by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). That said, some long-term efforts are underway to, among other things, make agency workforce data more accessible.", "Perhaps in light of these technology and resource challenges, OPM occasionally has produced reports on federal civilian workforce statistics using the CPDF and other sources.

OPM reported that in 2004, over 1.2 million individual cash awards were granted (perhaps in some cases more than one award per employee), totaling $1.1 billion, or 1.01% of total salaries. As a percentage of salaries, awards have been relatively stable in the reported years. In practice, awards to individual employees tend to be considerably larger in number and dollar amount, in the aggregate, than awards to groups. Group cash awards amounted to about 0.11% of total salaries in FY2004.

SES employees also may receive Chapter 45, Subchapter II awards (i.e., cost savings disclosure awards).", "For Presidential Rank Awards, an executive with the rank of Meritorious Executive (\"for sustained accomplishment\") receives a payment of 20% of annual basic pay. For the rank of Distinguished Executive (\"for sustained extraordinary accomplishment\"), the payment is 35%. The payment percentage is multiplied by an SES member's basic pay, which, in turn, is determined in part by whether the SES appraisal system at an agency has been certified by OPM. For 2008, bands for SES basic pay were established at $114,468-$158,500 for an uncertified system and $114,468-$172,200 for a certified system. Therefore, rank awards could be between $22,894 (20% of the lower bound) and $55,475 (35% of the upper bound) in an agency with an uncertified appraisal system, and between $22,894 (20% of lower bound) and $60,270 (35% of upper bound) in an agency with a certified system (figures rounded by CRS).

In FY2007, for example, the most highly rated career SES employees received an average performance award of $15,051 in agencies that have five rating levels and $17,140 in agencies that have four rating levels. These figures compared with average performance awards of $8,615 and $7,022, respectively, for career SES employees rated at the next lower level.

However, these salary adjustments and additional kinds of awards for which politically appointed SES employees are eligible did not appear to be within the scope of OPM's reports. In sum, it is not clear from publicly available data whether a comprehensive look at awards and salary adjustments for politically appointed SES employees would show higher or lower average levels of award and salary adjustment compensation, compared with career SES employees. However, if the award amounts that politically appointed SES employees receive are similar to those of career SES employees in relation to their performance ratings (e.g., $15,051 at the highest level and $8,615 at the next lower level), the consistently higher incidence of top performance ratings for SES political appointees may indicate that politically appointed SES employees receive higher average amounts for awards than career employees receive."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "\"3R\" Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Statutory provisions that authorize agency use of incentives to help recruit, relocate, and retain employees are located in Title 5, Chapter 57, Subchapter IV.

The federal civil service increasingly has been customized to individual agencies and workforces (e.g., doctors, nurses, law enforcement officers). It also has been increasingly decentralized in execution. The civil service typically is described as divided into three separate services: the competitive service, the excepted service, and the SES. The competitive service has its statutory basis in the general personnel laws of Title 5, and specifically Title 5's appointment provisions. The SES has its own customized appointment provisions in Title 5. Employees who are in the excepted service work in agencies or organizations that operate outside of Title 5's appointment provisions. Different statutory provisions relating to hiring, pay, awards, and labor-management relations may apply to these workforces or portions of these workforces.

An implication of this customization and decentralization is that pay, award, and incentive authorities available to specific agencies and workforces may differ substantially across government.", "Title 5 award and incentive authorities have wide coverage across agencies and workforces. Perhaps as a recognition of this diversity, Congress granted extensive flexibility and discretion to agencies under these Chapter 45 and Chapter 57 provisions to customize award and incentive practices to fit agency missions, environments, and resource levels. It may be fair to ask, however, for any given agency or workforce, whether these authorities\u2014alone or in combination with agency- or workforce-specific \"carve out\" authorities\u2014give agencies the capabilities they need in order to properly recruit, motivate, reward, and retain high-performing workforces. How would one make such an assessment? For example, how do these award and incentive authorities relate to an agency's pay system(s) and alternative award and incentive authorities? To what extent does an agency offer intrinsic rewards and incentives (e.g., autonomy, professional development) in addition to extrinsic ones (e.g., involving monetary compensation)?
