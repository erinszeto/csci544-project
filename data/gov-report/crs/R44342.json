Generally there are three tax bases from which governments can raise this revenue directly from individuals: income, wages, and consumption. The United States implements taxes on all three of these bases. The first tax base, income, includes all income from both labor and capital (e.g., wages and interest on investments). In the United States, income is taxed through a federal income tax, which applies differential tax rates on income from labor and capital. The second tax base, wages, includes all income that results from labor. The payroll tax, which in part funds the Social Security program, is a type of wage tax. The third tax base, consumption, includes all money spent on goods and services. A number of narrow consumption taxes exist at the federal level, such as the gasoline excise tax. Broader consumption taxes are popular at the state level in the form of sales taxes. ", "State sales taxes are a commonplace consumption tax in the United States. There are differences, however, across states regarding the base to which state sales taxes are applied. For example, many state sales taxes exempt certain necessities from their sales tax base, such as certain medicines under Virginia's state sales tax. ", "A broad and comprehensive consumption tax could be applied to all money spent on goods and services for final consumption. Examples of broader consumption taxes can be found in Europe, where many countries implement national-level consumption taxes referred to as value added taxes (VATs). These taxes generally do not have as many exemptions as consumption taxes in the United States, and therefore have a broader tax base. A broader tax base, other things equal, allows more revenue to be collected with lower tax rates. ", "A consumption and income tax with broad bases can be similar depending on an individual's saving behavior. An individual who saves no money at all would experience no difference between an income and a consumption tax. Without savings, consumption is equal to income. A consumption tax distinguishes itself from an income tax when taxpayers save a portion of their income. For example, under a consumption tax, a taxpayer who makes $100,000 and saves $10,000 a year would only pay taxes on the $90,000 that was spent on goods and services. However, under an income tax the same taxpayer would pay taxes on the full $100,000, whether it was saved or spent.", "Proponents of a consumption tax argue that by allowing savings to be carried forward tax-free, taxpayers will choose to save more of their income.

Taxes distort these decisions by interfering with prices. Beginning the policy discussion with the understanding that taxes generally impede economic efficiency, the goal is then to design a tax structure that minimizes distortions, allowing the market to operate as efficiently as possible. ", "It is important to note that a \"perfectly competitive market\" is a purely theoretical concept in economics, which requires several very strict assumptions to achieve economic efficiency. For a perfectly competitive market to function according to economic theory, the market must consist of many buyers and sellers such that no individual can exert market influence independently, firms can freely enter or exit the market (i.e., there are no barriers to entering a market), the good being sold by producers is homogenous, and buyers and sellers have access to all information related to their economic decisions. Few markets, if any, achieve all of these characteristics. ", "There are also situations where a tax, or subsidy, can improve economic efficiency, by correcting for a market failure. Market failures can occur for a number of reasons, but result in an inefficient allocation of resources, either producing too little or too much of a good than the optimal quantity. For example, the current income tax code contains a number of tax benefits to support education. Education generates positive externalities, as there are benefits to society that individuals do not consider when making education consumption choices. Thus, absent intervention, markets would tend to result in an allocation of resources for education that is below socially optimal levels.

One of the main concerns voiced when discussing tax policy is its potential impact on individual work decisions. Taxes can impact individual work decisions through two avenues, (1) by reducing the real value of work, known as the income effect, and (2) by changing the relative value of work in relation to other activities, known as the substitution effect. The impact of these effects is discussed below.

Under an income tax, an individual's take-home salary is reduced by the amount of the tax. Under a consumption tax, an individual's purchasing power is reduced either through increased prices or reduced wages. For example, consider an individual whose total monthly expenditures equal $1,500, and who has a job that pays $10 per hour. He would have to work 150 hours a month to cover his expenditures. However, if an income tax of 20% is implemented, his effective wage is reduced to $8 per hour, and he would have to work 187.5 hours a month to cover his expenses. Similarly, under a 20% consumption tax, assuming the tax is passed on completely to consumers through higher retail prices, the effective cost of his monthly expenditures increases to $1,800, and he must now work 180 hours to cover his monthly expenditures. ", "In response to the decreased value of work due to an income or consumption tax, individuals are expected to increase how much they work to make up for some of the lost consumption power. This response to taxation is referred to as the income effect. If a consumption tax proposal were revenue neutral, the income effect produced from switching to a consumption tax is likely to be similar to the income effect under the income tax. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Substitution Effect", "paragraphs": ["In addition to decreasing an individual's purchasing power, taxes also decrease the relative value of work in relation to leisure. Individuals have to make numerous decisions about how to spend their time each day, allocating time between work, friends, family, and numerous other activities. With the implementation of a tax on income or consumption, the value of spending an hour at work is reduced in relation to these other activities. Under an income tax, this occurs because the tax reduces an individual's income for a given level of work by the tax rate. Whereas under a consumption tax, this occurs because the tax decreases the amount an individual can purchase for a given level of work by increasing the price of goods or reducing his or her wages. As taxes reduce the real value of work, the relative value of leisure and other activities increases and individuals are expected to decrease the amount of time they spend working. This response, referred to as the substitution effect, works in opposition to the income effect discussed above.", "The degree to which the substitution effect impacts individual work decisions is largely a function of the tax rate used. A higher tax rate is expected to increase the substitution effect, and therefore increase the disincentive to work by making leisure relatively more valuable. A consumption tax is likely to have a higher tax rate than an income tax if the taxes are to be revenue neutral, because the tax base under a consumption tax is necessarily smaller than the tax base under an income tax. A higher tax rate under a consumption tax would be expected to decrease the relative value of work to a greater degree than under an income tax, and therefore decrease work effort to a greater degree. ", "There is, however, an important feature inherent in the transition to a consumption tax that limits the need for higher rates, thus limiting changes in behavior arising from the substitution effect. While transitioning to a consumption tax, there would be an additional implicit tax placed on savings and assets owned before the transition to a consumption tax is complete. Under the current income tax, individuals purchase assets and save a portion of their income to finance consumption later in life. These savings and assets have a certain value under an income tax, but with the implementation of a consumption tax, the real value of these assets and savings would decrease. The value declines because when individuals begin to consume (by drawing down their savings) their purchases would now be subject to the consumption tax. The real value of assets and savings is reduced by the amount of the consumption tax rate. The decrease in value arising from the transition to a consumption tax is often referred to as a tax on old capital. ", "As discussed earlier, most taxes tend to distort individual behavior and reduce economic efficiency. There are a number of exceptions to this rule however, and the inherent tax on old capital under a consumption tax is one such example. The tax on old capital is not expected to distort individual behavior because there is no legal way for individuals to alter their behavior in a way to reduce their tax burden. All decisions to purchase assets or save income occurred in the past, and because individuals cannot travel back in time to reduce their asset purchases or saving behavior, individuals cannot alter their behavior to avoid the tax on old capital. This kind of tax is referred to as a lump-sum tax, and is not expected to distort the economy because individuals will not alter their behavior in response to it. ", "As discussed above, a revenue-neutral consumption tax is likely to require a higher tax rate than an income tax because the tax base under a consumption tax is necessarily smaller. This would, all else equal, generate a larger substitution effect and discourage individuals from working as much when compared to an income tax. However, in practice, a lower consumption tax rate can be used while remaining revenue neutral because the lump sum tax on old capital generates additional tax revenue. In addition, this tax raises revenue without introducing distortions into the economy. The result is that the anticipated substitution effect under a consumption tax may not be significantly larger than under an income tax when the tax plans are revenue neutral."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Empirical Discussion", "paragraphs": ["In summation, economic theory suggests that taxes have two opposing effects on an individual's work decisions.

In empirical work, economists attempt to quantify the responsiveness of workers to changes in after-tax wages\u2014the \"labor supply elasticity.\" These estimates yield the percentage change in hours worked arising from a percentage change in after-tax wages. ", "Estimated elasticities range between 0 and 1.3, but elasticities tend to bunch at the low end. Numerous studies have found elasticities between 0 and 0.3. An elasticity of 0.3 suggests that a 10% decrease in after tax-wages would decrease hours worked by 3%. Some researchers have critiqued the work finding low elasticities, citing poor methodological choices. These critics believe the response would likely be higher once these methodological shortcomings are accounted for, suggesting a larger decrease in hours worked in response to the same decrease in after-tax income. ", "According to the empirical literature, increased taxes tend to result in decreased work effort. Therefore, empirically, the substitution effect is larger in magnitude than the income effect. While increasing taxes will likely decrease individuals' work effort, it is unlikely that there would be a significant difference in work effort under a revenue neutral consumption tax compared to an income tax. The additional lump sum tax on old capital under a consumption tax is the principal reason for the anticipated minimal impact on work effort.

A generic income tax would be applied to both income earned from labor and capital. In addition to the impact on work choices discussed previously, an income tax is expected to affect individuals' saving behavior by reducing the after-tax return to savings. By reducing the after-tax return to savings, an income tax is expected to change individual saving behavior.

The expected increase in standard of living is due to a number of factors, including increased personal savings, but also the inherent lump sum tax on capital that occurs while transitioning to a consumption tax. The inherent lump sum tax allows policymakers to use a lower consumption tax rate than without the lump sum tax, while raising similar amounts of revenue to those under an income tax. The anticipated increase in economic welfare from switching to a consumption tax is largely due to a combination of these two factors, increased private saving, and the lower effective tax rate afforded by the lump-sum tax on capital.

The economic literature suggests that individuals would likely save more of their income due to the expected increased return to saving under a consumption tax, as discussed in the previous section. An increase in private saving would theoretically increase the amount of capital available for firms to borrow and use for investments in improved facilities, machines, and workers. Increases in the amount of capital available to firms are expected to increase productivity and lead to increased economic output in the long run, according to economic theory. ", "Additionally, the lump-sum tax on old capital allows for additional tax revenue without introducing significant distortions into the economy. As discussed earlier, individuals tend to save part of their income while young, investing in capital to finance consumption in retirement. They then draw down those savings to finance consumption when they are retired. As such, older individuals with retirement savings would own a significant amount of old capital, and would therefore bear a larger burden from the lump-sum tax when transitioning to a consumption tax.", "Researchers have produced varying estimates of the potential impact on the economy of transitioning to a consumption tax. These estimates vary for a number of reasons including the type of model, assumptions, and parameter estimates used. Researchers have found that switching to a consumption tax could increase total economic output by 5% to 10% in the long run compared with a stylized income tax. The projected increase in economic output occurs over a long period of time, often in the range of 100 years, meaning that the change in annual GDP growth is very small. It should also be noted that to achieve these economic gains under a consumption tax, near-term consumption spending necessarily decreases. ", "The burden the lump-sum tax on old capital would impose on the elderly with retirement savings may motivate policymakers to look for policy remedies to ease the tax burden on this cohort. However, this sort of policy intervention would reduce the expected increase in economic output. Estimates suggest that by compensating the owners of old capital, the efficiency gains of switching to a consumption tax could decrease by 60% to 90%. This occurs in part because any structure to compensate owners of old capital will require a higher tax rate under the consumption tax to maintain revenue neutrality.

As shown in Figure 2 , individuals between the ages of 35 and 44 had an average savings rate of 25%, in comparison with individuals under 25, who had an average savings rate of -9%, and individuals above 75 years old, who had an average savings rate of -1%. Due to the differing savings rates of individuals over their lifetimes, differing average tax rates are produced under a consumption tax as shown in Figure 2 . An individual under the age of 25, who has an average savings rate of -9%, would have an average tax rate of 22% with respect to annual income, while an individual between the ages of 35 and 44, who has an average savings rate of 25%, would have an average tax rate of 15%. Assuming that this distribution of savings rates would prevail under a consumption tax, middle-aged individuals would have the lowest average tax rates, as a function of their income, while older and younger individuals would have the highest average tax rates, as a function of their income.

Although a consumption-based tax could be designed to be very simple, a consumption-based tax is not inherently simpler than an income-based tax. An income-based tax could also be designed to be simpler and more manageable than the current income tax code. The complexity of the current tax code is not a result of using income as the tax base, but rather the political process and the gradual additions and revisions to the tax code. ", "While complexity is not necessarily inherent to either of these tax bases, consumption or income, limited evidence shows that some consumption-based taxes tend to have lower administrative costs. For example, European countries with VATs have average administrative costs of 3 to 5 cents per dollar collected in tax revenue, compared with 13 cents per dollar in the United States. Another study found that VAT administration costs in the United Kingdom were estimated to be 0.55% of revenue collected, compared with 1.27% in the United States for the federal income tax. As discussed earlier, most European countries have introduced VATs to supplement their income taxes. If the United States were to follow this example, administrative costs associated would likely increase, as a new or expanded agency would be required to administer the new consumption tax.

Under a VAT or NST, the relative price of consumer goods and services would necessarily increase with respect to production costs and wages as the new tax is applied to goods and services. Because the price increase is relative to production costs and wages, assuming production costs cannot be lowered, the relative increase in prices can be achieved either by price increases or wage decreases. Whether prices or wages are impacted depends on \"the institutions of wage- and price-setting and on monetary policy.\" Policy analysts generally believe that a one-time increase in consumer prices would be accommodated, in part because workers are reluctant to accept lower wages and many workers could leave their jobs if wages were lowered. Additionally, if inflation expectations remain well-anchored, a one-time price adjustment might not lead to any subsequent changes in inflation, in which case monetary policy would not need to be modified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interactions with State Tax Codes", "paragraphs": ["State tax codes and the federal tax code interact in a number of ways, which could complicate the implementation of a broad consumption tax in the United States. As discussed earlier, a number of states have consumption taxes in the form of retail sales taxes. If the federal government were to implement a broad-based consumption tax as well, states could object that the federal government is encroaching on their tax base. ", "Additional implementation hurdles arise due to the inconsistent tax bases across states. Many states have exempted certain items and entities from their sales tax. With the implementation of a consumption tax, such as the NST, businesses would have to keep track of two separate lists of taxable items based on the federal tax code and their home state tax code. Businesses would be tasked with managing a tax structure in which either one, both, or neither tax is applied to certain items at the point of sale. This sort of added complexity reduces the administrative efficiency gains that could be achieved under a consumption tax. However, under the current income tax structure similar complexity exists due to alternative income tax deductions available at the state and federal level.

Under a progressive income tax, as the economy expands and individuals' incomes grow, individuals' tax burdens also grow, which some believe has a stabilizing effect on the economy. Similarly, under a consumption tax, as the economy expands, individual demand for goods grows, which will increase individuals' tax burdens and decrease demand. It is a matter of debate whether countercyclical tax policy helps promote stability of the business cycle or potentially leads to further destabilization of the business cycle."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
