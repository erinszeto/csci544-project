PLA naval forces feature quieter submarines, large surface combatants with improved air defenses and long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, and a nascent aircraft carrier program. New air power capabilities include modern fighter aircraft, more supporting platforms, and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in production and under development. The PLA has increased the number and accuracy of its ballistic missiles for both nuclear and conventional strike missions.

The cyber operations of the PLA are harder to characterize, but reports indicate that China has invested heavily in this area.", "Despite the acquisition of modern equipment, the PLA has weaknesses and limitations that constrain the effectiveness of its operations, including training, jointness, human capital, and logistics. The short war with Vietnam in 1979 was China's last major conflict, and the PLA has not been involved in sustained combat since the Korean War (1950-1953) and a limited border war with India (1962).

The PLA shares many features in common with militaries around the world, but its organization has many unique features. The PLA is divided into four services (for ground, naval, air, and missile forces) and the Strategic Support Force, which appears to be responsible for logistics, space and cyber capabilities, and development of information technology ( Figure 1 ). Two-thirds of the PLA currently is composed of ground forces, and generals from the ground forces have historically dominated top PLA leadership. China's plan to cut 300,000 troops in the near future may shift force structure and leadership ratios in favor of the naval and air forces. Although an earlier incarnation of the PLA fought against Imperial Japan (1937-1945) and won its signature victory in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949) against the Nationalist (Kuomintang) forces of Chiang Kai-shek, it has no recent combat experience. The short war with Vietnam in 1979 was China's last major conflict, and the PLA has not been involved in sustained combat since the Korean War (1950-1953) and the brief border war with India (1962). China does not have military allies, effectively.", "Alongside the PLA active and reserve forces, China maintains the People's Armed Police Force (PAP), a paramilitary police force whose primary mission is to provide internal security (e.g., as riot police for major disturbances). China also has a formal \"militia\" composed of citizens who would be called on to assist the PLA with domestic security and logistics functions during war.", "The allegiance of the PLA to the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP, or the Party) has shaped the PLA's history and its present functions. Unlike the U.S. Department of Defense's relationship with the U.S. military, China's Ministry of National Defense does not govern the PLA, but instead manages PLA interactions with foreign militaries and defense agencies. The CCP exercises civilian oversight of the PLA through the Central Military Commission (CMC), a powerful body in the Chinese political system currently chaired by Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. In late 2015 and early 2016, China outlined major reforms to the organization of the PLA. The reforms have several stated objectives, including: rationalize the force structure for China's current security environment, improve joint (inter-service) command and control structures, centralize administrative authority under the CMC, increase oversight to eliminate corruption, and improve the professional military education system. Many details of the organizational reforms remain unclear as of March 2016, but the far-reaching scope of the changes indicates that China's defense elites have a desire to address deep-rooted problems. The timing of the reforms could suggest that Chinese leaders see their country's external security environment as stable enough to allow a period of internal disorganization during the implementation process.", "China divides its territory into five large Theater Commands (\u6218\u533a, sometimes translated as \"theater\" or \"battle zone\"), each covering at least three provinces or autonomous regions ( Figure 2 ). Prior to the PLA organizational reforms announced in late 2015 and early 2016, there were seven areas, called Military Regions, which functioned as administrative organizations in charge of training and other preparations during peacetime and may have constituted temporary operational war zone headquarters during a national security emergency.

Many of the PLA's older major weapons systems are legacy platforms from the Cold War era, a time when Chinese defense technology lagged far behind, but the ratio of modern to older platforms is steadily increasing. For example, China's inventory of fighter aircraft has declined sharply since the mid-1990s to about 1,500 aircraft, but the percentage of that inventory that is composed of modern, fourth-generation-and-above fighters has grown to nearly 50% (see Figure 4 ).

Successive generations of Chinese leaders have built upon these pillars so that they apply to the current age of modern warfare. Classic texts such as Sun Tzu's The Art of War continue to guide Chinese strategists in using deception, leveraging all aspects of national power, disrupting the enemy's alliances, attacking the enemy's strategy, and the preference for achieving the state's objectives without using force. For more discussion, see Appendix B .", "The principle of \"Active Defense\" is China's strategic stance of not attacking unless attacked, but seizing the initiative on the \"operational level\" once China is under attack on the \"strategic level.\" Active Defense continues to be the strategic guideline for China's national defense. Chinese military leaders describe Active Defense as being \"on the whole\" strategically defensive but \"on the specifics\" operationally offensive in order to achieve goals that are perceived as strategically defensive. This understanding might be used to justify a pre-emptive strike if China's leaders deem that the country's strategic interests are under threat. American experts on the PLA have suggested that China might carry out a military first strike in response to foreign non-military actions, such as those in the political domain, if Beijing sees those actions as an attack on China at the strategic level. ", "In the nuclear realm, however, China asserts a doctrine of \"no first-use,\" meaning that it would not launch a nuclear attack on another country unless that country has struck first with nuclear weapons. The PRC has described its doctrine for response to a nuclear attack as \"limited nuclear retaliation,\" and outside assessments concur that the size of China's nuclear weapons arsenal is far below that of the U.S. or Russian arsenals (see \" Ballistic Missile and Nuclear Forces ,\" below). Many observers note that the no first-use doctrine may be subject to change under the pressure of war or depend on circumstances, although there are indications that Chinese leaders are sincere in promoting this policy.", "In 2004, Hu Jintao, CCP leader 2002-2012, tasked the military with a new mission set called the New Historic Missions, which expanded the definition and geographic scope of China's security interests. The missions can be summarized as (1) reinforcing the PLA's loyalty to the CCP; (2) ensuring China's economic development by defending China's sovereignty, territorial integrity (prevent Taiwan's \"secession\"), and domestic security; (3) defending China's expanding national interests, especially in the maritime, space, and cyberspace domains; and (4) preventing the outbreak of conflict by improving deterrence and through international security cooperation.", "Current leader Xi Jinping is pursuing the development of a strong military as a necessity for realizing the \"Chinese Dream,\" which is Xi's aspirational phrase for a modern, strong, and prosperous China. Xi emphasizes developing the PLA's actual fighting capabilities as the main goal of military modernization efforts, calling on the military to enhance its \"real combat awareness\" and be able to \"fight and win wars.\" Xi has carried out an intense anti-corruption campaign throughout the armed forces, investigating and punishing high-level officers across the military's leadership. Analysts have posited that corruption investigations are being used to solidify support for Xi and his military reform plan, which is meant to reinforce loyalty to the CCP.

Likewise, the 2015 defense white paper recognizes China's increasing comprehensive national strength and international influence. It asserts that the U.S. strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region, with an enhanced military presence and alliance network, is the main cause of regional instability, rather than China's efforts to enhance control over its expansive territorial claims.

China seeks to have the status of Taiwan resolved on terms favorable to Beijing (i.e., that Taiwan eventually unifies with mainland China instead of becoming a formally independent country). Experts believe that other reasons for China's military modernization are its ambitions to become the leading regional power in a more multipolar East Asia and to defend China's expanding economic interests, including shipping lanes. There is a plethora of opinions about other drivers of China's military modernization, as well as views that ascribe more hostile intent to Chinese leaders.", "Some analysts believe that China is not building up its military to push the U.S. military out of the Western Pacific, but rather is strengthening the PLA to shape the regional strategic environment in China's favor. Beijing intends for its growing military power to serve as a deterrent to negative outcomes on what it considers core interests\u2014the status of Taiwan, Tibet, and perhaps other territorial claims\u2014these experts argue. The gap between Beijing's views of its rightful territorial possessions and outsiders' views of these territorial claims leads to friction and distrust of Chinese aims. The PRC does not consider its desire to unify with Taiwan and to consolidate control over islands in the South China Sea as strategically offensive, whereas many in the United States and other countries see such ambitions as inherently offensive. To execute those types of missions, China is enhancing the PLA's power projection capabilities, exacerbating friction and distrust. Many observers agree that China does not seek war\u2014after all, it has benefited enormously from the existing international order\u2014but its growing desire to enforce territorial claims may lead to friction and even conflict.

One U.S. expert on Asian security wrote in 2012, \"The military investments currently pursued by China, therefore, reflect its interests in larger goals beyond simply territorial integrity....\" Pointing to elements of Chinese strategic thought such as the \"New Security Concept,\" which suggests that Asians alone should be responsible for security affairs in Asia, some analysts believe that over time Beijing will seek to minimize the U.S. forward military presence and \"dominate\" East Asia. In such a future, the preponderant power of the PLA could intimidate China's smaller neighbors and place them in a \"constant state of latent coercion,\" according to one analyst.", "There appears to be less agreement about China's ambitions to wield military power on a global scale. Some analysts believe that the trend of increasing PLA force projection capabilities and activities in distant areas of the globe will continue unabated, and that China may seek to become a global military power by 2050. Other analysts assert that China will continue to eschew the responsibilities of a world power and will focus narrowly on defending Chinese interests in a few strategically important areas, especially energy-exporting regions.

China possesses nearly 70 satellites used for military purposes that include communications; navigation, positioning, and timing; ISR; meteorology; and electronic and signals intelligence. China's Zhongxing communications satellites are dual use, and are assessed to enable secure communications for the PLA. China has a limited satellite navigation system called Beidou, which is expected to become fully operational around 2020 with capabilities comparable to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS). A completed Beidou satellite constellation could support target positioning at the tactical level, be used in coordination with guidance systems by precision strike weapons, and allow for a common operating picture of friendly force locations. Beidou is expected to play an important role in providing the PLAAF, PLAN, and PLARF with operational support farther from China's borders as the system achieves global coverage near the end of the decade.

However, a general picture of Chinese military capabilities in the cyber domain has emerged in public research. The 2013 edition of The Science of Military Strategy , a key PLA text, reportedly describes China's network attack forces and how they might be employed. China has three types of cyber forces: (1) specialized military network warfare forces in the PLA, (2) PLA-authorized teams of network warfare specialists in government organizations, and (3) non-governmental forces that may be mobilized for network warfare operations. This third category constitutes a cyber militia of private-sector personnel that the PLA can task with computer network operations, and perhaps patriotic hackers that the PRC government could direct loosely.", "The PLA has employed network warfare units since the 1990s and announced in 2003 that it would incorporate these units in all PLA armies. According to analysts, prior to the 2016 organizational reforms the General Staff Department Third Department exercised executive authority over PLA's cyber espionage, broadly speaking. Under this authority, the Beijing North Computing Center planned and coordinated PLA computer network operations, including \"exploitation of foreign networks, and possibly denying an adversary access to his networks.\" Following the elimination of the General Departments in the early 2016 PLA reorganization, analysts believe that responsibility for cyber and space capabilities resides in the newly established PLA Strategic Support Force. In addition, there are many groups within the PLA that conduct computer network operations on a semi-autonomous basis. Reportedly, Chinese military and non-military entities have conducted cyber espionage on a large scale and stolen U.S. defense contractor data that Chinese defense firms used to develop advanced aircraft and other platforms.

Although the PLA may overcome certain limitations in capacity or training realism in the near term, other weaknesses could remain for decades while the PLA attempts to correct them.", "By its own assessments, the PLA has weaknesses in training, jointness, administration, human capital, force development, and logistics. The organizational practices and relationships that developed in the course of the PLA's history are poorly suited to current requirements. PLA officers must spend hours each week studying CCP pronouncements and burnishing their loyalty to the Party. Compared to other militaries, the PLA has underutilized its non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and its lower-level officers are not as empowered to improvise decisions during battle. Historically, PLA training and exercises were highly scripted and did not foster a culture of honest self-examination and improvement. Corrupt PLA officials diverted military resources for personal profit and bribed senior PLA leaders in exchange for promotions, according to reports. PLA and external commentators have noted the PLA's slow progress in executing truly joint operations (with multiple services coordinating in a synergistic manner). The lack of combat experience for nearly all PLA personnel may be one reason that organizational problems were allowed to fester, and it could continue to inhibit rapid learning and incorporation of organizational improvements.", "The PLA has limitations in its ability to project power outside China's immediate periphery, although the PLA appears focused on overcoming this problem. The farther that the PLA reaches over the horizon, the more it is likely to encounter problems with command and control, ISR coverage and targeting, logistics, and limited inventories of longer-range weapons. Learning the requirements of long-distance, long-duration operations was one motivation for China to send PLAN vessels to participate in multinational anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. The lack of overseas military facilities constrains China's ambition to enhance its naval presence along strategic sea lines of communication. To address this challenge (and to provide support to Chinese peacekeeping forces in Africa), China reached an agreement with Djibouti in late 2015 to establish a PLA logistics facility in the small African country.", "Analyzing the Chinese military's weaknesses by comparison to other militaries (especially to militaries with global reach) may not always be appropriate, because different militaries have different missions to perform. In the near future, China's leaders may judge that the PLA is sufficiently capable of performing its assigned missions, despite persistent problems. On the other hand, as noted in a 2015 RAND assessment, PLA weaknesses in areas like logistics and amphibious lift could render the PLA unable to carry out assigned missions, in particular an invasion of Taiwan. Both air lift and sea lift capacity remain major shortcomings for the PLA, constraining significantly its ability to carry out large-scale power projection operations.", "Political and economic problems may also constrain the Chinese military. A significant increase in domestic unrest, or security risks from terrorism and transnational crime, may cause PRC leaders to divert more PLA resources toward managing these issues. Low levels of economic growth could reduce China's available resources to increase the defense budget.

The percentage of Chinese GDP that is spent on defense, roughly 2%, is comparable to most other countries and lower than the proportion spent by the United States, Russia, and South Korea (see Figure 5 ), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Analysts believe that defense modernization will remain subordinate to economic development, in line with China's overall national strategy. Indeed, the 7.6% defense budget increase in 2016 is smaller than in recent years and follows the trajectory of China's economy.

For example, spending on veterans' benefits, nuclear weapons development and maintenance, and military construction costs are not included consistently across countries. Procurement of foreign-produced weapons systems, for example, is not included in the PLA budget and thus the discrepancy can fluctuate on a year-to-year basis. China may seek to diminish concerns about the growth of its defense budget by under-reporting defense spending. Elements of centralized state planning within China's economic structure make it difficult to value certain inputs and activities. Poor accounting practices and incomplete information within China's defense bureaucracy make it difficult for China itself to determine an accurate amount. The profits of companies owned or controlled by the PLA are not part of the official budget. However, after the CCP ordered the PLA to divest its commercial assets in the 1990s, this source of off-the-books funding for the PLA has shrunk.", "China's white papers state, and one external study confirmed, that the defense budget is split roughly evenly among three categories: personnel, training and maintenance, and equipment, but the PLA does not provide any further breakdown of spending. Lower per-capita personnel costs and lower costs of many goods and services in China, compared to most developed countries, amplify the spending power of each yuan in the budget. A comparison of U.S. and Chinese defense budgets on an exchange-rate basis understates the true purchasing power of the Chinese budget.

In the current era, CMI aids the defense sector by leveraging the science and technology base in the civilian domain. This includes providing civilian technologies for military use and providing new sources of capital to the defense sector. Reform efforts aim to facilitate private company participation in the defense sector in order to generate increased competition, innovation, and capital. While enjoying widespread understanding and support, implementation of CMI has met strong obstacles stemming from deficient implementation guidance, entrenched status-quo interests, and a history of civil-military segregation and an independent PLA. Private sector involvement in the defense sector has also been hindered by the fact that state owned enterprises (SOEs) have advantages in areas such as taxes and priority bid consideration. Overall, CMI has taken root but remains underdeveloped.", "Other serious issues in China's defense sector remain, including widespread corruption; inadequate quality control; limited competition due to domination of the market by SOEs; an inefficient \"cost-plus\" pricing system that reduces incentives to innovate; bureaucratic fragmentation that fosters risk-adverse consensus-based decisionmaking; and restricted access to advanced Western technologies after the United States and European countries imposed arms embargoes in response to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Despite these difficulties, the DOD assesses that progress is being made. China's missile manufacturers produce a range of cruise, ballistic, air-to-air, and surface-to-air missiles that are comparable to top-tier foreign models.

The 12 areas include nuclear operations, advanced combined-arms and joint combat operations, surveillance and reconnaissance operations, military space operations, and access to a DOD laboratory. The FY2000 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to inform Congress annually about any contacts with the PLA that breached the restrictions on inappropriate exposure.", "Some observers argue that mil-mil relations with the PLA have been detrimental to U.S. national interests and that the U.S. military should change its approach toward these contacts. These observers argue that access to U.S. military assets and facilities aided PLA modernization efforts in the past and that the U.S. military did not gain reciprocal access from the PLA. Furthermore, they argue, the PLA could use the information that it has learned about U.S. equipment and operations against the United States in a potential future conflict. Another criticism is that high-level dialogues and participation in high-profile exercises like RIMPAC give unwarranted status to the PLA, which, these analysts contend, has behaved in destabilizing ways that merit reprimand rather than reward. Some observers argue that the U.S. military's eagerness for good mil-mil relations with the PLA has led U.S. policymakers in some cases to defer or dilute actions that would upset Chinese leaders.", "Other observers, including current DOD officials and U.S. military officers, assert that the mil-mil relationship with the PLA provides a number of benefits to the United States. The high-level dialogues are the only channel for senior U.S. military officers and officials to interact directly with their counterparts. Proponents note that these dialogues are a good setting to deliver deterrent messages to senior PLA leaders and to foster understanding of U.S. defense policies. Some observers argue that these talks could open up channels of communications to defuse crises or to improve operational coordination between the two militaries, although a 2015 study concluded that individual and institutional barriers prevented U.S.-China mil-mil relations from creating \"operational value\" in that sense. ", "The United States and China in October 2014 signed two MOUs that are intended to improve transparency and decrease the risk of accidents and miscalculation through confidence-building measures. These non-binding agreements largely reaffirm existing commitments made by the two sides. DOD contends that the MOUs reflect a \"shared objective of the two militaries to improve relations, reduce risk, and expand cooperation in areas of mutual interest while managing our differences through sustained and substantive engagements.\" The MOU on Notification of Major Military Activities relates to exchange of information about defense policies and strategies and the observation of military exercises, and it calls for the creation of a mechanism to improve information exchange. The MOU on Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters outlines a framework for prescribed behavior in encounters between surface vessels.

This section summarizes the main elements of these responses, with a focus on recent actions. Although U.S. officials state that many of the actions described below are not directed at any particular country, many observers believe they are, at least in part, responses to China's changing military capabilities and China's assertive behavior regarding its maritime territorial claims in the East and South China Seas. (Some of them may also be responses to concerns about North Korean and Iranian military capabilities.)", "U.S. diplomatic engagement has sought to alleviate Chinese security concerns while emphasizing deterrent messages regarding American interests. In 2011, the Obama Administration initiated its policy of \"strategic rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific region, partly to reassure allies about the strength of the U.S. military presence in East Asia and to prevent conflict through enhanced deterrence. The State Department and DOD developed frameworks to enhance significantly the security relationships with Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea. In addition to bolstering treaty alliances, the United States has enhanced its security cooperation with other countries in the region, notably Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam, alongside efforts to engage constructively with China. ", "In May 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative, a new capacity-building effort focused on improving maritime law enforcement and information sharing in Southeast Asia.

This increased emphasis constitutes the military component of the strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region that also includes economic and political components. In 2012, DOD announced that 60% of U.S. Navy vessels will be based in the Pacific theater by 2020, shifting from the previous 50/50 split between the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. The U.S. military has arranged for additional deployments of U.S. forces on a rotational basis to U.S. allies Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea. DOD states that it will deploy its most advanced defense platforms (for example, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyer) to the Asia-Pacific region before other areas.", "DOD's budget includes a number of programs for investing in weapons and systems for so-called \"high-end\" warfare, meaning technologically sophisticated, high-intensity warfare against capable adversary forces. To address concerns that the U.S. military technological edge over potential adversaries may be diminishing, DOD in November 2014 announced a new Defense Innovation Initiative. In a related effort, DOD has also announced that it is seeking a new general U.S. approach\u2014a \"third offset strategy\"\u2014for maintaining U.S. superiority over opposing military forces that are numerically large and armed with precision-guided weapons. In testimony to Congress in February 2016, the commander of U.S. Pacific Command highlighted DOD efforts to increase the lethality of surface-to-surface missiles. Alongside advances in defense technologies, DOD is crafting new operational concepts to leverage its advantages, especially in joint operations. The AirSea Battle operational concept, subsumed within the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons in 2015, is an attempt to counter the types of A2/AD capabilities that the PLA has developed.", "Some U.S. military operations may be a direct response to Chinese military activities. DOD is maintaining and in some cases drawing public attention to its naval and air operations in the Western Pacific, including presence operations and Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations that are intended to reinforce long-standing international legal norms relating to freedom of the seas.

Challenges in assessing China's changing military capability and comparing it to U.S. military capabilities include the following:", "Multiple factors contribute to military capability. Ships, aircraft, vehicles, and ballistic missiles can be relatively easy to count, but quantity is only one aspect of a country's military capability. Other factors include the technological sophistication of those platforms and weapons; capabilities for knitting those platforms and weapons into networks; supporting maintenance and logistics capabilities; doctrine and tactics; the quality, education, and training of personnel; and the realism and complexity of exercises. Some of these factors are harder to observe and evaluate than others. Limited Chinese transparency . China's limited transparency on matters relating to its military makes it more difficult to observe and evaluate factors that contribute to or detract from China's military capability. U.S. officials regularly urge China to be more transparent about its military activities. In recent years, China has taken small steps in that direction by providing increased information about its military in periodic defense white papers. Information on China's military is also available in a wide array of defense-focused magazines published in China. Even so, China in general makes available much less information about its military than the United States does about its military. Differing geographic scope of responsibilities. The U.S. military has substantial worldwide responsibilities, including NATO-related responsibilities in Europe and a security role in the Middle East. Consequently, only a portion of the U.S. military might be available for a crisis or conflict scenario involving China. The PLA, in contrast, has limited responsibilities outside China's home region. Consequently, a more substantial fraction of China's military would likely be available for a conflict in China's home region. D iffering missions. The missions to be performed by one country's military can differ greatly from the missions to be performed by another country's military. Consequently, more meaning comes from measuring a military's capability against its assigned missions than measuring against other metrics. This consideration is significant in assessing U.S. and Chinese military capabilities, because the missions of the two militaries are quite different.", "Potential oversight questions for Congress include the following:", "Is the executive branch accurately assessing China's changing military capabilities, particularly in relation to the kinds of missions that Chinese leaders want the PLA to be able to perform? Is the executive branch doing enough to encourage greater transparency from China concerning its military capabilities? How well are U.S. surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities able to compensate for China's limited transparency on military matters? Are DOD and the U.S. intelligence community devoting the right amount of resources toward surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities directed at the PLA? What are the limits of what can be learned through these activities? How does U.S.-China military-to-military engagement inform the U.S. government about Chinese military capabilities? Does DOD's annual report to Congress on military and security developments involving China provide sufficient information to permit Congress to make a well-considered (if generalized) independent assessment of China's military capabilities?

Challenges in assessing the intentions of China's leaders include the following:", "Statements from Chinese (or other national) lea d ers about their intentions may not always be reliable. China's leaders make regular (if often generalized) statements about their intentions for their military through white papers and other public statements. These statements, however, might be attempts to influence foreign audiences or for domestic consumption, and might not be an accurate guide to understanding the actual intentions that China's leaders have for the PLA. On the other hand, not all statements should be dismissed as posturing. For example, Chinese leaders have made statements about China's \"core interests\" and their willingness to defend them by force if necessary; such statements might reflect, to some degree at least, genuinely held views. The challenge is to discern posturing from genuine expressions. Observing what kinds of military capabilities China is pursuing, and how these capabilities appear to align or not align with stated intentions, can help inform judgments on this question. Limited Chinese transparency. As with the matter of assessing China's military capabilities, assessing China's leaders' intentions regarding the military is made more complicated by China's limited transparency regarding intentions. DOD states that \"China's lack of transparency surrounding its growing military capabilities and strategic decision-making has also increased concerns in the region about China's intentions. Absent greater transparency, these concerns will likely intensify as the PLA modernization progresses.\" U.S. officials regularly urge China to be more transparent regarding their intentions. Mirror imaging. Assessing China's leaders' intentions regarding the military can benefit from having an accurate understanding of the values and belief sets of those leaders. Those values and belief sets can differ, perhaps substantially, from the values and belief sets common to Americans. Mirror imaging\u2014tacitly and perhaps unconsciously assuming that one's values and belief sets are shared by the other party\u2014can lead to less accurate assessments of the other party's intentions.

China's Strategic Culture", "Mao Zedong's Principles", "Chinese strategists continue to cite Mao Zedong as a master of warfare, and describe his military theory as the baseline that subsequent leaders have built upon and improved. However, in many other ways, the PLA has cast aside outdated ideas in favor of modern concepts derived from other militaries' strategies. Mao's dictums that war is a continuation of politics and that the Communist Party must have political control over the military remain guiding principles today. Mao's concept of \"People's War,\" which traditionally relies on overwhelming numbers, guerrilla tactics, cooperation between the military and the broader population, and protracted conflict, is being updated to apply to modern warfare. The People's War concept is being integrated with information warfare through the use of modern fighting platforms and domains, thereby in theory allowing \"the masses\" and PLA to work hand-in-hand even in cyber operations. Likewise, some Western analysts have assessed that China is applying the concept of People's War to its maritime disputes by organizing some of its fishing fleet into a maritime militia. The People's War concept continues to be taken seriously by China's leaders and does not appear merely to be a relic from the days of Mao. ", "Evolution of Chinese \"Military Thought\"", "Successive CCP leaders have built upon the principles of ancient strategists and Mao Zedong in promulgating their own dictums on the military and the strategic environment. This evolutionary process reflects each leader's understanding of China's strategic environment and the PLA's changing abilities to protect the state's interests. Deng Xiaoping, who served as China's supreme leader from 1978 until his death in 1997, judged that the main root of warfare had changed from class struggle to hegemony, reflecting the perceived military threat from the Soviet Union. In contrast with the CCP's previous long-held view that war was imminent, Deng posited that overall war was avoidable and that, if war did come, it would be a \"local war,\" meaning a war that is short of world war or nuclear war. Deng also applied his principle of \"seeking truth from facts\" to military development, admitting that the quality of the force was low and therefore incapable of fighting a modern war. Deng advocated large-scale personnel cuts as a means to increase fighting strength and emphasized that army building was secondary to China's other modernization priorities.", "Jiang Zemin was elevated to the top CCP post in 1989, immediately following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. In response to the harsh crackdown, Western countries imposed sanctions to prohibit the sale of advanced weapons to China, which was diplomatically isolated at the time. Nevertheless, the 1991 Persian Gulf War demonstrated to Beijing the importance of the use of high-tech weaponry to defeat a less-advanced opponent. Since that time, \"winning local wars under high-tech conditions\" has been a mainstay in China's understanding of modern warfare. Jiang supported military budget increases that were commensurate with overall national economic growth, overseeing consistent double-digit annual military budget increases. Like Deng, Jiang emphasized the need for quality over quantity to improve combat effectiveness, calling for the application of science and technology to enhance military training, education, and logistics. Jiang also took the crucial step of largely divesting the military from its commercial endeavors, which had become a serious source of corruption.", "A Chinese Way of War?", "Chinese thinking about military strategy and operations has idiosyncratic aspects that are amplified by Chinese axioms such as, \"You fight in your way and we fight in ours, and strive for full initiative.\" The PLA is not as transparent as most Western militaries regarding military doctrine, but there are several features to highlight here. Mobilization of the civilian population, a corollary of the People's War concept, figures large in Chinese military planning, for example. PRC administrative units (e.g., provinces and cities) regularly conduct exercises for defense mobilization of civilian transportation and infrastructure assets. Analysts assess that alongside kinetic operations, Chinese leaders likely would employ the concept of the \"Three Warfares\"\u2014legal, media/propaganda, and psychological warfare\u2014during (and possibly before) a conflict to achieve their political aims.", "Following the strategic concept of Active Defense, PLA strategists place a high priority on seizing the initiative in a conflict. Some observers believe that the PLA would pair this predilection with its assessment that the cyber and space domains are the \"high ground\" of contemporary warfare and thus choose to strike its adversary's information networks. According to one American scholar, China believes that a \"preemptive first strike is preferable, as it sets the stage for the remainder of the conflict and puts the aggressor in a distinct position of advantage.... The PLA advocates a cyber-posture that makes no differentiation between peace-time and war-time, and, in fact, advocates for a state of perpetual mobilization.\" The PLA may use a variety of operations, including kinetic and electronic warfare methods, to disrupt an adversary's military satellite networks.", "Since the Sino-Soviet split in 1960, China has pursued a course of strategic non-alignment and has eschewed treaty alliances. China often criticizes U.S. bilateral alliances, calling them outdated relics of the Cold War. China also has made rejection of overseas bases a central part of its foreign policy, but there are indications that the ongoing expansion of PLA operations may force China to rethink this policy. The new logistics facility that the PLA plans to establish in Djibouti may be a sign that China has already changed its approach."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
