Such conduct can include (1) soliciting or otherwise requesting offers; (2) cancelling such solicitations or requests; (3) awarding or proposing to award a contract; (4) terminating or cancelling a contract due to improprieties involving its award; or (5) converting functions performed by government employees to private sector performance. Bid protests are of perennial interest to Congress, in part, because of the effects of protests on agency missions and operations. Congressional interest can also be prompted by notable protests, as well as by agency determinations not to follow any nonbinding recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in deciding protests.", "GAO is not the only forum with authority to hear bid protests involving federal acquisitions. The procuring agency and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims can also hear bid protests. However, GAO hears more protests than the Court of Federal Claims, the only other forum for which data are readily available. Thus, its protest procedures\u2014which can differ somewhat from those of the procuring agencies and the Court of Federal Claims\u2014are the focus of this report.", "Legislation and regulations establish what issues may be protested with GAO and who may bring a protest. As previously noted, by statute, GAO may hear complaints alleging violations of federal procurement law in federal acquisitions. However, it is expressly barred by regulation from hearing certain issues, such as challenges to small business size certifications. Any interested party\u2014an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of, or failure to award, a contract\u2014may file a protest.", "GAO is required by statute to provide for the \"inexpensive and expeditious\" resolution of protests, \"[t]o the maximum extent practicable.\" Its practices permit \"inexpensive\" resolution, in part, by enabling interested parties to represent themselves, rather than rely on attorneys. For example, GAO does not require \"formal briefs\" or \"other technical forms\" of pleadings or motions. It is also subject to statutory mandates that promote \"expeditious\" resolution, in part, by requiring GAO to issue final decisions within 65 to 100 days after the protest was filed.", "Filing a GAO protest may trigger an automatic stay of contract award or performance that lasts for the duration of the protest. Such automatic stays are unique to bid protests filed with GAO and help account for GAO's popularity as a protest forum. Agencies may, however, override these stays upon determining that urgent and compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for GAO's decision, or performance of the contract is in the best interests of the United States.", "GAO may dismiss, deny, or sustain a protest. When a protest is dismissed or denied, the procuring agency may generally proceed with the challenged action. In contrast, when a protest is sustained, GAO may recommend specific actions (e.g., amending the solicitation, reevaluating proposals). Such recommendations are not legally binding because the separation of powers doctrine precludes legislative branch agencies, such as GAO, from controlling the actions of executive branch agencies. However, the procuring agency is required by statute to notify GAO if GAO's recommendations are not fully implemented, and GAO, in turn, must notify Congress.", "Protesters disappointed with GAO's decision can seek reconsideration from GAO.

The federal courts did not hear protests at that time. Indeed, in its 1940 decision in Perkins v. Lukens Steel Company , the Supreme Court found that actual or potential bidders who had been disappointed in their dealings with the federal government lacked standing to challenge alleged violations of federal procurement laws by government agencies. The Court reached this conclusion because it viewed these federal procurement laws as having been enacted strictly for the government's benefit, \"for the purpose of keeping its own house in order,\" and thus not enforceable against the government by private parties. However, several decades later, beginning with the 1970 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. John H. Shaffer , the federal courts came to hold that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 authorized them to hear bid protests. ", "Congress later expressly granted bid protest jurisdiction to GAO when it enacted the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984. GAO's long history of handling bid protests, coupled with several unique aspects of the GAO bid-protest process, most notably the stay of contract award or performance that may result from the filing of a GAO protest, make it a primary locus for federal bid protests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purposes of Bid-Protest Processes", "paragraphs": ["Although disappointed bidders or offerors would generally have no right to protest if Congress did not provide for this right with either CICA or the APA, Congress has chosen to authorize several judicial and other forums to hear bid protests for several reasons. First, protest mechanisms ensure that entities doing business with the government can air their complaints about government contracting processes and obtain relief. Without such mechanisms, certain frustrations that citizens have with their government could remain unaddressed. Additionally, absent such mechanisms, entities might be less willing to do business with the government, which could diminish competition for government contracts and drive up prices. Second, protest mechanisms enhance the accountability of procurement officials and government agencies by highlighting and correcting mistakes and misconduct. This accountability helps to ensure the integrity of the procurement system. If the government's procurement system were perceived as corrupt or ineffective, contractors might be less willing to compete for government contracts, and the price at which the government acquires goods and services could increase. A corrupt or ineffective procurement system could also waste taxpayers' money.", "These benefits of bid protests are not costless, however; protests can impede the prompt and efficient acquisition of goods and services needed by the government. Particularly when contract award or performance is stayed due to the filing of a bid protest, as may happen with GAO protests, protests can delay agency procurement actions. Protests also require agency officials to spend time explaining their conduct to disappointed bidders and offerors, and in defending their conduct before judicial or other forums. Moreover, fear of possible protests may increase the time and energy that agencies expend in documenting their procurement decisions. Congress has, however, historically viewed the benefits of protests as outweighing these costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The GAO Bid-Protest Process", "paragraphs": ["When it enacted CICA, Congress charged GAO with \"provid[ing] for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of [bid] protests\" to \"the maximum extent practicable.\" GAO has attempted to meet these goals through the use of time frames and procedures partly prescribed by statute and partly established by administrative rulemaking. These time frames and procures are discussed below.

The alleged violation may arise prior to contract award, as when a contractor claims that some aspect of the solicitation would impermissibly disadvantage it in competing for the contract. Alternately, the alleged violation may arise with the contract, as when a contractor claims that the government failed to follow the rules for the competition or otherwise acted improperly in awarding the contract to the protestor's competitor(s). Starting in FY2008, under additional jurisdiction granted to GAO by Congress, GAO may also hear alleged violations pertaining to agencies' issuance of task or delivery orders under multiple-award contracts, or contracting out under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76. It can also hear protests involving Transportation Security Administration contracts, which had formerly been excluded from GAO review.", "GAO regulations, however, bar GAO from considering certain issues, even when these issues are implicated in the formation of a government contract. These issues generally include the following:", "disputes between a contractor and an agency regarding the terms and performance of an existing contract; challenges to small business size standards and standard industrial classifications; issuance of or refusal to issue certificates of competency under Section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act; determinations to procure particular supplies or services through the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (commonly known as the 8(a) Program); challenges to agency determinations that a prospective contractor is affirmatively \"responsible\" for purposes of the award of a contract; alleged procurement integrity violations which the protester did not report to the agency responsible for the alleged violations within 14 days of discovering them; procurements by agencies that are not \"federal agencies\" as defined in Section 3 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. \u00a7102); awards or proposed awards of subcontracts, unless the agency awarding the prime contract has requested in writing that subcontract protests be handled by GAO as \"non-statutory protests\"; the debarment and suspension of government contractors; protests asserting that the protester's proposal should not have been included or kept in the competitive range; and decisions by \"agency tender officials\" regarding whether to file protests in connection with \"public-private competitions,\" which are competitions conducted to determine whether the \"commercial functions\" of federal agencies are performed using government personnel or contractor employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Can File or Be a Party to a GAO Protest?", "paragraphs": ["By statute, a GAO bid protest may be filed by any interested party , or any \"actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.\" This focus upon direct economic interest in determining who is an interested party means that a larger number of contractors can generally bring pre-award protests than can bring post-award protests. Prior to contract award, contractors who are considering bidding or offering generally qualify as interested parties. In contrast, after contract award, only contractors who bid on the contract or submitted offers may generally qualify as interested parties because only they are eligible for the award. Moreover, because of the focus on direct economic interest, GAO may require that contractors both have bid or offered on the contract and be next in line for its award if the protest is sustained for them to qualify as interested parties. Given their lack of \"direct economic interests,\" concerned citizens are not interested parties who may bring GAO bid protests. Subcontractors on federal contracts also generally lack standing to bring a GAO protest unless the contracting agency has requested that GAO hear such protests.", "In addition to prospective or actual bidders or offerors, other parties to GAO bid protests include the agency responsible for the alleged violations of federal procurement law and, potentially, one or more intervenors. Intervenors enter protests to protect their status as awardees or potential awardees.

", "GAO also allows protesters to avoid the costs of traveling to Washington, DC, where GAO is located, by providing for the resolution of protests based upon documents filed by the protester and the agency, as opposed to in-person hearings. Hearings are relatively rare in GAO protests. Between FY2011 and FY2014, 3% to 8% of GAO cases annually entailed hearings. Moreover, when held, hearings are generally less formal than hearings in federal court, with GAO and the parties determining at a pre-hearing conference what procedures will be followed, as well as what issues will be considered and which witnesses will testify.", "These factors, as well as the strict time frames for resolving GAO protests, described below, can make GAO a less expensive venue in which to conduct bid protests than the Court of Federal Claims. Protesters in the Court of Federal Claims are, in contrast, generally more likely to be represented by attorneys and have hearings on their protests. Their protests can also take longer to resolve. However, some commentators have wondered whether GAO's comparatively quicker and less formal procedures make GAO more likely than the Court of Federal Claims to issue erroneous decisions.

GAO generally considers untimely protests only when the protester shows good cause for its late filing or when GAO determines that the protest raises \"issues significant to the procurement system.\" However, would-be protesters that miss GAO filing deadlines can sometimes still file bid protests with the Court of Federal Claims, provided they meet the court's timeliness requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Notice to the Agency", "paragraphs": ["Once a protest is filed with GAO, GAO is required by statute to notify the federal agency whose contracting activities are being protested within one working day of receiving the protest.

This is because, under CICA, federal agencies which have been notified of GAO bid protests that were filed within 10 days of contract award (or within 5 days of a debriefing) may not award or authorize performance of the contract until the protest is decided.

However, the 16-day-long government shutdown at the beginning of FY2014 prompted GAO to \"extend the bid protest deadlines one day for each day that GAO was shutdown.\" 280 protests were reportedly affected by this extension. Of these, GAO reports that 241 were resolved within 100 days without any extension, and the remaining 39 were resolved within 100 \"calendar days for the period that the government was funded\" (i.e., 100 days plus the 16-day extension).

If authorization has not been withheld, the agency must \"immediately direct the contractor to cease performance under the contract\" until the protest is resolved.", "These bid-protest stays\u2014commonly known as \"CICA stays\"\u2014are a key aspect of the GAO bid-protest process, which Congress mandated in order to strengthen GAO's protest function. Congress did not provide for similar stays when bid protests are filed with the Court of Federal Claims. Rather, protesters filing suit in the Court of Federal Claims must meet the court's usual requirements for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions in order to affect a delay of the agency's procurement activities similar to that which generally occurs automatically when a GAO protest is filed. This difference between bid protests at GAO and those at the Court of Federal Claims has prompted some commentators to worry that the stays triggered by GAO protests encourage contractors to \"game the system.\" Such commentators worry that contractors knowingly file meritless protests with GAO in order to harass their competitors and delay awards to them, or in the hopes of obtaining short-term contracts from the government during the pendency of the GAO protest. These commentators also worry that the public interest, as embodied in the contract to be awarded or performed, is neglected during the stay.

In determining whether the procurement official's decision had a rational basis, the court considers whether the agency (1) relied on factors Congress did not intend it to consider in making its decision; (2) failed to consider an important aspect of the problem; or (3) offered an explanation for its action contrary to the evidence before it, or so implausible it could not be ascribed to a difference of opinion or the product of agency expertise.", "A Court of Federal Claims protest, even one \"appealing\" a prior GAO decision, does not trigger an automatic stay of the agency's award of the contract or authorization of performance under it. Rather, a bid protester in the Court of Federal Claims must file and prevail upon a motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to effect a delay of the agency's procurement actions similar to that generally occurring automatically when a GAO protest is filed."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
