Efforts are ongoing to restore this environment, which has been damaged by specific events such as the Deepwater Horizon spill and hurricanes as well as by disturbances to wetlands and water quality from human alterations and other impacts. The issue for Congress is the implementation, funding, and performance of congressionally sanctioned restoration efforts for the Gulf Coast.", "Ongoing Efforts to Restore the Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast environment has been degraded over time due to, among other things, altered hydrology, loss of barrier islands and coastal wetland habitat, issues associated with low water quality, and other human impacts and natural processes. Preexisting environmental issues throughout the Gulf Coast have been affected and in some cases exacerbated by natural hazards and manmade catastrophes. Among other events, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused widespread damage to wetland and coastal areas along the Gulf. A number of federal agencies\u2014the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others\u2014are engaged in ongoing efforts to restore areas or aspects of the Gulf Coast environments. Significant state and local efforts to restore the Gulf Coast also have been undertaken, in some cases in consultation with the federal government.

The Deepwater Horizon explosion on April 20, 2010, resulted in an unprecedented discharge of oil in U.S. waters, eventually oiling more than 1,100 miles of U.S. Gulf Coast shoreline. As an identified responsible party, the energy company BP is liable for response (i.e., cleanup) costs, as well as specified economic damages and natural resource damages related to the spill.", "Efforts to mitigate and recover from the Deepwater Horizon spill have initiated several new processes that are expected to supplement ongoing Gulf Coast restoration work. In particular, three major processes are likely to significantly affect restoration work going forward: first, the dissemination of approximately $5.3 billion in Clean Water Act penalties, as required in the RESTORE Act (P.L. 112-141); second, the dissemination of $2.55 billion in criminal penalties from responsible parties by the nonprofit National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), as required under relevant court settlements; and third, the assessment and provision of $8.8 billion in Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA) penalties under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (P.L. 101-380). Initial funding under NFWF and NRDA early restoration efforts was first released in 2013 and 2014, respectively, whereas the Treasury Department and Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council began to release funding for certain planning activities under the RESTORE Act in 2015.", "Issues for Congress. Congressional interest in Gulf Coast restoration may include oversight of previously passed legislation (P.L. 112-141 and P.L. 101-380), including progress to date and any related legislative changes that may be required. Congress also may be interested in the effect of these efforts on ongoing Gulf Coast restoration, coordination between the multiple aforementioned processes, and the effectiveness of these efforts going forward. As a result of differences in the origins and implementation of each effort, Congress has varying degrees of oversight and control over the dissemination of funding to restore the Gulf Coast.

Animal, plant, and microbial populations depend on the Gulf's unique processes to survive. Overall, the Gulf Coast environment includes multiple interconnected ecosystems spanning 600,000 square miles of shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. These ecosystems provide services that encompass aesthetic, economic, and environmental values for their residents. For instance, barrier islands and wetland complexes may provide some coastal storm damage protection benefits for coastal communities. They provide habitat for a number of commercially and recreationally important species of fish, invertebrates, mammals, and birds, including many threatened and endangered species. These ecosystems also filter water, remove and trap contaminants, and store carbon, among other functions.", "The Deepwater Horizon spill is one of several events and ongoing processes that have altered the Gulf Coast ecosystems over time. Prior to the spill, the ecosystems were undergoing large changes due to human development and natural processes. For example, large-scale sediment and habitat loss was occurring, in part, due to altered water flows from the Mississippi River; water pollution was being exacerbated by excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen; and waterways were being altered due to dredging and levee construction; among other things. The spill did not change many of these processes but altered perspectives on how federal and state governments approach restoration. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prespill Federal Restoration Activities in the Gulf", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, several federal agencies were involved in a number of efforts to restore and conserve ecosystems in the Gulf Coast region. These efforts ranged from large-scale restoration initiatives in particular ecosystems to grant programs and projects focusing on distinct restoration issues. For example, the Corps is involved with the state of Louisiana in an initiative that aims to restore wetlands and reduce wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. The program, termed the Louisiana Coastal Area Program, is expected to entail the construction of coastal restoration features that involve habitat restoration and dredging, among other things. The Appendix to this report outlines the major ongoing federal restoration efforts and initiatives in the Gulf. Several interagency forums coordinate federal stewardship efforts and collaborative planning for Gulf Coast projects, some in cooperation with state, nonprofit, and local entities. ", "Over the years, the Gulf Coast region has not been addressed comprehensively as an area for restoration. There has been no overarching restoration initiative addressing the region, possibly because of the size of the region and variability in its ecosystems and governing entities. Further, there has been no central entity or program responsible for planning or implementing restoration activities. Instead, responsibilities have varied by area, timing, and scope, with various combinations of federal, state, local, and nonprofit entities implementing (and in some cases directing) restoration. For instance, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have major ongoing Corps restoration plans focused on specific projects and ecosystems. These are federal/state partnerships and differ in terms of how far projects have progressed. There are no comparable coastal initiatives in Alabama or in the northern part of Florida. In these areas, states, along with other entities, have initiated restoration efforts. Further complicating a comprehensive effort to restore the region is the complexity of ecological issues in the region and their connection to ecosystems outside of the region. For example, excess nutrients that cause hypoxia in the Gulf Coast area are attributed in part to agricultural runoff in the northern reaches of the Mississippi River. Addressing restoration in the Gulf Coast cuts across regions and ecosystems, as well as departmental and agency jurisdictions within the federal government. ", "Efforts at unifying federal agency actions and developing a process for restoring the Gulf Coast region were initiated by the Obama Administration and predated the Deepwater Horizon spill. The Obama Administration created a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Working Group, which was tasked with developing a strategy for restoring the Gulf Coast region. The strategy is termed the Roadmap for Restoring Ecosystem Resiliency and Sustainability in the Louisiana and Mississippi Coasts. The intent of the roadmap was to guide near-term restoration actions to be undertaken by agencies within the working group, and facilitate the coordination of federal restoration and protection activities. However, the Deepwater Horizon spill and resulting damages and financial compensation from litigation altered the federal government's approach to restoration and coordination. Some of the new processes that have developed as a result of the oil spill are discussed below. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Environmental Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig on April 20, 2010, which took place 41 miles southeast of the Louisiana coast, resulted in an estimated 171 million gallons (4.1 million barrels) of oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico over 84 days. An additional 35 million gallons of oil escaped the well, but did not enter the Gulf environment, because BP recovered this oil directly from the wellhead. At the time these calculations were made (July 14, 2010), approximately 50% of the oil had evaporated, dissolved, or been effectively removed from the Gulf environment through human activities. However, a substantial portion\u2014over 100 million gallons\u2014remained, in some form, in the Gulf of Mexico. The fate of the remaining oil in the Gulf is uncertain and might never be determined conclusively. Multiple challenges hinder determination of the fate of the oil, and as time progresses, determining the fate of the oil and related environmental impacts will likely become more difficult. Some study results indicate that microbial organisms (bacteria) consumed and broke down a considerable amount of the oil in the water column. ", "The effects from the oil spill were spread throughout the Gulf Coast ecosystem. In the immediate aftermath of the spill, more than 88,522 square miles of coast were closed and almost 1,100 miles of shoreline and related habitat were damaged due to oiling. A map of some of the documented oiling impacts in the immediate area of the oil spill is shown below in Figure 1 .", "Several scientists have noted that the long-term effects of the spill are likely to persist into the future. One of the earliest reports on the oil spill, carried out by a presidential task force under the direction of former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, divided the effects of the oil spill into four categories:", "1. Water Column Effects: Due to the location and scale of the oil spill, the spill is expected to have impacts on the food chain in coastal areas. 2. Fisheries Effects: The oil spill led to the temporary closure of approximately 36% of federal Gulf waters, as well as in-state waters, to fishing. Although these waters have subsequently been reopened, studies on fisheries impacts are ongoing, and impacts from oil on fish eggs and larvae may be better understood over time. 3. Effects on Other Species: Animals face both short-term and long-term impacts from the oil spill, including impacts on food availability, growth, reproduction, behavior, and disease. 4. Habitat Effects: Beaches, wetlands, and other Gulf Coats habitats were exposed to oil, which could potentially exacerbate erosion issues in the region and kill plants and animals.", "Specific long-term effects on the ecosystem are still being studied. Documented effects have been reported by scientists for various aspects of the ecosystem. For example, scientists provided estimates on the effect of the oil plume on deep sea sediment habitat and species around the well head. They reported that the most severe reduction of biodiversity in this habitat extended 3 km around the wellhead, and that moderate impacts were observed up to 17 km southwest and 8.5 km northeast of the wellhead. Further, scientists estimated that recovery rates for this habitat could be in terms of decades or longer. The effects on the seafood industry are also being calculated economically and environmentally for the long term.

Although the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) liability provisions are meant to address natural resource damages related to the oil spill, many policymakers and stakeholders expressed an interest in also addressing prespill natural resource issues in the Gulf. Thus, to some degree, Gulf restoration activities may be divided into short-term efforts that address natural resource impacts related to the 2010 oil spill and long-term recovery efforts that address restoration issues in place well before the 2010 spill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mabus Report and Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force", "paragraphs": ["The impetus for long-term environmental restoration and recovery efforts related to the oil spill can be traced, in part, to a September 2010 report commissioned by the Obama Administration and under the direction of former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (also known as the \"Mabus Report\").

The final report noted the multiple challenges facing the Gulf Coast and suggested incorporating them into the response to the oil spill:", "This is a region that was already struggling with urgent environmental challenges.... [I]t only makes sense to look at the broader challenges facing the system and to leverage ongoing efforts to find solutions to some of the complex problems that face the Gulf. Sustained activities that restore the critical ecosystem functions of the Gulf will be needed to support and sustain the region's economic revitalization.", "The report made a number of recommendations for future restoration actions to address this challenge. Most importantly, the Mabus Report recommended the dedication of civil penalties under the Clean Water Act toward Gulf restoration to address recovery needs that may fall outside the scope of natural resource damages under the OPA. It further recommended that \"Congress establish a Gulf Coast Recovery Council that should focus on improving the economy and public health of the Gulf Coast, and on ecosystem restoration not dealt with under [OPA's Natural Resource Damage Assessment program]. These three areas are inextricably linked to the successful recovery of the region.\"", "To further the long-term restoration objectives outlined in the Mabus Report, President Obama established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in October 2010. The task force held meetings, met with public officials, and produced a restoration strategy in December 2011, which was expected to guide future restoration efforts in the region. The task force strategy defined ecosystem restoration goals and described milestones toward reaching those goals; considered existing research and ecosystem restoration planning efforts; identified major policy areas where coordinated actions between government agencies were needed; and evaluated existing research and monitoring programs and gaps in data collection.

As discussed above, several disparate streams of funding and resources are going toward new and existing restoration activities in the Gulf. These restoration activities are to be planned and implemented according to multiple planning documents and processes. For example, efforts conducted by NFWF will be done under its planning process after consultation with state and federal entities, while the council will be conducting its own coordination with state and federal agencies and governments for disbursing funds from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund pursuant to the RESTORE Act. Although the primary entities have highlighted coordination of their efforts, there is no formal entity that oversees all ongoing restoration in the Gulf nor is there a formal coordination process required among the implementing entities. This lack of formal requirements may cause concerns among some related to the potential duplication of projects, implementation of restoration projects that address the same issue yet promote different solutions, or projects with conflicting goals at local and regional levels. However, others may argue that formal coordination has not been necessary, as the informal coordination among the multiple restoration entities has thus far been effective.", "The 2016 Comprehensive Plan Update under the RESTORE Act acknowledges some of these potential shortfalls and discusses the council's intention to coordinate among implementing entities. For example, the Comprehensive Plan states that the council will strive to coordinate with other partners involved in restoration activities to \"maximize ecological and socio-economic benefits and avoid duplication.\" The RESTORE Act itself also includes some requirements related to coordination, although it does not provide for a congressionally authorized coordinating entity with authority over all relevant processes going forward. The act authorizes memoranda of understanding between the council and federal agencies to establish integrated funding and implementation plans, which could reduce project duplication and promote an integrated restoration effort among federal entities. It also addresses duplication of efforts in relation to monitoring the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The RESTORE Act requires the Gulf Coast Science Program to avoid duplication of other research and monitoring activities and requires the NOAA administrator to develop a plan for the coordination of projects and activities between the program and other similar state and federal programs and centers of excellence. ", "Broader questions of coordination among restoration activities go beyond the RESTORE Act and may include, in addition to NRDA and NFWF activities, existing federal and state projects and activities, as well as activities conducted in other states that might have an effect in the Gulf Coast region. Some potential questions addressing coordination include the following:", "How are restoration plans and projects coordinated among implementing entities? Is there a need for a congressionally authorized mechanism for coordination? How are new restoration activities authorized under the RESTORE Act integrated with existing restoration programs and efforts, without causing overlap? Will there be assurances that project monitoring and oversight are measured with similar metrics? Will data and results from restoration activities be comparable to similar activities implemented by another entity? Will baseline ecosystem restoration activities continue under their authorities and funding or will they be integrated into efforts authorized under the RESTORE Act and other Deepwater Horizon -related restoration activities?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning", "paragraphs": ["Another potential issue for Congress is the status and content of multiple planning processes related to Gulf restoration. Although the planning process and implementation progress under the RESTORE Act may receive significant attention from Congress, planning under the NFWF and NRDA processes may be of interest to some in Congress, as well.", "As discussed previously, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council published a Comprehensive Plan Update in December 2016. The stated intent of the plan is to provide a framework to implement restoration activities in the Gulf Coast region. When it was published, the council noted that the updated plan was intended to \"provide strategic guidance that will help the Council more effectively address these complex and critical challenges and supersedes the Initial Plan approved by the Council in August 2013.\" ", "The Comprehensive Plan Update published by the council included some of the elements required by Congress that were not in the Initial Plan. Among these, it included a description of the process underpinning project selection and state expenditure plans, as well as congressionally required elements, such as the 10-Year Funding Strategy and the 3-year FPL. Additionally, other elements that are related to Gulf Coast restoration were not required by Congress to be included in the report. For instance, Congress did not require that the report cover the Direct Component under the RESTORE Act (i.e., funding which goes directly to states). Similarly, activities under the Gulf Coast Science Program and centers of excellence were not included in this plan. ", "The two other Gulf Coast restoration planning processes discussed herein are those coordinated by NFWF and NRDA trustees, respectively. Notably, neither is governed by RESTORE Act planning processes. NFWF restoration actions are governed first by the criminal settlements between DOJ and BP and DOJ and Transocean (and subsequent guidance from NFWF), whereas the NRDA planning process is governed by NOAA regulations, pursuant to the OPA. These planning processes may be more targeted than those under the RESTORE Act and are expected to proceed independently. ", "Another issue for Congress is whether the current approach to ecosystem restoration in the Gulf is effective and whether or not it would be better implemented under alternative organizational structures. For instance, in the Everglades, restoration is federally led and ostensibly guided by a centralized, \"comprehensive\" plan, known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). Authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-541 ), CERP outlined 68 distinct projects that are intended to comprise a large amount of the restoration effort. Generally speaking, CERP is more centralized and detailed than the comprehensive planning process that has been carried out for the Gulf under the RESTORE Act to date. However, it is similar to the current planning process in the Gulf in that it is dependent on other restoration efforts that are not formally covered by CERP or led by the federal government. In the case of the Everglades, planning for these activities is coordinated by a separate congressionally authorized body, the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. A complete comparison and assessment of the disparate planning processes in the Gulf is made difficult by the absence of some information from the processes. For instance, to date no plans have provided an estimated time frame for completing restoration, nor have the plans addressed the maintenance of restoration activities when funding has been exhausted and governance structures have been dissolved. The Comprehensive Plan Update discusses consideration of regional planning frameworks, with collaboration meetings and workshops to begin in 2017, but as of July 2017 no such documentation is available. Potential questions Congress may have related to planning for restoration may include the following:", "How is the planning process under the RESTORE Act incorporating other processes, such as those related to prespill restoration activities or restoration activities conducted by states and other entities such as NFWF or under NRDA? What is the anticipated time line for the implementation of the individual elements of the RESTORE Act? Will a vision or set of criteria for defining what a restored ecosystem will look like be created or required under RESTORE Act and other planning processes in the Gulf? Will it include an estimate of how long restoration will take or how much it will cost? Who will be responsible for providing future funding to continue restoration activities in the Gulf after activities funded under the Deepwater Horizon settlements are complete?

The RESTORE Act does not specify an overarching entity that would monitor and report on the implementation of all aspects of restoration. The council's responsibility appears to be focused on the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan and state plans pursuant to the Spill Impact Component, while NRDA and NFWF plans will focus on those elements separately.
