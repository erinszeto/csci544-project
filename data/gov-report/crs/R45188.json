The director must first consult with the Attorney General, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Homeland Security, heads of the relevant National Drug Control Program Agencies, and the governor of the applicable state. Four main criteria are considered when designating an area as a HIDTA: ", "the extent to which [1] the area is a significant center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution; [2] State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem; [3] drug-related activities in the area are having a significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of the country; and [4] a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug related activities in the area.", "The HIDTA program is designed with the county as its geographic unit of inclusion. As such, if an entire state were to be included in a HIDTA, this would be because each county within the state had been separately designated as a critical drug trafficking area.

Multiagency (federal plus state/local/tribal law enforcement) task force activities focused on investigation, interdiction, fugitive apprehension, and prosecution of serious drug-related crimes and criminals/criminal networks. Intelligence and Information Sharing. Activities including intelligence analysis, deconfliction services, and information gathering and distribution. Support. Activities peripheral to core enforcement and intelligence and information sharing activities, including training, crime and forensic labs, shared resource expenses, and information technology needs. Prevention. Coordination and collaboration between law enforcement and the community to reduce drug use and its consequences and prevent drug related crime. Treatment. Since 2006, there has been a prohibition on the use of HIDTA funds to establish or expand drug treatment programs. However, the Washington/Baltimore HIDTA has continued its prior funding support to drug courts in its region. Management and Coordination. Coordination and integration of HIDTA initiatives and program overhead (e.g., HIDTA leadership and administrative staff salaries, rent).", "Notably, within the program's history, support for drug prevention initiatives has been more of a recent focus. Now, all HIDTAs support prevention initiatives. ", "Several initiatives are perennial and not exclusive to one particular HIDTA region. For instance, the Domestic Highway Enforcement strategy supports multijurisdictional law enforcement efforts to counter drug trafficking and money laundering activities that are facilitated by the U.S. highways. The directors of nine HIDTA regions are currently coordinating this strategy. In addition, the National Emerging Threats Initiative identifies \"emerging drug threats and their patterns [and addresses] each threat through the use of best practices, promoting cooperation among public safety, public health, regulators, treatment, and prevention entities\" and provides solutions to the threats.

There is currently no mechanism to enroll a specific city or an entire state unless it is done on a county-by-county basis. In the realm of drug threats that the HIDTAs are actively combating, however, traffickers and other criminals have little regard for these jurisdictional borders that define the operations of U.S. law enforcement. As such, criminal activity may shift along with supply, demand, and law enforcement pressures. The HIDTA program currently responds to these changes by adding and removing counties from HIDTAs.", "The current method of county-by-county inclusion has thus far encompassed counties in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some policymakers may question whether the county is the most suitable unit of inclusion in the HIDTA program and whether the county, as the unit of inclusion, allows for the most appropriate multilateral law enforcement initiatives to receive HIDTA support. One option may be to consider what would happen if the unit of inclusion were changed to a different jurisdictional level, such as the state or city. For instance, changing the unit of inclusion to the state level rather than the county level would, as it stands, include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories. Because the HIDTA program aims to channel resources to areas that may benefit most from additional law enforcement resources in countering drug trafficking and related threats, some may question whether including 100% of the states in HIDTAs would really accomplish the goal of assisting the most critical areas of the country. For some of these states, the total area of the state could reflect the most critical area. For others, it may be that only a portion of the state is impacted by significant drug trafficking activity. And, if the entire states were included in HIDTAs, some may question whether there should also be mechanisms in place to ensure that sufficient resources provided through the HIDTA program would reach the most critical regions.", "Some may also question whether the processes for adding and removing counties from HIDTAs are sufficient as critical drug trafficking areas shift. Are the policies adequately nimble to allow for timely shifting of HIDTA designations and resources? "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "County-Level Drug Trafficking Data", "paragraphs": ["Given that the HIDTA program adds and removes counties based on the existing drug trafficking threat in the county, policymakers may be interested in understanding changes in drug trafficking activity in counties before, during, and after they are designated as HIDTA counties. However, the existing landscape of national data on drug trafficking activity is not necessarily captured and aggregated by county. For instance, some databases might capture drug trafficking broken down by region of the United States (e.g., U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizure data in each of the Border Patrol sectors). Other databases may reflect drug trafficking investigations or prosecutions broken down by state or field office (e.g., certain data tracked by federal law enforcement entities such as the Drug Enforcement Administration or Federal Bureau of Investigation). However, national data on drug trafficking aggregated at the county level are scarce; rather, some data may be available from the various state and local law enforcement entities operating in a given county. Notably, there are likely differences in what may be captured in these local-level data. Nonetheless, in conducting oversight of the HIDTA program, policymakers may explore changes in drug trafficking at the county level before the county's inclusion in the program as well as after it becomes eligible for HIDTA support for law enforcement initiatives in its area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Inclusion", "paragraphs": ["As outlined, there are four principal criteria against which counties are evaluated when they are considered for HIDTA inclusion. In conducting oversight, policymakers may reevaluate these criteria to ensure that the counties most at-risk for drug trafficking activities are included in a HIDTA. To evaluate whether these criteria are reliably identifying at-risk counties, policymakers may question how each criterion is measured. Ensuring that the evaluation standards are used consistently for each county will help ensure that the most critical areas are designated in an impartial manner. For example, the first criterion against which counties are evaluated is \"the extent to which the area is a significant center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution.\" One question that may arise when evaluating this criterion is what constitutes a \"\u201bsignificant' center\" of illegal drug activity. Petitions to designate a county as part of a HIDTA are evaluated independently, not in relation to other petitions or to the conditions in counties already designated HIDTA counties. Further, there do not appear to be standardized numerical metrics (for levels of drug production or quantities of drugs distributed, for instance) against which counties are evaluated in determining whether they should be included in a HIDTA. As such, what might be considered a significant drug threat in one county might not be considered a significant threat in another county. Policymakers may examine what metrics ONDCP uses to determine when the level of drug trafficking in an area reaches a level of significance. A related question policymakers may ask is whether ONDCP has altered or needs to alter the metrics or criteria for evaluating whether a county should be designated as part of a HIDTA as trends in drug production, manufacturing, importation, and distribution change.", "Annually, the HIDTA Executive Boards examine\u2014against the four criteria for HIDTA designation\u2014the counties included in their regions. If a board determines that a county \"no longer meets the statutory requirements for HIDTA designation,\" it petitions ONDCP to remove the county's HIDTA designation. For example, if a board deems that a county within its HIDTA region is no longer a significant center of drug trafficking, it can petition for the county's removal from the HIDTA. Just as policymakers may question whether there are specific metrics that determine whether a county is a significant center of drug trafficking for the purpose of HIDTA designation, they may also question whether any specific metrics are also used in determining whether the designation should be removed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Policymakers have long expressed interest in ensuring that funding is provided to programs with demonstrated effectiveness. ONDCP has established measures to evaluate whether each HIDTA is (1) reducing drug availability by helping participating law enforcement agencies disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations and (2) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of HIDTA initiatives. Specifically, ONDCP has established a Performance Management Process (PMP) to help evaluate the success of individual HIDTAs as well as the program as a whole in achieving these two goals. The PMP does not allow for comparisons between each HIDTA's performance. ", "In order to evaluate these two goals, ONDCP requires each HIDTA to provide four items annually: (1) a threat assessment of the drug trafficking and related activities in its area, (2) a strategy for how the HIDTA addresses the threats identified in the threat assessment, (3) a budget proposal including funding needs for initiatives in the area and performance goals for the initiatives, and (4) a report describing activities and progress in executing the HIDTA's strategy.", "In conducting oversight regarding ONDCP and the HIDTA program, policymakers may question whether ONDCP is reliably and validly measuring the results and effectiveness of each individual HIDTA as well as the HIDTA program overall; in other words, they may examine the reliability and validity of the PMP.

As the program is tailored, it aims to counter specific threats, namely drug production and trafficking, in those areas where these threats are most prevalent. All task force investigations that are supported with HIDTA grant funding are to have a direct nexus to drug trafficking. However, many criminal networks, such as Mexican drug trafficking organizations, may be involved in a range of illicit activity. As such, while the HIDTA program only directly supports law enforcement initiatives that target the drug trafficking activities of these criminal organizations, the program may indirectly support efforts to combat other crimes committed by drug traffickers.

However, up to 5% of HIDTA funds may be used to establish drug prevention programs.

As one of the law enforcement agencies of DOJ, the DEA does not currently administer grant programs. Policymakers may debate a number of issues when considering the Administration's proposal to move the administration of the HIDTA program from ONDCP to the DEA. One is whether there may be sufficient resources (funding, manpower, and expertise) within the DEA for it to undertake a new role of grants administration. Another is whether the HIDTA program, if administered by the DEA, would continue to be seen as a collaborative law enforcement program, not under the direction of any one federal law enforcement agency, supporting law enforcement agencies across the country at multiple levels of government in their efforts to combat drug trafficking and related threats."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
