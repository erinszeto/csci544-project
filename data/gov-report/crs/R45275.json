The 115th Congress has the opportunity to establish the future direction of farm and food policy, because many of the provisions in the current farm bill (the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79) expire in 2018.", "On June 21, 2018, the House voted 213-211 to approve H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, an omnibus farm bill that would authorize farm and food policy for FY2019-FY2023. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also a five-year bill, on June 28, 2018, on a vote of 86-11.", "In terms of cost, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score of July 24, 2018, of the programs in both bills with mandatory spending\u2014such as nutrition programs, commodity support programs, major conservation programs, and crop insurance\u2014over a 10-year budget window (FY2019-FY2028) amounts to $867 billion in the Senate-passed bill and $865 billion in the House-passed bill. These cost projections compare with CBO's baseline scenario of an extension of existing 2014 farm bill programs with no changes of $867 billion. In both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2, most existing programs would be extended through FY2023. Overall, the bills provide a relatively large measure of continuity with the existing framework of farm and food programs even as they would modify numerous programs, alter the amount and type of program funding that certain programs receive, and exercise discretion not to reauthorize some others.", "Both bills would extend commodity support programs largely along existing lines while modifying them in different ways. For instance, the House bill could raise the effective reference price for crops enrolled in the Price Loss Coverage program (PLC) under certain market conditions. It would also amend payment limits and the adjusted gross income (AGI) limit for eligibility for farm program payments and increase the number of producer exemptions from payment and income limits. In contrast, the Senate bill would leave payment limits unchanged while lowering the AGI limit for payment eligibility. The Senate would also leave PLC unchanged while adopting changes to the Agricultural Risk Coverage program (ARC) that could enhance its appeal as a program option. Both bills would amend disaster assistance programs but under different approaches. Both bills would also rename the dairy program and expand coverage choices for milk producers, and both bills extend the sugar program with no changes.", "The House and Senate bills would reauthorize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for five years, and both bills include polices intended to improve error and fraud detection. Among their differences, the House bill includes multiple changes to who is eligible for SNAP and the calculation of benefits, which are not included in the Senate bill. The House bill includes major changes to work requirements, while the Senate bill would make changes that are minor by comparison.", "Within the conservation title, the two bills would raise the acreage limit on enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), with the House bill setting a higher limit than the Senate does. Among other differences, the House bill would repeal the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), whereas the Senate bill would extend CSP but lower the limit on acreage enrollment. The House bill also increases funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), while the Senate bill reduces funding for EQIP. Within the credit title, both bills increase the maximum loan amounts for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's guaranteed farm ownership loans and guaranteed farm operating loans. The Senate bill would also raise the limits for direct farm ownership loans and direct farm operating loans, whereas the House bill would not. The miscellaneous title of both bills establishes an animal disease preparedness program and a vaccine bank, although they diverge over funding.", "The Senate bill includes a number of provisions that are intended to facilitate the possible commercial cultivation of industrial hemp, while the House bill would amend certain regulatory requirements that apply to industrial hemp. For rural communities, the House bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to reprioritize certain loan and grant programs and take other actions to respond to specific health emergencies, and it would require the Secretary to promulgate minimum acceptable standards for broadband service. The Senate bill would establish priorities for awarding loans and grains for rural broadband projects and add a new program on substance abuse education and prevention. Both bills extend most bioenergy programs, but the House bill places them within the title on rural development and infrastructure, while the Senate bill maintains a separate energy title.

Over the year s, as economic conditions and technology have evolved, Congress has regularly revisited agricultural policy through periodic farm legislation. Across these decades, the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a broad spectrum of related areas, such as agricultural conservation, credit, rural development, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and international food aid, organic agriculture, forestry, and support for beginning and veteran farmers and ranchers, among others. ", "On June 21, 2018, the House voted 213-211 to approve H.R. 2 , the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, an omnibus farm bill that would establish farm and food policy for the next five years, covering FY2019-FY2023. The vote to approve H.R. 2 followed a failed vote of 198-213 on the same bill on May 18, 2018. The final passage vote on June 21 followed a vote of 233-191 approving a motion to reconsider, which was made after the unsuccessful vote on final passage of May 18. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, on June 28, 2018, on a vote of 86-11.", "Both the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2 continue the tradition of multi-year farm bills that would establish policy for farm programs and nutrition assistance. To this end, H.R. 2 addresses agriculture and food policy across 11 titles in the House bill and 12 titles in the Senate bill. These titles cover commodity support programs, agricultural conservation, trade and international food aid, domestic nutrition assistance, credit, rural infrastructure and economic development, research and extension, forestry, horticulture, and a variety of other policies and initiatives. The disparity in the number of titles between the two bills reflects the provision of a separate title for energy programs in the Senate bill, whereas the House bill would eliminate what had been a separate energy title in the 2014 farm bill and place these agricultural energy programs within the title on rural infrastructure and economic development. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued its scores of H.R. 2 as passed by the House and the Senate on July 24, 2018. CBO projected that spending on mandatory programs in the Senate bill would total $867 billion over the 10-year period FY2019-FY2028 and $865 billion in the House bill. These totals compare with CBO's estimate of the cost of extending the current 2014 farm bill for 10 years of $867 billion. According to CBO, the estimated costs across titles and individual programs frequently differ between the House-passed bill and the Senate-passed bill as well, reflecting the program priorities and policy preferences of each chamber. The Budget Impact section of this report includes a breakdown of these differences in the two bills.", "Both versions of H.R. 2 would supersede the current slate of farm programs and policies authorized by the 2014 farm bill, P.L. 113-79 , many of which are to expire in 2018 unless Congress acts to reauthorize or extend them. Certain programs, such as crop insurance, are permanently authorized and would continue to operate in the absence of new farm legislation or an extension of the current farm bill. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could continue to operate as long as funding is appropriated. But if the current farm law were to expire, many other programs\u2014such as revenue support programs for producers of major agricultural commodities\u2014including corn, wheat, milk, sugar, and others\u2014would be governed by so-called permanent laws, which date from the late 1930s and 1940s and do not expire. ", "These permanent laws, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-430) and Agricultural Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-439), rely on supply controls to buttress price support regimes that would raise market prices of these basic farm commodities above existing levels. A change in farm policy along these lines could restrict production and prove to be broadly disruptive for farmers, farm input suppliers, agricultural exporters, food manufacturers, and consumers. Many other programs, such as conservation programs and rural development programs, would cease to function. In the past, when Congress has faced the prospect of expiring farm legislation without enacting successor legislation, it has acted to extend the existing policies, as it did when the 2002 and 2008 acts expired. ", "A change in the current policy environment from the situation that prevailed when the 2014 farm bill was being debated and enacted is the reduced profitability of the U.S. farm economy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts that for 2017 and 2018, net cash farm income\u2014a measure of the profitability of farming\u2014will be about one-third below the high levels reached in 2012 and 2013, when Congress was considering the 2014 farm bill. The decline in net cash farm income over this period reflects declining prices for many commodities. More recently, trade disputes involving major U.S. agricultural export markets\u2014including China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU\u2014has led to imposition of tariffs by these trading partners on a range of U.S. farm product exports. Agricultural exports provide critical support to U.S. commodity prices and farm profitability. The tariffs have coincided with a further decline in prices for some U.S. agricultural products while fostering uncertainty about the near-term prospects for U.S. agricultural exports and, by extension, farm income. ", "This report provides a title-by-title summary of the policies and provisions in the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2 and compares them with current law. Following an analysis of the budgetary implications of both bills, summaries of some of the changes that the House and Senate bills would make in each of their 11 and 12 titles, respectively, are provided.

It projects that, if current law were extended, farm bill programs would cost $867 billion over the next 10 years, FY2019-2028, 77% of which is in the nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining $203 billion baseline is for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation.

This is the result of a decrease in projected outlays of $1.3 billion and $0.5 billion of new revenue from fees that would be paid by contractors in the SNAP program. On a shorter-time-period basis, the five-year score shows a net increase of $2.2 billion over the $426 billion baseline that is more than offset by net reductions in the second five years of the budget window. The 10-year score of the Senate-passed amendment to H.R. 2 is budget neutral ($0, +0%), with an overall increase in outlays of $68 million (+0.01%) that is offset by a $68 million increase in revenue from fees for an oilheat program. As in the House bill, the five-year score shows a net increase ($1.6 billion) that is offset by net reductions in the second five years of the budget window.", "The overall relatively small scores (measured in percentage changes) of the bills are the net result of sometimes relatively larger increases and reductions across individual titles ( Table 2 , Figure 2 ). ", "In the House bill, the 10-year score of outlays shows increases for the commodities, trade, research, and miscellaneous titles. These increases are more than offset by net reductions in the nutrition, conservation, energy (rural infrastructure), and crop insurance titles, as well as a revenue provision in the nutrition title. In the Senate bill, the 10-year score shows increases for the trade, energy, horticulture, research, and miscellaneous titles. These increases are offset by net reductions in the rural development and commodities titles, along with a revenue provision in the miscellaneous title.", "Some of the overall scores within an individual title are the net result of increases in individual provisions, which are offset by reductions in other provisions within a title.", "In the House bill, the nutrition and conservation titles have numerous provisions with relatively large cumulative increases that are offset by provisions with relatively large decreases in their scores ( Table 3 , Figure 3 ). In the Senate bill, while none of the titles' cumulative increases and decreases are as large in magnitude as the changes to nutrition and conservation programs in the House bill, the section-by-section scores of the Senate bill nonetheless show both increases and decreases from the baseline.

Major field-crop programs include the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) programs and the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program (see Table 5 ). The dairy program involves protecting a portion of the margin between milk and feed prices. The sugar program provides a combination of price support, border protection, and producer production allotments. Four disaster assistance programs that focus primarily on livestock and tree crops were permanently authorized in the 2014 farm bill. These disaster assistance programs provide federal assistance to help farmers recover financially from natural disasters, including drought and floods. Title I also includes several administrative provisions that suspend permanent farm law from 1938 and 1949; assign payment limits for individuals, joint ventures or partnerships, and corporations; specify the adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold for program payment eligibility; and identify other details regarding payment attribution and eligibility.", "Both bills extend authority for most current commodity programs but with some modifications to programs for covered commodities and dairy as well as agricultural disaster assistance. The Senate bill eliminates the transition assistance for producers of upland cotton. Under both bills, the sugar program is extended but is otherwise unchanged.", "In general, program changes affecting covered commodities under the House farm bill make PLC a more attractive option for producers than ARC. In particular, the House farm bill includes an escalator provision that would raise a covered commodity's effective reference price (used in the PLC payment formula) by as much as 115% of the statutory PLC reference price based on 85% of the five-year Olympic average of farm prices. In addition, producers participating in PLC that experienced at least 20 consecutive weeks of severe drought during 2008-2012 would be allowed to update their program yields (used in the PLC payment formula). Producers enrolled in the county-level ARC program (or the stacked income protection plan for cotton) would be ineligible for crop insurance coverage under an area yield and loss basis or the supplemental coverage option. Furthermore, the individual, farm-level ARC program is eliminated. ", "In contrast, the Senate farm bill leaves the PLC program unchanged but proposes changes to ARC that make it a more attractive option: ARC would use a trend-adjusted yield and would increase the yield floor (available to producers under certain conditions) to 75% of the transitional county yield (up from 70%) when calculating the benchmark county revenue guarantee. In addition, ARC would become the default option when a producer fails to choose between ARC and PLC at signup. The Senate farm bill also specifies that the county in which a farm is located be used for the benchmark and actual ARC revenue calculations, and it instructs USDA to use a single data source for county yield estimates to avoid the disparity in ARC payments that some neighboring counties experienced in recent years. The Senate farm bill would also require USDA to publish ARC and PLC payment rates within 30 days after the end of the crop marketing year and would obligate USDA to review and report on the establishment, calculation, reallocation, adjustment, and reduction of base acres.", "With respect to payment limits and the AGI limit, the Senate farm bill would leave payment limits unchanged but tighten the AGI limit to $700,000 (down from $900,000 under current law). In contrast, the House farm bill proposes to expand the list of producer exemptions from payment and income limits under certain conditions. First, MAL program benefits would be exempted from inclusion under both payment limits and the AGI limit. Second, payment limits would be affected by the House farm bill's treatment of eligible payment entities. Under current law, partnerships and joint ventures are treated as collections of individuals, each with their own payment limits, whereas a corporation is treated as a single individual subject to a single payment limit. The House bill would alter the treatment of certain corporations by defining qualified pass - through entity (QTPE) as including partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability corporations, and S corporations. This would allow each separate owner of a QTPE (meeting all program eligibility criteria) to have an individual payment limit. Also, the House bill would redefine family farm to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews, thus increasing the potential pool of individuals eligible for individual payment limits on family farming operations. ", "Both the House and the Senate bills amend the permanent agricultural disaster assistance programs, but there is no overlap between the amendments. The House bill amends the limits on payments received under select disaster assistance programs and waives the AGI requirement if more than 75% of the producer's income comes from farming, ranching, or silviculture. The House bill also expands payments for livestock losses caused by disease, whereas the Senate bill expands payments for losses of unweaned livestock that occur before vaccination. The Senate bill also expands the definition of an eligible producer to include Indian tribes or tribal organizations and increases replanting and rehabilitation payment rates for beginning and veteran orchardists.", "Both the House and the Senate bills would rename the current dairy Margin Protection Program (MPP)\u2014Dairy Risk Management Program (DRMP) under the House bill and Dairy Risk Coverage (DRC) by the Senate. Like MPP, both the DRMP and DRC would pay participating dairy producers the difference (when positive) between a producer-selected margin and the national milk margin (calculated as the all-milk price minus an average feed cost ration). Both bills would lower the catastrophic margin protection level. Under current law, for a $100 administrative fee, participating dairy producers automatically receive payments on 90% of their first 5 million pounds or less of milk production when the milk margin falls below $5.00 per hundredweight (cwt.). Under both DRMP and DRC, the catastrophic margin is lowered to $4.00/cwt. ", "Both bills would also expand coverage choices for milk producers. Under current law, premiums paid by producers vary with coverage levels selected across two production tiers: Tier I is the first 5 million pounds of milk production; Tier II is milk production above 5 million pounds. Currently, dairy producers select a percent coverage ranging from 25% to 90% of the farm's historical milk production. Both DRMP and DRC propose extending the percent coverage range to 5% to 90% of a farm's milk production history.", "Both DRMP and DRC would reinstate premiums for the $4.50/cwt. and $5.00/cwt. margins and add margin levels of $8.50/cwt. and $9.00/cwt. under Tier I. DRMP would substantially reduce premiums for the other Tier I margins ranging from $5.50/cwt. to $8.00/cwt., while premiums for Tier II would be left unchanged. In contrast, DRC would slightly raise premiums for the other Tier I margins ranging from $5.50/cwt. to $7.50/cwt., while the $8.00/cwt. margin would be lowered slightly. DRC would raise the premiums for all Tier II margins. DRC would partially offset higher premiums by providing premium discounts for small- and medium-sized participating dairy operations: Discounts of 50% are available on Tier I and Tier II premiums for milk production history of 2 million pounds or less, and premium discounts of 25% are available on milk production history over 2 million pounds but not greater than 10 million pounds. Finally, DRC requires USDA to repay any calendar-year positive net premiums (i.e., premiums paid minus both margin-payments received and MPP program costs) to dairy operations that participated in MPP during 2015-2017. ", "Under DRC, as under current law, dairy producers would make annual elections of a margin coverage level and a percentage of milk production to cover. Under DRMP, dairy producers would make a single one-time election, which would last the duration of the farm bill.", "Both the House and the Senate bills would extend through FY2023 the Dairy Forward Pricing Program, the Dairy Indemnity Program, and the Dairy Promotion and Research Program. The House bill would eliminate the provision prohibiting dairy producers from participating in both the DRMP and the Livestock Gross Margin-Dairy insurance program, although dual coverage cannot be on the same milk production. The Senate bill would retain the current law prohibition on joint participation in both margin programs. Both bills would amend the formula for the Class I skim milk price used for calculating the Class I price under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. ", "Finally, the House bill, but not the Senate bill, would require USDA to conduct studies on whether the feed cost ration is representative of actual feed costs used in the margin calculation and on the cost of corn silage versus the feed cost of corn.

The proposal would increase asset limits and change how vehicles and savings accounts are counted. It also amends the way certain income is counted or excluded and requires households' cooperation with child support enforcement. On the other hand, the Senate-passed bill would largely maintain current law in these areas, though it would increase certification periods for certain households and make some changes to existing work-related rules, including additional employment and training pilot programs.

The House bill alone would make multivitamins and dietary supplements eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits.", "Other SNAP-Related Grants. In addition to making changes to SNAP Employment and Training, both bills make changes to, and in some cases increase, existing grant programs' funding, with the House bill providing greater increases. Both bills would expand SNAP bonus incentives for fruit and vegetable purchases and authorize the addition of milk for certain incentive pilot programs (one with mandatory funding in the House bill, one with discretionary funding in the Senate bill). Both bills reauthorize the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program, renaming it Gus Schumacher FINI and providing for evaluation, training, and technical assistance. The House bill increases FINI funding by $472 million over 10 years; the Senate bill increases funding by $401 million over two years. On nutrition education, the House bill moves SNAP's nutrition education component from SNAP state agencies to land-grant universities and increases program funding.

The bill proposes to place additional limits on households that are eligible for SNAP based on their receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits. CBO estimates that the House-passed changes would reduce SNAP spending by approximately $4 billion over the 10-year window. Regarding participation, CBO estimated, for the House-reported bill, that in an average year, about 400,000 households would lose SNAP eligibility. As SNAP recipients are also eligible for free school meals, CBO estimated that in an average year, 265,000 children would lose access to free meals, though many would still be eligible for reduced-price meals. 2. Work-related requirements. The bill proposes to replace SNAP's general work requirements and time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents with a work requirement for all states. Beginning in FY2021, the proposal would require a minimum of 20 hours of work per week for nonexempt able-bodied adults. Unlike the current law time limit, which applies to 18- to 49-year-olds who do not have children, the proposed requirement would apply to 18- to 59-year-olds and would not exempt parents or caretakers of children age six or older. The proposal continues to give states authority to exempt a portion of the caseload and to request geographic waivers based on labor-market measures, with some amendments to current law. Unlike the current law time limit, the proposal requires states to offer employment or training opportunities to those individuals subject to the requirements. The bill increases SNAP Employment and Training funding for the states, increasing mandatory funding in a formula grant for states from $110 million in current law to $270 million in FY2020 and to $1 billion in FY2021 and each year thereafter. CBO estimates that the House-passed work-related changes would reduce spending on SNAP benefits by approximately $14.1 billion over 10 years and would increase spending on program administration by approximately $7.3 billion\u2014a net reduction of $6.8 billion. CBO estimated for the House-reported bill that, in FY2028, in an average month, approximately 1.2 million recipients would no longer receive benefits, with each recipient losing an average annual SNAP benefit amount of $1,816. 3. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) and benefit calculation. Under current law, an eligible household's receipt of a LIHEAP payment over $20 has the potential to increase monthly benefit amounts, because this payment allows the household to have their benefits calculated using a standard utility allowance. Under this bill, for households without elderly or disabled members, LIHEAP would no longer confer this advantage regardless of the amount provided.

The bill modifies the definitions for biobased product, biorefinery, and renewable energy systems. It extends most of the programs through FY2023. Additionally, it provides mandatory funding for seven programs\u2014the Biobased Markets Program, the Biorefinery Assistance Program, the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, the Rural Energy for America Program, the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, and the newly established carbon utilization education program\u2014amounting to approximately $640 million over five years.", "The two bills have similarities as well as differences. For instance, unlike the House bill, the Senate Agriculture Committee bill repeals the Repowering Assistance Program. Similar to the House bill, the Senate bill modifies the Biobased Markets Program to restrict federal agencies from placing certain limitations on the procurement of bio-based products. Additionally, unlike the House bill, the Senate bill expands the focus of the Biomass Research and Development Initiative to include carbon dioxide utilization and sequestration. The Senate bill would also establish a biogas research and adoption of biogas systems initiative and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to form an Interagency Biogas Opportunities Task Force and to partner with the National Renewable Laboratory to conduct a biogas study, among other things.

States or Indian tribes that seek primary regulatory authority over hemp production would be required to implement a \"plan\" to further monitor and regulate hemp production.
