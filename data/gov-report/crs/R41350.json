Major commercial banks, insurers, government-sponsored enterprises, and investment banks either failed or required hundreds of billions in federal support to continue functioning. Households were hit hard by drops in the prices of real estate and financial assets, and by a sharp rise in unemployment. Congress responded to the crisis by enacting the most comprehensive financial reform legislation since the 1930s.", "Then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner issued a reform plan in the summer of 2009 that served as a template for legislation in both the House and Senate. After significant congressional revisions, President Obama signed H.R. 4173, now titled the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203), into law on July 21, 2010.", "Perhaps the major issue in the financial reform legislation was how to address the systemic fragility revealed by the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulatory umbrella group chaired by the Treasury Secretary\u2014the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)\u2014with authority to designate certain financial firms as systemically important and subjecting them and all banks with more than $50 billion in assets to heightened prudential regulation. Financial firms were also subjected to a special resolution process (called \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\") similar to that used in the past to address failing depository institutions following a finding that their failure would pose systemic risk.", "The Dodd-Frank Act made other changes to the regulatory structure. It created the Office of Financial Research to support FSOC. The act consolidated consumer protection responsibilities in a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB). It consolidated bank regulation by reassigning the Office of Thrift Supervision's (OTS's) responsibilities to the other banking regulators. A federal office was created to monitor insurance. The Federal Reserve's emergency authority was amended, and its activities were subjected to greater public disclosure and oversight by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).", "Other aspects of Dodd-Frank addressed particular sectors of the financial system or selected classes of market participants. Dodd-Frank required more derivatives to be cleared and traded through regulated exchanges, reporting for derivatives that remain in the over-the-counter market, and registration with appropriate regulators for certain derivatives dealers and large traders. Hedge funds were subject to new reporting and registration requirements. Credit rating agencies were subject to greater disclosure and legal liability provisions, and references to credit ratings were required to be removed from statute and regulation. Executive compensation and securitization reforms attempted to reduce incentives to take excessive risks. Securitizers were subject to risk retention requirements, popularly called \"skin in the game.\" It made changes to bank regulation to make bank failures less likely in the future, including prohibitions on certain forms of risky trading (known as the \"Volcker Rule\"). It created new mortgage standards in response to practices that caused problems in the foreclosure crisis.", "This report reviews issues related to financial regulation and provides brief descriptions of major provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, along with links to CRS products going in to greater depth on specific issues.

In March 2008, then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson issued a \"Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure.\" The Obama Administration released \"Financial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation\" in June 2009, and followed this with specific legislative language that provided a base text for congressional consideration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Crisis", "paragraphs": ["Understanding the fabric of financial reform proposals requires some analysis both of financial disruptions that peaked in September 2008, as well as of more enduring concerns about risks in the financial system. ", "The financial crisis focused policy attention on systemic risk, which had previously been a subject of interest to academics and central bankers, but was not seen as a significant threat to economic stability. The last major systemic risk episode was sparked by bank runs in the Great Depression, and the main elements of the current bank regulatory regime and federal safety net were put in place to prevent a similar recurrence. Between the end of the Great Depression and the early 2000s, the financial system weathered numerous shocks, failures, and crashes, with limited spillover into the real economy. Typically, the Federal Reserve (Fed) would announce that it stood ready to provide liquidity to the system, and that proved sufficient to stem panic. The idea that a financial shock could cause the entire system to spin out of control and collapse, and that the flow of credit might stop altogether, seemed to be a remote prospect. De facto policy was to rely on the Fed to deal with crises after the fact.", "The events of 2007 and 2008 caused a sharp reassessment of the robustness and the self-stabilizing capacity of the financial system. As then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner noted in written testimony delivered to the House Financial Services Committee on September 23, 2009, \"The job of a financial system \u2026 is to efficiently allocate savings and risk. Last fall, our financial system failed to do its job, and came precariously close to failing altogether.\"", "A number of discrete failures in individual markets and institutions led to global financial panic. Notably, many of these failures were not banks, seen historically as the primary source of systemic risk. U.S. financial firms suffered heavy losses in 2007 and 2008, primarily because of declines in the value of mortgage-related assets. During September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in government conservatorship. Merrill Lynch was sold in distress to Bank of America in a deal supported by the Fed and Treasury. The Fed and Treasury failed to find a buyer for Lehman Brothers, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy, disrupting financial markets. A money market mutual fund (the Reserve Primary Fund) that held debt issued by Lehman Brothers announced losses, triggering a run on other money market funds, and Treasury responded with a guarantee for money market funds. The American International Group (AIG), an insurance conglomerate with a securities subsidiary that specialized in financial derivatives, including credit default swaps, was unable to post collateral related to its derivatives and securities lending activities. The Fed intervened with an $85 billion loan to prevent bankruptcy and to ensure full payment to AIG's counterparties. In response to the general panic, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP); the Fed introduced several lending facilities to provide liquidity to different parts of the financial system; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) introduced a debt guarantee program for banks. The panic largely subsided through the latter part of 2008, although confidence in the financial system returned very slowly.", "It was widely understood that the panic had its roots in the subprime mortgage market, in which years of double-digit housing price increases had fed a bubble mentality and caused lenders to relax underwriting standards. That the housing market would cool, as it began to do in 2006, was not a great surprise. What was generally unexpected was the way losses caused by rising foreclosures and bad loans rippled through the system. Major financial institutions had constructed highly leveraged speculative positions that magnified the subprime shock, so that a setback in a $1 trillion segment of the U.S. housing market generated many times that amount in financial losses.", "Giant financial institutions were shown to be vulnerable to liquidity runs, and many failed or had to be rescued as short-term credit dried up. The value of complex financial instruments created through securitization became completely uncertain, and market participants lost confidence in each other's creditworthiness. Risks that were thought to be unrelated became highly correlated; a negative spiral that showed all financial risk taking to be interconnected and all declines to be self-reinforcing took hold. Doubts about counterparty exposure were magnified by opacity in derivatives markets.", "Disruption to the financial system exacerbated recessionary forces already at work in the economy. Asset prices plunged and consumers suffered sharp losses in their retirement and college savings accounts, as well as in the value of their homes. The financial crisis accelerated declines in consumption and business investment, which in turn made banks' problems worse. Overall, the recession proved to be the deepest and longest since the Great Depression."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-203)", "paragraphs": ["The Dodd-Frank Act included measures to improve systemic stability, improve policy options for coping with failing financial firms, increase transparency throughout financial markets, and protect consumers and investors.

Although regulators took systemic risk into account before the crisis, and systemic risk can never be entirely eliminated, analysts have pointed to a number of ostensible weaknesses in the precrisis regulatory regime's approach to systemic risk. First, there had been no regulator with overarching responsibility for mitigating systemic risk. Some analysts argue that systemic risk can fester in the gaps in the regulatory system where one regulator's jurisdiction ends and another's begins. Second, the crisis revealed that liquidity crises and runs were not just a problem for depository institutions. Third, the crisis revealed that nonbank, highly leveraged firms, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, could be a source of systemic risk and \"too big (or too interconnected) to fail.\" Finally, there were concerns that the breakdown of different payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) systems that make up the \"plumbing\" of the financial system, which were not regulated consistently, could be another source of systemic risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act (Titles I and VIII)", "paragraphs": ["Rather than creating a dedicated systemic risk regulator with broad powers to neutralize sources of systemic risk as they arise, Dodd-Frank instead created a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), composed of the Treasury Secretary as chair along with eight heads of federal regulatory agencies (including the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) and a presidential appointee with insurance experience as voting members. The act created an Office of Financial Research to support the council. See Table 2 below.", "The council is authorized to identify and advise its member regulators on sources of systemic risk and \"regulatory gap\" problems, but has limited rulemaking, examination, or enforcement powers of its own. The council is authorized to identify systemically important financial firms regardless of their legal charter, and the Fed will subject them and all bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets to stricter prudential oversight and regulation, including counterparty exposure limits set at 25% of total capital, annual stress tests and capital planning requirements, resolution planning (\"living wills\"), early remediation requirements, and risk management standards. Many large firms were already regulated by the Fed for safety and soundness as bank holding companies; the act prevented most firms from changing their charter in order to escape Fed regulation (known as the \"Hotel California\" provision). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act included a 10% liability concentration limit for financial firms and mechanisms by which the Fed would be empowered to curb the growth or reduce the size of large firms if they pose a risk to financial stability.", "Title VIII also provided for many PCS systems and activities deemed systemically important by the council to be regulated for safety and soundness by (depending on the type) the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and to have access to the Fed's discount window in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Crisis Context11", "paragraphs": ["During the recent financial turmoil, the Fed engaged in unprecedented levels of emergency lending to nonbank financial firms through its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.

When using this emergency authority, the Fed is required to seek approval from the Treasury Secretary. Title XI would also allow the FDIC to set up emergency liquidity programs to guarantee the debt of bank holding companies, similar to the 2008 Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.", "In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allowed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to audit the Fed's lending facilities and open market operations for internal controls and risk management, and it called for a GAO audit of the Fed's actions during the crisis.

The primary objective of a corporate bankruptcy is to provide the debtor with a \"fresh start\" by discharging the company's legal obligations to make further payments on existing debts. This generally is accomplished by either (1) liquidating the debtor company's assets so as to maximize returns to creditor classes based on a statutorily defined priority scheme, or (2) reorganizing the company's debts so that creditor classes receive more than they would have through liquidation, while also enabling the debtor to maintain operations as a going concern. ", "However, federal law does not permit every financial company to file for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. For example, depository institutions (i.e., banks and thrifts) that hold FDIC-insured deposits cannot be debtors under the Bankruptcy Code. Instead, these insured depositories are subject to a special resolution regime, called a conservatorship or receivership (C/R), that typically is administered by the FDIC. ", "Unlike the bankruptcy process, this C/R resolution regime is a largely nonjudicial, administrative process through which the FDIC assumes control over a troubled depository for the purpose of either preserving and conserving the institution's assets as conservator or liquidating the institution as receiver. The FDIC, as conservator or receiver, assumes broad and flexible powers, including \"all the powers of the members or shareholders, the directors, and the officers of the institution.\" One of the primary objectives of the FDIC as conservator or receiver is to protect federally insured deposits of the failed institution by either paying them off or transferring them to another institution. This process generally requires significant disbursements from the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund and often results in the FDIC being the largest creditor of the failed institution. The FDIC is generally required by statute to choose the \"least-cost resolution\" strategy that will result in the lowest cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund. However, the FDIC may waive the least-cost resolution requirement under certain circumstances to \"avoid serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.\" ", "The financial turmoil at the end of the last decade that resulted from the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the federal government's provision of ad hoc emergency financial assistance to prevent the bankruptcies of AIG, Bear Stearns, and others focused congressional attention on options for resolving large, complex financial companies while maintaining the stability of the U.S. financial system. More specifically, policymakers questioned whether the Bankruptcy Code, as it was structured at the time of the financial crisis, could effectuate the resolution of large, complex financial companies without undermining financial stability. Some believed that establishing a special resolution regime for large, complex financial companies modeled after the nonjudicial C/R process for resolving failed depositories would reduce the likelihood that the federal government would need to provide taxpayer-backed financial assistance to reduce the potential systemic disruptions of one or more financial companies entering bankruptcy. Opponents argued that the establishment of a special resolution regime would enable policymakers to provide beneficial treatment to favored creditors and counterparties of failing firms. Rather than establishing a new administrative resolution regime, some policymakers argued that these systemic risk concerns could be effectively addressed through amendments to the Bankruptcy Code. Ultimately, Congress can be seen to have chosen a path somewhat in the middle of these policy proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II)", "paragraphs": ["Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new resolution regime for certain financial companies, called the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" (OLA). OLA is an administrative process modeled after the C/R regime for failed depository institutions. However, OLA is statutorily structured as a fallback alternative to the normally applicable Bankruptcy Code that is to be utilized only under extraordinary circumstances. Under normal circumstances, failed financial companies would be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code. OLA, on the other hand, may be utilized only if, at the time when an eligible financial company is in default or in danger of default, various federal regulators determine that the company's resolution under the Bankruptcy Code would pose dangers to the U.S. financial system. ", "OLA is largely modeled after the C/R regime for failed depository institutions described above, but with some notable distinguishing characteristics. Like the C/R regime for depositories, OLA is a largely nonjudicial, administrative process that typically would be administered by the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC's powers under OLA are similar to those assumed by the FDIC under the C/R regime for depositories. ", "Unlike the C/R regime, which is limited to depository institutions and their subsidiaries, OLA is available to a broad array of financial companies, including bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, and insurance holding companies, as well as many of their subsidiaries. However, depository institutions continue to be resolved under the C/R regime, and insurance companies and certain securities broker-dealers are subject to distinct resolution requirements. ", "While the chief objective of the C/R regime is to protect federally insured deposits and minimize the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the primary objective of the OLA is \"to provide the necessary authority to liquidate failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk and minimizes moral hazard.\" To further this objective, OLA authorizes only receiverships, not conservatorships. The Dodd-Frank Act states that \"[a]ll financial companies put into receivership under this title shall be liquidated and no taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the liquidation of any financial company under this title.\"", "The funding mechanism for resolutions under the OLA also differs from the C/R regime for depositories. Whereas the Deposit Insurance Fund is prefunded based on assessments against insured depositories, the Orderly Liquidation Fund established for funding resolutions under the OLA is not prefunded. Instead, the FDIC is authorized to borrow from the Treasury as necessary to fund a specific OLA receivership, subject to explicit caps based on the value of the failed company's consolidated assets. If the failed companies' assets are insufficient to repay fully what was borrowed from the Treasury, then the FDIC is empowered to recover the shortfall from the financial industry.

Lenders collect origination fees, but if they sell their loans they are not exposed to loan losses if borrowers default. This creates an incentive to originate loans without appropriate underwriting. Prior to the crisis, these incentives likely led to deteriorating underwriting standards, and certain lenders may have been indifferent to whether loans would be repaid. Private securitization was especially prevalent in the subprime mortgage market, the nonconforming mortgage market, and in regions where loan defaults were particularly severe. Losses and illiquidity in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market led to wider problems in the crisis, including a lack of confidence in financial firms because of uncertainty about their exposure to potential MBS losses, through their holdings of MBS or off-balance sheet support to securitizers.", "One approach to address incentives in securitization is to require loan securitizers to retain a portion of the long-term default risk. An advantage of this \"skin in the game\" requirement is that it may help preserve underwriting standards among lenders funded by securitization. Another advantage is that securitizers would share in the risks faced by the investors to whom they market their securities.

During this crisis, the FDIC temporarily raised the maximum insured deposit amount to $250,000, because many depositors held accounts larger than $100,000.

To reach these ends, the banking agencies held broad authority to subject depository institutions to upfront supervisory standards, including the authority to conduct regular, if not continuous, on-site examinations of depository institutions.
