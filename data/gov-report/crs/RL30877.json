The acknowledgment should include a description of the contribution, a good faith estimate of the value of any property contributed, and a statement about whether anything was given in return. In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-280 ) imposes a new requirement that any cash donation be substantiated by a bank record or written communication from the organization showing its name and the date and amount of the contribution.
