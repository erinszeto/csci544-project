Nevertheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that the language of \u00a71591(a) applied to the case of two customers caught in a law enforcement \"sting\" who attempted to purchase the services of what they believed were child prostitutes. \"The ordinary and natural meaning of 'obtains' and the other terms Congress selected in drafting section 1591 are broad enough to encompass the actions of both suppliers and purchasers of commercial sex acts,\" the court declared.", "S. 178 (Senator Cornyn), H.R. 181 (Representative Poe), and a number of other bills would explicitly confirm this construction by amending \u00a71591(a) to read, in part, \"Whoever knowingly ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, maintains, or patronizes, or solicits by any means any person ...\" (language of the proposed amendment in italics).

Even before amendment, however, there was some evidence that advertising might constitute a crime under either offense. Aiding and abetting would have provided the key to prosecution in both instances. Anyone who aids and abets the commission of a federal crime by another merits the same punishment as the individual who actually commits the crime. Liability for aiding and abetting requires that a defendant embrace the crime of another and consciously do something to contribute to its success. Anyone who knowingly advertised the availability of child prostitutes might have faced charges of aiding and abetting a commercial sex trafficking offense. An advertiser who profited from such activity might face charges under the profiteering prong of \u00a71591.", "Yet \u00a71591 might have presented a technical obstacle. One of \u00a71591's distinctive features was that its action elements\u2014recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining\u2014were activities that might be associated with aiding and abetting the operation of a prostitution enterprise. Section 1591, read literally then, did not outlaw operating a prostitution business; it outlawed the steps leading up to or associated with operating a prostitution business\u2014recruiting, harboring, transporting, etc. Strictly construed, advertising in aid of recruitment, harboring, transporting, or one of the other action elements might have qualified as aiding and abetting a violation of \u00a71591, while advertising the availability of a prostitute might not have.", "Nevertheless, at least one court suggested that \u00a71591 did outlaw operating a prostitution business, at least for purposes of aiding and abetting liability, and thus by implication advertising might have constituted aiding and abetting a violation of the section:", "Pringler first argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for aiding and abetting the sex trafficking of a minor [in violation of Section 1591].... We disagree. The record is not devoid of evidence to support the jury's verdict and show Pringler's integral role in the criminal venture. Pringler took the money that Norman and B.L. earned from their prostitution and used some of it to pay for hotel rooms where the women met their patrons. Pringler bought the laptop Norman and B.L. used to advertise their services. He drove Norman and B.L. to \"outcall\" appointments, and he took photographs of Norman, which he had planned for use in advertisements.", "P.L. 114-22 resolves the uncertainty by adding advertising to the prostitution-assisting element of the commercial sex trafficking offense.

Advertising traffickers are liable if they knew of or recklessly disregarded the victim's status. Advertising profiteers are liable only if they knew of the victim's status:", "Whoever knowingly- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits ... advertises ... ; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or , except where, in an offense under paragraph (2), the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising , in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) [language added by the amendment in italics].", "Knowledge is obviously a more demanding standard than reckless disregard, but the dividing line between the two is not always easily discerned, in part because of the doctrine of willful blindness. The doctrine describes the circumstances under which a jury may be instructed by the court that it may infer knowledge on the part of a defendant. Worded variously, the doctrine applies where evidence indicates that the defendant sought to avoid the guilty knowledge.", "Since the element was worded in the alternative\u2014knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact\u2014the courts have rarely distinguished the two. One possible interpretation comes from comparable wording in an immigration offense which outlaws transporting an alien knowing or acting in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien is in this country illegally: \"To act with reckless disregard of the fact means to be aware of but consciously and carelessly ignore facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the person transported was an alien who had entered or remained in the United States illegally.\" The courts refer to a similar unreasonable indifference standard when speaking of the veracity required for the issuance of a warrant.

H.R. 956 would impose the same obligation on the Secretary of Defense, but without the fiscal sanctions which attend a state's failure to comply. In addition to the demand to register where they live, work, or attend school, sex offenders being released from custody must also register with the jurisdiction in which they were convicted. H.R. 956 would require military sex offenders to register upon release in addition with the Secretary of Defense.", "H.R. 956 , like S. 178 and S. 409 , would require the Secretary of Defense to include the same information within his registry regarding a recently released sex offender that states and tribes are required to capture: physical description of the sex offender; text of the law proscribing the conduct for which the sex offender was convicted; the sex offender's criminal history; fingerprints, a DNA sample, and a photograph of the sex offender; a copy of the offender's driver's license or other official identification of the sex offender; and any additional information required by the Attorney General.", "The Secretary would have to make this information publicly available online, and would be required to report the information to the Attorney General, appropriate law enforcement, and educational, public housing, social service officials, as well as assorted related public and private entities. The Attorney General would be required to include the information in the national registry and to forward updated information received from various jurisdictions relating to a military sex offender to the Secretary of Defense. The national registry would be required to include military sex offender information available on the Secretary's website.", "SORNA mandates that \"appropriate officials\" and \"appropriate law enforcement agencies\" take action when a sex offender fails to comply with the requirements of a state or tribal registry. H.R. 956 would establish a comparable command for action when a military sex offender fails to comply with the requirements of the DOD registry. It is unclear whether the amendment is intended to expand the terms \"appropriate official\" and \"appropriate law enforcement agencies\" to encompass DOD officials and law enforcement agencies, giving them authority over discharged military sex offenders over whom they would otherwise have no jurisdiction.", "SORNA obligates the Attorney General to develop and support the computer software necessary for jurisdictions to comply with SORNA's standards. H.R. 956 would enlarge the obligation to enable establishment and maintenance of a DOD registry.", "Finally, H.R. 956 would require military sex offenders entering the United States to register with the Secretary of Defense."], "subsections": []}]}}
