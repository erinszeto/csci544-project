While I do not decide that violence inflicted by non-governmental actors may never serve as the basis for an asylum or withholding application based on membership in a particular social group, in practice such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address. The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes\u2014such as domestic violence or gang violence\u2014or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim.", "The decision further noted that because claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by nongovernmental actors generally will not qualify for asylum, they would also generally not meet the threshold for a finding of a credible fear of persecution (see \" Inspection of Arriving Aliens \").", "In July 2018, USCIS issued a policy memorandum to provide guidance to its asylum officers in light of the Attorney General's decision. Highlighting required findings about the home government in cases involving private violence, the memorandum stated:", "Few gang-based or domestic-violence claims involving particular social groups defined by the members' vulnerability to harm may merit a grant of asylum or refugee status\u2014or pass the \"significant possibility\" test in credible fear screenings \u2026\u2014because an applicant must prove, or establish a significant possibility that, his or her government is unable or unwilling to protect him or her\u2026. Again, the home government must either condone the behavior or demonstrate a complete helplessness to protect victims of such alleged persecution.", "Following issuance of the Attorney General's decision, immigration advocates expressed worry that the decision and the related USCIS policy memorandum could have wide-sweeping consequences, particularly for asylum seekers from Central America. In a letter to the New York Times , a counsel with the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for immigrant women and girls fleeing gender-based violence, wrote, \"As a result of that ruling, and the subsequent policy guidance, immigration officers may now feel emboldened to deny asylum to women fleeing domestic violence, even under the most life-threatening circumstances.\"", "On December 19, 2018, a federal district court judge in Washington, DC, ruled on a case challenging the policies regarding credible fear of persecution determinations set forth in former Attorney General Sessions' decision and the USCIS policy memorandum. The judge permanently enjoined the U.S. government from continuing some of the new policies.", "S ome who a re concerned about the potential impact of the former Attorney General's decision on women seeking asylum have discussed the possibility of amending the underlying INA definition of a refugee to explicitly address gender-based asylum claims. Among the l egislative options that have been put forward a re to add \"gender\" to the list of persecution gro unds or \"to define the phrase ' particular social group' by amending the law to include a non-exclusive list of (currently) common gender-based asylum claims, including domestic violence.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credible Fear of Persecution Threshold", "paragraphs": ["Separate from the 2018 decision by former Attorney General Sessions and the related USCIS policy memorandum discussed in the preceding section, the credible fear of persecution threshold has been a focus of attention recently as the number of individuals being screened for and found to have a credible fear has grown.

In prepared testimony for a May 2018 House hearing on border security, he stated, \"The simple reality is that those who wish to gain access to or remain in the United States know they can likely effect that access and then delay their removal by simply saying the 'magic words' of 'fear' or 'asylum.' The standard for credible fear screenings at the border has been set so low that nearly everyone meets it.\"", "Others disagree that the credible fear standard should be raised. In a 2018 policy brief, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) argues that \"the lower threshold for credible fear determinations is necessary precisely because asylum seekers arriving at the border are typically detained, traumatized, and have limited access to counsel and documentation to support their claims.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frivolous or Fraudulent Asylum Claims", "paragraphs": ["There have been concerns about frivolous asylum applications since the establishment of the U.S. asylum program. As noted, the 1980 interim regulations made reference to \"non-frivolous\" applications, and IIRIRA amended the INA to permanently bar an individual who knowingly files a frivolous asylum application from receiving immigration benefits. Under current regulations, an asylum application is considered \"frivolous\" for purposes of the INA benefit bar \"if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.\" These regulations also provide that for purposes of the bar, \"a finding that an alien filed a frivolous asylum application shall not preclude the alien from seeking withholding of removal.\"", "The issue of frivolous asylum claims was highlighted by Attorney General Sessions in 2017 remarks, in which he described the asylum system as being \"subject to rampant abuse and fraud.\" He further said, \"And as this system becomes overloaded with fake claims, it cannot deal effectively with just claims.\" Similarly, in his May 2018 House testimony, USCIS Director Cissna stated, \"The integrity of our entire immigration system is at risk because frivolous asylum applications impede our ability to help people who really need it.\" ", "Several House bills considered in the 115 th Congress sought to tighten language in the INA on frivolous asylum claims. In his May 2018 testimony, USCIS Director Cissna called for legislation to address the problem of frivolous claims that would, among other provisions, \"impos[e] and enforce[e] penalties for the filing of frivolous asylum applications.\"", "A key point of contention in the current debate about frivolous or fraudulent asylum claims is the scope of the problem. According to a researcher at the immigration-restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies, \"Most asylum claims nowadays, whether in Europe or the United States, are not genuine. Migrants are more and more using the asylum ticket to gain entry into a country and stay.\"", "Other experts, such as Law Professor Lindsay M. Harris, reach different conclusions about the prevalence of fraud in recent asylum applications: \"One of the humanitarian crises producing refugees happens to be south of our border, in Central America, and this accounts for the exponential increase in asylum claims and individuals seeking protection in the U.S. through the credible fear system, rather than a sudden increase in fraudulent claims.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employment Authorization", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, an asylum seeker who is not otherwise eligible for employment authorization cannot be granted such authorization until 180 days after filing an application for asylum. In general, under DHS regulations, an asylum applicant cannot submit an application for employment authorization and an employment authorization document (EAD) until 150 days after a complete asylum application has been received. There is no fee for an asylum applicant's initial application for employment authorization. Renewal applications are subject to standard fees.", "Although there seems to be general agreement that asylum seekers should be eligible for employment authorization at some point, aspects of this policy have long been debated. For example, for more than 20 years, some have argued that the availability of employment authorization creates an incentive for individuals to apply for asylum solely to be able to work legally in the United States. In his prepared testimony for the May 2018 House hearing on border issues, USCIS Director Cissna stated, \"While the number of mala fide claims is difficult to estimate, experience from the 1990s indicates that a significant amount of the growth in receipts since FY 2014 may be linked to individuals pursuing work authorization and not necessarily asylum status.\"", "Others dismiss the idea that asylum seekers act in response to particular U.S. policies, arguing that they are motivated by desperate circumstances. Commenting on Central American asylum seekers, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said, \"People are leaving because they are suffering from high levels of violence from gangs and other organized criminal groups.\u2026 This flow of families from Central America will not stop because if the root causes are still there these people will keep coming to the U.S. or to other countries.\"", "The complex system set up to track when an asylum seeker has reached the 180-day point for employment authorization purposes\u2014known as the asylum EAD clock \u2014has also been controversial. There are various events that stop the asylum EAD clock. USCIS and EOIR characterize these as \"delays requested or caused by an applicant while his or her asylum application is pending with USCIS and/or EOIR\" (e.g., the applicant's \"failure to appear at an interview or fingerprint appointment\" or \"the applicant or his or her attorney asks for additional time to prepare the case\").

Among its findings, the report identified the Newark and San Francisco Immigration Courts as having the greatest judge-to-judge differences in asylum cases decided during that time. For the San Francisco court, for example, it stated that \"the odds of denial varied from only 9.4 percent all the way up to 97.1 percent depending upon the judge.\" The TRAC analysis assumes that \"when individual judges [on the same court] handle a sufficient number of asylum requests, random case assignment will result in each judge being assigned a roughly equivalent mix of 'worthy' cases.\" It, thus, posits, \"any large differences in the denial rates of individual judges are unlikely to be the result of differences in the nature of the incoming cases. Instead, they are likely to reflect the personal perspective that each judge brings to the bench.\"", "TRAC first reported on differences in asylum decisions by immigration judges nationwide based on an analysis of asylum cases decided by judges from FY1994 through early FY2005.

In October 2018 remarks at an immigration conference, USCIS Director Cissna offered context for DHS's and DOJ's asylum-related actions from the Administration's perspective when he referenced \"challenges associated with surges at the U.
