The first is the nature of the state economy and, to the extent possible, a state's ability to respond to economic changes (i.e., downturns or upturns). The impact on a particular state of a national economic downturn or upturn will be related to the structure of the state economy and its business sectors. For example, a national decline in automobile sales, while having an impact on all state economies, will have a larger impact in states that manufacture automobiles as production is reduced and workers are laid off.", "Second, the FMAP formula relies on per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average per capita personal income . The national economy is basically the sum of all state economies. As a result, the national response to an economic change is the sum of the state responses to economic change. If more states (or larger states) experience an economic decline, the national economy reflects this decline to some extent. However, the national decline will be lower than some states' declines because the total decline has been offset by states with small decreases or even increases (i.e., states with growing economies). The U.S. per capita personal income, because of this balancing of positive and negative, has only a small percentage change each year. Since the FMAP formula compares state changes in per capita personal income (which can have large changes each year) to the U.S. per capita personal income, this comparison can result in significant state FMAP rate changes.", "In addition to annual revisions of per capita personal income data, comprehensive NIPA revisions undertaken every four to five years may also influence regular FMAP rates (e.g., because of changes in the definition of personal income). The impact on FMAP rates will depend on whether the changes are broad (affecting all states) or more selective (affecting only certain states or industries)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2014 Regular FMAP Rates", "paragraphs": ["Regular FMAP rates for FY2014 (the federal fiscal year that begins on October 1, 2013) were calculated and published November 30, 2012, in the Federal Register .

Originally, it was assumed that all states would implement the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014 as required by statute because implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion was required in order for states to receive any federal Medicaid funding. However, on June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius finding that the federal government cannot terminate the federal Medicaid funding a state receives for its current Medicaid program if a state refuses to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion. If a state accepts the new ACA Medicaid expansion funds, it must abide by the new expansion coverage rules. However, based on the Court's opinion, it appears that a state can refuse to participate in the ACA Medicaid expansion without losing any of its current federal Medicaid matching funds.", "While not all states are expected to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the Medicaid expansion will increase Medicaid enrollment by 7 million in FY2014, which is a 20% increase over the Medicaid enrollment estimated for FY2014 without the ACA Medicaid expansion. As a result, the expansion will significantly increase Medicaid expenditures, and the federal government will cover a vast majority of the costs for individuals who are \"newly eligible\" due to ACA.

States will receive 100% FMAP rate for the cost of providing benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage to \"newly eligible\" individuals, from 2014 through 2016. For \"newly eligible\" individuals, the FMAP rate will phase down to 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% afterward (See Table 2 ).", "\"Expansion State\" FMAP Rates.

Populations in an \"expansion state\" that meet the definition for the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate will receive the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate. For example, an \"expansion state\" that currently provides Medicaid coverage to childless adults and parents up to 100% FPL that chooses to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion will receive the higher \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate for individuals between 100% and 133% FPL. Also, \"expansion states\" will receive the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate for individuals who received limited Medicaid benefits. In addition, \"expansion states\" that provided state-funded health benefits coverage will receive the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate for individuals previously covered by the state-only program.
