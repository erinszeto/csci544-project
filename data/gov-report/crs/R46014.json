Brief descriptions of the factors are as follows:", "1. State Fiscal Capacity and Resource Availability requires an evaluation of the resources available to the local and state/territorial/Indian tribal government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, combined with the circumstances that contribute to a lack of sufficient resources, resulting in a need for supplemental federal assistance. This factor includes two subfactors: a. Fiscal Capacity evaluates the state's ability to raise revenue for disaster response and recovery using one of two variables: (1) increasing or decreasing, or higher or lower state total taxable resources (TTR); or (2)\u00c2\u00a0higher or lower state gross domestic product (GDP), which may be considered as the primary alternative to TTR for requesting territories or when TTR data is unavailable. Higher or lower per capita personal income by local area may also be considered with TTR or state GDP when FEMA needs to better assess the need for supplemental federal assistance within a local area. In addition, other factors may be considered because even states with a high fiscal capacity may be affected by disasters that overwhelm their capabilities, or the variables (i.e., TTR and state GDP) may not accurately reflect a state's fiscal capacity due to extenuating circumstances; and b. Resource Availability evaluates whether the disaster-caused needs can be met using non-Stafford Act sources. Two variables are considered: (1)\u00c2\u00a0resources and services provided by local and state/territorial/Indian tribal governments, and nongovernmental and private sector organizations; and (2)\u00c2\u00a0the cumulative effect of recent disasters occurring in the previous 24-month period. 2. Uninsured Home and Personal Property Losses considers the results of the FEMA-State Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) process to evaluate the extent of damage and estimated cost of assistance. The subfactors considered include (1) the \"peril that caused the disaster damage\" because it may affect insurance coverage; (2) the percentage of affected applicants with insurance for the peril that caused the damage; (3) whether the concentration of damages is in one area or if it is widespread; (4) the number of homes damaged and degree to which they are damaged (i.e., whether habitability is affected); (5) the estimated cost of assistance based on the PDA data and historical data; (6) the estimated rate of homeownership for the affected homes, which may influence whether the IHP is needed, and what types of housing assistance should be made available; and (7) other relevant PDA data that may demonstrate a need for supplemental federal assistance. 3. Disaster Impacted Population Profile evaluates the recovery challenges of the impacted population considering the affected community's demographics as compared with national averages. 4. Impact to Community Infrastructure evaluates the disaster's impact by considering disruption, damage, or destruction for more than 72 hours to any of the following three subfactors: (1) Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Services that provide an \"essential community function that ... will affect public health and safety\", such as police, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS), medical facilities, and water treatment services; (2) Essential Community Services that improve quality of life, such as schools and childcare providers, and social services; and (3) Transportation Infrastructure and Utilities that, for example, render housing uninhabitable or inaccessible, or affect the delivery of services. 5. Casualties , including the number of individuals who are missing, injured, or deceased as a result of a disaster, indicate the level of trauma, which may influence the appropriate types of IA assistance to provide.", "Disaster Related Unemployment identifies the number of individuals who may have lost work or become unemployed as a result of the disaster and who do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
