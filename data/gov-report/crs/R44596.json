The act is associated with three separate bill numbers: H.R. 4974, S. 2806, and H.R. 2577.", "Congressional action on FY2017 military construction appropriations legislation has been heavily influenced by the statutorily mandated discretionary spending caps established by P.L. 114-74, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). A significant issue before Congress is the extent to which Congress and the President will agree on budgetary authority that (1) exceeds the established BBA limit, and (2) is exempt under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7901 from being counted toward that limit by virtue of categorization as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The 2015 BBA temporarily increased statutory funding limits on defense and non-defense appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017 above those established by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 (P.L. 112-25).", "New budget authority (funding not previously appropriated) for military construction and military family housing totaled $8,171.0 million for FY2016.

On May 19, 2016, the Senate combined the versions of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (T-HUD), Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MILCON/VA), and Zika Response and Preparedness appropriations bills into H.R. 2577 (a T-HUD appropriations bill for FY2016 that the House had passed in June, 2015), passed the amended bill, and sent it to the House. The House substituted its own amendment in three divisions (Division A: MILCON/VA, Division B: Zika Response Appropriations, and Division C: Zika Vector Control), removing the T-HUD portion for H.R. 2577, passed the bill, and requested a conference.", "The conference met on June 15, 2016, and filed its report (H.Rept. 114-640) the next day.

This compares with $7.72 billion made available for FY2015 and $8.54 billion enacted for FY2016. This continues a downward trend in military construction appropriations begun in FY2010, when construction activity associated with the 2005 Base Closure (BRAC) round began to subside.", "The President has requested significantly less military construction funding for FY2017 than was the norm during the early years of the 2000s. Figure 1 illustrates the amounts of new budget authority enacted FY2000-FY2016 and projected by DOD through FY2021.", "The OCO portion of the request continues a shift in emphasis that has become apparent in recent years. OCO construction has shifted from the CENTCOM (Middle East and Southwest Asia) and AFRICOM (Africa, less Egypt) Areas of Responsibility (AOR) to EUCOM (Europe). OCO military construction through FY2011 was directed to the CENTCOM AOR in Southwest Asia. For example, in FY2011, $1.22 billion in OCO construction was devoted to Afghanistan, Qatar, and Bahrain. This began to be redirected in FY2012, when $269.7 million in OCO construction went to projects in Afghanistan, Bahrain, and Djibouti. The FY2013 OCO appropriation included $355.6 million for construction in Djibouti, Bahrain, and Diego Garcia (a British Protectorate in the Indian Ocean), plus funds to construct the ballistic missile defense AEGIS Ashore complex in Romania. No construction funding was identified as OCO for FY2014, but the FY2015 appropriation included $151.9 million that encompassed some OCO construction in Djibouti and Bahrain but devoted most of its emphasis to improving airfields in Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. The FY2016 appropriation of $428.9 million was devoted largely to an AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense Complex in Poland, with the remainder going to ship-related construction in Bahrain and airfield improvements in Oman, Niger, and Djibouti. Nearly two-thirds of the FY2017 request of $172.4 million is designated as part of the European Reassurance Initiative and is dedicated to airfield improvements in Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, plus additional facilities in Iceland and Germany to accommodate the Navy's P-8A Poseidon and the Air Force's F/A-22 Raptor aircraft.
