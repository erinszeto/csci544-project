Nearly all of DARPA's funding falls under the categories of basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Funding under these categories is referred to by DOD as the science and technology (S&T) budget. DOD's S&T budget is often singled out by analysts and others for additional scrutiny, as it is viewed as an investment in the foundational knowledge needed to develop future military systems. DARPA's share of Defense S&T funding has remained relatively steady at between 22% and 25% from FY2000 to FY2019. In FY2019, basic research accounts for 14% of DARPA funding, up from 3% in FY1996. However, the proportion of DARPA funding supporting basic research in FY2019 represents a 10% decline when compared to the proportion of DARPA funding supporting basic research in FY2018.

Such research is also characterized by its challenge to current understanding or its pathway to new frontiers.", "Since its establishment, DARPA-funded research has made important scientific and technological contributions in computer science, telecommunications, and material sciences, among other areas. Specifically, DARPA investments have resulted in a number of significant breakthroughs in military technology, including precision guided munitions, stealth technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, and infrared night vision technology. DARPA-sponsored R&D has also led to the development of notable commercial products and technologies such as the internet, global positioning system (GPS), automated voice recognition, and personal electronics.", "The nature of the high-risk, high-reward approach to funding taken by DARPA also results in a number of failed or less successful projects. For example, in the 1970s DARPA supported research into paranormal phenomena and the possibility of using telepathy and psychokinesis to conduct remote espionage. The agency also supported the development of a \"mechanical elephant\" for transportation in the jungles of Vietnam that former DARPA Director Rechtin termed a \"damn fool\" project and terminated before it could come under scrutiny by Congress.

The goal of the Total Information Awareness program was to \"revolutionize the ability of the United States to detect, classify and identify foreign terrorists\u2014and decipher their plans\" by creating a large database of information that could be \"mined\" using new tools and techniques to identify actionable intelligence. Some Members of Congress, the American Civil Liberties Union, and others criticized the program as an abuse of government authorities and an infringement on the privacy of Americans. In Section 111 of the appropriations bill for FY2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ) Congress limited the use of funds for the TIA program and expressed the sense of Congress that the program \"should not be used to develop technologies for use in conducting intelligence activities or law enforcement activities against United States persons without appropriate consultation with Congress or without clear adherence to principles to protect civil liberties and privacy.\"", "There has been at least one more recent DARPA program that failed to meet expectations. In 2011, the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 exploded 9 minutes into a 30-minute planned test flight when large portions of the vehicle's outer shell peeled away. The program ended in 2011.", "These less successful and sometimes high-profile failures highlight DARPA's willingness to invest in high-risk, high-reward R&D. Despite such setbacks, the agency is frequently cited as a model for innovation that other agencies, outside groups, and Congress have sought to replicate across the federal government. For example, both the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) within the Department of Energy were modeled after DARPA with a focus on high-risk, high-reward research in their respective areas.

Although DARPA program managers can use peer review to help them evaluate the merit of an R&D proposal, they are not required to do so and are in effect responsible for the selection, and, if necessary, the termination of a project.

DARPA believes that the continued influx of new program managers infuses the agency with new ideas and personnel who have a passion for turning those ideas into reality as quickly as possible. DARPA estimates that 25% of its program mangers turn over annually. According to the agency, \"in most organizations that would be considered a problem; at DARPA, it is intentional and invigorating. A short tenure means that people come to the agency to get something done, not build a career.\" ", "However, some contend that the high turnover rate of program managers can result in duplicative efforts due to a lack of institutional memory. Concerns have also been raised that the recruitment process used by DARPA\u2014existing or previous program managers identify new program managers\u2014might contribute to a gender imbalance (DARPA program managers are typically men) and the selection of individuals from the same network of researchers, which could lead to a stagnation of new ideas and perspectives.", "Limited tenure and urgency is also reflected in how DARPA funds its projects. In general, DARPA funds an idea or project just long enough to determine its feasibility, typically three to five years. If a program manager believes a new idea is not working out, the program manager can terminate the project quickly and funds can be redirected to a new project or an existing project with more potential.

Specifically, the program granted DARPA the authority to directly hire experts in science and engineering from outside the federal government for limited term appointments (up to six years). It also exempted the agency from complying with traditional civilian personnel requirements, thereby allowing DARPA to streamline its hiring process and increase the level of compensation it could offer scientists and engineers. Many in Congress viewed this flexibility in hiring as improving DARPA's ability to recruit and retain eminent scientific and technical experts.

OTs do not have to comply with the government's procurement regulations. Only those agencies that have been provided OT authority may engage in other transactions. Generally, the reason for creating OT authority is that the government needs to obtain leading edge R&D or prototypes from commercial sources that are unwilling or unable to navigate the government's procurement regulations. OT authority is generally viewed as giving federal agencies additional flexibility to develop agreements tailored to the needs of the project and its participants. In 1991, Congress made DARPA's OT authority permanent and extended it to DOD broadly. In 1993, Congress provided DARPA with authority to use OTs for prototypes; this authority was subsequently extended to the entire department in 1996 and made permanent in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 ( P.L. 114-92 )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DARPA's Role in DOD and Selection of R&D Programs", "paragraphs": ["DARPA's R&D efforts are generally long-term in character and often in areas where the national security or defense need is initially unclear.

This construct has allowed DARPA to support R&D and technology efforts that are not tied to formal military requirements or to the specific roles or missions of the military services.

DARPA considers this connection to the R&D and entrepreneurial community critical to driving innovation and risk-taking within the agency's activities. Additionally, DARPA often holds conferences, sponsors workshops, and supports travel by its program managers and its leadership to ensure the agency is fully informed of current and cutting-edge technologies and research.

For example, according to GAO, the Air Force was initially resistant to investments in stealth technologies for aircraft. Risk aversion and resistance within the military services often can only be overcome with sufficient maturation and demonstration of the technologies prior to transition. However, DARPA's funding only supports budget activities from 6.1 to 6.3\u2014basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development\u2014and not the further levels of technology maturation in 6.4 and 6.5\u2014advanced component development and prototypes and system development and demonstration\u2014which could be used to overcome a military service's resistance. In a 2017 report comparing the best practices and management of science and technology programs at leading companies to DOD, GAO noted that companies recognize the difficulty associated with transitioning disruptive technologies and fund their disruptive technology projects through demonstration to help obtain a customer. Recent prototyping initiatives such as the Air Force Experimentation Initiative or the Army Technology Maturation Initiative within DOD may help to overcome the gap in technology maturation funding between DARPA and the department's acquisition programs. Other barriers to technology transfer also exist, including the development of technologies that do not fall clearly within the mission of a particular service and the lack of a clear \"customer.\"", "Case studies by GAO and others, however, do indicate that DARPA has succeeded in transitioning some of its technologies to the military services and the private sector. According to GAO, the four factors that contribute to a successful technology transition are ", "military or commercial demand for the technology; linkage to a research area where DARPA has had a sustained interest; active collaboration with the potential transition partner; and achievement of clearly defined technical goals.", "As noted by GAO and others, technology transfer is not a primary emphasis of DARPA. GAO has found that inconsistencies in the reporting and collection of technology transfer information by the agency make it difficult to reliably report on the overall success of DARPA's transition efforts. GAO first stated its concern regarding the lack of documentation for DARPA's technology transfer activities in 1974. More recently, GAO has concluded that DARPA leadership \"foregoes opportunities to assess, and thus potentially improve, technology transition strategies\" and that technology transition responsibilities fall to individual program managers that GAO believes are not sufficiently trained to achieve successful outcomes. Congress may examine the effectiveness of DARPA's Adaptive Execution Office which is responsible for reviewing and implementing the agency's technology transition strategies, including assisting individual program managers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DARPA's Role and the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years, some Members of Congress, think tanks, and others have expressed concern that the U.S. military is losing its technical superiority due, in part, to the proliferation of technologies outside the defense sector and the inability of DOD to effectively incorporate and exploit commercial innovations. To address this concern, Congress established an Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD R&E) in 2016 that \"would take risks, press the technology envelope, test and experiment, and have the latitude to fail, as appropriate.\" In describing the role of the Under Secretary, the Senate Committee on Armed Services stated ", "the USD(R&E) will be a unifying force to focus the efforts of the defense laboratories, as well as agencies with critical innovation missions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Missile Defense Agency on achieving and maintaining U.S. defense technological dominance.", "How the USD R&E will \"focus the efforts\" of DARPA is unclear and an area that Congress may consider defining. In determining the appropriate role of DARPA in DOD's efforts to maintain technological superiority, it may be useful to examine some of the roles DARPA has played in its past. According to the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), DARPA has at various times through its history been the", "focus for large-scale, nationally important technology application areas; principal supporter of major areas of basic research and generic technologies with both military and commercial potential; developer of specific, large-scale system concepts and prototypes; supporter of highly experimental and extremely advanced concepts for weapons, systems, and capabilities; developer of operational systems and capabilities for direct application to existing military conflicts; funder of research to improve the capabilities of industry to produce defense-related technologies; and supporter of fundamental knowledge needed to better understand a phenomena related to a potential defense application.", "It may be appropriate to have DARPA pursue some or all of these roles simultaneously, with varying degrees of emphasis. However, IDA has stated that, historically, \"DARPA efforts had their greatest success when there was a clearly defined sense of mission and direction in the agency and DOD.\" On December 18, 2017, the Trump Administration released the National Security Strategy, which stated that \"the United States will prioritize emerging technologies critical to economic growth and security, such as data science, encryption, autonomous technologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing technologies, and artificial intelligence.\" Currently, it is unclear how DOD will implement this strategic vision across its R&D organizations, including DARPA. Some of the questions posed by IDA in its 1991 report on the future of DARPA still hold today and may be considered by the USD R&E, DARPA, and Congress, including the following:", "What military needs and threats should DARPA's work be focused on? What technologies have the potential to make the largest impact in the future? How should DARPA interact with the commercial sector and civilian technologies? How does DARPA determine the scale and scope of its investment in a given area? How does DARPA appropriately balance investment risk and the pursuit of ambitious, potentially high-payoff programs?", "A 2003 report by IDA stated that \"DARPA's success depends not only on strong support from OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense], but also on clear guidance from it on strategic needs.\" ", "For more information on the USD R&E see CRS In Focus IF10834, Defense Primer: Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering , by Marcy E. Gallo and Moshe Schwartz. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integration of Ethical, Social, and Legal Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Developments in R&D and technology can raise ethical, legal, and societal (ELS) concerns. For example, some groups have expressed concern about the impact artificial intelligence and neurotechnologies could have on privacy, consent, and an individual's identity and agency (i.e., a person's bodily and mental integrity and their ability to choose their own actions). The application of these technologies in a military context has the potential to further elevate ELS concerns. For example, how would a neurotechnology that enhances a soldier's senses, stamina, or dexterity affect the ability of an individual to integrate into civilian life upon completion of their service? ", "In 2013, DARPA initiated a number of neurotechnology programs as part of the Obama Administration's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, including R&D on implantable brain-computer interfaces that could restore neural and behavioral function or improve training and performance. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that institutions supporting neuroscience research integrate ethical considerations early on and explicitly throughout a research endeavor. DARPA addressed the integration of ethical considerations into its work by requiring neuroscience research program managers to engage an independent Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications panel at the inception of an R&D project. DARPA is also planning to host a national ethics workshop. However, some critics assert that DARPA does not adequately examine the moral and ethical implications of the research it supports. See the box below, \"DARPA's Insect Allies Program: Some Scientists and Lawyers Express Concern,\" for an illustrative example. ", "According to a 2014 report by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) ", "knowledge regarding ethical, legal, and societal issues associated with R&D for technology intended for military purposes is not nearly as well developed as that for the sciences (especially the life sciences) in the civilian sector more generally. ", "In its 2014 report the NAS recommended the development and deployment of five specific processes to ensure the consideration of ELS issues in an agency's R&D portfolio. These include (1) initial screening of proposed R&D projects, (2) review of proposals that raise ELS concerns, (3) monitoring of R&D projects for the emergence of ELS issues and making midcourse corrections when necessary, (4) engaging with various segments of the pubic as needed, and (5) periodically reviewing the ELS-related processes in an agency. ", "According to DARPA officials, the agency has implemented a strategy\u2014informed by the 2014 NAS report\u2014for addressing ELS concerns early on (during the program formulation stage) and throughout the lifespan of a program. Additionally, according to DARPA, the Director conducted a review of the agency's ELS strategy and its implementation in partnership with the Biological Technologies Office and three external ELS experts in the summer of 2017. DARPA asserts that the implementation of the strategy has been effective, based in part on the \"positive feedback\" the agency has received from the ELS community. Congress may consider conducting oversight on the processes and mechanisms used by DARPA to integrate ethical, legal, and societal considerations into its R&D portfolio. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
