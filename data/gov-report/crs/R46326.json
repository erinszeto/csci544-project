The crisis counseling services are intended to assist disaster survivors \"to prevent or mitigate adverse psychological effects caused or aggravated by a major disaster.\" FEMA operates the CCP with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "An emergency declaration or a major disaster declaration may be amended to allow for additional types of IA to be authorized (see Table 1 for a list of IA programs). The governor may request that the declaration be amended to include additional types of assistance. FEMA can approve a request for additional forms of assistance after a presidential declaration. If a governor of an affected state requested types of IA be authorized in their major disaster declaration request, and those forms of IA were not authorized, the governor may appeal the decision in writing (if a request to amend a declaration to add types of IA is denied, that decision may also be appealed).

FEMA generally refers to PA Applicants as any entity that is responsible for PA-eligible work. Applicants may be state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, as well as eligible private nonprofits. For example, the Texas Department of State Health Services applied for PA funds for COVID-19 response as a PA Applicant. Those funds were administered by the state of Texas as the PA grant Recipient. As the PA Recipient, the state of Texas also administered funds through its PA award for state and local PA Applicants including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, Harris County, and the Texas Military Department. ", "To receive PA funds, Applicants may submit a request for grant funds, a project worksheet describing the details of the work and costs claimed, and supporting documentation though the PA Grants Portal. FEMA and the PA grant Recipient evaluate these documents for eligibility and reasonableness. Once a project worksheet is approved, Applicants may receive reimbursement for eligible costs incurred while executing eligible emergency protective measures. ", "FEMA's fact sheet on PA Simplified Application procedures for COVID-19 notes that expedited assistance may be available in certain cases. When expedited assistance is approved for large projects (in FY2020, projects over $131,100), FEMA obligates 50% of the total expected costs as soon as the project worksheet is approved, and the PA Applicant may be reimbursed at that time. The remaining federal share may be reimbursed once the Applicant submits documentation of actual costs incurred while performing eligible work.
