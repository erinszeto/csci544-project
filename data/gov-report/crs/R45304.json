In 1996, Congress authorized the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help public water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and to meet the act's health protection objectives. Under this program, states receive annual capitalization grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide financial assistance (primarily subsidized loans) to water systems for drinking water projects and related activities. Through FY2018, Congress has appropriated a total of $20.41 billion for the program. From FY1997 through FY2017, states provided $35.38 billion in DWSRF assistance to water systems for 14,090 projects.", "EPA's latest survey of capital improvement needs indicates that public water systems need to invest $472.6 billion on infrastructure improvements over 20 years to ensure the provision of safe drinking water. EPA reports that, while all of the projects identified in the survey would promote SDWA health protection objectives, $57.6 billion (12%) of reported needs are attributable to SDWA compliance. An American Water Works Association study estimates that restoring aging infrastructure and expanding water systems to keep up with population growth would require a nationwide investment of at least $1 trillion through 2035.", "Program issues include (1) the gap between estimated needs and funding; (2) the growing cost of complying with SDWA standards; (3) the ability of small or disadvantaged communities to afford DWSRF or other financing; and (4) the broader need for cities to maintain, upgrade, and expand infrastructure unrelated to SDWA compliance. Several overarching policy questions are under debate, including the appropriate federal role in providing financial assistance for local water infrastructure projects and potential funding mechanisms that could supplement or replace a program reliant on annual appropriations.", "Enacted in 2014, the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA; P.L. 113-121,Title V) authorized a five-year pilot loan guarantee program to promote increased development of, and private investment in, primarily large water infrastructure projects. Congress noted that WIFIA was intended to complement, not replace, the DWSRF program and the similar Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program for wastewater infrastructure. For FY2017, Congress provided $30.0 million for WIFIA ($25 million for EPA to provide loan guarantees for water infrastructure projects and $5 million for administrative costs).", "The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act; P.L. 114-322) made several revisions to the DWSRF program and authorized $100 million in DWSRF appropriations to Michigan to assist the City of Flint in repairing its water system.

The 2015 assessment did not specifically break out needs related to water system security improvements. In the 2011 survey, EPA estimated a 20-year need of $235.9 million for security-related projects. For that assessment, EPA concluded that security-related needs may be far greater, because many water systems incorporate these costs into the costs of broader construction projects rather than report them separately.", "The needs survey also breaks down the 20-year needs estimates according to system size and ownership. The 20-year drinking water infrastructure need for states (including Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) totaled $463.6 billion.

Within the total needs reported, $57.6 billion (12.2%) is directly attributable to regulatory costs, while $415.0 billion (87.8%) represents nonregulatory costs (e.g., replacing old distribution lines). (See Figure 2 .) Most regulatory funding needs typically involve the upgrade, replacement, or installation of treatment technologies. Most nonregulatory funding needs typically involve installing, upgrading, or replacing transmission and distribution infrastructure to allow a system to continue to deliver safe drinking water. Although these system problems often do not cause a violation of a specific drinking water standard, projects to correct infrastructure problems may be eligible for DWSRF funding if needed to address public health risks. ", "EPA noted that the total needs estimate may be conservative for several reasons: (1) systems are required to meet stringent documentation criteria when identifying needs; (2) many systems had not fully evaluated their security needs at the time of the assessment; (3) capital improvement plans often cover fewer than 10 years, while the survey tries to capture 20-year estimates; and (4) the survey is limited to eligible needs, thus excluding water infrastructure projects related to dams, raw water reservoirs, fire protection, operation and maintenance, and future growth.", "EPA also presents drinking water infrastructure needs by state, as shown in Figure 3 .

The DWSRF program includes competing objectives, and, thus, this competition is perhaps unavoidable. On the one hand, the fundamental purpose of the program is to capitalize revolving funds in the states in order to generate a sustainable source of funding for drinking water projects. On the other hand, Congress authorized multiple set-asides to fund other drinking water program priorities and requirements, such as system compliance-capacity assurance, operator certification, wellhead protection, and small system technical assistance. Overall, states may use as much as 31% of their grants for the set-asides and another 30% to provide additional loan subsidies to disadvantaged communities. ", "While these options offer states flexibility to tailor their programs to meet their particular needs, using funds for these activities could significantly erode the corpus of state funds and slow the rate at which they become capitalized. A concern for states is that, to the degree that Congress relies on the DWSRF to fund other SDWA requirements\u2014rather than providing separate appropriations\u2014the potential of the DWSRF program is diminished. Moreover, in recent appropriations acts, Congress has added several policy directives not present in the SDWA that may also affect the states' ability to grow or maintain their SRFs. These added provisions include specified additional subsidization requirements for disadvantaged systems, Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and Buy American (iron and steel) provisions. In FY2010 and subsequent appropriations acts, Congress has mandated that states use a certain portion (usually 20%) of their federal capitalization grants to provide additional subsidies to borrowers. EPA notes:", "This change allowed states to aid communities most in need and incentivize particular types of projects. Because this subsidy comes from the federal dollars, continued federal support is needed to maintain this benefit and continue growing the fund.", "A chronic issue concerns the need for communities to address drinking water infrastructure requirements outside the scope of the DWSRF program. Communities must typically address several categories of infrastructure requirements that are unrelated to SDWA compliance or public health and, thus, ineligible for DWSRF assistance. These categories include future growth, ongoing rehabilitation, and operation and maintenance of systems. EPA has reported that outdated and deteriorated drinking water infrastructure poses a fundamental long-term threat to drinking water safety and that, in many communities, basic infrastructure costs can far exceed SDWA compliance costs. As reported in EPA's most recent drinking water needs assessment, roughly 12% of the 20-year estimated need is directly related to compliance with SDWA regulations.", "A fundamental question has concerned the long-term federal role in water infrastructure financing. A subset of questions concerns how deficit reduction efforts might affect federal involvement\u2014for example, how deficit reduction objectives might impact proposals to develop a small system grant program or sustainable funding source, such as a water infrastructure trust fund. Other persistent water infrastructure issues include the gap between funding and estimated needs, the growing cost of complying with SDWA standards (particularly for small communities), the ability of small or disadvantaged communities to afford DWSRF financing, and the broader need for cities to maintain, upgrade, and expand infrastructure unrelated to SDWA compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Actions", "paragraphs": ["In the face of large needs, competition for limited federal resources, and debate over the federal role in funding water infrastructure, EPA, states, and communities and utilities have increasingly focused on alternative management and financing strategies to address costs and promote greater financial self-reliance among water systems.

Although state SRF financing authorities are currently eligible to receive WIFIA assistance, the SRF WIN bills would authorize EPA to provide secured loans at subsidized interest rates for eligible states. These states would include those that received less than 2% of the SRF funds in the most recent year or states in which the President declared a major disaster between 2017 and the enactment date. (These loans would be limited to wastewater or drinking water infrastructure damaged by the major disaster.) Funding for the subsidized loans would be capped. Unlike other WIFIA assistance, the federal assistance under this section would be able to support 100% of project costs, and application fees would be waived. The bills would authorize appropriations of $200 million for each fiscal year between FY2019 and FY2023.

Section 8 would direct EPA to establish a water infrastructure innovation grant program for the design and installation of drinking water and wastewater systems that use innovative materials to reduce total costs and extend the service life of installed structures. It would authorize to be appropriated for this program $65 million for each of FY2019 through FY2023. H.R. 6727 / S. 3012 , the Water Technology Acceleration Act, would authorize EPA to carry out a grant program to accelerate the development of innovative water technologies that address various pressing water issues. It would authorize states to provide additional subsidization under the DWSRF and CWSRF programs for projects using innovative technologies. S. 181 would require GAO to (1) publish a report identifying all federal public works and infrastructure programs and whether a domestic content preference requirement (e.g., iron, steel, and manufactured products) applied and (2) include a list of programs for which a listed preference requirement does not apply. Generally, once GAO issued the report, no federal funds or credit assistance could be made available under a program that lacks a domestic content preference for infrastructure projects unless all iron, steel, manufactured goods, and commodity construction materials used were produced in the United States. S. 880 , the Made in America Water Infrastructure Act, would expand and make permanent the SDWA provision requiring use of U.S.-manufactured iron and steel in projects receiving DWSRF assistance. The bill would apply American iron and steel requirements to maintenance projects (in addition to construction, alteration, and repair projects). S. 1137 , the Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act, includes a sense of Congress that appropriations for the DWSRF and CWSRF should be robust. The bill would increase DWSRF set-aside authority for state implementation of source water protection plans and would apply 40 U.S.C. Chapter 11 (the Brooks Act) to negotiation of DWSRF-assisted contracts for communities serving more than 10,000 individuals. The bill would also authorize EPA's WaterSense Program and authorize to be appropriated a total of $18 billion over five years for combined sewer overflow projects grants under CWA Section 221. (See also S. 2800 .) S. 2727 would direct EPA to establish a discretionary grant program for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects, including projects eligible under the CWSRF and DWSRF programs. S. 3121 would amend DWSRF and CWSRF provisions to require states to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that each procurement transaction for a project receiving SRF assistance is conducted in a manner that provides maximum open and free competition and that water systems consider use of all suitable materials for each solicitation of a procurement offer for a project.
