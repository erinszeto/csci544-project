Institutions are required to award FSEOG aid first to students with exceptional financial need, as determined according to the HEA need analysis provisions, with priority going to students receiving Pell Grants. Institutions may establish categories of students for purposes of packaging FSEOG awards. For example, \"categories may be based on class standing, enrollment status, program, date of application, or a combination of factors.\" Categorization of awards may not be used to arbitrarily deny FSEOG aid to students, for example by establishing a policy of awarding aid on a first-come, first-served basis.", "FSEOG aid consists of a federal share, not to exceed 75% (except if the Secretary determines that a larger share is necessary to further the purpose of the program), and a nonfederal share of at least 25%. The nonfederal share is required to be funded through the institution's resources, such as institutional grants and scholarships, tuition or fee waivers, state scholarships, and foundation or other charitable organization funds. The Department of Education (ED) has determined that all state scholarships and grants can be counted toward meeting the nonfederal share, except for any portion of those awards that may be attributable to federal funds.

The maximum FSEOG award amount per academic year is the lesser of the student's financial need or $4,000. In the case of a student studying abroad, and if the cost of studying abroad exceeds the cost of studying at the student's home institution, the FSEOG award may be increased to a maximum of $4,400. The minimum value of an FSEOG award is $100 per year. For students enrolled for less than a full academic year, the value of FSEOG awards must be proportionately reduced. Institutions are required to award a \"reasonable proportion\" of FSEOG aid to independent students and to those who are enrolled less than full-time, if the institution's allocation of FSEOG funds was based in part on the financial need of such students.

Institutions' base guarantees are adjusted to be proportional to the ratio of total funds available for the FSEOG program to the national total of institutions' base guarantees. This amount is called an institution's adjusted base guarantee.", "After allocating institutions their adjusted base guarantee, any remaining FSEOG funds are allocated to institutions proportionately according to their eligible amount of need that is greater than their adjusted base guarantee. An institution's eligible amount of need, or fair share, is calculated by subtracting the sum of aid provided under the Pell Grant program from the aggregate financial need of the institution's undergraduate students. Undergraduate student financial need is determined through a formula that takes into account the cost of attendance (COA) at the institution and the expected family contribution (EFC) of a representative sample of students. Institutions with a fair share amount of need that is greater than their FSEOG adjusted base guarantee are considered to have an excess eligible amount of need.
