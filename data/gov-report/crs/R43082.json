In a non-random survey of compounded drugs available over the Internet, about one-third (33%) failed analytic testing, mostly regarding potency or uniformity of dosage. In these surveys, the rates of analytic testing failures for compounded drugs were higher than those for commercially-available drugs, where only 2% of drugs failed analytic testing.

For example, the State of Missouri Board of Pharmacy initiated a testing program in 2003 for compounded drugs and each year tests a certain number of finished products. Over the course of the testing program, 15% - 25% of the CDs were found to have problems with drug potency, ranging from a sub-potent drug with 0%\u2014no active ingredient present\u2014to a super-potent drug with almost 400% of the prescribed dosage.

For example, a provision in the draft HELP legislation would create new authorities for FDA oversight of \"compounding manufacturers\" (i.e., non-traditional compounders) (see Table A-1 ).", "Some Members of Congress argue that new FDA authorities should await better implementation of existing authorities. For example, a House Committee on Energy and Commerce report questions whether a lack of enforcement by FDA and state authorities of certain vendors is an issue. The report cites safety violations at NECC in prior years, which do not appear to have been resolved despite FDA involvement. ", "Some in the compounding pharmacy industry believe that the current safety issues are isolated to certain vendors and that compounding, in general, is not unsafe. Some compounding associations have reservations about the FDA having new authorities; others support increased FDA oversight. Many acknowledge that compounded health care products have become more complex and health delivery more complicated. In a recent report, the Association of Health-System Pharmacists (AHSP) and American Hospital Association (AHA) noted that there was general support from stakeholders in these associations for (1) FDA oversight of certain non-traditional compounding pharmacies (e.g., providing a CD without a prescription and shipped over state lines); (2) improved communication between state and federal regulators; (3) a list of \"do-not-compound\" CDs; and (4) improved access to USP compounding monographs that provide guidance to compounders on making certain CDs.", "Appendix A.
