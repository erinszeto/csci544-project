It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled. Long-term cost projections are at best speculative, and should be viewed with attentive skepticism. Despite models' inability to predict the future, cases examined here do provide insights on the costs and benefits of S. 2191.", "First, the ultimate cost of S. 2191 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill. The potential for technology to reduce S. 2191's costs is not fully analyzed by any of the cases, nor can it be. Technology development is not sufficiently understood currently for models to replicate with confidence. Likewise, it is difficult to determine if available incentives are directed in an optimal manner. The cases suggest that S. 2191's Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) bonus allowances would encourage deployment of CCS, accelerating development by 5-10 years.", "Second, a considerable amount of low-carbon generating capacity will have to be built under S. 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement. How much capacity will be necessary depends on new and replacement capacity needs, along with consumer demand response to rising prices and incentives contained in S. 2191.", "Third, offsets could be a valuable tool not only to potentially reduce costs, but also to buy time to permit further development of new, more efficient technologies. Cost could be lowered further by greater availability of offsets and international credits and with a broader definition of eligible international credits.", "Fourth, the Carbon Market Efficiency Board could have an important effect on the cost of S. 2191 through its power to extend the availability of offsets and international credits. In this sense, the Board's powers could mesh with the previous insight about the potential effect of offsets on the bill's overall costs.", "Fifth, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply. The effects will depend on what fuels are included, the emissions reductions achieved by alternatives, and the ability to produce those alternatives.", "Finally, S. 2191's climate-related benefit is best considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort. The United States and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to take the lead in reducing GHGs when they ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This context raises two issues for S. 2191: (1) whether S. 2191's GHG program would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely, and (2) whether S. 2191's reductions meet U.S. commitments under the UNFCCC."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["As Congress continues the debate on an appropriate response to the climate change issue, multiple bills have been introduced to begin reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

On December 5, 2007, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ordered reported an amended version of the bill that would establish a mandatory cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from most sectors of the economy. As ordered reported, S. 2191 's emissions cap is estimated by its sponsors to require a 71% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from covered entities (estimated by the sponsors to account for 87% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions). Overall, the sponsors estimate that S. 2191 would reduce total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66% from 2005 levels by 2050.", "S. 2191 would establish an absolute cap on the emissions from covered sectors and would allow trading of emissions permits (\" allowances \") among covered and non-covered entities. The bill achieves its broad coverage through an upstream compliance mandate on petroleum, natural gas, and fluorinated gas producers and importers, and a downstream mandate on coal consumers, such as electric generators. Specifically, the bill would limit greenhouse gas emissions from all petroleum producers/importers, all natural gas processors, all facilities that use more than 5,000 tons of coal per year, and entities that produce or import more than 10,000 tons annually (carbon dioxide equivalent) of fluorinated gases and other greenhouse gases.", "S. 2191 does not have a \"safety valve\"\u2014an alternative compliance option that permits covered entities to pay an excess emissions fee instead of reducing emissions. Instead, the bill creates a Carbon Market Efficiency Board with authority to temporarily adjust the availability of allowances through borrowing and other techniques; however, it is a zero-sum game. Allowances borrowed must be repaid, so the emissions cap is maintained. The bill limits the availability of domestic offsets to 15% of the allowance requirement, with allowances bought in an eligible international allowance market also limited to 15%. Both percentages may be increased by the Carbon Market Efficiency Board if market conditions suggest such action. The bill would permit banking of allowances.", "For each year 2012 through 2050, the bill specifies the total number of allowances available, then explicitly states the percentage of those allowances that will go to covered and non-covered sectors, as well as the share that will be auctioned . (See Table 1 .) Over time, an increasing share of the allowances are auctioned, while the allowances to covered sectors decrease to zero. Auction proceeds are allocated for various purposes, including technology development and deployment, transition assistance, adaptation, and program administration. (See Table 2 .) Under a proposed amendment to make the bill revenue neutral, a percentage of allowances (starting at 6.1%, increasing to 15.99%) would be auctioned off-the-top for deficit reduction (\"Deficit Reduction Fund\"). After the Deficit Reduction allowances are allocated, the rest of the allowances (\"remainder allowances\") are allocated according to the bill as reported. For example, in 2012, 6.1% of the total number of allowances are auctioned for deficit reduction, and an additional 21.5% of the \"remainder allowances\" are auctioned for program management, technology deployment, adaptation, and other purposes.", "In addition to the cap-and-trade program, S. 2191 has other key provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "Title VI imposes an \"international reserve allowance\" requirement on certain \"covered\" imported goods as a prerequisite for entry into the country. Unlike importers of covered fuels that create greenhouse gases when used (which are directly controlled as covered facilities under S. 2191 ), Title VI would affect certain bulk goods manufactured in processes that generate greenhouse gases (e.g. iron, paper, etc.) that would not be allowed into the country if the allowance requirement were not met. The amount and allocation of international reserve allowances would be determined by EPA, and a separate allowance trading system could be established (international reserve allowances could not be used for domestic compliance). Title VIII on carbon sequestration requires: (1) EPA to amend regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act to allow commercial-scale underground injection of carbon dioxide for sequestration, and to monitor such activity to reduce adverse impacts from such injection; (2) the Department of the Interior to assess U.S. capacity for geological sequestration; (3) the Department of Energy to assess the feasibility of CO 2 pipelines; and (4) EPA to establish a task force to study the issues related to federal assumption of liability for sequestration sites. Title IX permits the President to temporarily adjust or waive any regulations promulgated under the bill if a \"national security emergency exists,\" and it is in the \"paramount interest of the United States\" to modify the requirements in response to that emergency. In addition to the limits under the cap-and-trade program, Title X requires EPA to establish a program limiting U.S. consumption of hydrofluorocarbons under a separate HFC allowance program. Title XI amends the Clean Air Act in three ways: (1) it requires EPA to establish a program to limit emissions of greenhouse gases not covered under the program; (2) it limits the sale and use of certain motor vehicle air conditioning fluids; and (3) it establishes a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) requiring per-unit-energy reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Earlier Versions of the Bill", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bill as Introduced", "paragraphs": ["S. 2191 (originally titled America's Climate Security Act of 2007), as introduced October 18, 2007, by Senator Lieberman, would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation, industrial, and transportation sectors (for facilities that emit more than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent).

The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events (such as electric utility deregulation) loom as critical issues which can not be modeled. Hence, cost projections beyond the year 2000 are at best speculative, and are more a function of each model ' s assumptions and structure than they are of the details of proposed legislation . Projections this far into the future are based more on philosophy than analysis. [emphasis in original]", "The history of resulting SO 2 cap-and-trade program costs has proven illuminating. As indicated in Table 3 , the 2010 cost estimates for the SO 2 cap-and-trade program made in 1990 proved to be substantially higher than what is now estimated to be the program's actual costs. Indeed, the EPA-ICF low estimate\u2014the estimate closest to the projected actual number\u2014is both 50% higher than the actual number, and the estimate least focused-on in the original ICF report. It is interesting that none of the analyses were willing to \"speculate\" with assumptions that would have created a 2010 cost estimate lower than EPA's current projection.", "Equally interesting is that the \"best\" 2000 estimate was off by almost the same 50% that the 2010 estimate was. Like the 2010 estimates, the assumptions either underestimated the ingenuity and creativity of companies in responding to the SO 2 requirements, or mis-read the economics of the cap-and-trade process. As explained below by Chestnut and Mills in 2005, the gross over-estimates are essentially the product of the models' failure both to fully incorporate the flexibility that the cap-and-trade program provided participants and to employ sufficient imagination to explore the potential for technological breakthroughs and enhancements:", "Costs are lower than originally predicted primarily because flexibility occurred in areas that were thought to be inflexible and technical improvements were made that were not anticipated. Factors contributing to the lower costs included lower transportation costs for low-sulfur coal (attributed to railroad deregulation), productivity increases in coal production leading to favorable prices for low-sulfur and mid-sulfur coal, cheaper than expected installation and operation costs for smokestack scrubbers, and new boiler adaptations to allow use of different types of coal. It appears that Title IV has worked as expected to provide the flexibility and incentives for producers to find low-cost compliance options. [footnote omitted] Banking opportunities also induced early reductions in emissions for some facilities. Harrington et al (2000) compared estimates of actual costs of many large regulatory programs to predictions of those costs made while the regulatory programs were being developed and found a tendency for predicted costs to overstate the actual implementation costs, especially for market-based programs such as the SO 2 trading program. They cite technological innovation and unanticipated efficiency gains as key factors leading to lower than predicted costs. They noted that unit costs are often more accurately predicted than total costs because predicted emission reductions are sometimes overstated, but they report that predicted unit costs and total costs were both overstated for Title IV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Illustrative Example from Analyses of S. 2191", "paragraphs": ["There is no reason to believe that cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions will be any more accurate than the 1990 SO 2 estimates; indeed, they are likely to be more unreliable. This is not to say that they will be too high; they may be too low. To illustrate, CRS examines some results of the modeling efforts with respect to the costs of S. 2191 . To frame this illustration, we focus on the three primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions: (1) population growth, (2) incomes (measured as per capita gross domestic product [GDP]), and (3) intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities (measured as metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per million dollars of GDP). As shown in the following formula, a country's annual greenhouse gas emissions are the product of these three drivers:", "( Population ) x ( Per Capita GDP ) x ( Intensity ghg ) = Emissions ghg", "This is the relationship for a given point in time; over time, any effort to change emissions alters the exponential rates of change of these variables. This means that the rates of change of the three left-hand variables, measured in percentage of annual change, sum to the rate of change of the right-hand variable, emissions.", "Using the three drivers, Table 4 provides the essential assumptions from three analyses of S. 2191 for the year 2050. Examining the \"business-as-usual\" reference cases, a range of assumptions are employed by the models. As suggested by the formula above, the differing assumptions result in very different 2050 baseline GHG emissions: 10.3 billion metric tons for EPA/ADAGE-REF, 11.1 billion metric tons for EPA/IGEM-REF, and 13.3 billion metric tons for MIT/EPPA\u2014a 29% difference from the lowest to the highest. Interestingly, major sources of disagreement in the reference cases include per capita GDP and population projections\u2014two variables that are generally not the focus of greenhouse gas reduction strategies.", "Moving to the S. 2191 scenario as modeled, the variability in the results widens for two of the three drivers (the 2050 reference case population remains constant in the three models). Not surprisingly, the range widens for the projected 2050 greenhouse gas emissions estimates: 5.3 billion metric tons for EPA/ADAGE-REF, 4.1 billion metric tons EPA/IGEM-REF, and 3.8 billion metric tons for MIT/EPPA\u2014a 40% difference. In particular, the models' assumptions about the flexibility and responsiveness of the U.S. economy resulted in some interesting reversals: (1) The MIT/EPPA model, which has the closest relationship between GHGs and GDP in the reference case, has the most responsive assumptions resulting in the greatest reduction in GHG and GHG intensity under S. 2191 ; (2) In contrast, the EPA/ADAGE-REF model, which has the lowest GHG intensity assumption in its reference cases, has the highest GHG intensity result under S. 2191 .", "The MIT/EPPA model assumes more economic growth per capita and more responsiveness by the economy to GHG constraints; the EPA/ADAGE model assumes the most GHG-efficient economy, but the least amount of flexibility to respond to GHG constraints; and the EPA/IGEM model assumes the fastest growth in population.", "The result of these different views of the economy is that the economic impact is less than the differences in the models' reference case assumptions. As indicated in Table 4 , the MIT/EPPA model projection of the country's 2050 GDP per capita under S. 2191 is greater than the basecase projections of either of the other models. According to the MIT/EPPA model, the 2050 GDP per capita of the country is reduced by only 0.75% under S. 2191 . The reduction under the other two models is 6.9% for EPA/IGEM-REF and 2.4% for EPA/ADAGE-REF\u2014well within the variability of the reference cases.", "The result is not significantly more consistent for projections for 2030, particularly with the addition of the EIA baselines. The CATF/NEMS analysis uses the EIA baseline published in its Annual Energy Outlook 2007 for its analysis. The EIA/NEMS analysis uses a preliminary version of EIA's upcoming 2008 AEO baseline. As indicated in Table 5 , the basecase assumptions for per capita GDP vary by a greater percentage for 2030 than they do for 2050. The introduction of the EIA 2008 baseline is responsible for much of the increase in GDP per capita variability (it would be 7% without it). Similarly, the inclusion of the 2007 and 2008 EIA baseline increases the variability of the greenhouse gas intensity driver (it would be 9% without it). Likewise, the GDP per capita impact of S. 2191 is within the noise of the reference cases as the estimated GDP per capita reduction under S. 2191 is only 0.3% for EIA/NEMS, 0.37% for EPPA, 0.90% for ADAGE, and 3.8% for IGEM.", "The situation is more constant in the 2020 reference cases, although the impact of S. 2191 is still within the noise of the per capita GDP assumptions, with S. 2191 GDP per capita impact estimated at 0.3% for EIA/NEMS, 0.69% for EPA/ADAGE-REF, 0.78% for MIT/EPPA, and 2.6% for EPA/IGEM-REF.", "The uncertainty about the future direction of the basic drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and the economy ' s responsiveness (economically, technologically, and behaviorally) illustrate the inability of models to predict the ultimate macroeconomic costs of reducing greenhouse gases. Policy relevant analysis is analysis that provides insight into the features and design of proposals that increase or reduce compliance cost and under what economic, technological, and behavior conditions, and that identify potential intended and unintended consequences on the economy.

In its analysis of S. 2191 , EPA presents eight pages of bullets identifying various limitations on its modeling exercise and four pages of additional \"qualitative\" considerations.

Conceptually, a CO 2 tradeable permit program could work similarly to the SO 2 program. However, significant differences exist between acid rain and possible global warming that affect current abilities to model responses. For example, the acid rain program involves up to 3,000 new and existing electric generating units that contribute two-thirds of the country's SO 2 . This concentration of sources makes the logistics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable. The imposition of the allowance requirement is straightforward. The acid rain program is a \"downstream\" program focused on the electric utility industry. The allowance requirement is imposed at the point of SO 2 emissions so the participant has a clear price signal to respond to. The basic dynamic of the program is simple, although not necessarily predictable.", "A comprehensive greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program would not be as straightforward to implement. Greenhouse gas emissions sources are not concentrated. Although over 80% of the greenhouse gases generated comes from fossil fuel combustion, only about 33% comes from electricity generation. Transportation accounts for about 26%, direct residential and commercial use about 8%, agriculture about 6%, and direct industrial use about 16%. Thus, small dispersed sources in transportation, residential/commercial, agriculture, and the industrial sectors are far more important in controlling greenhouse gas emissions than they are in controlling SO 2 emissions. This greatly increases the economic sectors and individual entities that may be required to reduce emissions.", "It also affects the operation of a cap-and-trade program, as the diversity of sources creates significant administrative and enforcement problems for a tradeable permit program if it is meant to be comprehensive. A downstream approach is impractical for a comprehensive greenhouse gas program where the transportation sector and dispersed residential, commercial, and agricultural sources emit almost half the total emissions. One alternative is to move the imposition point more \"upstream\" in those sectors, as is done by S. 2191 . This complicates the economics of the program as the price signal has to work its way through multiple paths to the particular entities\u2014utilities, consumers, industry\u2014that are the ultimate sources of the greenhouse gases. Arguably, the primary purpose of an economic mechanism, such as a cap-and-trade program, is to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of a comprehensive cap-and-trade program, the impact of that price signal will not be simple or straightforward, with unintended consequences likely.

Offsets (emission reductions made by entities not directly covered by the program) are not a major component of the SO 2 program. Uncovered industrial entities that want to participate in the program must become covered entities with their own baselines and monitoring equipment. The bill also sets up a small reserve of allowances to reward reductions through conservation and renewable energy efforts. With the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade system being limited to the United States, there is no international trading in the acid rain program.", "In contrast, most GHG cap-and-trade proposals expand the supply of available allowances by permitting offsets from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural practices, forestry projects, sequestration activities, and alternative energy projects. These diverse sources multiply as the trading extends globally and as other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases are included in the supply mix. Finally, the interaction of these various supply sources and the demand of other countries also reducing emissions (or who may decide to reduce in the future) provide for an almost infinite number of possible scenarios.

The effectiveness of these initiatives and price signals would be pivotal to the ultimate cost of any reduction strategy, particularly in the long term.

The possibility for regulation through existing Clean Air Act authority was recently outlined by EPA in congressional testimony.", "The key to such regulation is that the EPA Administrator issue appropriate findings on whether greenhouse gases \"contribute to air pollution that is reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" It is difficult, bordering on impossible, to determine where such a finding would lead. The Administrator has substantial discretion in defining what emission limits should\u00a0be set once he or she makes such a finding, and what sections of the act he or she might use.

If coal-fired plants were their own category or a technological approach were taken, the best technology could be carbon capture and storage (CCS).

There are two components of macro-economic cost measures: (1) the direct abatement (or compliance) cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program, and (2) the general equilibrium effects of a greenhouse gas reduction program (i.e., the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy).", "The most common measure presented is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a nation's borders. Although it is commonly used as a measure of quality of life, this application is problematic. Generally, it includes only those items for which there is a value defined in a market, and does not take into account some activities that have economic value, but no market valuation (e.g., leisure time, environmental quality, etc.). GDP is intended to be a measure of economic activity, not quality of life.", "A second measure sometimes presented is consumption effects (sometimes called welfare effects). Unfortunately, the models do not measure consumption or welfare effects in a consistent fashion (the primary advantage of measuring GDP). For example, the MIT/EPPA analysis presents \"welfare effects\" in terms of changes in aggregate market consumption plus leisure. Measured as \"equivalent variation,\" the change in welfare represents the amount of income needed to compensate for the change. In contrast, the EIA/NEMS model presents \"real consumption impacts\" in terms of consumer expenditures. This makes comparisons difficult and lessens the utility of the measure. For example, when analyzing proposed legislation, the \"welfare effects\" of legislation under the MIT/EPPA are usually less than the GDP effects, while the \"real consumption impacts\" under EIA/NEMS are usually greater than the GDP effects on a percentage basis. In addition, like GDP, none of the definitions of consumption or welfare currently employed quantify any environmental effects.", "A third measure generally presented is allowance prices. These generally reflect to some degree the aggregate marginal cost of the program as estimated by the models. Marginal cost is the cost of reducing the last ton (and, therefore, the most expensive) of greenhouse gases required by the program at a specific point in time. Marginal costs are very useful to affected entities in choosing what reduction strategy would be the most cost-effective in achieving their assigned reduction requirement. They are not an average cost and therefore cannot be simply multiplied by the greenhouse gases reduced to estimate total compliance cost. They also need to be put into the context of the overall reduction achieved at the given point and time being examined.", "However, allowance prices in most analyses are actually different from marginal costs because of program provisions, such as banking. Banking activity reflects the assumed foresight of affected entities to the likelihood of increasing allowance prices (in real terms) as the cap tightens. As indicated by the experience with the SO 2 program, entities will bank substantial allowances early and use them later as the program's requirements tighten. This results in allowance prices being higher than marginal costs in the early years of the program, and lower in later years. For example, the NMA/CRA International analysis of S. 2191 has a 2050 allowance price of about $352 under \"no banking\" assumptions, but an allowance price of about $195 with banking. In contrast, 2015 allowance prices are estimated at $51 for the \"banking\" scenario, but only $38 under the no banking scenario. This ability to time-shift reduction requirements and compliance costs means that allowance price projections reflect the assumed foresight of affected entities as much as they do actual marginal costs.", "In presenting cost measures, most analyses over-emphasize aggregate welfare indicators, such as GDP. As illustrated above, aggregate, macroeconomic cost results for S. 2191 fall into the noise of uncertainty about future conditions. In addition, aggregate macroeconomic measures reduce the transparency of the analyses' compliance strategies, and as a result, make them easier to dismiss. For example, Figure 1 below shows a 1997 scatter-plot by World Resources Institute (WRI) of 162 predicted impacts estimates from 16 different economic models of the U.S. economy as a result of a CO 2 abatement program. As indicated, the vast majority of estimates fall with a range of 0%-4% of GDP, regardless of the reduction requirement. Over-emphasis on GDP or other aggregate cost measures can obscure fundamental technological, economic, or behavioral insights the analyses may have in helping policymakers craft legislation. Instead, the analysis becomes a \" black box \" exercise with little enlightenment function.", "This \"fog\" is inherent when analysts choose to include the general equilibrium effects of a program in their cost measure\u2014a fog that can limit the explanatory value of the analysis. While supporting use of aggregate welfare cost measures, MIT notes:", "GE [general equilibrium] effects can stem from interactions with pre-existing distortions (e.g., taxes), from externally induced terms-of-trade effects, from the fact that the domestic policy itself creates terms-of-trade effects, and from other rigidities in the economy. Many aspects of model structure produce GE effects that are not easy to separately measure because of the inherent interactions in the economy.", "Generally, the cases examined here have not chosen to separate the two components of macro-economic cost measures: (1) the direct abatement (or compliance) cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program, and (2) the general equilibrium effects of a greenhouse gas reduction program (i.e., the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy). The availability of compliance cost estimates would allow policymakers to put current greenhouse gas reduction proposals in the context of other environmental initiatives\u2014be they acid rain or toxic air pollutants\u2014and, indeed, to the overall environmental agenda, and greatly increase the transparency of the analyses' insights. It would also help relieve confusion between compliance costs, average costs (per ton reduced), and the other commonly presented costs, such as allowance prices. It is argued that an aggregate macroeconomic cost measure provides a more complete view of the economic impact of proposed legislation, and helps identity potential unintended economic effects of compliance strategies. This may be true, particularly if, for example, auction revenues are being recycled via a reformed tax code. However, as indicated here, aggregated macroeconomic cost measures, such as GDP, can also be interpreted to merely show that the United States has a massive economy that can absorb substantial shocks with limited long-term effect."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Three Perspectives: Getting Out of the Noise", "paragraphs": ["Breaking through the fog of analyses and cost indicators, cost estimates to reduce CO 2 emissions vary greatly and focus attention on an estimator's basic beliefs about the problem and the future, in addition to simple, technical differences in economic assumptions. In a previous report, CRS\u00a0identified three \"lenses\" through which people can view the global climate change issues, and their influence on cost analysis. These are summarized in Table 6 . None of these perspectives is inherently more \"right\" or \"correct\" than another; rather, they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with one another. People generally hold to each of the lenses to some degree.", "However, different combinations of these perspectives lead to very different cost estimates. A classic example of this is the contrast between the S. 2191 results obtained by the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) and the American Council for Capital Formation/National Association of Manufacturers (ACCF/NAM) using the same model: EIA's NEMS model. Table 7 summarizes the general approach of the two analyses according to the three perspectives identified above. In its analysis, CATF expresses confidence in S. 2191 's various technology and efficiency provisions and models the bill assuming EIA's Best Available Technology (BAT) case, banking, and offsets. In contrast, ACCF/NAM states that it is \"unlikely\" that technology, new energy sources, and market mechanisms (e.g., carbon offsets, banking) will be sufficiently available to achieve S. 2191 's emission targets. Accordingly, ACCF/NAM's assumptions differ substantially from CATF's and other studies by excluding banking, significantly capping the availability of various technologies, and assuming higher construction costs.", "As indicated by Table 8 , the widely different cost assumptions provided the expected results, although all three analyses remained in the 0-4% GDP range common for greenhouse gas reduction analysis. Allowance price estimates are widely different, but this cost measure tends to exaggerate differences between results and should not be confused with average costs or program costs. This is particularly true in this case, as ACCF/NAM did not publish its environmental results in terms of greenhouse gases reduced; thus, one can not compare the allowance price with what is being reduced over time. Unfortunately, the analyses do not present sufficient sensitivity analysis and other information to determine whether it is the economic assumptions (e.g., banking and offset availability), the behavioral assumptions (e.g., BAT), the technology assumptions (e.g., availability), or just the higher cost assumptions of the ACCF/NAM analysis that explains the difference in allowance prices.", "Some attempts have been made to sort out the importance of various assumptions in analyzing the costs of greenhouse gas reduction proposals, beginning with Repetto and Austin's effort for the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 1997, with more recent efforts by Barker, Qureshi and Kohler in 2006 and Barker and Jenkins in 2007. Indeed, Dr. Repetto has set up a website where people may answer seven key questions about the cost and benefit assumptions they feel are most reasonable and find out how their choices would affect GDP. Through meta-analysis of the results from multiple independent studies, the role of various assumptions and methodologies are quantified. In general, these studies found seven underlying assumptions affecting results: (1) the efficiency of the economic response; (2) availability of non-carbon technology; (3) availability of the Kyoto mechanisms; (4) method of revenue recycling; (5) method of incorporating technological advancements; (6) inclusion of non-climate-related environmental benefits; and (7) inclusion of climate-related benefits.

For example, the assumption about the relationship between leisure and consumption in IGEM is quite different from the other models. Essentially, as prices for goods and services increase, IGEM assumes a highly responsive relationship, with people deciding to work less and buy less. As a result, a small increase in prices will produce a relatively large loss of consumption, resulting in a larger impact on GDP and other cost measures. In contrast, other models are less responsive, assuming people will absorb higher prices without changing their work or consumption habits very much. Other factors influencing IGEM's results include (1) a somewhat higher emissions baseline, (2) the lack of some less carbon-emitting technological alternatives, such as carbon capture and storage, (3) a U.S.-only context that affects the model's estimates of exports, and (4) elasticities that are calibrated based on historical data.", "The only year for which GDP per capita estimates were presented for all cases is 2030.

The general lack of detailed technology descriptions in the CGE models does not help in this regard. For example, the EPA/IGEM's presentation of the energy sector and technology options is too aggregated to be analyzed in terms of technology development under S. 2191 .", "Current Technologies . Several currently available technologies emit less greenhouse gases (or none) compared to a conventional coal-fired facility. Those technologies include electric generation from wind, biomass, landfill gas, nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas. Some of these sources, such as biomass and natural gas, have some repowering potential with respect to coal-fired generation.", "The models do not provide much insight on the likely mix of these technologies under S. 2191 .

Because the ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases heavily constrain the availability of most alternatives to natural-gas generation, it is not surprising that a substantial amount of natural gas capacity is assumed to be built under these cases during this time period. This result is confirmed by sensitivity analysis conducted by EIA that shows a movement to natural gas if the availability of nuclear power, renewable power, and coal with CCS are constrained. In contrast, the EPA/IPM, CATF/NEMS, and two EPA/ADAGE cases indicate little or no new construction of natural gas.

Likewise, requiring each motorist to submit allowances for his or her fossil fuel use would greatly increase the administrative costs of an emission reduction program.", "Therefore, any regulation of transportation, especially motor vehicles, would likely occur upstream of the emitting source, as is the case with S. 2191 . Emissions reductions from transportation generally must come in one of three ways: (1) reduce fuel consumption through more efficient vehicles or through reduction in vehicle-miles traveled (e.g., mass transit, carpooling, etc.); (2) reduce the carbon content of transportation fuels through the blending of lower-carbon fuels in conventional fuels; (3) switch from conventional fuels to alternatives with lower lifecycle emissions. Current federal policy attempts to address numbers 1 and 2. The federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, as amended by EISA, require increasing fuel economy for new passenger cars and light trucks. The renewable fuel standard (RFS), also amended by EISA, requires an increasing amount of renewable transportation fuel, and that an increasing share of that fuel have lower greenhouse gas emissions. Both of these programs should help reduce the number of allowances needed by the petroleum industry by reducing the amount of fuel consumed, and the carbon content of the fuel supplied.", "The cap-and-trade restrictions on petroleum would most likely be felt by transportation users through higher prices.

Simply put, the more fuels included in the program, and the greater the volume that must be displaced, the more stringent the standard becomes. This is especially true for aviation fuel since there are currently few or no options to reduce jet fuel lifecycle greenhouse gases.

To meet a 10% reduction requirement, 24 billion gallons of zero-carbon fuel would be needed, assuming equivalent energy content per gallon. However, many low-carbon fuels have less energy per gallon than petroleum fuels, and all have some associated carbon emissions. If cellulosic ethanol is found to have a 90% reduction in lifecycle emissions, and the fuel has 2/3 the energy content of gasoline, then roughly 40 billion gallons would be required. This is considerably more than the existing RFS mandate of 30 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the same year. If, however, only motor gasoline and diesel fuel are considered, then the total volume is reduced to 13.47 million barrels per day, or 206 billion gallons annually.

NMA/CRA did not disclose the discount rate used in making this estimate.", "Not surprisingly, the estimates illustrated here have been criticized by some (including the UK Parliament) for being too low and incomplete. Likewise, others have criticized the estimates as too large and inflated. For example, in its recent assessment of new average fuel economy standards, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) chose to value carbon reductions at $7 a ton and employ a 7% discount rate. Applied to the reduction estimated under S. 2191 , the resulting NPV would be about one order of magnitude lower than the UK shadow price-based estimates. Thus, reminiscent of EPA's illustrative calculation of the health benefits of a 1-hour sulfur dioxide standard, the illustration here results in a range of climate-related benefits from reducing greenhouse gases under S. 2191 at between zero and $200-$260 billion annually (2005$).", "As illustrated with the long-term cost estimates presented in this report, attempts to monetize climate-related benefits currently reflect much about the philosophies and assumptions of the people doing the estimating. As stated in The Stern Review : \"It is very important ... to stress that such estimates [NPV of climate change policy benefits] reflect a large number of underlying assumptions, many of which are very tentative or specific to the ethical perspectives adopted.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Putting Emission Reductions under S. 2191 into Context", "paragraphs": ["It is difficult to put the actions of one country's emissions reduction plan in the context of a fragmented global effort to address climate change. One useful perspective is provided by MIT's general study of cap and trade bills. Using the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), MIT explored the climate response to different stabilization goals being discussed in the international community. It developed parameterizations of IGSM that represented each of three major atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AO GCMs) that would help illustrate the uncertainty in translating emission trends into an estimate of climate change: those of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (CISS-SB), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL-2.1), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (CCSM3).", "MIT simulated the climate effects of six different policy scenarios through 2100. Four of these are of interest in exploring S. 2191 : (1) a reference scenario that assumes no specific global climate policy ( Reference ); (2) a global participation scenario ( Global Participation, 203 bmt case ), (3) a global participation scenario where abatement efforts in developing countries are delayed until 2050 ( Developing Countries Delayed ); and (4) a partial participation scenario where no abatement efforts occur in developing countries ( Developed Only ). Under scenarios 2, 3, and 4, developed countries (including the United States) are assumed to have reduced emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 (and held them there through 2100). This assumption is in the ballpark of U.S. reductions anticipated under S. 2191 . For developing countries, scenario 2 assumes their emissions reductions begin in 2025, with emissions returning to their 2015 levels, and with additional reductions beginning in 2035 with emissions returning to their 2000 levels, and are held there; scenario 3 assumes emissions reductions are delayed until 2050, at which point they return to 2000 levels; and scenario 4 assumes developing country emissions are not stabilized at all.", "The climate effects of these scenarios as simulated by MIT IGSM replication of the three AO GCMs identified above is shown in Figure 11 . As indicated by the red line, the impact of S. 2191 , combined with that of the other developed countries (all of which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol), is to reduce by 0.5 degrees C the projected 3.5 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C increase in global mean temperatures suggested by the simulations. If the United States chose not to reduce, the impact would be to move the red, green, and blue lines closer to the reference case line. With respect to the red line, it should be noted that, in 2000, the United States' greenhouse gas emissions were about 40% of the developed world's total emissions. In terms of the effect of any U.S. reductions on global mean temperatures, that is about all that can be said in isolation. As noted by MIT:", "...it is not possible to connect specific U.S. policy targets with a particular global concentration or temperature target, and therefore the avoided damages, because any climate gains depend on efforts in the rest of the world.... If a cooperative solution is at all possible, therefore, a major strategic consideration in setting U.S. policy targets should be their value in leading other major countries to take on similar efforts.", "Instead, S. 2191 's climate-related environmental benefit must be considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort. It is in this context that the United States and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This global context raises two issues for S. 2191 : (1) whether S. 2191 ' s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely, and (2) whether S. 2191 ' s reductions meet U.S. commitments to stabilization under the UNFCCC and occur in a timely fashion so that global stabilization may occur at an acceptable level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Non-Climate Change Air Quality Benefits", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, only the EPA/IPM study included any estimates of emission reductions from non-greenhouse gas air pollutants. Only two pollutants were analyzed, and the resulting estimates reflect short-term interactions between S. 2191 and existing cap and trade programs. However, it should be noted that values have been assigned to these pollutants from time to time. For example, in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the new average fuel economy standard, the Department of Transportation assigned emission damage costs of $3,900 a short ton for nitrogen oxides, $16,000 a short ton for sulfur dioxide, and $164,000 a short ton for particulate matter\u2014all pollutants that are also emitted from coal-fired generating facilities. This is an incomplete set of pollutants that would be reduced by S. 2191 . Other benefits may occur from reductions of pollutants such as mercury and carbon monoxide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact on Behavior", "paragraphs": ["The impact of any price increases from S. 2191 on households, industries, and businesses would depend on their responsiveness to the price signal, the distribution of safety net funds under S. 2191 , and the impact of various other provisions of the bill that encourage, or could be used to encourage, conservation and new technology development. Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state \"should be viewed with attentive skepticism\" for at least two reasons. First, baseline forecasts are even less accurate at a sector level than they are at an aggregate national level. As noted by Winebrake and Sakva, sector level baseline forecasts have significantly higher errors compared with aggregate estimates, nor have sector estimates improved over the past two decades:", "We find that low errors for total energy consumption are concealing much larger sectoral errors that cancel each other out when aggregated. For example, 5-year forecasts made between 1982 and 1998 demonstrate a mean percentage error for total energy consumption of 0.1%. Yet, this hides the fact that the industrial sector was overestimated by an average of\u00a05.9%, and the transportation sector was underestimated by an average of 4.5% We also find no evidence that forecasts within each sector have improved over the two decades studied here.", "Second, particularly with respect to industry, the effect of S. 2191 is likely to be very site-specific, particularly as the primary impact will be indirect in terms of added energy costs, not direct compliance costs. An industry-by-industry approach masks the interplay of companies that would be affected differently by S. 2191 .", "Most industries face a competitive market (sometimes international in scope) both in terms of producers of the same products and producers of substitute products. Also, in some cases, an industry may face a fairly elastic demand for its product. Thus, most industries are price sensitive, and therefore any increase in manufacturing costs hurts the competitiveness of a firm. This complex situation is further complicated for energy-intensive industries in the case of S. 2191 as competitors within the same industry may experience different energy price increases (particularly for electric power), depending on their individual energy needs and power arrangements. Thus individual facilities within the same industry will be affected differently by S. 2191 and other unforeseen events in the future. For example, an aluminum plant receiving power from a hydro-electric facility may not be affected the same way as a similar plant with a power contract with a coal-fired power supplier.", "This differential effect on individual companies under S. 2191 could have several potential impacts. First, as noted above, it may affect the competitive balance of specific facilities in the United States. Second, investment decisions by industries could be affected, particularly with respect to technology. New, more efficient technology is emerging for some processes. The combination of current price signals being sent from the energy markets and potential ones from S. 2191 could speed their development. If commercialized, new technology would reduce the impact of S. 2191 and, indeed, improve competitiveness. Not surprisingly, none of the cases presented here have sufficient industry sector detail to examine this possibility, nor did any attempt to develop proxies to explore the possibilities for industrial technology over the next 40 years.", "S. 2191 attempts to ameliorate these effects somewhat by providing a subsidy for such industries facing international competitiveness issues. The degree to which the subsidy could address the issue was not examined by any of the cases presented here. Likewise, the sufficiency of the funds was not examined. Interestingly, such an approach to exposed industry has some parallels to recommendations that have been made with respect to carbon intensive industries in Europe facing reduction requirements and increased fuel cost from the EU's Kyoto Protocol, and post-Kyoto commitments. For example, one such recommendation by the UK Carbon Trust suggested the following:", "For a very small number of carbon-intensive, internationally exposed activities headed by steel and cement production, governments should establish a transitional 'compensating rate of free allocation' on an activity-specific basis, based upon the likely degree of cost pass-through given international trade conditions. The scale of free allocation to electricity-intensive activities in the EU-ETS (notably pulp and paper) should also take account of their electricity consumption, whilst manufacturing of fertilisers and basic chemicals might benefit from being brought into the EU-ETS on a similar basis. Together with aluminium smelting these constitute four trade-exposed electricity-intensive activities for which additional measures, linked to redistribution of auction revenues or equivalent 'downstream' allocation of electricity-related allowances, could be considered.... However, focused measures to facilitate direct, long-term investment in low carbon electricity generation may offer the best long-term solution.", "For households, the interplay of price signals, conservation, and regulations is difficult to separate in the CGE models, such as ADAGE, IGEM, and EPPA. NEMS does break down the residential sector into both residential energy consumption and residential prices by fuel. However, any estimates from such a breakdown can only be considered illustrative at best. For example, the CATF/NEMS analysis illustrates that if S. 2191 results in only a moderate increase in electricity and natural gas prices, then households could, on average, respond with sufficient conservation and efficiency improvements to overcome the projected price increases and reduce their monthly bill compared with business as usual levels. If allowance prices are higher, this become more difficult. An effort by Keohane and Goldmark to estimate the monthly increase in residential electric bills based on MIT/EPPA's higher allowance prices resulted in a 6% increase in those bills in 2030. Impacts on residential monthly natural gas bills would follow a similar pattern. The CATF/NEMS analysis indicates that an aggressive demand response by consumers almost eliminates the projected modest increase in natural gas prices. In contrast, Keohane and Goldmark calculations based on the higher allowance prices of the MIT/EPPA analysis result in a 14% increase in monthly natural gas bills in 2030.", "As with the energy-intensive industries discussed above, S. 2191 attempts to ameliorate the impact of projected energy price increases for low- and middle-income households by providing funds for states to provide electricity and natural gas impact assistance. The EIA/NEMS analysis breaks out the estimated impact of the electricity impact assistance funds in its calculation of household impacts. Assuming the value of the allowances allocated would be passed on to all consumers\u2014not just low-income\u2014EIA/NEMS estimates the reduction at one-half cent per kilowatthour (KWH) or about a 5% reduction in rates. If the money were directed toward low-income consumers, the impact would be greater. Including the effects of the impact assistance, EIA/NEMS estimates the average monthly household energy bill (excluding transportation) under S. 2191 would increase about $3 a month in 2020, rising to about $6 a month in 2030.", "Overall, EIA/NEMS estimates that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for energy in 2030 would be 18% higher for residential consumers and 29% higher for industrial consumers than basecase levels. To put these potential increased costs into context, EIA/NEMS compared its estimated incremental consumer and industrial energy prices increases under S. 2191 with those of the past 5 years. As indicated in Figure 12 and stated by EIA/NEMS, \"if measured from 2008 energy prices, it takes 22 years in the S. 2191 Core Case to reach the same percentage change that current energy prices have increased from 2003 to 2008.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This report examines six studies that project the costs of S. 2191 to 2030 or 2050. It is difficult (and some would consider it unwise) to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events (such as technological breakthroughs) loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled. Hence, long-term cost projections are at best speculative, and should be viewed with attentive skepticism . In the words of the late Dr. Lincoln Moses, the first Administrator of the Energy Information Administration: \"There are no facts about the future.\"", "Models cannot predict the future, but they can indicate the sensitivity of a program's provisions to varying economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymakers in designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of S. 2191 and its many provisions.", "First, if enacted, the ultimate cost of S. 2191 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill. The bill provides numerous price, research and development, deployment, and regulatory incentives for technology innovation. The potential for new technology to reduce the costs of S. 2191 is not fully analyzed by any of the cases examined, nor can it be. The process of technology development and dissemination is not sufficiently understood at the current time for models to replicate with any long-term confidence. In the same vein, it is difficult to determine whether the various incentives provided by S. 2191 are directed in the most optimal manner.", "Second, in some ways, the interplay between nuclear power, renewables, natural gas, and coal-fired capacity with CCS among the cases is a proxy for the need for a low-carbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid- to long-term. A considerable amount of low-carbon generation will have to be built under S. 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement. The cases presented here do not agree on the amount of new generating capacity necessary under S. 2191 or the mix of fuels and technologies that would be employed. The estimated amount of capacity constructed depends on the cases' assumptions about the need for new capacity and replacement/retirement of existing capacity under S. 2191 , along with consumer demand response to the rising prices and incentives contained in S. 2191 .", "Third, the cases suggest that the CCS bonus allowance allocation under S. 2191 is effective in encouraging deployment of CCS, accelerating development by 5-10 years. However, the cases disagree on whether the bonus amount provided by S. 2191 is sufficient, or needs to be extended additional years.", "Fourth, the cases generally indicate that offsets could be a valuable tool for covered entities not only to potentially reduce costs, but perhaps more importantly, to buy time to further develop new, more efficient technologies. The availability of offsets could be complemented by the bill's provisions permitting banking, allowing companies more time to develop long-term investment and strategic plans, and to pursue technology development. Cost could be lowered further by allowing greater availability of offsets and international credits and with a broader definition of eligible international credits. A more direct path for permitting international credits from mechanisms such as the CDM would also reduce one of the more important cost uncertainties revealed by the cases' varying interpretations of international credit eligibility requirements and their projected price.", "Fifth, the Carbon Market Efficiency Board could have an important effect on the cost of the program through its power to increase the availability of offsets and international credits. The cases generally do not consider the Board in their analyses, however, one can infer from the cases' results that the most important power that the Board may have is the ability to increase the availability of domestic offsets and international credits (although not the authority to change the eligibility requirements for domestic offsets and international credits). In this sense, the Board's powers could mesh with the previous insight about the importance of offsets and banking to the cost-effectiveness of S. 2191 . However, the Board is primarily designed to deal with short-term volatility due to episodic events in the allowance market and has only short-term powers. Whether it could coordinate a longer term strategy, if necessary, with its proposed authority is not known.", "Sixth, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply. The effects will depend on what fuels are included in the LCFS, the level of emissions reductions achieved by alternatives, and the ability of suppliers to produce those alternatives. If plug-in hybrid vehicles or large amounts of cellulosic biofuel are available early, or if certain fuels such as aviation fuel are excluded from the mandate, the costs could be lower. Only one case provided any analysis of the LCFS.", "Seventh, S. 2191 ' s climate-related environmental benefit is best considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort.
