Broader interest in the media and among the public arises in the aftermath of incidents such as the June 14, 2017, attack on at least 17 Members of Congress, several staff, USCP officers, and members of the public in Alexandria, Virginia. In that incident, a Member was critically wounded, and others were injured during a shooting that occurred as Members were practicing for an annual congressional baseball game.", "Official records, supplemented from available news accounts, suggest that there have been at least 20 instances of attacks against Members since 1789. In 10 instances, the attacks failed, were thwarted, or resulted in no serious injuries to Members. Another five incidents resulted in the wounding of at least nine Members. Finally, five instances each resulted in the death of a Member. In these examples, it appears that individual Members were targeted on 17 occasions. There have been three incidents in which more than one Member was targeted, including the Alexandria attack.", "In some of the incidents of attacks on Members or in the Capitol, including the Alexandria incident, some congressional staff were also affected. Two incidents resulted in fatalities, including a 1998 incident in which a gunman entered the Capitol and killed two USCP officers, and a 2011 shooting at a congressional event in Tucson, Arizona, which resulted in the death of a congressional staff member.", "On a number of occasions, incidents of violence involving Members of Congress or congressional staff have led to congressional legislative or administrative responses changing policy and practice. These include a ban on dueling or challenging to duel within the District of Columbia; the enactment of law making it a federal offense to assassinate, kidnap, or assault a Member of Congress or Member-elect; and the initiation of congressional mail screening.", "In the 115th Congress (2017-2018), several legislative proposals have been introduced related to potential response to violence against Members of Congress or their staffs.", "Citing concerns about Member security in the House and in district offices, the House on June 27, 2017, adopted H.Res. 411 to increase the 2017 Member Representational Allowance for each House Member office by $25,000.", "H.R. 3298, the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017, was enacted into law on August, 4, 2017, as P.L. 117-45. The law authorizes the payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to USCP employees who sustain serious injuries in the line-of-duty.", "Other related measures have also been introduced, including H.R. 2940, the Congressional Self-Defense Act; H.R. 2945, the Congressional Personal Safety Act; and H.R. 2951, to allow Members of Congress to carry a concealed handgun anywhere in the United States, with exceptions. If enacted, the measures would allow Members of Congress to carry concealed weapons subject to different qualifications and limitations.", "In addition to legislative proposals, various administrative efforts were undertaken in response to the Alexandria shooting, including an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regarding the use of campaign funds by Members of the House for residential security systems, and an update to the Members' Congressional Handbook to provide additional guidance for updating security equipment and measures."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Q uestions about the personal security and safety of Members of Congress and their staffs are of enduring concern for the House, Senate, and the United States Capitol Police (USCP).

In that incident, a Member was critically wounded, and others, including other Members, a congressional staffer, USCP officers, and a member of the public were injured during a shooting that occurred as Members were practicing for an annual congressional baseball game.", "There is concern about the level and extent of threats against Members. In a mid-June, 2017 letter to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), House Sergeant at Arms (HSAA) Paul D. Irving stated that USCP had investigated approximately 950 threatening communications against Members of Congress since January 1, 2017, and compared that total to what he stated were 902 similar investigations occurring in all of 2016.

Official records, supplemented from available news accounts, suggest that there have been at least 20 instances of attacks against Members, summarized in Table 1 . In 10 instances, the attacks failed, were thwarted, or resulted in no serious injuries to Members. Another five incidents resulted in the wounding of at least nine Members. Finally, five instances each resulted in the death of a Member.", "In these examples, it appears that individual Members were targeted on 17 occasions. There have been three incidents in which more than one Member was targeted. These include the Alexandria attack, in which at least 17 Members were present, a 2001 biologic attack directed at two Senators, but affecting numerous other Members and staff in the Hart and Dirksen Senate Office Buildings, and a 1954 shooting in the House chamber where a quorum call had registered the presence of 243 Representatives just prior to the incident.", "Identifying examples of violence against Members of Congress can be a complicated, complex undertaking. As political figures and national leaders, part of the role of Members is to participate in public discussion about a wide range of topics, including war, peace, and policies affecting the future of the nation and its citizens. Some of those issues might incite violent responses between Members, or between Members and the general public. In other circumstances, Members may be involved in violent activities that are unrelated to their official duties, due to personal circumstances, or because they were the random target of criminal activity. The focus of this report is on identified incidents in which Members appear to have been the target of an attack by someone outside of Congress, presumably due to their role as a Member of Congress, or, in one instance, while seeking other office while serving in Congress. This report excludes incidents in which Members voluntarily participated in violent activities, such as war service as a combatant, or other instances, in which some Members voluntarily initiated violent activities, including duels, fistfights, beatings, and other individualized conflicts, sometimes with other Members. Also excluded are incidents in which the Capitol was attacked, but no Members or staff were reported as injured. Examples include the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812; the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in which the Capitol and Congress may have been a target; and bombings in the Capitol in 1915, 1971, and 1983."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Violence Against Congressional Staff", "paragraphs": ["In some of the incidents of attacks on Members or in the Capitol, including the Alexandria incident, some congressional staff were also affected. Two incidents resulted in fatalities. In 1998, a gunman entered the Capitol, and made his way to the Majority Whip's office, although it is unknown whether the Whip was a target. Two USCP officers, Private First Class Jacob Chestnut, and Detective John Gibson, were killed while responding to the incident. A 2011 shooting at a congressional event in Tucson, Arizona, resulted in the death of a congressional staff member, Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman.", "Other violent but non-lethal incidents involving staff have also occurred. In 1905, \"Doc\" Thompkins, private secretary to Representative John M. Pinckney of Texas, was wounded in a riot in which Representative Pinckney was killed. In 1935, Earle Christenberry, secretary to Senator Huey Pierce Long of Louisiana, opened a package containing a bomb, which did not explode. In the 1954 House chamber shooting, two House doorkeepers suffered injuries. Matthew Fardella was struck in the jaw while subduing the shooters. William Belcher suffered a heart attack following the attack. In a 1978 incident, Jackie Speier, then a staff member working for Representative Leo Joseph Ryan of California, who now serves as a Representative, was critically wounded by gunfire in an attack in Guyana. Representative Ryan was killed in the attack.", "Identifying instances of violence against congressional staff poses significant challenges. Because they are private citizens who do not receive extensive, sustained public attention, there is no assurance that all instances of violence against them can be identified. Violence against staff that is reported here happened in the course of their official duties. Identifying all who have served Congress in a staff capacity, and then identifying whether they have suffered violence during that service, presents all but insurmountable obstacles to compiling an exhaustive and authoritative inventory of violent incidents. A consequence of these challenges is that the material presented here cannot with authority be said to comprise all of the attacks on Members of Congress or staff that have ever occurred.", "An example of the difficulties presented in chronicling violence against staff is the death of Harold W. \"Hal\" Rosenthal, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member. As noted in Table 1 , Mr. Rosenthal was killed during an August 11, 1976, terrorist attack at an airport in Istanbul, Turkey. It cannot be determined if the attackers were aware of Mr. Rosenthal's status as a congressional employee. Although contemporary news reports and congressional statements state that Mr. Rosenthal was overseas on official congressional business to Israel, the lack of official records of staff activity render it virtually impossible to determine if Mr. Rosenthal died in Istanbul while in the course of his official duties.", " Table 1 summarizes incidents of violence directed against Members or congressional staff. This material should be interpreted with care. Although they have high profiles, and any incident of violence against them is likely to engender considerable attention in contemporary times, it is possible that some incidents of violence involving Members have not been captured. It is also possible that available sources, whether official or non-official, provide limited or conflicting accounts of a Member's involvement in violent activities.

Initiation of congressional mail screening following the delivery in the fall of 2001 of letters containing anthrax spores to the offices of Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota.", "Some violent incidents in which Members may not have been the direct target have also led in part to congressional action. The 1971 and 1983 Capitol bombings were reportedly some of the reasons for the introduction of visitor screening around the chamber galleries, and Capitol entrances, respectively. The attacks of September 11, 2001, were a contributing factor in increases to the number of USCP officers and staff, expedited deployment of a security perimeter planned prior to the attacks, and appropriations funding construction of the Capitol Visitor Center.
