On November 17, 2008, the Bush Administration concluded a security agreement providing the legal basis for the continued presence, operation, and eventual withdrawal of U.S. armed forces in Iraq once the U.N. Security Council mandate expired on December 31, 2008, and a strategic framework agreement to cover the overall bilateral relationship between the two countries.", "After the Bush Administration announced its intention to enter into these agreements, several Members of Congress demanded that Congress be involved in creating the planned agreements, from negotiation to implementation, and took action to ensure such involvement. Members proposed numerous pieces of legislation that would increase Congress's role in creating these agreements, and, after the agreements were finalized, their implementation, from calling for executive-branch consultation and reporting to requiring formal congressional approval. Congress has also conducted multiple hearings that have concerned the agreements, receiving clarification on many important issues from Bush and Obama Administration officials, and subject-matter experts.

It portended a bilateral agreement to address political, economic, and cultural issues, as well as the continued presence of U.S. forces in Iraq after the December 31, 2008 termination of the U.N. Security Council resolution currently authorizing the Multinational Force in Iraq (MNF-I). The Bush Administration later announced that it would negotiate two agreements, an agreement providing the legal basis between the two countries for the continued presence and operation of U.S. armed forces in Iraq, termed a status of forces agreement (SOFA), and a strategic framework agreement to cover the overall bilateral relationship. The Declaration of Principles presaged U.S. \"security assurances and commitments\" to aid Iraq in defending against external and internal threats. Shortly after the announcement of the Declaration of Principles, Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, Assistant to President Bush for Iraq and Afghanistan, stated that the planned agreement would cover nearly every aspect of the future U.S. military role in Iraq, including the overall mission, force levels, and basing arrangements. He explained that the parties intended to conclude the agreement by July 31, 2008. Regarding Congress's role in the creation of the agreement, General Lute stated that the Bush Administration did not expect the agreement to rise to the level of a treaty, and that it did not foresee the need for \"formal inputs\" from Congress.

These were the \"Strategic Framework Agreement for a Relationship of Friendship and Cooperation between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq\" (\"Strategic Framework\") and the \"Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq\" (\"Security Agreement,\" and together, with the Strategic Framework, the \"Iraq Agreements\" or the \"Agreements\").", "Although the Bush Administration executed the Agreements as sole executive agreements, needing only the signature of Ambassador Crocker for entry into force, the Iraqi process for approval required three additional steps. First, before the Agreements could be signed, the Iraqi cabinet had to approve the final version of the two Agreements, which it did on November 16 as mentioned above. Second, the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) had to vote to approve the Agreements. Finally, the Iraqi Presidency Council, made up of Iraq's president and two vice presidents, had to give its approval.", "After finalizing the Agreements on November 17, therefore, the Iraqi government sent the Iraq Agreements to the COR for approval. On November 19, 2008, a session in the COR to hear the second public reading of the law to approve the Agreements was halted when a physical confrontation broke out due to a dispute over parliamentary process. Several members of the COR asserted that it was unconstitutional to consider approval of the agreements because the COR had not yet passed a general law on ratification of international agreements, required by Article 61 of the Iraq constitution. Other members stated that the law approving the Agreements would need two-thirds majority approval to pass, not a bare majority as had been previously decided. There was sentiment among many members that constitutional requirements were being bypassed in order to force the Agreements through the COR quickly without due consideration.", "Despite this opposition, and criticism from certain Iranian leaders influential among some Iraqi groups, the COR passed the law approving the Iraq Agreements by simple majority on November 27, 2008. Several Sunni and independent COR members agreed to vote for approval when an additional measure passed calling for a national referendum on the Agreements to take place in July 2009, which would allow the Iraqi people a chance to vote their disapproval, requiring the government of Iraq to pull out of the Agreements. Iraq's Presidency Council gave its approval of the Iraq Agreements on December 4, 2008, and they entered into force on January 1, 2009. Observers have asserted that preparations for the July 2009 referendum, including a law to govern the referendum process, have not taken place to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summaries of the Iraq Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The Strategic Framework sets out broad goals for the overall relationship and cooperation between the United States and Iraq. Section I states that the presence of U.S. forces is at the request and invitation of the government of Iraq; that the United States shall not use Iraqi land, sea, or air to launch attacks against other countries; and that the United States shall not request permanent military bases or a permanent military presence in Iraq. Section II requires the United States to \"ensure maximum efforts to work with and through the democratically elected Government of Iraq\" for political and diplomatic cooperation. Section III states that the defense and security cooperation between the parties shall be undertaken pursuant to the Security Agreement. Sections IV through VIII state that the parties \"agree to cooperate\" on issues of culture, economics, energy, health, environment, information technology and communications, and law enforcement and the judiciary. Section IX requires the parties to establish a Higher Coordinating Committee to monitor implementation of the Strategic Framework, and establish additional Joint Coordination Committees as necessary. Section X provides that the parties may enter into further agreements or arrangements as necessary to implement the Strategic Framework. Finally, Section XI provides in part that the Strategic Framework enter into force on January 1, 2009 following the exchange of diplomatic notes confirming that the two parties have completed their respective constitutional procedures to enter into the Strategic Framework. The Section also states that either party may withdraw from the agreement one year after notifying the other party of its intent to withdraw.", "The Security Agreement states in Article 1 that its scope and purpose is to \"determine the principal provisions and requirements that regulate the temporary presence, activities, and withdrawal of the United States Forces from Iraq.\" The Security Agreement contains many provisions common to most U.S. SOFAs. Articles concerning taxes, claims, carrying weapons and wearing uniforms, for instance, are regularly included in SOFAs. ", "The document, however, also contains a number of articles that are not typical of a SOFA and seem to expand the scope of the Security Agreement. Several articles, for example, concern the authority of U.S. forces to conduct military operations within Iraq. Article 4, \"Missions,\" explains that Iraq requests the temporary assistance of U.S. armed forces in the conduct of military operations within Iraq. The Article also states that all military operations carried out pursuant to the Security Agreement must be approved by the government of Iraq and coordinated with Iraqi authorities through a Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee (JMOCC) to be established under Article 23. Article 22 gives U.S. forces authority to detain individuals in Iraq in accordance with Article 4. Article 27 authorizes military operations, among other actions, to deter external or internal threats or aggression against Iraq if mutually agreed by the parties. ", "In addition to those concerning military operations, the Security Agreement contains other unusual provisions. Article 24 sets out timelines for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by December 31, 2011, with an earlier withdrawal deadline on June 30, 2009 for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraqi cities and towns. Notwithstanding these timelines, the Article also states that the United States has the right to withdraw its armed forces from Iraq at any time, and Iraq has the right to request the departure of U.S. armed forces at any time. Article 25 concerns efforts to end the application of resolutions affecting Iraq under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Article 23 requires the creation of a Joint Ministerial Committee, which in turn shall create the JMOCC and a Joint Committee, for the purpose of implementing and interpreting the Security Agreement, as well as settling disputes arising under the Security Agreement. Article 29 contemplates creation of further mechanisms for implementation of the Security Agreement, including new mechanisms not specifically prescribed by the provisions of the Security Agreement. Article 30 states that the Security Agreement is effective for three years, but that either party may terminate the Security Agreement one year after giving notice of its intention to withdraw. Like the Strategic Framework, Article 30 also provides that the Security Agreement enter into force on January 1, 2009 following the exchange of diplomatic notes confirming that the two parties have completed their respective constitutional procedures to enter into the Security Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Implementation of the Iraq Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Despite earlier concerns about possible incompatibility between some provisions of the Iraq Agreements and the campaign promises of President Obama, the Obama Administration has indicated its intention to abide by the terms of both the Security Agreement and the Strategic Framework. President Obama stated in February 2009 that the United States would withdraw the majority of its troops from Iraq by August 2010, but that 35,000-50,000 troops would remain longer, with drawdowns continuing until December 31, 2011, as set out in the Security Agreement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in her nomination hearing that the State Department would actively pursue the cooperation activities set out in the Strategic Framework.", "Implementation of the provisions of the Security Agreement in Iraq, however, has not been without difficulties. General Ray Odierno, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, stated that despite the requirement in the Security Agreement that U.S. forces withdraw from Iraqi cities and towns by June 30, 2009, some U.S. troops will not withdraw by that date where Iraqi security forces are not prepared to independently meet their duties, in order to provide support against remaining insurgents and training for Iraqi forces. According to a recent report, the United States and Iraq began negotiations to extend the presence of U.S. troops in Baghdad and Mosul past the June 30, 2009 deadline. Both General Odierno and an Iraqi government spokesperson further stated that the timetable for overall withdrawal by the end of 2011 could be renegotiated if a continued U.S. presence is necessary. In January 2009, General Odierno nevertheless asserted that the full withdrawal of U.S. troops would go forward as set out in the Security Agreement.", "With regard to joint operational command under the Security Agreement, Iraqi commanders have claimed that U.S. forces have often failed to pre-coordinate their activities with Iraqi officials, thus violating the provisions requiring Iraqi approval of U.S. operations, and that pre-coordination mechanisms have not functioned efficiently. Prime Minister al Maliki condemned a U.S. raid in the southern Iraqi town of Kut in late April 2009, which apparently occurred without coordination or approval from Iraqi officials as required under the Security Agreement. The Prime Minister characterized the raid as a \"breach of the security pact\" and called on the United States to \"hand over those responsible for this crime to the courts.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Congressional Reactions, Oversight, and Proposed Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Several Members of Congress have proposed numerous pieces of legislation, both before and after the November 2008 finalization of the Agreements, designed to encourage or require the submission of the Iraq Agreements to Congress for formal approval. The language of some of these bills would require consultation and reporting from the President concerning the progress of negotiation of the Agreements. Congress has also conducted multiple hearings that have either focused on or at least touched on the Iraq Agreements. In these hearings, Congress has heard testimony from executive branch officials addressing the plans and important issues concerning the Iraq Agreements, and, prior to finalization of the Agreements, received promises from such officials to keep Congress informed on the progress of negotiations. This testimony has equipped Congress with information pertinent to deciding what further action can be taken to involve Congress more in the implementation of the Iraq Agreements.", "At congressional hearings, the Bush Administration and the Iraqi legislature also expressed their opinions regarding the Iraq Agreements. In answering Congress's concerns, the Bush Administration sought to reassure Congress of its intentions regarding the content and scope of the Iraq Agreements, while vigorously defending the President's asserted constitutional and legislated right to execute such Agreements without formal congressional approval or a specified congressional role. At a June 4, 2008, hearing before the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, members of the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) testified that the COR as a whole believed no U.S.-Iraq agreement was proper at the time because Iraq did not enjoy full sovereignty, and that the COR's approval was required for the Iraq Agreements to go into effect, statements that described similar sentiments reported at the time of the approval of the Iraq Agreements in November 2008.", "Congress's response to the Iraq Agreements has illuminated the priority concerns and positions of the various stakeholders involved in the Agreements. Several Members of Congress have asserted the necessity of congressional involvement in the Iraq Agreements, arguing that the Agreements require advice and consent of the Senate as a formal treaty under the Constitution, or congressional approval through normal legislation. Some Members have contended that any agreement with Iraq, given the importance of U.S. involvement in Iraq to the Congress and the American people, should be negotiated with meaningful consultation from the Congress, no matter what legal form the agreement takes. Some statements from Members have suggested that the Iraq Agreements, negotiated and executed out of the sight of Congress, may still unexpectedly bind the hands of the Obama Administration and Congress, and might include a role for U.S. troops in Iraq that exceeds the scope of the 2002 congressional authorization to use force in Iraq. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all asserted as Members of Congress that Congress should be involved in the negotiation of these Agreements and such Agreements should not be allowed to enter into force prior to congressional approval of some form. As senators, both Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton introduced legislation to require consultation with, and approval from, Congress before the Agreements with Iraq were finalized. Then-Senator Obama was a co-sponsor of then-Senator Clinton's bill, S. 2426 (110 th Congress). On the other hand, certain Members have argued that President Bush completed the Iraq Agreements as sole executive agreements within the scope of his inherent powers and the congressional authorization to use force, characterizing demands for greater congressional involvement as unnecessary and possibly improper under the Constitution.", "After the Iraq Agreements were finalized, certain Members continued to express concerns about various aspects of the Agreements, including the legal protections for U.S. troops, the effectiveness of the timetable for withdrawal, and the true nature of the continuing U.S. commitment to the security of Iraq, among others.", "This remainder of this report is divided into two main parts: the first describes in detail the actions taken by Congress concerning the planned Iraq Agreements, including legislative initiatives and congressional hearings; the second provides a range of options for further congressional action concerning Congress's role in negotiating, executing, and implementing the Iraq Agreements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Action Taken by Congress Regarding the Iraq Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Congress, in response to the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the Iraq Agreements, has enacted legislation, proposed legislation, and held hearings.

The Bush Administration's refusal to fully consult Congress with regard to the Agreements could force Congress to use the power of the purse to ensure that Congress's point of view is considered.

The State Department's own Circular 175 regulations concerning the execution of international agreements require meaningful consultation with Congress before agreements such as the Iraq Agreements are signed. Because the U.N. mandate and Iraq's threat to the national security of the United States, the two bases for the 2002 authorization for the use of force in Iraq, have both ended, there is no authorization under U.S. law for U.S. troops to conduct military operations in Iraq. Extension of the U.N. mandate past December 31, 2008 would have obviated the need to quickly conclude the Iraq Agreements, but a U.N. mandate would not have best served U.S. interests, and would weaken Iraq's overall position as a sovereign nation.

Bush Administration statements included the following:", "The Security Agreement would not contain a U.S. commitment to defend the security of Iraq if such security is threatened. The Iraq Agreements would not bind the next Administration to a certain course concerning Iraq policy. What was to become the Security Agreement, as a document, was properly termed a status of forces agreement (SOFA) that provided the legal status of U.S. troops in Iraq, and as such did not need congressional approval. The Bush Administration would consult with Congress regarding the Iraq Agreements prior to their conclusion. The 2002 authorization of the use of force in Iraq was still effective given the continued security situation in Iraq.

With regard to consultation, although the Bush Administration appears to have conducted limited briefings on the Agreements with congressional leadership, many Members of Congress said they had not yet seen the text of the Iraq Agreements as of November 17, 2008, when the Agreements were finalized. As to the contents of the Security Agreement, it seems that while the text contains many provisions that are usually provided in SOFAs, there are many provisions that are not usual and that are possibly outside the scope of a SOFA, especially Article 27 dealing with the authorization of U.S. military operations in Iraq."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Possible Further Congressional Action Concerning the Iraq Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Congress has several options for further action to help shape its own involvement in the continued implementation of the Iraq Agreements.

Indeed, as illustrated above, the hearings conducted by various congressional committees and subcommittees have produced a body of evidence concerning the Agreements, including both the intentions of the Bush and Obama Administrations and the general sentiment of the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR). Executive branch officials have given sworn testimony regarding bases, security commitments, troop levels, scope of mission, legal immunity for U.S. forces, withdrawal timelines, and other issues. The hearings may have therefore produced a useful result as an investigative device to pin down the Bush and Obama Administrations' plans regarding the Iraq Agreements.", "On the other hand, Congress may wish to capitalize on some of the information gathered earlier by continuing to hold hearings on such an important issue as the future of the U.S.-Iraq relationship and the ongoing U.S. presence in Iraq. Congress received numerous promises that the executive branch would keep Congress informed during the negotiation process for the Iraq Agreements, and that the Agreements would be submitted in some form to the Congress before they were finalized and implemented. The Bush Administration made several statements to Congress concerning the scope and contents of the Iraq Agreements, with many being direct responses to problems perceived by Members of Congress.

While a reporting requirement is useful for enlightening Congress concerning the Iraq agreements, it does not afford Congress the opportunity to directly shape the implementation of the Agreements.", "With regard to passage of legislation containing a requirement that one or more of the Iraq Agreements be submitted to Congress for approval, the Obama Administration might argue, as did the Bush Administration, that the President has the constitutional authority within Article II, apart from any need for congressional input, to conclude the Iraq Agreements as sole executive agreements. Although this position would conflict with the position President Obama took as a Senator when he co-sponsored a bill to require congressional approval for the Iraq Agreements, President Obama may argue that such a requirement may damage the U.S. relationship with Iraq as it might throw the status of the Agreements into doubt. Any such legislation may face a veto, and could precipitate a constitutional confrontation concerning the respective powers of the legislature and the executive in determining the form of international agreements under U.S. law. As an alternative to requiring congressional approval outright, provisions prohibiting the use of funds to implement the Iraq Agreements, while significant, would not present the same constitutional problems, as they fall squarely within Congress's appropriations power.

The Iraq Agreements could be viewed as defining the parameters of the continued authorization for deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq, those forces' legal status, and their ability to use force. Congress might consider legislation, therefore, delineating the President's authority to implement the Iraq Agreements by adding specific Iraq-Agreement language to the existing use-of-force authorizations.", "Amendments to the 2002 authorization of the use of force have already been introduced; for example, legislation was proposed prior to the signing of the Declaration of Principles that would set time restrictions on the authorization to use force in Iraq. New amendatory language directly regarding the Iraq Agreements could include certain directives to the President that would redefine the authorization to use force and therefore shape the implementation of the Iraq Agreements.

Because the 2002 joint resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq had as one of its two bases the enforcement of U.N. Security Council resolutions, which came to include the resolution authorizing the activities of the U.S.-led Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I), some Members of Congress might wish to require the executive branch to submit to Congress for approval any agreement purporting to replace the U.N. mandate as the legal basis under international law for the continued presence and military activity of U.S. armed forces in Iraq. This would require the Obama Administration to submit either the Security Agreement or both Iraq Agreements to Congress for approval. The language of such an amendment could make clear that the submission and approval is required even if such action takes place after the Agreements' entry into force, as would indeed be the case at this point in time.

Such legislation would likely entail little downside for the Obama Administration, as it would not require any changes to the Iraq Agreements, the relationship with Iraq overall, or the Administration's own plans for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.", "That said, legislation approving the Iraq Agreements could be straightforward, but need not be. As with new legislation redefining the use of force authorization, such approval legislation would also provide an opportunity for Congress to attach conditions and interpretations to the provisions of the Iraq Agreements, and to require consultation and reporting.

Building on the sentiments of the subcommittee's January 23 hearing, Members made the following statements, among others:", "the authority for U.S. forces to remain in Iraq past the end of the U.N. mandate on December 31, 2008, must be approved by both the Congress and the Iraqi COR; and the Declaration of Principles has been used by the Administration to send misleading political signals to both Congress and Iraq.", "The expert panel provided extensive testimony on the four questions posed by the subcommittee, including these assertions:", "a commitment to defend another country cannot be included in a status of forces agreement as that term is commonly used; the type of security commitment spelled out in the Declaration of Principles would contain a greater obligation for the United States than U.S. mutual defense treaties include, as the commitment involves defending against internal threats and an automatic requirement to use force in Iraq's defense; the Declaration itself, however, may not be intended as binding, and likely represents only a statement of shared interests, not a preview of the contents of the actual Iraq Agreements; any provisions in the proposed SOFA concerning immunity for security contractors from Iraq's legal process might represent an expansion of recognized presidential prerogatives regarding these types of agreements, although providing for such immunity may be within the President's constitutionally granted powers; and because the conditions of the specific 2002 authorization of the use of force against Iraq no longer adhere, the proposed Iraq Agreements represent a new national commitment of the U.S. armed forces and as such require congressional approval.", "Hearings on the FY2009 Foreign Affairs Budget", "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee held separate hearings concerning the FY2009 foreign affairs budget on February 13, 2008. During Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's testimony in the two hearings, she was questioned about the provisions of the proposed Iraq Agreements. She stated the following on the issue:", "the Administration is not seeking permanent bases in Iraq; the United States is not taking on an obligation to defend Iraq against its neighbors, or provide any security guarantees; the agreements do not contain a \"commitment to combat forces\" or required U.S. troop levels; the SOFA is intended to allow U.S. forces to operate there in a legal fashion after the U.N. mandate; the Administration will consult with Congress as the negotiations progress; and the SOFA will not bind the hands of the next president.", "Secretary Rice maintained the Administration's position that the proposed SOFA, while tailored to the specific situation in Iraq, still fell under the customary form of a SOFA and therefore could be concluded without congressional approval.", "Status of Forces Agreements and U.N. Mandates: What Authorities and Protections Do They Provide to U.S. Personnel?", "Continuing its series on the future of the U.S. relationship with Iraq, the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight held this hearing on February 28, 2008. Focusing on the purpose and scope of SOFAs in general, the hearing produced statements from committee members that Congress needs to play a significant role in reviewing and approving the Iraq SOFA, even if it does not include a commitment to defend Iraq, due to the importance of Iraq to U.S. foreign policy overall. Professor Michael J. Matheson, one of the experts on the hearing panel, suggested that Congress should engage in defining the scope of authority for military operations in Iraq going forward.", "Declaration and Principles: Future U.S. Commitments to Iraq", "This hearing took place before a joint session of the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight and the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia on March 4, 2008. The fourth hearing in a series, it was the first that collected testimony from Administration officials. Ambassador David Satterfield, who leads the negotiations with Iraq, answered numerous questions from Members concerning the Iraq Agreements, making the following statements, among others:", "the Iraq Agreements will not include a binding commitment to defend Iraq or any other security commitment that would warrant Senate advice and consent; the Iraq Agreements will not create permanent U.S. bases in Iraq, and will not specify numbers of U.S. troops to be stationed there; any arrangement fulfilling the pledges of the Declaration of Principles between the Administration and Iraq will be made public and will not remain secret; the Administration does not contemplate the Strategic Framework as a legally binding agreement; the Administration has made clear to Prime Minister al Maliki and other Iraqi officials that the Agreements will not include an obligation to enter into combat if Iraq is attacked; the Iraq Agreements will not contain a commitment for U.S. forces to remain present in Iraq; and the Administration relies on the congressional authority in the 2002 authorization to invade Iraq as the basis for maintaining U.S. forces in Iraq past the end of the U.N. mandate.", "When asked whether the Administration would present the Iraq Agreements to Congress for approval, Ambassador Satterfield held to the Administration's position that the Agreements did not need congressional approval, but stated that the Administration would comply with all constitutional requirements. He stated that background briefings had already taken place between the Administration and Members of Congress, and that they would continue, but that the Administration would not publicly disclose its negotiating positions.", "International Affairs Budget for Fiscal Year 2009", "The House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs held this hearing on March 12, 2008. Secretary Rice appeared before the subcommittee during this hearing and was asked several questions concerning the Iraq Agreements. She reiterated her comments from earlier hearings, stating that the Administration was not seeking permanent bases, and that the SOFA being negotiated does not set troop levels, and does not make commitments to specific kinds of operations. Answering a question concerning the submission of the Iraq SOFA to Congress for approval, Secretary Rice responded that SOFAs are not submitted to Congress. When pressed on the source of the President's authority to continue the U.S. presence in Iraq, Secretary Rice did not cite the 2002 authorization to invade Iraq or the 2001 authorization to use military force in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, instead stating, \"the President has the authority, we believe, to continue the operations,\" without reference to the basis for that authority.", "Hearings on the Iraq Report Regarding the U.S. Troop Surge", "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on April 8, 2008, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on April 9, 2008, each held a hearing to discuss the results of the U.S. troop surge in Iraq. Ambassador Ryan Crocker testified before both committees, making several statements and answering questions concerning the Iraq Agreements. While much of his testimony was similar to that of other Administration officials in previous hearings, he did explain the motivation for the Agreements, stating that the principal leaders of Iraq requested a long-term bilateral relationship with the United States in August 2007, and that the Agreements represent to the Iraqis an affirmation of their sovereignty. He also explained that the Agreements do not contain provisions for permanent U.S. bases in Iraq, and that he anticipated the United States would explicitly forswear such bases in the Agreements. As other Administration officials had done, Ambassador Crocker stated the Administration's intention was to conclude the SOFA as a sole executive agreement. He also made comments that indicated the Strategic Framework would not be a legally enforceable international agreement, but merely a political agreement between the Administration and the al Maliki government.", "Negotiating a Long-Term Relationship with Iraq", "This hearing was held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 10, 2008. Ambassador David Satterfield appeared before the committee and gave testimony concerning the two proposed Iraq Agreements that was similar to his earlier testimony on March 4, outlined above: no permanent U.S. bases, no requirement for troop levels or the nature of the U.S. mission, no binding commitment to defend Iraq, and no provisions that will limit the policy options of the next president. He repeated the Administration's position that the SOFA would be concluded as an executive agreement rather than a treaty, but that the Administration intended to consult with Congress throughout the process. He explained that the Strategic Framework would not contain legally binding commitments that would trigger Senate advice-and-consent procedures. When questioned about the authority for the U.S. presence in Iraq after the expiration of the U.N. mandate on December 31, 2008, Ambassador Satterfield cited the President's authorities as commander-in-chief as well as the 2002 authorization to invade Iraq and the 2001 authorization to use force after the September 11 terrorist attacks.", "The Future of U.S.-Iraqi Relations: The Perspective of the Iraqi Parliament", "The House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight held this hearing on June 4, 2008. The subcommittee took testimony from two members of the Iraqi COR, Sheikh Khalaf Al-Ulayyan and Professor Nadeem Al-Jaberi, concerning the continuing U.S. presence in Iraq and the two proposed Iraq Agreements. They asserted that as a whole the COR had several ongoing concerns:", "the Agreements should not be concluded at this time, because Iraq does not enjoy full sovereignty and as such cannot enter any agreement with the United States as an equal party; Iraq should not enter into the Agreements until the new U.S. president comes into office; any agreement between the al Maliki government and the United States will not be implemented without approval by the COR; no provision for permanent U.S. bases in the Iraq Agreements will be acceptable to the Iraqi populace; and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is no longer needed, and a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. forces is desired.", "At the hearing, Chairman Delahunt announced a plan to create a formalized interparliamentary dialogue mechanism between the legislatures of the United States and Iraq that would \"allow us to continue these conversations and better inform ourselves, because legislative bodies in a democracy are absolutely essential and particularly in terms of oversight of the executive branches.\" Professor Al-Jaberi indicated that the COR will pursue this idea.", "Hearing to receive a briefing on the status of negotiations with Iraq on a Strategic Framework Agreement and a Status of Forces Agreement", "This hearing was held on July 16, 2008 in a closed session of the Senate Armed Services Committee.", "Possible Extension of the U.N. Mandate for Iraq: Options", "The House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight held this hearing on July 23, 2008. The hearing focused on the continued negotiation of the Iraq Agreements and the possible need for extension of the U.N. mandate if the Agreements were not finalized by December 31, 2008. At the hearing, Members of Congress expressed their continued concerns over whether the Bush Administration and the al Maliki government could execute the Iraq Agreements before expiration of the U.N. mandate. Several continued to argue that the Bush Administration must consult with Congress on the negotiation of the Agreements and must submit the Agreements to Congress for approval. Some stressed their view as well that review and approval of the Iraq Agreements by the Iraqi COR was legally required. Several witnesses gave their testimony on these and other issues concerning the Iraq Agreements, and made statements demonstrating a number of points of view:", "Execution of the Security Agreement and Strategic Framework will better ensure U.S. national security interests than an extension of the U.N. mandate. Continuation of the U.N. mandate will harm Iraq's sovereignty in the eyes of the international community and of the Iraqis themselves. Extension of the U.N. mandate under Chapter VI, which would allow Iraq to voluntarily allow the presence of U.S. troops, may be a middle way between the contemplated Iraq Agreements and the extension of the Chapter VII mandate. A majority of the Iraqi COR and the Iraqi population welcome non-military U.S. assistance, but desire a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops in any bilateral agreement for a continued U.S. military presence. Given the reported difficulties in the negotiations over the Iraq Agreements and the short time frame for finalizing the agreements, an extension of the U.N. mandate is the only avenue to ensuring the legality of the U.S. mission in Iraq under domestic and international law, and the legal protections and immunities of U.S. troops in Iraq. Going forward, Congress can strengthen its role in the execution of the Iraq Agreements by working directly with the Iraqi COR and coordinating efforts for including the two legislatures in the process, making its oversight activities as visible as possible to both the U.S. and Iraqi populations, and to continue to conduct oversight through hearings and other means as the negotiations continue.", "The last witness at the hearing was Dr. Ayad Allawi, the former prime minister of Iraq, and current member of the COR. Dr. Allawi expressed his opinion that the Iraq Agreements should be transparent, and that the Prime Minister al Maliki's government should consult with the COR about these Agreements and submit them to the COR for formal approval, in compliance with the requirements of the Iraqi constitution. He stated that the general opposition of a majority of COR members to the Iraq Agreement stemmed from the fact that the COR had not been kept apprised of the contents of the Agreements and the status of the negotiations. The Agreements may receive the two-thirds majority vote for ratification, he explained, if the COR had an opportunity to review the agreements beforehand. With regard to an extension of the U.N. mandate, Dr. Allawi stated that a Chapter VI mandate would be more appropriate to the current state of Iraq's status as a sovereign nation.", "Hearing on the Iraq Progress Report", "The House Armed Services Committee held this hearing on July 23, 2008. The Committee received testimony from Mr. Gene Dodaro, Acting Comptroller General of the United States. During his testimony, Mr. Dodaro made several statements and answered questions concerning the Iraq Agreements and the termination of the U.N. mandate as it pertained to the benchmarks set out in the Iraq Progress Report. Mr. Dodaro stated that the Iraq Agreements should address the issues of continued development of various capacities in Iraq, and that the continuing framework for Iraq's progress must take into account issues of the imminent U.S. presidential transition.", "The Situation in Iraq and Afghanistan", "During this hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 23, 2008, Senator John Warner questioned Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on the status of negotiations over the Iraq Agreements, and the Bush Administration's intentions to involve Congress in the overall process of executing the Agreements. Secretary Gates explained that the negotiations had been difficult, and that the Iraqi government had strong views about the country's sovereignty. He stated that it was his understanding that all relevant committees had been briefed on the negotiations, and that the Agreements would not be signed before consultation with Members of Congress. Senator Warner expressed his belief that full and open consultation with Congress was required, not briefings for \"just one or two chairmen here or a ranking [member] there.... \" Secretary Gates stated that if the Agreements reach final form during a recess the Administration would make significant effort to \"reach out to members.\" Chairman Carl Levin then asked Secretary Gates to confirm his understanding, stating, \"There's a commitment from this administration that before the agreements are finalized that there be consultation with the leadership of the Congress.\" (Emphasis added.) Secretary Gates answered, \"Yes, sir.\"", "Renewing the United Nations Mandate for Iraq (and Analysis of Finalized Iraq Agreements)", "This hearing took place before the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight on November 19, 2008. The topic for the hearing was to center on renewing the U.N. mandate for Iraq, but the participants focused extensively on the bilateral U.S.-Iraq Agreements signed on November 17. The COR had not yet voted to approve the Agreements, however, making the extension of the UN mandate a possibility if the Iraqi COR disapproved the Security Agreement.", "Chairman Delahunt commented that he hoped the series of hearings conducted by the subcommittee had a role in shaping the discussion and formation of the Iraq Agreements, especially the inclusion of withdrawal deadlines in the Security Agreement. He expressed continued frustration with the Bush Administration's unwillingness to conduct open consultation with Congress and to submit the Iraq Agreements to Congress for formal approval. In addition, he noted his surprise at the opposition of the Administration to an extension of the UN mandate and insistence on finalizing the bilateral Security Agreement before December 31, 2008.", "Members participating in the hearing also stated a number of concerns about the provisions of the Security Agreement itself, including", "the lack of provision in the Agreements for Iraqi reimbursement of U.S. costs incurred as a result of a continued U.S. presence in Iraq through 2011; the Agreements' inattention to the role of multilateral cooperation in the continuing reconstruction of Iraq; the lack of legal immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts for private security contractors not employed under DOD contract; and the vagueness of several of the provisions.", "The Iraq Agreements in the Context of U.S. Interests and the Mission in Iraq", "Thomas Donnelly of the American Enterprise Institute gave testimony concerning the Security Agreement's relationship to U.S. interests in Iraq. He stated that the Congress should approve the Security Agreement if possible, because it would aid the President by removing doubts about the legal status of U.S. troops, and because the Security Agreement would bolster the developing stability of Iraq. He claimed that passage of the Security Agreement would weaken the supporters of Moqtada al Sadr, represent a rejection of Iran's influence in Iraq, and improve Iraq's self-image as a sovereign nation. He also expressed his concerns about the requirement for U.S. forces to withdraw from Iraqi cities and towns by June 30, 2009, citing the possibility of a return to ethnic cleansing, and the lack of certainty about U.S. operations in Iraq that may be necessary past the December 31, 2011 termination of the Security Agreement. He stated that while the Security Agreement did not require Iraq to reimburse the United States for its expenditures in Iraq, the United States should ensure that Iraq budgetary process and execution be strengthened in order to increase Iraq's ability to take over security and other activities from the United States.", "The members of the subcommittee and the witnesses also engaged in a discussion concerning the Iraqi courts' jurisdiction over U.S. forces, DOD contractors, and non-DOD contractors.", "U.S. Constitutional Issues Concerning the Iraq Agreements", "Professor Oona Hathaway provided testimony to the subcommittee concerning U.S. constitutional issues and the Security Agreement, making the argument that the Security Agreement contained provisions that fell outside the President's independent constitutional powers. First, she considered the provision requiring U.S. commanders in Iraq to receive approval from the Iraqi government through the JMOCC before engaging in military activities. Professor Hathaway stated that the executive branch's partial ceding of operational decisional control without prior congressional approval was unprecedented. Second, she argued that the Security Agreement contained many provisions that had never been included in a U.S. SOFA, including the provision granting U.S. forces the ability to fight in Iraq, the JMOCC provision requiring Iraqi approval of U.S. military operations, and the timetables for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities and from Iraq itself. Professor Hathaway explained that such agreements have in the past been concluded as treaties requiring Senate approval.", "Last, Professor Hathaway argued that the war in Iraq would become illegal under U.S. law because Congress authorized the use of force against Iraq for two purposes: (1) to defend U.S. national security against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) to enforce all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. Because Iraq is no longer a threat, as stated in the Security Agreement itself, and because the UN mandate expires on December 31, 2008, she asserted that there would be no congressional approval for the war as of January 1, 2009. Professor Hathaway argued that only an extension of the UN mandate, or congressional approval of the Security Agreement, would give legal authority for the continuation of the war in Iraq.", "When asked by Members of the Subcommittee about the legality of the Security Agreement if Congress does not approve it, Professor Hathaway stated that it would be unconstitutional in her view. She stated that a challenge in the courts is possible but unlikely to be effective, but legislation from Congress stating that the Security Agreement must be approved by Congress to be legal might be effective in protecting congressional powers against a harmful precedent. She also explained that the President may wish to submit the Security Agreement to Congress for approval, making it a so-called \"ex post congressional-executive agreement.\" In response to questions concerning Congress's ability to pass legislation that changes, reinterprets, or rejects provisions of the Security Agreement, Professor Hathaway stated that the President must agree to any changes to the Security Agreement before they could be effective.", "Iraqi Constitutional Requirements for Ratification of the Iraq Agreements", "Testimony entered into the record from Issam M. Saliba of the Law Library of Congress explained the requirements in the Iraq constitution for ratification of international agreements:", "Article 80, Section 6 authorizes the Council of Ministers or its designee to negotiate and sign international treaties and agreements. Article 73, Section 2 requires international treaties and agreements to be ratified by the COR and confirmed by the President. Article 61, Section 4 authorizes passage of a law by a two-thirds majority regulating ratification of international treaties and agreements. Mr. Saliba stated that the ratification law required by Article 64 could contain different requirements for different types of agreements. He stated, however, that the COR has not yet passed the ratification law, and therefore there is no legal basis for asserting that the Iraq Agreements may be ratified by a simple majority of the COR. He argued that a two-thirds majority vote of the COR approving either of the Iraq Agreements would be legally valid under the constitution, as the number of COR members approving the individual Agreements would equal the number required to pass the law of ratification. Chairman Delahunt stated that the Speaker of the COR at the time, Dr. Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, agreed with this legal assessment. ", "Raed Jarrar, Iraq consultant to the American Friends Service Committee, testified that many political factions within the COR oppose entering into the Iraq Agreements at this time, arguing that the COR has not been adequately involved in the negotiation of the Iraq Agreements, and that it needed more than a few days to consider the agreement. Members of the COR had also expressed concerns about Article 29 of the Security Agreement, Mr. Jarrar stated, as that article permits the parties to enter into additional implementation agreements, presumably without additional parliamentary approval. Recently, Mr. Jarrar explained, political parties aligned with the Prime Minister began to assert that the agreement could be passed by a simple majority in the COR. He expressed his opinion that this argument was politically motivated, because (1) the proposed law on ratifications would call for a two-thirds vote on the Agreements, support the government did not have, and (2) Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani insisted that the Agreements be presented to the COR for approval at this time. He was of the opinion that a bare-majority vote in the COR on the Iraq Agreements may be cause for renewed splits among different groups in Iraq. Mr. Jarrar also mentioned that the Iraqi constitutional court, which would rule on constitutional issues such as these, has not yet been created. He stated it is possible that the court, once in operation, would judge the Security Agreement invalid due to the COR's possible circumvention of constitutional requirements for ratification.", "International Law Issues Concerning the Iraq Agreements and Extension of the UN Mandate", "Professor Michael Matheson testified on the U.N. Security Council's resolution procedures and their possible use to extend the U.N. mandate for Iraq. He stated that a new Security Council resolution could be passed as it exists now, as a Chapter VII mandate requiring a threat to international peace and security, or as a Chapter VI mandate, which requires the invitation of foreign troops into the host country. A Chapter VI mandate, he explained, would not have any derogatory effect on Iraqi sovereignty, and would allow U.S. forces to continue to operate in Iraq with the same legal status and protections. Professor Matheson stated that certain Chapter VII resolutions would remain in effect, however, including those concerning protection of Iraqi oil assets and the U.N. regime on compensation of Kuwaiti victims of the first Gulf War."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
