For such reasons, the manufacturing sector has received the attention of the federal government since the nation's founding. ", "Critics of a strong federal role provide a variety of arguments. For example, some contend that such interventions skew technology development and competition by replacing market-based decisions of companies, capital providers, and researchers with the judgment of government bureaucrats or politicians (sometimes referred to as the government \"picking winners and losers\"). Those who hold this view generally assert that this may result in inefficient allocation of capital, development and deployment of inferior technologies, and political favoritism (sometimes referred to as \"crony capitalism\"). Others assert that such interventions often represent a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to already-prosperous companies and their shareholders (sometimes referred to as \"corporate welfare\").

Expressed concerns of those holding this view include", "a \"hollowing-out\" of U.S. manufacturing resulting from the decision of many U.S. manufacturers to move production activities and other corporate functions (e.g., research and development, accounting, information technology, tax planning, legal research) offshore; focused efforts by other nations to grow the size, diversity, and technological prowess of their manufacturing capabilities and to attract manufacturing operations of U.S.-headquartered multinational companies using a variety of policy tools (e.g., tax holidays, worker training incentives, market access, and access to rare earth minerals); and a decades-long declining trend in U.S. manufacturing employment, punctuated by a steeper drop from 2001 to 2010. In January 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment fell to its lowest level (11.5 million) since March 1941, down more than 41% from its peak of 19.6 million in June 1979.", "In support of the President's proposal for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, DC-based think tank, articulated a variety of reasons why there is a need for an NMI-like federal program in a report titled Why America Needs a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation . Among the ITIF's assertions:", "An NMI-like program would address two issues important to U.S. manufacturing competitiveness: technology and talent. Spillovers from successful innovations resulting from a firm's investments can yield substantial benefits captured by competitors producing a market failure that results in underinvestment in manufacturing R&D and innovation. Other types of market failures\u2014for example, the need for large-scale capital investments and training outlays that may require many years to pay off\u2014may \"limit the scale-up of innovative manufacturing processes, the installation of new capital equipment, and the full integration of manufacturing systems across supply chains.\" Foreign governments engage in a variety of policy and programmatic activities designed to attract U.S. and other manufacturing firms to their countries; subsidize and protect domestic producers; or \"repress labor, condone intellectual property theft, and manipulate their currency values in order to expand their manufacturing footprint.\" The federal government provides little support for manufacturing-focused U.S. based research activities: such funding is scattered among multiple agencies and \"has rarely been a priority for any of them.\" This position contends that U.S. academia, in general, does not incentivize engineering advances and practical problem-solving, but rather \"originality and breakthroughs.\" The emphasis on \"engineering as a science\" in U.S. academic engineering programs contributes further to this bias.", "Other analysts see the U.S. manufacturing sector as vibrant and healthy. Those holding this view tend to point to, among other things, the sector's strong growth in output and productivity, as well as the United States' substantial share (17.4%) of global manufacturing value-added (second only to China, 22.4%). In addition, between January 2010 and September 2014, manufacturing employment added approximately 707,000 jobs, growing to 12.2 million. In addition, many analysts attribute U.S. manufacturing employment losses to broader global technology and business trends, such as technology-driven productivity improvements, increases in capital-labor substitution, movement of labor-intensive production activities to lower wage regions of the world, foreign competition in manufactured goods in both U.S. and foreign markets, and disaggregation of work processes resulting in the contracting of service work previously performed by employees of manufacturing firms as well as the offshoring of manufacturing activities.", "Independent of their perspective on the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector, some analysts may believe that there should not be an NMI program. Some may assert that the role envisioned for the NMI should be performed by the private sector; that the federal government should not favor or subsidize particular companies, industries, or technologies; that the NMI would be ineffective or counterproductive; that the funds that would go to the NMI should be used to support manufacturing in other ways; that the funds should be used for different federal functions altogether; or that the funds should be directed toward deficit reduction. ", "Some may also believe that the NMI is, in part or in whole, duplicative of other federal programs, such as the NIST Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AmTech) consortia program or the Manufacturing Extension Partnership; or, as a new and separate program, represents an increasing fragmentation of federal efforts to help manufacturers. Some may question whether additional federal funding will produce more innovation and whether and how the U.S. manufacturing base will effectively absorb such innovations.", "Others may prefer an expanded direct role for the federal government. This could include increasing federal funding for manufacturing R&D, providing grants and loan guarantees for domestic manufacturing, and, in some cases, subsidizing production of products for which there are deemed positive benefits for the nation that cannot be captured by the manufacturer.", "Still others argue that long-term employment losses in manufacturing are inevitable and that federal policy should focus elsewhere. In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal article, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that, \"The economic challenge of the future will not be producing enough. It will be providing enough good jobs.\" Summers described the loss of manufacturing jobs over the long-term as \"inexorable and nearly universal,\" a result of technology and market forces mirroring the earlier loss of agricultural jobs, only, he added, this \"change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy.\" Summers did not offer a prescriptive alternative, but rather stated the need for government policies and approaches that \"meet the needs of the information age.\" ", "When considered in the context of the overall U.S. economy, manufacturing output, or federal spending, the NMI appropriations authorizations provided in P.L. 113-235 are relatively small. Nevertheless, both proponents and opponents of the NMI may see such appropriations authorizations as opening the door to future increases in funding for the NMI as well as establishing a precedent for the creation of additional programs of a similar nature for manufacturing or other sectors of the U.S. economy.
