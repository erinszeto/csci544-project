Depending on the severity of the storm and resulting impairment, power outages can last a few hours or extend to periods of several days, and have real economic effects. Power outages can impact businesses (primarily through lost orders and damage to perishable goods and inventories), and manufacturers (mainly through downtime and lost production, or equipment damage). Data from various studies lead to cost estimates from storm-related outages to the U.S. economy at between $20 billion and $55 billion annually. Data also suggest the trend of outages from weather-related events is increasing.", "Suggested solutions for reducing impacts from weather-related outages include improved tree-trimming schedules to keep rights-of-way clear, placing distribution and some transmission lines underground, implementing Smart Grid improvements to enhance power system operations and control, inclusion of more distributed generation, and changing utility maintenance practices and metrics to focus on power system reliability. However, most of these potential solutions come with high costs which must be balanced against the perceived benefits.", "A number of options exist for Congress to consider which could help reduce storm-related outages. These range from improving the quality of data on storm-related outages, to a greater strategic investment in the U.S. electricity grid. Congress could empower a federal agency to develop standards for the consistent reporting of power outage data. While responsibility for the reliability of the bulk electric system is under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (as per the Energy Policy Act of 2005), no central responsibility exists for the reliability of distribution systems. One possible option could be to bring distribution systems under the Electric Reliability Organization for reliability purposes. Recovery after storm-related outages might be enhanced by a federal role in formalizing the review or coordination of electric utility mutual assistance agreements (MAAs). This would not necessarily mean federal approval of MAAs, but may help in the cooperative coordination of additional federal and state resources, especially in a wide, multi-state weather event. While there has been much discussion of transmission system inadequacies and inefficiencies, many distribution systems are in dire need of upgrades or repairs. The cost of upgrading the U.S. grid to meet future uses is expected to be high, with the American Society of Civil Engineers estimating a need of $673 billion by 2020. While the federal government recently made funding available of almost $16 billion for specific Smart Grid projects and new transmission lines under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, there has not been a comprehensive effort to study the needs, set goals, and provide targeted funding for modernization of the U.S. grid as part of a long-term national energy strategy.

As such, power outages can result from seasonal storms which often combine the furies of wind, rain, snow, or ice. The more severe weather events usually cause the greatest damage to electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure as damage can result from trees or branches falling on electricity lines. While data on storm-related power outages exist, they are not generally considered to be complete or well-characterized with regard to the cause of the outage event. It has been estimated that 90% of customer outage-minutes are due to events which affect local distribution systems.

It also noted that some of the reported events have \"multiple initiating\" causes, since some events (such as lightning) can trigger other outages or operator errors.", "A 2004 study by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) looking at power interruptions characterized power outages as being of short duration lasting less than five minutes, and sustained duration outages lasting longer than five minutes (and extending to hours or days). Power outages caused by storm-related events can vary in duration but tend to be sustained disruptions. The study noted that weather-related events are not always captured in power outage data.", "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) maintains its own database of grid disturbance events. A\u00a0recent analysis by LBL's Evan Mills of the DOE database shows an increasing number of outages from 1992 to 2010, all dominated by weather-related events (see Figure 2 ). According to Mills, approximately 78% of the reported 1,333 electric grid disruptions in the period were weather-related (i.e., caused by temperature extremes, ice/snow/winter storm, thunderstorm/tornado/lightning, windstorm/hurricane/severe storm, and undefined weather events), and the grid disruptions affected 178 million metered customers. ", "According to graphs shown in Figure 2 , the number of observed outages from weather-related incidents seems to be increasing.

However, when compared statistically to other nations, the U.S. grid does not necessarily meet those expectations. ", "There are two main indices generally used to measure reliability. The system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) represents the average amount of time per year that power supply to a customer is interrupted, expressed in minutes per customer per year. The system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) represents the average number of times per year that the supply to a customer is interrupted, expressed as interruptions per customer per year. However, there is a lack of consistency in how the inputs to these indices are measured, both domestically and internationally. Much of the discrepancy again concerns whether or how storm-related outage events are counted as outage events. Some jurisdictions, both in the United States and internationally, consider storm-related outages as \"extreme\" events, and thus are not included in power outage statistics. Additionally, what is considered as unusual weather in one region may not be counted as unusual in another region. ", "It should be noted, however, that weather circumstances that occur occasionally should not be considered as exceptional events. For example, snowstorms are not an exceptional event in Sweden, but could be seen as an exceptional event in southern Greece. Similarly, very hot temperature for sustained periods of time is not an exceptional event in Greece, but could be considered so in Sweden. Lightning should not be treated as an exceptional event anywhere in Europe.", "SAIDI and SAIFI reliability indices for nine industrial countries are summarized in Table 2 . As can be seen, the United States has the highest average annual outage time per customer, and the third-highest average annual number of supply outages per customer. ", "It should be noted that many European countries consider the threshold for defining an extended outage as longer than three minutes instead of the five minute standard generally used in the United States. European countries also commonly have a single regulatory body which is responsible for reliability of the entire nation's power system. These authorities generally authorize expenditures for improving the reliability of service. Overseeing the reliability of the bulk power system in the United States is the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as per EPACT, but responsibility for maintaining the reliability of the nation's electricity distribution systems is the responsibility of many state and local regulatory bodies. It is also likely that the physical size of the United States, and the historical weather extremes possible in any given season across the country, contribute to the U.S. standing in the statistics of Table 2 . ", "However, the generally degraded condition of the U.S. electric grid's infrastructure also likely contributes to the statistical quandary. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has labeled the nation's grid as a \"patchwork system\" that may ultimately break down without a massive investment of an estimated $673 billion by 2020.

Specific industries include paper; chemicals; petroleum; rubber and plastic; stone, clay, and glass; and primary metals.", "Fabrication and essential services (FES). This sector includes all other manufacturing industries, plus utilities and transportation facilities such as railroads and mass transit, water and wastewater treatment, and gas utilities and pipelines.", "These three sectors accounted for almost 40% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2001, but disruptions to especially the DE and FES sectors impact other sectors of the economy through the services they provide. ", "EPRI recognized that the economic cost of power outages was largely related to the length of the outage (while noting even short duration outages of a few minutes could have large costs), and estimated the average cost of a one-hour outage for manufacturing and DE firms at $7,795 per firm. While the estimate recognizes that typically most companies experienced a much smaller loss (with a one-hour outage costing 56% of all DE, CPM, and FES establishments less than $500), the number was weighted by the much larger losses experienced by a few companies. An estimated 5% of establishments in these sectors incurred costs from a one-hour outage of $20,000 or more, with costs for individual establishments ranging as high as $1.5 million. ", "EPRI estimated the annual cost of outages across all U.S. business sectors at $104 billion to $164 billion in 2001. With EPRI estimating the average number of power outages in a year over five minutes at 43% (see Figure 3 ), a reasonable estimate for the annual economic cost yields a possible $20 billion to $31 billion (using the Hines estimate of 44% of outages as weather-related) as a lower range. On the higher end (using Mills's estimate of 78% of outages as weather-related), an estimate of the cost yields $35 billion to $55 billion for annual weather-related outage costs.", "The 2004 LBL report estimated (in its base case) economic costs of sustained power interruptions at $26 billion, with the outages resulting from all causes including weather. In recognition of uncertainties in the data, LBL stated that the true cost of sustained outages could be higher or lower by tens of billions of dollars.

Minimum vegetation clearance distances are calculated by formula, varying from 0.82 feet (for a 69 kV line) to 8.06 feet (for a 765 kV line). NERC's tree-trimming standard does not apply to low-voltage distribution lines, which are typically less than 69 kV. ", "NERC's reliability rules do not apply to distribution utilities which are commonly subject to state jurisdiction. Consequently, there is no national law mandating minimum standards for vegetation management around distribution lines. Schedules for tree-trimming have come under scrutiny as some utilities appear to be increasing the period between these operations as they seek to reduce maintenance costs. Some state and local jurisdictions have instituted laws or regulations for tree-trimming or vegetation management. For example, New York and several states in New England require electric distribution utilities to submit a plan for tree-trimming and vegetation management for approval by a state utility commission.", "Although each company develops its own plan, subject to state approval, they tend to maintain an eight- to 10-foot clearance around the sides and bottom of a power line and a 12- to 15-foot clearance above it. Trimming cycles range from every four to seven years, with additional trimming and vegetation management for areas that have been problematic in the past.", "Nevertheless, vigilant maintenance of vegetation clearances for power line rights-of-way are generally seen as a good practice that may help to minimize storm-related outages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Undergrounding of Distribution/Transmission Lines", "paragraphs": ["The practice of putting electricity distribution lines underground has come to be called \"undergrounding.\" In both urban and suburban areas, the practice is common for new construction or in areas being redeveloped to improve aesthetics.

", "Underground transmission can be used in urban areas or in other locations where the use of overhead transmission lines may be technically challenging or undesirable. Examples of these situations may include instances when traversing an overland route is difficult, where rivers or natural obstacles exist, or when the line passes through land with a scenic or environmental value judged too great to disturb with an overhead transmission line. Underground transmission may also be less of a regulatory obstacle for these reasons. Underground lines are also safer for wildlife (i.e., a lessened risk of electrical shock) and have far fewer long-term visual impacts. ", "The cost of burying power lines has been estimated as being from ten to twenty times more expensive than overhead cables, with topography, subsurface conditions, and opportunity to use existing underground conduit among the factors contributing to the differences in cost estimates. While underground lines are less prone to severe weather events, maintenance costs may be higher, especially if the line has to be unearthed or brought to the surface for repair, or if the area is prone to flooding. Thus, the perceived benefits of burying power lines sometimes comes at a cost which communities are not willing to accept. Costs of undergrounding are usually passed along to electricity customers, and collected over an assumed average 25-year service life. Some utilities are also willing to share the cost with communities as they may derive some benefits from undergrounding.

The \"Smart Grid\" is the name given to the evolving electric power network as new information technology systems and capacities are incorporated. A lot has been said about how the Smart Grid can potentially improve electric utility services, but many customers apparently have yet to be convinced that a Smart Grid will benefit them. Smart Grid improvements could help to avoid power outages, as the system would be able to detect problems, and potentially re-route power while alerting system operators to the location of the issue. ", "Much of the Smart Grid would conceivably be deployed on electricity distribution systems. However, the privacy of customer information has been raised as an issue with smart meters (which relay information related to a customer's electricity usage back to the electric utility). Rate increases have accompanied Smart Grid-related projects in some states, as most of the costs related to smart meters have been directly passed on to electricity customers. Some state jurisdictions are requiring cost-benefit analyses before approving Smart Grid expenditures in rates.

Microgrids are another form of distributed generation. DOE estimated that as of 2007, there were more than 12 million distributed generation units installed across the United States, with a total capacity of 200 GigaWatts. ", "Since distributed generation can directly serve the power consumer without external power lines, it is far less vulnerable to the kinds of weather-related service interruptions that can affect utility power systems. DOE stated that \"weather is the primary reason for reliability problems, and includes problems caused by lightning strikes, high winds, snowfall, ice, and unexpectedly hot weather. The goal of both planners and operators is to have as resilient a system as possible that can adjust to problems without causing major consequences, and that when outages do occur, they are short-lived and affect the fewest number of customers as possible.\" Aside from the potential to provide back-up power to the customer in the event of an outage, DOE found there were other potential benefits to system reliability from distributed generation. ", "Several utilities offer financial incentives to owners of emergency power units to make them available to grid operators during times of system need. Several regions offer financial incentives or price signals to customers to reduce demand during times of system need (e.g., demand response programs), and some participants in these programs use distributed generation to maintain near-normal on-site operations while they reduce their demand for grid-connected power.", "DOE further observed that distributed generation can add diversity to power supply options, thus leading to improvements in overall system adequacy.

Adequate funds are being spent on maintenance and reliability. Restoration strategies, plans, and practices meet standard utility practices, but more effective resource acquisition (mutual aid) practices need to be employed, such as getting crews on the road earlier and allowing utilities to recover these costs even if they are not used.

", "Regulatory efforts, with regard to maintenance, follow two general approaches: development of time-based maintenance intervals with compliance reporting, typically on an annual basis; and development of a higher level maintenance approach with assessments or self-certification. Time-based maintenance may be cost effective for some technologies, but it is likely not effective for all assets. As more utilities evaluate the RCM model, regulators will have to review the benefits and accept the model as part of a cost effective maintenance program. If RCM-type approaches are proven to be effective, but are not accepted by the commissions, utilities will be forced to continue to use the time based methodology and may face a \"wall\" where assets will need to be replaced in large quantities. As a result, utilities may begin a large-scale and unfocused replacement strategy that does not produce commensurate reliability.", "However, the study noted that some state jurisdictions have instituted quality-of-service benchmarks for electric utilities, with penalties imposed on utilities not achieving reliability performance targets. The study observed that penalties rather than rewards would be the focus, as \"many state regulators feel that utilities should not be rewarded for service they should already be providing. Second, many regulators believe that there is no tangible benefit to most customers when a utility achieves performance beyond targets.\" Additionally, those customers willing to pay a premium for reliability (the study reasoned) would likely install their own back-up or distributed generation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mutual Assistance Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Depending on the size and extent of a storm causing an outage, a utility may find it necessary to call upon other utilities via its mutual assistance agreements (MAAs) to help it restore services.
