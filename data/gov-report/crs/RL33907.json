It acts as a guarantee that the federal government will buy successfully developed countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). It allows the government to enter into contracts to procure countermeasures while they still are in development, up to eight years before product delivery is expected. The government guarantees that it will buy a certain quantity at a specified price, once the countermeasure meets specific requirements. The government pays the agreed-upon amount only after these requirements are met and the product is delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile. If the product does not meet the requirements within the specified time frame, the contract can be cancelled without any payment to the contractor. Thus, Project BioShield is intended to reduce the developer's market risk; that is, the possibility that no customer will buy the successfully developed product. However, it does not reduce the development risk; that is, the possibility that the countermeasure will fail during development.

Botulinum toxin has several different types; an antitoxin against one type will not be effective against other types. This contract calls for a combination of antitoxins that will work against seven types of botulinum toxins. This combination is known as heptavalent antitoxin.

In 2004, after the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 provided the advance appropriation, but before the Project BioShield Act was enacted, HHS obligated $50 million from this account to support the botulinum antitoxin program. These funds were used to process existing horse blood that had been collected by the DOD and to establish horse farms needed to provide new horse blood. This expenditure would probably not have been eligible for funding from this account after enactment of the Project BioShield Act, as it limited the use of these funds to procuring products.

It is not clear what these amounts represent. The $50 million HHS obligated for the botulinum antitoxin program support could fall under the \"other services\" category, since it was not an acquisition per se , but the amount of this contract does not correlate to the amount categorized as \"other services.\"", "Another possibility is that President's Budget accounted for the rPA vaccine contract (awarded in November 2004) in FY2004 rather than FY2005. This interpretation is supported by the FY2007 Budget reporting that only $189 million was obligated in FY2005. However, the total of the $878 million rPA obligation and the $50 million botulinum antitoxin program obligation is greater than the budget authority made available in FY2004 ($885 million). This interpretation also would not account for the division of the funds into the two object classifications.

It created a process for the government to agree to purchase countermeasures while they still are in development. In addition to increasing the holdings of the Strategic National Stockpile, it was hoped that this government market guarantee would encourage companies to continue to develop promising countermeasures that they might have otherwise abandoned, and induce other companies to begin countermeasure development. It remains unclear how well Project BioShield is meeting these goals.", "Many stakeholders, industry leaders, and policymakers have criticized the rate at which DHS completes Material Threat Determinations. To address these concerns, legislation has been introduced in the previous and current Congresses. In the 110 th Congress, the Project BioShield Material Threats Act of 2007 ( H.R. 1089 , Langevin) and the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( H.R. 1684 , Thompson) would require an assessment, and an MTD if appropriate, for all currently known CBRN agents likely to pose a significant national security threat. These assessments would be required to be completed by December 31, 2007. By assessing all known threats and issuing those MTDs necessary, the full spectrum of material threats may be considered when developing a countermeasure acquisition strategy. Such a comprehensive acquisition strategy may allow for more efficient prioritization and balance of countermeasures, providing optimized protection from CBRN attacks using finite funds in the shortest time. Since HHS has not issued contracts for the all of the agents that already have MTDs, an increase in this number may not increase the rate of countermeasure awards. However, HHS has predicted that no additional MTDs would be issued unless \"technology advances or if our understanding of the potential threats changes.\"", "Appropriators set limits on how much could be obligated during specified periods of time. The pace by which HHS awards countermeasure contracts roughly corresponds to these limits. By this criterion, this program is on track to fulfill its goals; HHS cannot obligate the money faster than it becomes available.", "Stakeholders, industry leaders and policymakers have criticized HHS for some of the countermeasures it has chosen. In decisions as complicated and weighty as these, any choice is likely to be criticized. Given the failure of the largest contract to date, some critics may conclude that Project BioShield has fallen short of its goals, since the majority of the money that has been obligated, though not the majority of contracts, has not yet resulted in products in the stockpile. However, one of the unique features of Project BioShield contracts is that the government may contract for products that require up to eight years more of development. It was designed to allow the government to promise to buy something, but only pay for it on delivery. Thus the company, rather than the government, bears the majority of the development risk, i.e. that the product will never be deliverable. One industry group estimates that more than half of all pharmaceuticals will fail during the last eight years of development. Thus, it may be expected that at least some Project BioShield contracts will be cancelled. The government bears some development risk in the form of opportunity costs since the money available for obligation is finite, i.e., money obligated to a countermeasure that will ultimately fail in development cannot be simultaneously obligated to another needed countermeasure.", "It is possible that the establishment of the Biodefense Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS will reduce the likelihood that future Project BioShield contracts will fail during the advanced development phase. Established by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act ( P.L. 109-417 ), one of BARDA's roles is to support the advanced research and development of promising countermeasures. In theory, funding this part of the development process through such a dedicated mechanism could allow countermeasures to further mature through the development process longer before competing for a Project BioShield contract. This could reduce the risk that a countermeasure will fail while under a Project BioShield contract. P.L. 109-417 included authorization for approximately $1 billion to support this type of activity for FY2007 through FY2008. Although, Congress did not appropriate money for BARDA in FY2007, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 ( P.L. 110-28 ) transferred $99 million from National Institutes of Health accounts to fund BARDA. Even if BARDA becomes operational in FY2007, it will take some time to determine what projects to fund, provide funding, and receive returns on this investment. It remains to be seen how HHS' decision to combine BARDA with the HHS office responsible for executing Project BioShield (Office of Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures) will affect the execution of both programs.", "Additional criticism of the Project BioShield procurement process may stem from the perceived opacity of its decision-making process. HHS is moving to address some of these issues by publishing its PHEMCE Strategy for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Threats , inviting public comment, and reaching out to the public and companies that might develop needed countermeasures through stakeholder meetings.", "Some critics also suggest that the Project BioShield process has been poorly managed overall. Such suggestions are reinforced by the annual accounting discrepancies between HHS and DHS. It remains to be seen whether these concerns will be allayed through the management changes being implemented subsequent to: the establishment of the Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) and publication of its strategy; the enactment of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act ( P.L. 109-417 ); and the issuance of HSPD-18."], "subsections": []}]}}
