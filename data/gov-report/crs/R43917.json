TIP is of significant interest to the United States as a serious human rights concern, and it is believed to be one of the most prolific areas of contemporary criminal activity. TIP is both an international and domestic crime that involves violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards, as well as criminal law. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA)\u2014most recently reauthorized in March 2013 (Title XII of P.L. 113-4)\u2014is the primary law that addresses human trafficking. Domestically, anti-TIP efforts provided under the TVPA include protection for victims, the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses, and education of the public. This report discusses TIP issues that have received legislative action or are of significant interest in the 114th Congress.", "As human trafficking issues intersect with many different policy areas (e.g., immigration, child welfare, the criminal justice system, missing and exploited youth), legislation to address human trafficking is varied. This is illustrated by the panoply of bills that have recently passed the House. For example, the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of 2015 (H.R. 350), Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act of 2015 (H.R. 398), and the Human Trafficking Prioritization Act (H.R. 514), as passed by the House, would address interagency coordination, efficiency, and best practices as they relate to combating human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Prevention Act (H.R. 357) and the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460), as passed by the House, would enhance training for officials to help identify victims of trafficking. The International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 515), as passed by the House, would create a new center in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that would be responsible for notifying the destination country of international travel by child-sex offenders, where appropriate.", "Several other bills, as passed by the House, would strengthen the federal and state responses to trafficking through a variety of service systems. H.R. 246, To Improve the Response to Victims of Child Sex Trafficking, would ensure that reports to a federally funded tipline of sexually exploited children can include children who are victims of sex trafficking. The Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Youth Victims for Youth Trafficking Act of 2015 (H.R. 468) would use the Runaway and Homeless Youth program as a vehicle to enhance services to youth who are vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking. The Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act of 2015 (H.R. 469) would strengthen state child welfare agencies' responses to the trafficking of children.", "A number of bills would amend criminal justice policy in an attempt to obstruct human trafficking. For instance, the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015 (SAVE Act, H.R. 285, as passed by the House), would provide penalties for knowingly advertising, or knowingly selling advertising that offers, certain commercial sex acts. The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act (H.R. 159, as passed by the House, and S. 166, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee) would incentivize states to enact safe harbor legislation\u2014which would ensure that children who are found in prostitution would be treated as victims rather than perpetrators\u2014and increase restitution amounts for victims.", "Several pending bills, such as the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (H.R. 181; S. 178), the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2015 (H.R. 159), and the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of 2015 (H.R. 350), all as passed by the House, would adopt a multi-prong approach to anti-TIP efforts, including improving services to victims. For example, H.R. 181 and S. 178 would create new grant programs for law enforcement and victims services, and would amend the criminal code (Title 18 of the U.S. Code) for certain trafficking-related activities. S. 178 would also impose an additional $5,000 penalty on anyone convicted of certain trafficking-related and other offenses and would establish a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund into which revenues from such penalties would be deposited and used to award certain grants authorized by the TVPA or to enhance victims' services."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The 114 th Congress has made fighting trafficking in persons (TIP) within the United States a legislative priority.

", "The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subject to trafficking in persons. Human trafficking occurs in every state, and it victimizes both U.S. citizens and noncitizens. There are no current, reliable data on the number of individuals trafficked in the United States. However, some have suggested as many as 17,500 may be trafficked into the country each year, and perhaps 100,000 U.S. citizen children may be victims of trafficking within the United States. The trafficking of individuals within U.S. borders is commonly referred to as domestic human trafficking; it occurs primarily for labor, most often in domestic service, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial services, hotel services, construction, health and elder care, hair and nail salons, and strip club dancing. However, more investigations and prosecutions have taken place for sex trafficking offenses than for labor trafficking offenses. ", "Noncitizens are more susceptible than U.S. citizens to labor trafficking, and more foreign victims are found in labor trafficking than in sex trafficking. Migrant labor camps tend to be common settings for labor exploitation and domestic trafficking. Although labor trafficking can happen to U.S. citizens, significantly more U.S. citizens are found in sex trafficking than in labor trafficking. Research indicates that most of the victims of sex trafficking into and within the United States are women and children. ", "Domestically, anti-TIP efforts include protection for victims, education of the public, and the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses. The Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL) have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide assistance specific to the needs of trafficking victims. This includes temporary housing, independent living skills, cultural orientation, transportation, job training, mental health counseling, and legal assistance. A number of federal agencies administer public awareness campaigns on recognizing human trafficking victims. The majority of cases investigated at the federal level are handled by agents in DOJ's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS') U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), among others, who coordinate as appropriate. These cases are prosecuted by DOJ. ", "For more than a decade, Congress has been actively legislating to counter domestic human trafficking. Through the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386 ) and its four reauthorizations (TVPRAs), Congress has aimed to eliminate human trafficking within the United States by creating domestic grant programs for both victims and law enforcement, enhancing criminal laws, and conducting oversight on the effectiveness and implications of U.S. anti-TIP policy. The most recent reauthorization of the TVPA was in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Title XII of P.L. 113-4 ).

Actors engaged in human trafficking range from family-run organizations to sophisticated transnational organized crime syndicates. Trafficking victims are often subjected to mental and physical abuse in order to control them. Abuses may include debt bondage, social isolation, removal of identification cards and travel documents, violence, and threat of reprisals against them or their families.

Related to this is whether current services are adequate to combat sex trafficking of minors in the United States (i.e., the prostitution of children). There is confusion over whether U.S. citizens, as well as noncitizens, are eligible for services under all the anti-trafficking grant programs authorized by the TVPA, and whether Congress has provided funding for programs that target U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident (LPR) victims. Under the TVPA, DOJ, HHS, and DOL have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide services to trafficking victims. Only the DOJ and HHS programs receive specified funding for trafficking victims services.", "A related issue is the overall amount of funding for victims services, especially as the focus on sex trafficking is broadening to include minor sex trafficking victims in the United States who are U.S. citizens. Between FY2002 and FY2013, Congress appropriated approximately $20 million each year for victims services, and the amount was increased to approximately $28 million in FY2014 and approximately $58 million in FY2015. Between FY2009 and FY2013, HHS used all of its appropriated money on services for trafficking victims before the end of the fiscal year\u2014and all of the services were provided to noncitizen victims. Notably, the Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report , FY2012 recommended increasing funding for relevant agencies to provide victims services. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) report a critical need for an increase in the overall funding for comprehensive services.", "The 113 th Congress amended certain grant programs so that sex trafficking victims would be eligible for victims services programs. For example, the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA, P.L. 113-4 ) clarifies that victims services and legal assistance under VAWA include services and assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons . In addition, P.L. 113-4 amended the purpose for grants to tribal governments to combat violence against women to include sex trafficking and created a new purpose area to provide services to address the needs of youth who are victims of several crimes, including sex trafficking. The act also created a new tribal coalition grant program (administered by DOJ), which, among other purposes, seeks to enhance access to essential services for Indian women victimized by domestic and sexual violence, including sex trafficking; and to assist Indian tribes in developing and promoting state, local, and tribal laws and policies that enhance best practices for responding to violent crimes against Indian women, including sex trafficking. In addition, P.L. 113-4 amended the grant program for state and local law enforcement's anti-trafficking programs focusing on U.S. citizen victims so that these grants can be used for anti-trafficking programs for noncitizen victims as well.

The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2015 ( H.R. 159 and S. 166 ) would require, beginning in FY2017, that the Secretary of HHS make grants for a national communications system to help victims of severe forms of trafficking communicate with service providers. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 ( H.R. 181 and S. 178 ) would, among other things, add additional rights for victims of federal crime, including the right to be informed in a timely manner of court agreements and, with some exceptions, to be informed about certain victims services.

CACs are located in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The law also requires the establishment and support of four regional children's advocacy centers to increase the number of communities with CACs, help improve their practices, and support development of state chapter organizations for CACs.

In addition, H.R. 181 would direct grantees receiving funding for CACs or training and technical assistance to meet certain oversight and accountability requirements, and to disclose other sources of federal funding. Separately, the bills would enable DOJ to make grants for the development and implementation of specialized programs to identify and provide direct services to victims of child pornography.", "As mentioned, S. 178 would establish a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund. The bill would direct the Attorney General, in coordination with the HHS Secretary, to use the amounts available in the fund to, among other things, award grants or enhance victims programming provided through grants for CACs (and specified activities under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act).

Child victims of sex trafficking may come to the attention of a child welfare agency if they are reported to an agency's child protective services (CPS) hotline. Children in foster care\u2014who are placed out of their homes typically due to abuse or neglect by their parents or caregivers\u2014may be vulnerable to trafficking. Youth who run away from foster care are perceived to be especially susceptible to this type of victimization. The capacity for state and local child welfare agencies to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims is believed to be limited. This may be due, in part, to inadequate training, insufficient resources, high caseloads, and the perception that victims should be handled in the juvenile justice system. In addition, states may not have mechanisms in place to \"screen in\" cases involving a child who is sex trafficked because the perpetrator involved is not the child's parent or caregiver as these terms are defined under state law. ", "The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act ( P.L. 113-183 ), enacted in September 2014, specified a new role for state child welfare agencies in responding to child sex trafficking. Specifically, it amended the federal foster care program (authorized in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) to require state child welfare agencies to develop and implement procedures to identify, document in agency records, and determine appropriate services for certain children or youth who are victims of sex trafficking, or at risk of being such victims. The procedures need to ensure relevant training for caseworkers and must be developed in consultation with state and local law enforcement, juvenile justice systems, health care providers, education agencies, and organizations with experience in dealing with at-risk children and youth. ", "The law further requires state child welfare agencies to report (1) information it receives on missing and abducted children to NCMEC and to law enforcement authorities for inclusion in the NCIC database; and (2) to HHS annually on the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims. The procedures to identify, document in agency records, and determine services for victims of, or those at risk of, sex trafficking must apply to all children in the care, placement, or supervision of the state child welfare agency. In addition, a state may elect to use these procedures to identify individuals up to the age of 26 who are victims, or at risk of becoming victims, of sex trafficking without regard to whether the youth was ever in foster care. Separately, HHS is required under the law to establish a national advisory committee on child sex trafficking that must develop policies on improving the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking, among other responsibilities.", "A pending bill, the Strengthening the Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act of 2015 ( H.R. 469 ), seeks to reinforce some of these same concepts via the state grants program under Section 106 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). The bill would seek to ensure that initial investigation and assessment of child trafficking occurs, and to support states in developing procedures with regard to child victims of labor trafficking as well. Funding for CAPTA state grants is provided to help states improve their child welfare systems and may be used for a range of purposes specified in the law. As part of their CAPTA state plans submitted to HHS, states are required to have a statewide law or program to receive and respond to allegations of child abuse or neglect, ensure children's safety, and provide appropriate referrals; and to have in place other procedures to respond to abused and neglected children. ", "H.R. 469 would add that the state plans must include provisions and procedures related to sex trafficking of children. Specifically, such provisions and procedures would have to address (1) identifying and assessing reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims, (2) training representatives of the state child protective services about identifying and assessing such children, and (3) identifying services (including services provided by state law enforcement officials, the state juvenile justice system, and social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters) and procedures for appropriately referring child victims of sex trafficking to address their needs. Further, the bill would permit states to develop these same provisions and procedures for children who are victims of labor trafficking. States would also be required to include in their annual data reports to HHS the number of children identified as sex trafficking victims, and if applicable, labor trafficking victims. ", "Separately, H.R. 469 would direct HHS to report to Congress on child sex and labor trafficking, including (1) the specific type and prevalence of severe forms of trafficking (both sex and labor trafficking) perpetrated against children who have been identified for services or intervention while under the care and placement of the child welfare agency (including a state or Indian child welfare agency or Indian tribe); (2) the practices and protocols used by states under the CAPTA state grants program to identify and serve children who are, or are at-risk of becoming, victims of trafficking; and (3) any barriers in federal laws or regulations that may prevent identifying and assessing children who are such victims, including an evaluation of the extent to which states are able to address the needs of trafficked children without amending the definition of \"abuse and neglect\" under CAPTA.

The new grant program authorizes DOJ, in consultation with HHS, to award one-year grants to six grantees to combat sex trafficking of children in the United States. Of the grant amounts, at least 67% must be allocated to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to provide counseling, legal services, shelter, clothing, and other social services to victims, while not less than 10% must be allocated to provide services to victims or training for service providers on sex trafficking of children.", "Likewise, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 ( H.R. 181 and S. 178 ) would authorize the Attorney General to make grants to an eligible entity to develop, improve, or expand domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs designed to aid victims while investigating and prosecuting the trafficking offenses. An eligible entity is a state or unit of local government that meets specified criteria. The grants could be used to establish or enhance specialized training programs on the prevention of child trafficking for law enforcement, first responders, health care officials, child welfare officials, juvenile justice personnel, prosecutors, and judicial personnel; establish law enforcement and prosecution units dedicated to fighting trafficking of children; and establish or enhance court programs to assist child trafficking victims. S. 178 would authorize DOJ to use the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund (as would be established by the bill) to carry out these grants.

In addition, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act ( P.L. 113-183 ) requires HHS to establish, by September 2016, the National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States to improve the nation's response to sex trafficking and develop best practices and recommendations for states to combat sex trafficking of children, among other duties.
