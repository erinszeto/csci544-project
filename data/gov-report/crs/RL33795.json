{"id": "RL33795", "title": "Avian Influenza in Poultry and Wild Birds", "released_date": "2007-03-29T00:00:00", "summary": ["Avian influenza is a viral disease that primarily infects birds, both domestic and wild. Certain strains of bird flu break the avian barrier and have been known to infect other animals and humans. Avian flu viruses are common among wild bird populations, which act as a reservoir for the disease. While rarely fatal in wild birds, avian flu is highly contagious and often fatal in domestic poultry, prompting strict biosecurity measures on farms. International trade restrictions imposed by countries to counter avian flu can have large economic effects.", "The H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has spread throughout Asia since 2003, infecting mostly poultry, some wild birds, and a limited number of humans through close domestic poultry-to-human contact. The virus has spread beyond Asia, reaching Europe in 2005 and the Middle East and Africa in 2006. Over 250 million poultry have died or been destroyed internationally. Human mortality among the more than 275 people infected exceeds 55%. Fears that the virus could mutate to allow efficient human-to-human transmission and cause a human pandemic have prompted a massive political and public health response.", "Since wild birds can carry the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, federal, state, and other agencies have increased surveillance of wild and migratory birds. Surveillance is particularly high in Alaska, where Asian and American flyways overlap. Migrating birds from Asia could carry the virus to Alaska and infect birds from the Americas on shared nesting grounds. The newly infected birds could carry the virus down North American flyways. Alternatively, imports into Central and South America could introduce the virus to the Western Hemisphere, and subsequent wild bird migration could bring the virus north into the United States. The United States also has blocked imports of poultry and poultry products from H5N1-infected countries.", "The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain has not yet been detected in the United States. But surveillance has detected different, low pathogenicity strains in wild bird populations, including a low pathogenicity H5N1. The low pathogenicity strain does not pose the same threat as highly pathogenic H5N1. Even if highly pathogenic H5N1 is found in the Americas, it does not signal the onset of a global human pandemic. The virus apparently has not yet mutated to allow efficient human-to-human transmission, and scientists disagree whether or when this may happen.", "Controlling avian flu in poultry, and to the extent possible in wild birds, is seen as the best way to prevent a human pandemic from developing\u2014by reducing the number of animal hosts in which the virus may evolve. Indemnity payments to compensate farmers for birds destroyed in eradication efforts are seen as an important element of increasing success to control the disease.", "Congressional agriculture committees have held hearings on avian influenza preparedness, and appropriators have increased funding for surveillance and other preparedness activities for poultry and wild birds.", "This report will be updated periodically."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Avian Influenza?", "paragraphs": ["Avian influenza (AI) viruses exist throughout the world in many different strains.

Mortality under highly pathogenic avian flu ranges from 30%-100%, and is usually less than 20% for low pathogenicity.", "Both forms are possible in many strains, designated by the letters H and N. The strain designations refer to surface proteins on the virus called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Each AI virus has one hemagglutinin and one neuraminidase protein. Sixteen H subtypes and nine N subtypes have been identified, and are designated by numbers. They can occur in any combination, resulting in 144 possible strains (for example, H1N1, H7N2, etc.).", "Most strains are low pathogenicity, but some strains (particularly H5 and H7) can mutate from LPAI into HPAI during the course of an outbreak. Globally during the past 20 years, H5 or H7 LPAI viruses have mutated into HPAI on five occasions. Thus, low pathogenicity outbreaks in domestic poultry are treated aggressively.", "Low pathogenicity outbreaks in poultry are not uncommon, since LPAI is entrenched in wild birds. The most recent cases in U.S. poultry occurred in 2004, with low pathogenicity strains of H7N2 in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey; and low pathogenicity H2N2 in Pennsylvania. Separately, an H5N2 strain was found in Texas in 2004 and was classified genetically as highly pathogenic, although it did not manifest as such in terms of mortality. Other recent cases include low pathogenicity outbreaks of H7N2 in the Northeast in 2003, and in the mid-Atlantic in 2002. Only three highly pathogenic outbreaks have occurred in the United States in the past century (1924, 1983, and 2004)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Avian Influenza Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["A strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has spread throughout Asia since 2003, and has subsequently moved into Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Examining migration routes shows how the disease could spread from Asia into North America ( Figure 1 ). Surveillance is particularly high in Alaska, where Asian and American flyways overlap. Migrating birds from Asia could carry the virus to Alaska, and infect birds from the Americas on shared nesting grounds. The newly infected birds could carry the virus down North American flyways. This was particularly a concern through the summer and fall of 2006, but the possibility may return later in 2007, since highly pathogenic H5N1 continues to circulate in Asia.", "Since April 2006, over 107,000 samples have been collected from wild birds. About 19% of those samples are from Alaska, with the remainder spread throughout the lower 48 States. While no instance of highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found to date in North America, the tests have detected other low pathogenicity strains of avian influenza. For example, in August 2006, two wild mute swans in Michigan were confirmed positive for a low pathogenicity strain of H5N1. The swans showed no signs of sickness. This LPAI strain does not threaten poultry or humans like highly pathogenic H5N1, is not in commercial flocks, and was already known to exist in North America.", "Preliminary testing of birds can show positive results for H5N1 for three different reasons. First, if a bird is infected with two different strains of avian influenza, one with H5, and another with N1, the test may be positive. Birds initially testing positive for the presence of both proteins require further testing to determine if the H5N1 viral type itself is present. Second, some forms of H5N1 are low pathogenicity and are already somewhat common in North American wild bird populations. The low pathogenicity H5N1 strain (sometimes called \"North American\" H5N1) is not a human health problem like the highly pathogenic Asian strain of H5N1. Hunters who might eat infected birds, and hunting dogs that might retrieve them, are at no known risk from low pathogenicity H5N1. All the H5N1 virus found to date in the United States and Canada has been LPAI.

The first generally recognized outbreak of the H5N1 strain in wild birds occurred among waterfowl at the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve in west-central China in 2005. In 2005, the virus spread westward toward eastern Europe, being confirmed in six new countries. In 2006, it spread to dozens of new countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that over 250 million poultry have died or been culled internationally.

In wild populations, avian flu is not typically fatal\u2014or even apparent. However, an outbreak of the H5N1 strain is known to have appeared in Qinghai province in China in May 2005. Most of the wild species at greatest risk are highly migratory, e.g., ranging from Siberia to southern Asia, or Norway to central Africa. Many nest in dense aggregations during the breeding season (e.g., many species of terns and gulls), or winter in dense flocks (e.g., many species of gulls, geese, and ducks), or form huge flocks for migration or at migratory stop-over sites (e.g., many species of plovers, sandpipers, and their relatives).

Avian flu is highly contagious in poultry, and more so in crowded conditions. The virus is spread by contact with infected feces, nasal, or eye excretions. The incubation period for avian flu may last as long as 10 days, and the virus may be shed from live poultry for up to 21 days. Confined poultry sheds used in commercial production prevent contact with wild birds and thus reduce a source of infection, but may magnify the economic impact if the virus is introduced. People, clothing, vehicles, and supplies can carry the virus between farms. Thus, strict biosecurity measures are adopted by nearly all U.S. commercial poultry farms, not only to prevent the spread of avian flu, but also to shield the flocks from other infections.", "Avian flu viruses have been common in live bird markets (also known as wet markets ). These markets sell less than 1% of U.S. poultry, but outbreaks concern commercial growers, who practice tighter biosecurity than backyard growers or live bird markets. USDA has focused on these markets because insufficient biosecurity allowed birds and equipment to intermingle at the market and return to farms. Examples of states with live bird markets include New York, New Jersey, and Texas. In Asia, a larger network of live bird markets and backyard farms has made eradication difficult.", "Transportation of roosters for cock fighting, which is illegal in the United States (except in Louisiana and New Mexico) and some other parts of the world, is also a suspected route of disease transmission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transmission Across International Borders", "paragraphs": ["Pathogens may spread across international borders in several ways:", "naturally (e.g., wild bird migration, wind), accidentally (e.g., in legal or smuggled shipments of animals or products that happen to be infected), and intentionally (e.g., legally for controlled use in science, or illegally for crime or terrorism).", "The ability of H5N1 to spread naturally via migratory birds has been discussed above, and such migration cannot be stopped at international political borders. Surveillance programs are designed to detect the pathogen once it crosses a border, and enable a more rapid response than without surveillance.", "To reduce the possibility that highly pathogenic H5N1 enters the United States accidentally or intentionally, the USDA has blocked imports of poultry and poultry products (such as feathers, meat, or eggs) from affected countries, and increased smuggling interdiction efforts. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are considered a select agent under bioterrorism rules (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.3), and are subject to restrictions for their possession, use, and transportation. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) determines the scope of import restrictions regarding live animals and animal products, and issues import and other health regulations. APHIS employs smuggling interdiction units and staff at pre-inspection stations internationally to enforce import restrictions. Moreover, the domestic border inspectors of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection check passengers, cargo, and conveyances (vehicles, ships, and planes) at ports of entry for prohibited items. DHS inspectors include a cadre of agricultural specialists, many of whom were formerly employed by APHIS prior to the transfer of agricultural border inspectors to DHS in 2003.", "Despite the attention given to migratory bird surveillance in North America, some believe that poultry imports into Central and South America are a more likely pathway for the virus to enter the Western Hemisphere.

Infected poultry are very unlikely to enter the food chain, as nearly all commercial growers participate in avian flu testing programs.

Following depopulation, buildings and equipment are rigorously disinfected before new birds are allowed, a process that takes at least several weeks. The virus is killed by common disinfectants or heat (about 160\u00b0 F). Carcass disposal options usually include composting, burial, incineration, or rendering. Affected flocks that are not destroyed eventually may be marketed under controlled conditions with strict waiting periods and additional testing so that the infectious period has passed.", "Federal statute allows the destruction of affected animals (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.4).

USDA also works to lift restrictions once the outbreak is eradicated.", "Domestic outbreaks usually are managed through joint federal, state, and industry cooperation. States usually lead the response for depopulation and quarantines of surrounding areas that are imposed until the disease is eradicated. APHIS provides personnel and equipment to advise and supplement state resources. As part of the National Veterinary Stockpile, USDA has assembled pallets of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other response equipment that can be used when state resources are inadequate.

To qualify for 100% compensation, both the state and the commercial grower must participate in federal and state surveillance plans; otherwise the compensation rate is only 25%. An exception allows small growers to receive 100% compensation, regardless of participation in the surveillance plan. Thus, given expected participation rates among commercial growers and states, nearly all producers and states will qualify for 100% indemnification in an H5 or H7 outbreak.
