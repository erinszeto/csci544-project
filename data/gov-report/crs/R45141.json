The current four-formula strategy has evolved over time, beginning with the Basic Grant formula when the ESEA was originally enacted in 1965. The Concentration Grant formula was added in the 1970s in an attempt to provide additional funding for LEAs with concentrations of poverty. During consideration of ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, there was an attempt to replace the two existing formulas with a new formula that would target Title I-A funds more effectively to areas with concentrations of poverty. Both the House and the Senate developed formulas intended to accomplish this goal (Targeted Grants and EFIG, respectively). A compromise on a single new formula was not reached; nor was there agreement on eliminating the existing formulas. As a result, funds are allocated through four formulas under current law.", "Title I-A grant amounts are primarily driven by the number of \"formula children\"\u2014principally children from low-income families\u2014in an LEA, although all four formulas also include an expenditure factor based on education expenditures, minimum grant provisions, and hold harmless provisions. Since the initial enactment of Title I-A in 1965, the formula(s) have been criticized for being more favorable to more densely populated and typically urban areas due to how children from low-income families are counted, and for being more favorable to wealthier states due to the inclusion of factors based on education expenditures.", "This report analyzes issues related to three of the major debates surrounding the Title I-A formulas: (1) the effect of different formula factors and provisions on grant amounts, (2) whether the formulas are more favorable to certain types of LEAs and states, and (3) how effectively the Title I-A formulas target funds on concentrations of poverty. The report is intended to complement CRS Report R44898, History of the ESEA Title I-A Formulas, which provides a detailed examination of the history of the Title I-A formulas and of the underlying tensions in the policy debates about the design of the formulas from enactment of the original ESEA through enactment of the ESSA. Some of the themes highlighted in this report are as follows.", "All four Title I-A formulas include both formula child counts and state average per pupil expenditures (APPE) as factors used to determine LEA grant amounts. Based on regression analysis, formula child counts are estimated to explain 95% of the variance in overall LEA grant amounts, while APPE is estimated to explain less than 1% of it. A similar pattern is found for each of the individual formulas, with formula child counts estimated to explain between 90% and 98% of the variance in grant amounts under each formula. The state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions that are included in each of the four formulas provide a relatively large increase in overall grant amounts and grant amounts per formula child to the states and LEAs benefitting from these provisions, but result in a relatively small decrease in the Title I-A grant amounts of other states and LEAs. There has been an ongoing debate about whether the Title I-A formulas are more favorable to densely or less densely populated areas. This debate has centered on the relative emphasis that should be placed on the percentage of formula children versus the count of formula children in an LEA. Under current law, the debate is reflected in the two formula child weighting scales used in the determination of grants under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. An LEA's grant is calculated using whichever weighting scale is more favorable. Both formulas were introduced to enhance targeting toward concentrations of low-income students and both apply weights based on the number of formula children served by LEAs or the percentage of an LEA's students that formula children comprise. The percentage weighting scale (intended to be more favorable to less densely populated areas) applies larger weights than the numbers weighting scale (intended to be more favorable to densely populated areas). This has the appearance of being advantageous to less densely populated areas. However, because the top category in each weighting scale is open-ended, LEAs with large numbers of formula children are often able to apply the highest weights in the scale to larger proportions of formula children. As a result, in general, LEAs whose weighted formula child counts are calculated using the numbers scale receive a higher grant per formula child than LEAs whose grants are calculated using the percentage scale. The expenditure factor used in the Title I-A formulas to account for differences in cost of living has changed over time. Historical changes that have placed bounds on the extent to which variation across states' APPE can influence allocations have resulted in the expenditure factor being more closely tied to national APPE. These changes have generally benefitted states with a state APPE that is less than the national APPE and not benefitted states with a state APPE that exceeds the national APPE. When changes to the expenditure factor that would loosen or remove bounds are examined, such changes typically allow it to vary more closely with state APPE and would favor states with relatively high APPEs and be disadvantageous to those with relatively low APPEs. Current expenditure factors allow for some consideration of variation across states' APPE in allocations but also limit the effect of variation on allocations. Since its initial enactment, the Title I-A program has been intended to address the effects that concentrations of low-income families have on the ability of LEAs to provide \"adequate\" educational programs. While there are clearly some concerns about whether having a high number or high percentage of formula children should result in larger LEA grants per formula child, there has also been a broader debate about how much to target Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty and how best to do so. While Title I-A funds currently reach LEAs with varying concentrations of formula children, a proxy measure for concentrations of poverty, the targeting of Title I-A funds on the basis of higher concentrations of formula children has increased over time (measured by either numbers or percentage of such children in LEAs) . The addition of Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG to Title I-A did, to some extent, improve the targeting of funds to LEAs in this manner. Among the four Title I-A formulas, the newest formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG), which are allocating growing shares of Title I-A funds in recent years, appear to be most effective at targeting funds toward higher concentrations of poverty."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education.

The Basic Grant formula is the original Title I-A formula, and has received appropriations each year since FY1966. The Basic Grant formula is the primary vehicle for providing Title I-A funds: it is the formula under which the largest share of funds are allocated (42% of FY2017 appropriations) and under which the largest proportion of LEAs receive funds. Over time, the Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and EFIG formulas have been added to Title I-A to provide additional funds to areas with high numbers or percentages of children from low-income families.

Congress initially accomplished this by allocating Title I-A funds through one formula\u2014Basic Grants. The original Basic Grant formula was based on (1) the number of children from low-income families (commonly referred to as formula children) and (2) each state's average per pupil expenditures (APPE) for public elementary and secondary education. ", "Over time, Congress added three additional formulas that essentially provide supplemental funding to LEAs that serve areas with concentrations of poverty. The Concentration Grant formula was added in the 1970s in an attempt to provide additional funding for LEAs with concentrations of poverty. During the consideration of ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, the House and the Senate proposed formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG, respectively) intended to target concentrations of poverty more effectively by providing more funding per child to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of formula children. As both of these formulas were enacted into law, and the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas were retained, funds are allocated through four formulas under current law. Title I-A has also periodically included a Special Incentive Grant formula, intended to incentivize state and local education spending on elementary and secondary education. This formula was last funded in FY1975.", " Figure 1 shows the years in which the four formulas were authorized and funded. The figure also indicates the ESEA reauthorizations that made substantial changes to them. In some instances, formulas have been funded every year they have been authorized to receive appropriations, as well as in years in which the authorization of appropriations has expired (e.g., Basic Grants). In other instances, formulas were not funded until a subsequent reauthorization made substantial changes to the originally enacted formulas (e.g., EFIG).", "Since FY1966, every formula under the program has included some type of population factor and expenditure factor. Over the years, the children included in the determination of the population factor (referred to as formula children) have changed. The expenditure factors have been altered as well. Changes in both areas have substantial implications for state and LEA grant amounts. In addition, while continuing to focus on the targeting of Title I-A dollars on areas with the greatest concentrations of poverty, Congress has periodically taken steps to help provide smaller states with additional funding to run Title I-A programs through state minimum grant provisions. Congress has also modified the Title I-A allocation formulas over time to include hold harmless provisions to prevent LEAs from losing more than a certain amount of funding from year-to-year, provided appropriations are sufficient to make hold harmless payments.

The EFIG formula also includes two additional measures of state and local funding: an effort factor that is based on a state's education spending relative to personal income, and an equity factor based on the variation in education spending among LEAs within a state. ", "Under three of the Title I-A allocation formulas\u2014Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Targeted Grants\u2014funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of grant allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions.

They have been chosen for analysis because they are core elements in the design of the formulas, and they are known to have a sizable effect on allocations to certain states and LEAs. ", "In each of the formulas, after initial grant awards are calculated through multiplying a formula child count by at least one expenditure factor, grant amounts are reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant and hold harmless provisions. LEAs must also have a minimum number and/or percentage of formula children to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific formula. While these thresholds are important elements in the design of the allocation formulas, this section does not examine their effects on allocations.", "This section begins by examining the role of separate formula factors in determining Title I-A grant amounts.

The initial estimates of the effects of formula factors discussed here are based on regression analyses presented in Appendix D . ", "One way regression analysis can be used to illuminate the extent to which various formula factors contribute to grant calculations is by examining how much variance in grant amounts is \"explained\" by each formula factor ( Table D-1 and Table D-2 ). With respect to formula child counts and APPE, formula child counts are estimated to explain 95% of the variance in overall LEA grant amounts, while APPE is estimated to explain less than 1% of it. A similar pattern is found for each of the individual formulas, with formula child counts estimated to explain between 90% and 98% of the variance in grant amounts in independent examinations of each of the formulas. For the EFIG formula, which is initially calculated, formula child counts are estimated to explain over 97% of the variance in state grants made under the EFIG formula. The other factors (APPE, equity, and effort) account for less than 4% of the variance in the EFIG grant amounts. This again suggests that formula child counts are the primary driver of Title I-A grant amounts.", "The relationship between the formula factors and Title I-A grant amounts is further examined in Figure 2 . More specifically, Figure 2 shows each LEA's formula child count, expenditure factor, equity factor, and effort factor compared to its overall Title I-A grant amount. LEAs with higher formula child counts generally have higher grant amounts. Conversely, there are numerous LEAs with the same expenditure factor (as expenditure factors vary by state, not LEA), but the Title I-A grant amounts for LEAs with the same expenditure factor can range substantially. Similarly, many LEAs have the same effort and equity factors, which are also calculated at the state (not LEA) level, but grant amounts for LEAs with the same effort or equity factor can also range greatly. That is, with respect to the expenditure, equity, and effort factors, there is not a consistent relationship between the value of the factor and an LEA's grant amount.", "It would be expected that formula child counts play the dominant role in allocations given that the primary aim of Title I-A is to provide support to schools serving high concentrations of low-income students. From a formula design standpoint, one reason that formula child counts are the primary driver of Title I-A grant amounts may be that once grant eligibility threshold level requirements are met, the counts are not bounded (i.e., there are no minimums or maximums placed on formula child counts in the determination of Title I-A grants). They can be substantially different from LEA to LEA. Formula child counts vary at the LEA level, not the state level. ", "The expenditure, equity, and effort factors, on the other hand, are all calculated at the state level so they are the same for all LEAs in a state. In addition, a state's expenditure and effort factors are bounded, limiting the range in which they may vary. And, while there are no bounds placed on the equity factor, it is calculated in such a way that it does not vary much from state to state. ", "As a result, formula child counts range from no formula children to over 350,000 formula children while expenditure factors range from approximately $3,600 to $5,400, equity factors range from about 1.0 to 1.3, and effort factors range from 0.95 to 1.05 ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, formula child counts are a factor in all four formulas while the equity and effort factors are only included in the EFIG formula, which limits their impact on overall LEA grant amounts.", "Because formula child counts are the dominant factor in grant determinations, in the aggregate states and LEAs with large numbers of formula children will generally get more funding under the formulas. Additionally, while the current formulas do somewhat benefit states with higher expenditure, effort, and equity factors, an increase in the number of formula children in an LEA will likely have a larger effect on grant amounts than an increase in state and local spending on education. However, it should be noted that almost any formula factor change will cause a shift in Title I-A grant amounts. The size of the shift will depend on which factor changes and by how much. ", "As will be discussed next, other design elements of the formulas also have an effect on grant allocations. These effects can be quite substantial for some states and LEAs.

State minimum grant provisions increase the amount of funding provided to small states to enable them to operate more robust Title I-A programs. State minimum grant provisions are funded by reducing the amount of funding provided to all the other states in order to support the smaller states. LEA hold harmless provisions prevent LEAs from losing more than a certain percentage of funding from year-to-year to provide some stability in grant amounts, provided appropriations are sufficient to make hold harmless payments. As with the state minimum grant provisions, however, LEAs that receive grants in excess of their hold harmless amounts have their grant amounts reduced to provide other LEAs with a hold harmless grant amount. State minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions have also been included in formulas to mitigate losses to states and LEAs that may result from changes in the Title I-A formulas. ", "The minimum grant and hold harmless provisions provide a relatively large increase in overall grant amounts and grant amounts per formula child to the states and LEAs receiving them but cause a relatively small decrease in the Title I-A grant amounts of other states and LEAs. To estimate the effect of these provisions, CRS compared Title I-A grant amounts and grant amounts per formula child with and without them.", " Table 1 provides summary statistics on the effect of the state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions on overall Title I-A grant amounts. The estimated grant amounts for all states and the LEAs that would gain and lose the most funds when these provisions are removed are included in Appendix A .", "While approximately 1 in 10 LEAs are in states benefitting from the state minimum grant provisions, removing these provisions shifts less than 1% of Title I-A funds. That is, an estimated 11% of LEAs (1,456) are in states that receive a minimum grant under at least one of the four Title I-A formulas. If the minimum grant provisions were removed, an estimated 1,281 of these LEAs would see a decrease in their Title I-A grant amounts. The total decrease in funds for these LEAs would be an estimated $64.7 million, which is 0.44% of total Title I-A grant amounts. This indicates that state minimum grant provisions have a relatively small effect on overall Title I-A grant amounts. However, the LEAs that would lose funds when these provisions are removed would see an estimated average decrease of $51,000, or 15.03%. The losses for an individual LEA would range from approximately $10 to $4.3 million, while the average grant per formula child is estimated to decrease by about $210. It is also worth noting that while 11% of LEAs benefit from the state minimum grant provisions, less than 3% of all formula children (305,801) reside within these LEAs. ", "Over half of all LEAs receiving Title I-A funds benefit from the hold harmless provisions, but removing these provisions is estimated to shift less than 2% of funds. More specifically, an estimated 64% of LEAs (8,327), within which approximately one-third (4.2 million) of all formula children reside, received a hold harmless amount in FY2016. If the hold harmless provisions were removed, 4,317 of these LEAs are estimated to see a decrease in their Title I-A grant amounts, averaging $66,000, or 17.43%, per LEA. However, losses for an individual LEA would range from less than $10 to $19.1 million, while the average grant per formula child is estimated to decrease by about $60. The total decrease in funds for these LEAs would be an estimated $283.8 million, which is 1.92% of overall Title I-A funds. This indicates that while a large percentage of LEAs benefit from the hold harmless provisions, they have a relatively small effect on overall Title I-A grant amounts.", "If both the state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions were removed, 5,000 of the 8,749 LEAs benefitting from either or both of these provisions would see a decrease in their grant amounts. These LEAs would see an estimated average decrease of $73,000, or 20.98%, of funding per LEA. Losses for an individual LEA would range from less than $10 to $16.0 million, while the average grant per formula child is estimated to decrease by about $70. The total decrease in funds for these LEAs would be an estimated $366.7 million, which is 2.49% of total grant amounts. This indicates that while the elimination of both state minimum grant provisions and LEA hold harmless provisions is estimated to have a relatively small effect on overall Title I-A grant allocations, the effect on locales that would lose funds without them could be substantial. ", "Although state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions have a relatively small effect on overall grant allocations, they can have a more pronounced effect on grants per formula child. The estimated average national grant per formula child is $1,300. Under current law, LEAs in states receiving a minimum grant amount have above average grants per formula child. LEAs benefitting from the state minimum grant provisions receive, on average, an estimated $450 more per formula child ($1,750 compared to $1,300 for all LEAs). On the other hand, LEAs receiving hold harmless provisions (but not in states receiving a minimum grant) receive, on average, an estimated $30 less per formula child ($1,270 compared to $1,300 for all LEAs). LEAs in states receiving the minimum grant provision, receiving a hold harmless provision, or both receive, on average, an estimated $10 less per formula child ($1,290 compared to $1,300 for all LEAs). ", "Removing the state minimum grant provision, the hold harmless provision, or both, however, would reduce estimated per formula grant amounts for LEAs that benefit from one or both of the provisions. For LEAs in states that currently receive the minimum grant amount, it is estimated that average grants per formula child would be reduced by $210 with the removal of the provision. Average grants per formula child in these LEAs would still be $240 over the $1,300 per formula child for all LEAs as these LEAs could benefit from the hold harmless provisions, partially mitigating their losses from the removal of the state minimum grant provisions. If the hold harmless provisions were removed, estimated average grants per formula child in LEAs that receive the benefit under current law are estimated to be reduced by $60 to $1,210. If both provisions were removed, estimated average grants per formula child in LEAs that are currently in states receiving a state minimum grant, receiving an LEA hold harmless, or both are estimated to fall by $70 to $1,220. ", "There is a similar pattern at the state level with respect to the state minimum grant provisions. For example, for FY2016 Wyoming (which receives a minimum grant under all four formulas) is estimated to have the highest grant per formula child under current law ($2,650). If the minimum grant provisions were removed, Wyoming's estimated grant per formula child would decrease to $2,030. If the minimum grant and hold harmless provisions were removed, Wyoming's estimated grant per formula child would decrease to $1,410.", "It is worth noting that the effect of the hold harmless provisions depends on the appropriations level for Title I-A. Because an LEA's hold harmless level is based on its prior-year Title I-A grant amount and not the Title I-A appropriations level for the current fiscal year, the hold harmless provisions will have a larger effect on grant amounts in years where the Title I-A appropriations level decreases.

When AFDC children were first included in formula child counts in 1965, they were counted in full. During the 1970s, the inclusion of eligible AFDC children in formula child counts was viewed as favoring urban areas, resulting in changes to the Title I-A formulas to include only two-thirds of the actual number of eligible AFDC children in the formula child counts. This new approach was subsequently viewed as being unfavorable to urban areas, so the formula was changed once again to include the full count of eligible AFDC children.", "A debate over the relative emphasis that should be placed on the percentage versus the count of formula children in an LEA has also been consistently present and continues to exist regarding the current law formulas. Under current law, the debate is reflected in two formula child weighting scales used in the determination of grants under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas, the newer Title I-A formulas that were introduced to enhance targeting to LEAs serving concentrations of low-income students. These scales have not been changed since the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas were first funded in FY2002. One scale is based on formula child rates (determined by dividing an LEA's number of formula children by the number of children ages 5-17 residing in the LEA); the other is based on formula child counts. The weights under both scales are applied in a stepwise manner, rather than the highest relevant weight being applied to all formula children in the LEA. More specifically, there are five sets of weights that apply to an LEA's formula child count and the LEA's percentage of formula children. These weights correspond to five ranges of formula child counts and five ranges of formula child rates. The ranges and associated weights under the Targeted Grant formula are shown in Table 2 .", "The smallest weight is applied to formula children falling within the first range; a larger weight is applied to all remaining formula children falling within the second range, and so on.

That is, under current law higher weights are applied to the LEAs with the highest formula child rates than are applied to the LEAs with the highest formula child counts ( Table 2 ). Thus, at first glance the weighting process would appear to favor LEAs with higher formula child rates (often rural LEAs) over LEAs with higher numbers of formula children (typically urban LEAs); however, it often does not.

Because of this, LEAs with large numbers of formula children are often able to apply the highest weights to larger proportions of their formula children than smaller LEAs with relatively high percentages of formula children can.

However, LEAs with high numbers of formula children generally receive more per formula child than LEAs with high percentages of such children. The effect of the weighting scales on grants per formula child is illustrated in Table 3 below.", " Table 3 shows the estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants per formula child by weighting scale. Of the LEAs receiving a Title I-A grant that did not receive a hold harmless grant and were not located in a state receiving a minimum state grant amount, 82.2% had their Targeted Grant and EFIG amounts determined based on the percentage weighting scale. Thus, the majority of the LEAs included in the analysis have a higher weighted formula child count based on the percentage weighting scale versus the number weighting scale. However, in general, LEAs whose weighted formula child counts are calculated using the numbers scale received a higher grant per formula child than LEAs whose weighted formula child counts are calculated using the percentage scale. More specifically, LEAs using the numbers weighting scale to determine their formula child counts had an estimated average grant per formula child of $1,340 in FY2016, while LEAs using the percentage weighting scale had an estimated average grant per formula child of $1,220. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Expenditures on Public Education: High-Spending States Versus Low-Spending States", "paragraphs": ["Every Title I-A formula includes a factor that accounts for how much money states spend on public elementary and secondary education. From the start, proponents of including an expenditure factor argued that it was needed to compensate states where the cost of educating a child was higher. The expenditure factor was also intended to compensate states with a higher cost of living. Opponents argued that including an expenditure factor disproportionately benefitted wealthy states and counties. In part, the debate also focused on whether Title I-A funds should be spread broadly across the country or concentrated in the areas of greatest need. Additionally, it pitted the higher-spending states that argued their costs of education and living were higher against the lower-spending states that argued they could not afford to spend more on education and therefore needed more Title I-A funding. For the first two years of the Title I-A program, the expenditure factor was calculated as a percentage of state APPE. In the late 1960s, Congress added a minimum to the expenditure factor, which increased the expenditure factor used in grant determinations for low-spending states. More specifically, if a state's APPE was less than the national average then that state could use national APPE to determine its expenditure factor. In the mid-1970s, Congress put an upper bound on the expenditure factor, which reduced the expenditure factor used in grant determinations for high-spending states, and lowered the expenditure factor minimum. State APPE was subject to a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 120% of the national APPE. If a state's APPE was less than 80% of the national APPE, the state's APPE was automatically raised to 80% of the national APPE; if a state's APPE was more than 120% of the national APPE, the state's APPE was automatically reduced to 120% of the national APPE. The expenditure factor added in the mid-1970s is still used under current law to calculate grants.", "In addition to the debate over the bounds placed on the expenditure factor, there has been debate over the use of APPE as a measure of spending for public elementary and secondary education. In 1994, Congress created two additional Title I-A formulas (Targeted Grant and EFIG) that were intended to target Title I-A funds more effectively on LEAs with concentrations of poverty. When the EFIG formula was initially enacted, it did not include the same expenditure factor used in the other three formulas. Rather, the EFIG formula included two new factors to account for state spending on public education: an effort factor and an equity factor. The effort factor is based on a state's education spending relative to personal income, essentially considering the share of available resources a state is dedicating to public elementary and secondary education. The equity factor is based on variation in education spending among LEAs within a state. The more equitable spending is among LEAs in a given state, the higher a state's grant will be. These factors were included in the formulas due to concerns about disparities in funds and resources among LEAs in many states and to provide an incentive for states to reduce those disparities. The new EFIG formula was enacted in tandem with the new Targeted Grant formula, which included the same expenditure factor that was being used in the determination of Basic Grants and Concentration Grants. However, concerns were raised that the new EFIG formula compromise disadvantaged the southern states (traditionally lower-spending states). In addition, prior to funding of the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas in FY2002, the EFIG formula was changed to include an expenditure factor similar to that used in the other three formulas. Thus, the EFIG formula incorporates state spending on public elementary and secondary education in three ways, while the other three formulas account for it only through an expenditure factor.", "While overall consideration of APPE in the formulas is more beneficial to higher-spending states than to lower-spending states, some of this benefit has been mitigated over time. Lower-spending states have generally benefitted from the changes to the expenditure factor over time. Adding upper and lower bounds to the expenditure factor effectively provided a beneficial adjustment to lower-spending states given that it raised their expenditure factor for purposes of grant determinations and capped the amount of spending that could be considered for higher-spending states (which meant that higher-spending states could not benefit from any spending in excess of the upper bound). ", " Figure 3 shows the estimated FY2016 Title I-A state grants per formula child for select states assuming the expenditure factor was calculated (1) as 50% of state APPE; (2) as 50% of the larger of state or national APPE; and (3) as 40% of state APPE, subject to a minimum and maximum. These expenditure factors correspond to (1) the expenditure factor that was originally included in the Title I-A formulas, (2) the expenditure factor used to determine Title I-A grants for FY1968 through FY1974, and (3) the expenditure factor under current law. The states included in Figure 3 are (1) the two states with the lowest state APPE that are not receiving minimum grants (Arizona and Utah); (2) the two states with state APPE closest to the median state APPE that are not receiving minimum grants (Iowa and Washington); and (3) the two states with the highest state APPE that are not receiving minimum grants (Connecticut and New York). The grant per formula child is the lowest for lower-spending states (Utah and Arizona) when the expenditure factor is unbounded, as it was for FY1966 and FY1967. In states where the APPE is close to the national average (Iowa and Washington), the grant per formula child decreases when a lower bound is added to the expenditure factor (as was the case beginning in FY1968) but increases when an upper bound is added to the expenditure factor, as it is under current law. Conversely, the grant per formula child is the lowest for higher-spending states (Connecticut and New York) when the expenditure factor has both upper and lower bounds, as is the case under current law. ", "The historical changes to the expenditure factors that tied them more closely to national APPE have benefitted any state with a state APPE that is less than the national APPE and not benefitted any state with a state APPE that exceeds the national APPE. Any change to the expenditure factor that allows it to vary more closely with state APPE only (e.g., no bounds) would favor states with relatively high APPEs and disadvantage those with relatively low APPEs. The current law expenditure factors are essentially a compromise between these two positions, providing an additional boost to lower-spending states while still allowing some variation in the expenditure factor based on state APPE.

While there are some concerns about whether having a high number or high percentage of formula children should result in larger LEA grants per formula child, as evidenced by the current debate among densely populated and less densely populated areas discussed above, there has also been a broader debate about how much to target Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty and how best to do so.

Although this distribution indicates that the removal of the state minimum grant provisions would increase the targeting of Title I-A funds, the change is minimal.

One reason why the removal of the hold harmless provisions may hinder the targeting of Title I-A funds is that, as previously discussed, LEAs with higher formula child rates receive higher hold harmless rates; thus, the hold harmless provisions may actually help to target Title I-A funds to areas with concentrations of formula children.
