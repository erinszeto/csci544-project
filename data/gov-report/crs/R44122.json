The combination of Charter, TWC, and BHN would create a single entity providing cable television and broadband access service to 23.9 million customers in 41 states, making it the nation's second-largest cable television operator and broadband access provider.", "The proposed merger raises a number of potential concerns, reflecting the complex structure of the television industry and substantial changes in the way consumers choose to receive video programming. The many firms involved in content ownership, aggregation and packaging, and distribution of video programming often must cooperate with one another at the same time they are competing. Companies in the television industry are in frequent negotiation with one another for the right to transmit programming, and the merger of three players into a very large one could change the relative bargaining power of other parties. At the same time, growing numbers of consumers are now viewing programs online at a time of their choosing rather than subscribing to traditional cable or satellite services or watching based on a broadcaster's schedule. The proposed Charter transactions have the potential to affect the development of this relatively new online video distribution industry by inhibiting distributors' access to programming or their ability to send programs to customers over the Internet.", "At the federal level, both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) must approve Charter's transactions before they can close. The DOJ will investigate whether the proposed transactions would reduce competition. The FCC will investigate whether the proposed transactions would, on balance, be in the public interest.", "As regulatory authorities begin their review of Charter's proposed transactions, three key issues related to television industry competition may merit analysis: 1) whether the presence of members of Charter's board of directors on the boards of several companies that create television programming, including the cable networks Discovery and Starz and film and television studio Lions Gate, might impede competition in the distribution of television programming; 2) whether the fact that a major investor in Charter, John Malone, also controls some shares of a competitor to Charter, DIRECTV (whose proposed sale to AT&T has met federal regulatory approval), could reduce competition among video distributors to acquire programming from creators and to sell programming to consumers; and 3) whether Charter's assumption of TWC's various joint ventures and partnerships with Comcast Corporation, the largest cable television and broadband access provider in the United States, would reduce competition to acquire programming from creators and disadvantage online video distributors.", "In addition, the agencies may evaluate whether Charter's proposed commitments regarding service quality and availability would be sufficient to mitigate potential harms. To obtain FCC approval, Charter is likely to make a number of commitments regarding service quality and availability. However, the company would assume more than $24 billion of debt through the transactions, and the FCC may be concerned that this debt could compromise Charter's ability to fulfil commitments to provide sufficient capacity to deliver online video and other services to its broadband subscribers."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["In May 2015, Charter Communications, Inc. announced that it reached agreements with Time Warner Cable Inc.

If the deal is not approved by regulatory authorities, Charter will pay TWC a breakup fee of $2 billion. Charter, TWC, and BHN filed an application for FCC approval in June 2015. ", "As regulatory authorities begin their review of the proposed transactions, four key issues may merit analysis: ", "1. Members of Charter's board of directors also serve on the boards of several companies that create television programming, such as cable networks Discovery and Starz and film and television studio Lions Gate. These interlinks could potentially enable Charter to impede competition in the distribution of video programming. Charter's increased national market share after the proposed transactions would give it more leverage in negotiations with television programming creators. 2. John Malone, a major investor in Charter, controls a significant stake in Charter's competitor, DIRECTV. AT&T, a major provider of telephone, video, and broadband service, is in the process of acquiring DIRECTV, which would make it the largest U.S. distributor of video programming. Federal regulators have approved the transaction. That transaction, if completed, could result in Malone becoming a substantial shareholder in AT&T. Regulators may be concerned that Malone's influence over the combined AT&T-DIRECTV and the merged Charter could thwart competition among video distributors to acquire programming from creators and to sell programming to consumers. 3. TWC has various joint ventures and partnerships with Comcast Corporation, the largest cable television and broadband access provider in the United States. Regulators may be concerned that the merger would result in close relations between Comcast and Charter, potentially reducing competition to acquire programming from creators and among broadband access providers distributing programming from online video distributors. 4. Authorities may seek to investigate the reliability of Charter's claim that a key benefit of the transactions is Charter's commitment to investing in TWC's and BHN's products and services. The companies claim that the merged firm's wider national footprint and reduction in overhead costs will enable it to invest more than the three firms could on their own. However, Charter is expected to assume in excess of $24 billion of debt to finance the transaction. The FCC may be concerned that the debt could limit Charter's ability to fulfil its commitments to improve service quality and availability.

These players assume several distinct roles: ", "Content owners produce or control the copyright to video programming. Examples of content owners include television studios, movie studios, sports teams, and broadcast stations that produce local news programs. Aggregators/packagers pay the content owners for the right to use their programming. Examples of aggregators and packagers include broadcast television networks, cable networks, and broadcast television stations. Distributors purchase video programming from aggregators/packagers, content owners, or other distributors and sell it to paying subscribers. Congress has defined a class of multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) that have certain rights and obligations under the law. These include cable operators, satellite operators, and some traditional telephone companies that own and operate their own distribution facilities. The FCC is considering expanding the definition of MVPDs to include companies that distribute certain types of video programming over the Internet.", "Many companies fall into more than one of these categories, and some have multiple operations within a category. For example, all of the leading broadcast television networks also own cable networks and broadcast stations and produce content. In addition, while TWC and BHN are two separate distributors, BHN currently relies on TWC to negotiate programming agreements.", "Because of this complex structure, many companies in the television industry are in frequent negotiation with one another for the right to transmit programming or to retransmit broadcast signals. In some cases, these negotiations are governed by federal law, as when MVPDs negotiate with broadcast television stations for the right to carry broadcast signals. In other instances, negotiations over the right to broadcast or resell programming are based on market forces and reciprocal relationships, without government-imposed strictures.", " Table 1 describes the involvement of several media companies in various parts of the television industry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technology-Driven Changes", "paragraphs": ["Within the past decade, several companies have begun offering consumers the opportunity to view television programs, movies, and sports online. These companies license programming from content owners and rely on Internet service providers (ISPs) to distribute the programming to viewers. The FCC has called these firms online video distributors (OVDs). They fall into three general categories: ", "1. Electronic sell-through and rental OVDs charge consumers a one-time fee to download a television program or movie for viewing for an indefinite or limited time period. These services are generally owned by retailers, including Apple, Amazon, and Walmart. They usually offer a limited selection of recent and popular movies and television series that are in high demand from consumers. This product is similar to the pay-per-view services offered by MVPDs. 2. Subscription OVDs charge consumers monthly or annual fees for unlimited access to video programming. Subscription OVDs share attributes of broadcast and cable networks as well as MVPDs. Hulu Plus is co-owned by three major broadcast networks (ABC, FOX, and NBC), which in turn are subsidiaries of major entertainment conglomerates. The other two major subscription OVDs are Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant. In 2015, however, several studios, networks, and MVPDs launched or announced plans to launch their own OVDs. Subscription OVDs compete with the \"TV Everywhere\" services offered by MVPDs. The TV Everywhere services allow MVPD subscribers to view cable channels on computers and mobile devices, as well as on television sets. 3. Advertising-supported OVDs include advertising along with the programming and do not charge consumers directly. They are generally owned and operated by television networks and studios.

Some programming and most broadband access providers are controlled by companies that also operate as MVPDs. The structure of the television industry, as described in Table 1 , plays an increasingly important role in determining how MVPDs and OVDs compete with each other. The proposed Charter transactions, by altering the television industry's structure, could affect competition as well. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competition for Access to Programming", "paragraphs": ["MVPDs and OVDs may distinguish themselves by offering customers exclusive access to original programming, or exclusive access to programming during certain time periods. For example, subscription OVDs and MVPDs are battling over the right to offer their customers exclusive access to all of the episodes in a current season of a television program. (This is known in the television industry as \"in-season stacking rights.\") Netflix reportedly demanded a discount for the online rights to the 21 st Century Fox studio's television drama Empire , claiming that the studio devalued the program by providing MVPDs with in-season stacking rights. Hulu, which is partly owned by the studio and its affiliated broadcast network, reportedly stepped in by exceeding Netflix's original offer. Networks are increasingly choosing to license programming from co-owned studios rather than outside providers, in order to maximize revenues from licensing programs to MVPDs' video on demand (VOD) services and to OVD services.", "The FCC, pursuant to the 1992 Cable Act, has rules in place governing the behavior of cable operators and cable networks that have common ownership or control. The FCC rules prohibit cable operators from exercising \"undue influence\" over the decisions of affiliated cable and broadcast networks concerning the sale of programming (program access rules). The rules also bar cable and broadcast networks affiliated with cable operators from discriminating against unaffiliated MVPDs with respect to the prices, terms, and conditions for sale of programming (program carriage rules). ", "These rules do not apply to television or movie studios owned by cable operators, and they do not guarantee program access or nondiscriminatory treatment to on-demand services offered by cable providers or OVDs. In 2014, the FCC proposed extending these rules to benefit certain OVDs. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler stated that he expected the FCC to issue final rules about this proposal in the fall of 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interconnecting with Broadband Access Providers", "paragraphs": ["To deliver their programming to consumers, OVDs have different options for interconnecting with services that provide broadband access to the public, also known as retail ISPs. Several use specialized transit providers, known as wholesale ISPs, as intermediaries. Others generate sufficient traffic to make it economically feasible for them to bypass the intermediaries by using content delivery networks (CDNs), which store (\"cache\") copies of the videos and deliver them to broadband access providers as close as possible to viewers' locations. Netflix owns and operates its own CDN. MVPDs also use their own proprietary CDNs to store programming for services such as video on demand. ", "All transit providers and CDNs must interconnect with broadband access providers to reach individual homes and businesses. The charges and conditions imposed by the broadband access providers for this interconnection have been the subject of considerable debate, particularly because broadband access providers and MVPDs are often the same entities. In some cases, companies try to deal with this by \"settlement-free Internet peering,\" a relationship in which they reciprocally provide access to each other's customers without charging each other a fee. However, if either party perceives the value derived from peering to be unequal, it may deny peering or suggest an alternative paid arrangement. There is no standard way to calculate the value derived from peering. For example, Netflix claims that by charging Netflix a fee to connect its CDN, broadband access providers are extracting arbitrary tolls. Some broadband access providers, however, claim that Netflix wants to avoid paying its fair share for the cost of delivering video over the Internet by claiming it is entitled to settlement-free peering.", "In 2015 the FCC adopted its Open Internet rules, which", "ban blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization by mobile and fixed broadband access services that sell Internet access to consumers; create a general conduct standard that broadband access services cannot harm consumers or services (including OVDs) that rely on the Internet to reach consumers, and give the FCC the authority to address questionable practices on a case-by-case basis; and give the FCC authority to hear complaints and take enforcement action on a case-by-case basis if it deems the interconnection activities of broadband providers to be unjust and unreasonable.", "With limited exceptions, the rules went into effect on June 12, 2015.

As Figure 1 illustrates, the cable and satellite industries have lost video subscribers both to telephone companies that offer video service and to OVDs.", "Even as cable operators have lost video subscribers, however, they continue to gain broadband access subscribers. As Figure 2 illustrates, the number of broadband access subscribers has grown steadily between 2007 and 2015. About 94 million households and 6 million small- and medium-size businesses subscribe to broadband access services as of 2015. Of the total number of broadband access subscribers, about 58% rely on cable providers and 37% rely on telephone companies (telcos). Thus, about 95% rely on wireline technology for broadband access service to connect to the Internet, 3% of subscribers rely exclusively on wireless providers for broadband access service, and 2% rely on satellite providers.", "In addition to facing weaker demand for video subscriptions, MVPDs have seen the cost of programming rise relative to revenues from these subscriptions ( Figure 3 ). Although MVPDs bear franchise and regulatory fees, as well as marketing and operating expenses, programming is their single largest expense. MVPDs have attempted to pass those costs along to consumers; the consumer price index for cable and satellite television services has risen almost 13% since the start of 2011, compared with 7% for consumer prices overall. The increase in prices may be one factor leading viewers either to forgo video service or to downgrade to less expensive packages. In response, several MVPDs have begun to offer less expensive packages of video programming. For example, Dish Network, a satellite provider, offers the online video service Sling TV for $20 per month and Verizon offers consumers a base a la carte package of 35 channels for $55 per month.

At the time, Liberty Media's chairman and founder John Malone predicted that OVDs would upend MVPDs' traditional video services, and claimed that cable operators' broadband access services uniquely positioned them to take advantage of the trend.

In contrast to the antitrust agencies, the FCC considers whether a transaction will enhance, rather than merely preserve, existing competition, and often takes a more expansive view of potential and future competition in analyzing that issue.

Through iN Demand, TWC obtains rights to carry movies and events and to sell and/or rent video programming online. iN Demand also negotiates on behalf of Comcast with studios for the right to sell electronic copies of movies directly to consumers, enabling Comcast to compete directly with Apple's iTunes and Amazon Prime Instant. In addition, iN Demand produces promotional programming on behalf of TWC, BHN, and Cox Communications. iN Demand also owns and operates content delivery networks on behalf of its affiliates. By acquiring TWC's and BHN's interests in iN Demand, Charter could potentially facilitate coordination among cable operators with respect to the acquisition and marketing of programming for MVPDs' on-demand services.

The transactions could potentially increase Charter's ability to facilitate coordination among MVPDs in the sale of advertising.", "In December 2011, several cable operators entered into marketing agreements with Verizon Wireless. These agreements allow the companies to sell bundled offerings that include Verizon Wireless services and the cable operators' residential wireline voice, video, and Internet access services in areas where Verizon Wireless's parent company, Verizon Communications Inc., sells DSL Internet access service .

", "Among the benefits of the proposed transaction, Charter claims that the transactions would increase TWC's and BHN's incentives to invest in new services, infrastructure, and customer service. To verify this claim, the FCC would need to investigate whether TWC and BHN were planning to make such investments independently, absent the proposed transaction. Moreover, the FCC could investigate the extent to which Charter's reliance on secured debt to fund the transactions could limit Charter's ability to spend extensively on improving its products and services. If, after the transactions close, Charter's costs are higher than, or revenues are lower than, what it anticipates today, Charter may need to reduce spending on investments or sell off assets in order to repay debt holders.", "In July 2015, Charter pledged to the FCC that, as a condition of the agency's approval of the proposed transactions, it would maintain a settlement-free interconnection policy until December 31, 2018. According to its revised interconnection policy, Charter will interconnect its network at no charge with OVDs (or other applicants delivering content to Charter's subscribers) under certain conditions. Among the conditions, the applicants must deliver a minimum amount of traffic to Charter as set forth in the agreement. Both Charter and the applicants agree to maintain a certain level of capacity to meet the demand from Charter's broadband access subscribers. Either party may increase capacity at no charge to support the exchange of Internet traffic. Netflix responded by supporting the proposed transactions if the FCC incorporates Charter's new interconnection policy as a condition. The FCC may be concerned that Charter's debt could compromise its ability to fulfil commitments to provide sufficient capacity to deliver online video and other services to its broadband subscribers.", "In its public interest statement, Charter committed to abide by the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, as well as additional constraints on its behavior, for three years after the close of the transaction. Among those commitments, it pledged that the merged firm would not block or throttle Internet traffic or engage in paid prioritization, whether or not the FCC's Open Internet order is upheld in court. It also agreed to submit interconnection disputes to the FCC, and to refrain from engaging in data usage caps or usage-based billing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

Consumers can get video services from all three types of operators, but generally rely on cable operators and telcos for broadband access services. The geographic areas in which these types of firms operate vary. The largest cable operators generally do not compete directly with each other at the retail level. Instead, they operate in non-overlapping geographic regions. DBS operators are available throughout the United States. Telcos compete directly with the DBS and cable operators.

In 2015, however, as part of its congressionally mandated effort to evaluate regularly whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion, the FCC adopted the benchmark of 25 Megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 3 Mbps upstream for \"advanced telecommunications capability.\" In its evaluation of the now abandoned transactions involving Comcast, TWC, and Charter, the FCC's Media Bureau entered into the record broadband subscriber data that the FCC collects, including each provider's nationwide shares of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband subscribers. The FCC considered that data to be confidential, however, and limited access to members of the public willing to sign an order protecting the distribution of that data. Charter claims that after the merger it would serve fewer than 30% of U.S. customers whose broadband service meets the FCC's benchmark of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps or greater. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
