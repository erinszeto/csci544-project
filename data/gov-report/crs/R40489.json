One of the most basic characterizations of federal spending involves two separate categories, discretionary spending and direct spending. Discretionary spending is provided in, and controlled by, annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Direct spending, also referred to as mandatory spending, is controlled by substantive legislation under the jurisdiction of the various House and Senate legislative committees.", "In most instances, the substantive law that creates direct spending also includes the financing mechanism for it, often a \"permanent appropriation\" that provides funds automatically each year without the need for any further legislative action (e.g., Social Security and Medicare), or that provides funds automatically each year over a fixed, multi-year period (e.g., the periodic farm bill and highway bill). In some cases, a direct spending program does not have its own financing mechanism and requires financing through an annual appropriations act (e.g., veterans compensation and pensions); in these cases, however, the level of direct spending effectively is controlled in the substantive legislation, not the annual appropriations act.", "The annual budget resolution establishes a framework for the consideration of all legislation with a budgetary impact, including annual appropriations acts (regular, supplemental, and continuing) and direct spending measures, as well as revenue and debt-related measures.", "Different enforcement procedures are used with respect to annual appropriations acts and direct spending measures. The key enforcement tool applicable to the former is the \"Section 302(b)\" spending allocations, named after the pertinent section of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the point of order that may be raised against measures that violate the allocations. Under this tool, the Appropriations Committee in each chamber divides its allocation of total discretionary spending for the fiscal year made under the budget resolution among its 12 subcommittees; the cost of each appropriations act then is compared to the Section 302(b) spending allocation assigned to the pertinent subcommittee to determine if the act adheres to the spending levels under the budget resolution.", "Other enforcement tools apply to the consideration of direct spending measures, including \"Section 302(a)\" allocations of total direct spending to committees (unlike the Appropriations Committees, the legislative committees do not subdivide their total allocations by subcommittee), the optional budget reconciliation process, and House and Senate \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rules, among others.", "Funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs entails both discretionary spending and direct spending. In FY2008, for example, the Department's total spending of approximately $88 billion consisted of about $43 billion in discretionary spending and $44 billion in direct spending. Most of the Department's discretionary spending involves medical care while most direct spending involves compensation and benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Funding for VA Health Care", "paragraphs": ["For more than a decade VSOs have been repeatedly calling for \"assured funding\" or \"guaranteed\" or \"mandatory\" funding for VA health care.

VSOs claim that both the sufficiency of funding for veterans' health care as well as the timeliness and predictability of such funding would be addressed by funding VA health care under a mandatory appropriation .

Also pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budget rules adopted by Congress required offsets for any new direct spending program (see previous section on spending categories in the federal budget and enforcement procedures). Furthermore, some budget analysts had pointed out that a switch to a mandatory appropriation would:", "create incentives for undue expansion of the VHA; not be consistent with the longer term objectives of reforming the overall health care system; and boost federal spending at a time when other increases in federal healthcare spending would yield greater benefits.", "The analysts have also pointed out that converting VHA into a mandatory appropriation \"would not entirely insulate it from budgetary pressures.

The VHA is funded through multiple appropriations accounts that are supplemented by other sources of revenue. Although the appropriations account structure has been subject to change from year to year, the appropriation accounts used to support the VHA traditionally include medical care, medical and prosthetic research, and medical administration. In addition, Congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities through a larger appropriations account for construction for all VA facilities. In FY2004, \"to provide better oversight and [to] receive a more accurate accounting of funds,\" Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 , H.Rept. 108-401 ), funded VHA through four accounts: (1) medical services, (2) medical administration, (3) medical facilities, and (4) medical and prosthetic research. In FY2009, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 ) renamed the medical administration account as the medical support and compliance account.

VHA developed system-wide workload estimates, by type of care, by forecasts submitted by field stations. Unit costs were derived from the field stations' reports of the estimated distribution of expenses by type of care. Costs associated with new programs were estimated by VA central office and added to the budget estimate. The costs associated with staffing improvements, pay increases and inflation were also added to this estimate. Therefore, it could be stated that the principal assumption at each phase of the budget formulation process was that the preceding year's budget was the starting point.", "In 1996, Congress enacted the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1997 ( P.L. 104-204 ). This Act required VHA to develop a plan for the allocation of health care resources to ensure that veterans eligible for medical care who have similar economic status and eligibility priority have similar access to such care, regardless of where they reside. The plan was to \"account for forecasts in expected workload and to ensure fairness to facilities that provide cost-efficient health care.\"", "In response to the above-mentioned Congressional mandate, as well as the mandate in the Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-262 ) that required the VHA to establish a priority-based enrollment system, VHA established the Enrollee Health Care Demand Model in 1998. This model has evolved over time. The VHA's Enrollee Health Care Demand Model develops estimates of future veteran enrollment, enrollees' expected utilization of health care services, and the costs associated with that utilization. These 20-year projections are by fiscal year, enrollment priority, age, Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), market, and facility. The VHA budget is formulated using the model projections.", "Each year, through the annual appropriations process, Congress appropriates funds to the accounts that comprise VHA. VHA's budget request to Congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to estimate the demand for medical services among veterans in future years (a brief discussion of EHCPM is provided below).

While a complete description is beyond the scope of this report, this section provides a brief overview of the model. As described previously, VHA uses the EHCPM to forecast future resource requirements. The EHCPM model projects total expenditures for health care services in any given year by combining output from three model subcomponents: the enrollment projection model, the utilization projection model, and the unit cost projection model (A description of the EHCPM's three sub-models is given below). Outputs from these sub-models are then multiplied together for each of the 58 medical services (which include such services as inpatient medical, surgical, and psychiatric care; ambulatory care; pharmacy, including over the counter medications) for roughly 40,000 enrollee types. The enrollee types are defined by age category, by whether they were enrolled before or after eligibility reforms, by priority level, and by geographic sector. EHCPM applies four types of trend factors to account for general changes in medical costs and the anticipated changes in the efficiency of VA providers. The trend factors are utilization, inflation, intensity of service provision, and a measure of management efficiency.

The projected enrollee population is equal to current enrollment plus new enrollment minus deaths.

Each year, utilization rates are adjusted to account for national trends in health care utilization and VA-specific trends in management efficiency. Since model management trends are calibrated against the local community in which each VA facility operates, projected changes over time in the efficiency of VA practice are implicitly tied to community practices. In a final step, adjusted HCG benchmarks are calibrated to actual VA workload in the model base year to account for differences between the VA and the private sector that are not captured by adjustment.

One reason that has been cited in the literature for funding CPB under an AA is that it would \"insulate public broadcasting from the year-to year financial and political pressures which annual appropriations imposed.\" Furthermore, according to the CPB, AA allows \"CPB and grant recipients to include projected federal funding in their budget planning and program-acquisition processes two years before those budgets are implemented, and provides lengthy lead time for production of major programming\"", "Another program funded under an AA was the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In 1990 ( P.L. 101-501 ), Congress authorized a July 1 st to June 30 th LIHEAP program year to allow states to plan for their heating/cooling seasons with knowledge of available funds. Therefore, in FY1993, Congress provided forward funding in the appropriations law and appropriated funds for FY1993 and an additional $1.4 billion for the 9-month period from October 1993 through June of 1994. Subsequently in FY1994, the program was funded for the period July 1994 through June 1995. In 1998, Congress authorized an advance appropriation for LIHEAP. As a result, the program was taken off the program year cycle and put back on fiscal years.

Under the current congressional budget process, the House and Senate Budget Committees have adopted enforcement rules to maintain fiscal discipline; therefore, programs that are funded under an advanced appropriation (AA) need to be included in the yearly budget resolution. Congress may enforce the substantive provisions of the budget resolution through the use of points of order. Generally, these points of order prohibit the consideration of any legislation, or amendment that would cause a violation of the overall funding levels, the committee allocations, or the appropriations committees' subdivisions. ", "In general, a point of order could be raised against any AA that causes a ceiling on AA to be exceeded and that is not specified in a list of accounts appropriate for funding by AA in that budget year. For instance, in the House FY2010 Concurrent Resolution on the budget ( H.Con.Res. 85 ), section 403 has placed limits on the amount and type of advance appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012, and listed the programs that are excepted from this budget enforcement rule. In the Senate FY2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution ( S.Con.Res. 13 ) certain accounts to be funded under an AA are included in the resolution.

H.Con.Res. 85 does not include language to exempt the medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts from any point of order. However, during the Senate debate of S.Con.Res. 13 , Senator James Inhofe offered an amendment ( S.Amdt. 742 ) that was adopted by the Senate. S.Amdt. 742 would allow for an advance appropriation for the medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research accounts of VHA and would not subject those accounts to a point of order under section 302 of S.Con.Res. 13 . Sections 402 and 424 of the conference report on the FY2010 Concurrent Resolution on the budget ( H.Rept. 111-60 ) have included language excepting the following accounts from point of order against advance appropriations: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities. Therefore, while the use of points of order may no longer apply to these accounts in the FY2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution ( H.Rept. 111-60 ), future budget resolutions may need to include language excepting these accounts. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Issues", "paragraphs": ["One concern for Congress would be the effects or impact of funding some accounts under an AA based on the estimates generated by the EHCPM. It has been acknowledged that \"[VHA's] formulation of its budget is by its very nature challenging, as it is based on assumptions and imperfect information on the health care services [VHA] expects to provide.\" As stated previously, the EHCPM provides the basis for estimating VHA's budget request to Congress. While the EHCPM reasonably projects future enrollment estimates and is \"likely to yield accurate projections in a stable policy environment,\" it has also been found that \"the current specification of the EHCPM appears to lack the specificity to inform explicit scenarios regarding the relationships among VA benefit generosity, other sources of health coverage, veterans' enrollment decisions, and enrollee health status\" Under such findings it is reasonable to assume that future year budget projections could have variances that could create budget shortfalls if there are unanticipated shocks to the VA health care system or to the surrounding policy environment. For instance, if under the current economic climate large numbers of veterans lose their employer provided health insurance coverage, and for the first time try to seek care from the VA health care system, the EHCPM may not be able to accurately forecast such a scenario. Furthermore, the recent RAND study on the EHCPM expressed concerns regarding the validity and accuracy of the current approach for projecting future expenditures under budget and policy scenarios beyond the VA's current capacity to provide care. ", "While expenditures for medical services modeled through the EHCPM comprise about 84% of VHA's budget estimate to Congress, some programs such as long-term care are estimated separately by VHA and included in its budget estimates to Congress. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has expressed concern with VHA's long-term care spending estimates because the estimates are based on cost assumptions that GAO believes to be unrealistically low and on a noninstitutional workload projection that appears to be unrealistically high. Furthermore, it has stated that \"VA's long-term care spending estimates are questionable benchmarks for congressional budget deliberations.\" Given these concerns it is reasonable to consider whether funding VHA under AA could still create potential budget shortfalls, which Congress would have to address through a regular appropriations bill. ", "Another issue that may arise would be how funding for VHA information technology programs including its electronic medical records system (Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)) relate to funding the rest of the VHA under an AA . In October 2005, the VA began to reorganize its information technology (IT) functions to improve the management of its IT programs. Before the realignment, funding and approval of IT functions were controlled by each medical center director. The reorganization consolidated all IT functions throughout the VA under control of the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO). As a result of this reorganization, VHA's health IT budget was brought under central control. Currently, all IT programs within the VA are funded under the Information Technology account. Furthermore, to support health care, VA IT infrastructure provides VA facilities with voice services and data capture, processing, transmission, and analysis. Health care professionals maintain and transmit patient data and x-ray, MRI, and other images to serve veterans wherever service is required. In addition, VA is undertaking the migration of VistA into VA's new health care system, Health e Vet. Due to all these reasons, providing an AA for three accounts and funding IT accounts under a regular appropriation act could create a situation whereby, for example, VHA could not purchase computer software although it has procured medical equipment that needs software, or may not be able to transmit patient data through VA's IT infrastructure. Likewise, when VHA expands new services, based on funding in the medical services account, there is frequently an IT component that would need funding from the VA's IT budget. If Congress funds some accounts under an AA, and the IT budget under a regular appropriation then, for example, when a new community-based outpatient clinic (CBOC) is opened, the IT infrastructure that is needed to support the clinic may not be available.", "Another potential issue that may arise is VHA's ability to implement congressionally mandated policy changes. For instance, if Congress were to pass legislation to increase access to veterans in highly rural areas during FY2011, an advance appropriation might not be able to account for this legislative mandate, since funding for the medical services account would have already been appropriated for FY2011 during the FY2010 budget cycle. ", "Although it may be not be as significant as the previous three implementation issues\u2014since medical and prosthetic research account funds are available to VHA for a period of two years\u2014funding some accounts of VHA under an AA and some accounts under a regular FY appropriation could potentially create accounting complexities for VA's medical research programs. Under the current legislative proposal ( H.R. 1016 ; S. 423 ), the following three accounts that comprise VHA would be funded under an AA: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities. Under this proposal the medical and prosthetic research account which funds VHA's research program would be excluded from being funded under an AA and would be funded under a regular FY appropriations act. This potentially could raise an issue with regard to timing of funding research projects and funding research support (personnel costs, administrative support, among other things). Under the current appropriations account set-up, research support from the medical care budget (distributed through the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process ) includes one year funding for personal services costs for individuals on the medical care rolls who spend a portion of their VA time working on research projects, and includes administrative support provided to the research program by fiscal, engineering, acquisition and materiel management units of the VA. As stated before, this could potentially create a mismatch between funding research projects and funding research support.

One option would be for Congress to provide oversight and direction to VHA to modify its EHCPM so that it could provide better predictability for VHA funding in future years. VHA would have to develop analytic tools for measuring demand for health care, treatment capacity, and the fixed and variable costs associated with delivering care. Furthermore, forecasting the effects of VA policy and external influences on demand requires routine collection of data on veterans' employment, health insurance, health status, and overall health care utilization. These modifications could provide VHA and Congress with better estimates of funding needs, and thereby allow Congress to make informed policy decisions.", "Another option might be to create an independent entity modeled along the lines of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). Creation of such an entity could bring transparency to VHA's funding process and would create credibility, particularly among key constituent groups. MedPAC was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ) to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. The Commission's statutory mandate includes advising Congress on payments to private health plans participating in Medicare and providers in Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program. Furthermore, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to care, quality of care, and other issues affecting Medicare. The Commission meets publicly to discuss Medicare issues and policy questions and to develop and approve its reports and recommendations to the Congress. Such a program for VHA might independently analyze issues facing VHA and advise Congress on funding for both short-and long-term issues affecting health care for veterans. This could in turn provide an added layer of transparency and accountability to VHA's budget process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
