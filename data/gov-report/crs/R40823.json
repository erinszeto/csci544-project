In addition, electronic technology has reduced the marginal cost of constituent communications; unlike postal letters, Members can reach large numbers of constituents for a fixed cost. Despite these advantages, electronic communications have raised some concerns.

This report is inherently a snapshot in time of a dynamic process. As with any new technology, the number of Members using Twitter and the patterns of use may change rapidly in short periods of time.

With approximately 29% of House Members and 31% of Senators registered with Twitter, Members sent an average of 85 tweets per day collectively. House Republicans sent the most tweets (54%), followed by House Democrats (27%), Senate Republicans (10%), and Senate Democrats (9%). The data also suggest that more tweets were sent on Thursday than any other day of the week.", "Members' use of Twitter can be divided into six categories: position taking, press or web links, district or state activities, official congressional action, personal, and replies. The data suggest that the most frequent type of tweets were press and web link tweets, which comprised 43% of in-session and 46% of recess tweets.

Although virtually all Members continue to use traditional modes of constituent communication, use of new communications technology is increasing. For example, prior to 1995, there was virtually no e-mail traffic between Members and constituents. In 2008, almost 200 million e-mails were sent to the House of Representatives, and a similar number were sent from House computers. Member official websites, blogs, Youtube channels, and Facebook pages\u2014all non-existent several years ago\u2014also receive significant traffic. Conversely, the amount of postal mail sent to Congress has dropped by more than 50% during the same time period. In addition, electronic technology has reduced the marginal cost of constituent communications; unlike postal letters, Members can reach large numbers of constituents for a fixed cost.", "Member use of electronic communications has raised several concerns. Some of these concerns are similar to those associated with traditional modes of constituent communications, such as the potential electoral advantage that the franking privilege may confer on incumbent Members. Other issues, such as the use of third-party communication software platforms, are unique to the new electronic mediums.

During the first week of data collection, the House and Senate were in session. During the second week of data collection, the House and Senate were in recess.", "Several caveats accompany the results presented. First, CRS relies on TweetCongress's identification and aggregation of Member tweets, which claims to be comprehensive, but may not be exhaustive. Second, the analysis treats all Member tweets as structurally identical, because each individual tweet reveals no information about its genesis. In some cases, Members might be personally tweeting, whereas in others they are delegating Twitter responsibilities to their communications staff. CRS draws no distinction between the two. Similarly, some Members use Twitter as a communication medium in their official public capacity as Members, whereas others use Twitter as a communication medium for their campaign. Although there are important differences in the laws and chamber rules governing these two uses, CRS draws no distinction between the two in its analysis. Third, these results cannot be used to predict future behavior.", "Finally, the analysis covers only two weeks of Member tweeting. Therefore, it is inherently a snapshot in time of a dynamic process.
