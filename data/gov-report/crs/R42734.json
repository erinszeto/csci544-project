Together, these programs serve more than 4 million families and make up well over three-quarters of HUD's budget. All five programs provide rental assistance in the form of below-market rent available to low-income individuals and families. While the programs vary in some important ways\u2014how assistance is provided, who administers the assistance, whether the assistance is restricted to certain populations\u2014they use many of the same or similar standards when establishing tenants' income eligibility and their minimum contributions toward rent.", "Families are generally eligible for HUD assistance if their incomes are below certain income standards set by HUD. Unlike the poverty measurement used by some other federal benefits programs that target low-income populations, income eligibility for HUD-assisted housing varies by locality and is tied to local area median income. Income, for the purposes of eligibility, is defined as income from all sources earned by all members of the family, with some exclusions (e.g., income earned by minors). Although a family may be eligible for assistance, they are not guaranteed to receive it. Housing assistance programs are not entitlements, thus, due to funding limitations they serve only roughly one in four eligible households. Families wishing to receive assistance are generally placed on waiting lists.", "Once a family is determined eligible for HUD assistance and is selected to receive assistance, the rent they pay is generally based on 30% of their adjusted income. Those adjustments include deductions for elderly and disabled families, certain medical costs, and certain child care costs. Families' incomes, adjusted incomes, and contributions toward rent are typically recertified annually.", "The laws governing both income eligibility and tenant rents were standardized in the early 1980s, although the origins of the current policies date back earlier and are derived from experiences with the public housing program, which was the first federal rental assistance program.", "The income and rent policies in the five primary HUD rental assistance programs are also used to some extent by other HUD programs such as the homeless assistance programs and the HOME Investment Partnerships program. Looking at non-HUD housing programs, the Department of Agriculture's rural rental assistance program largely uses HUD's income and rent policies, and the Department of Treasury's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program uses some HUD standards, but not all of them. Comparing HUD's primary rental assistance programs to other federal assistance programs that serve similar populations, HUD's programs differ in important ways; most notably, other assistance programs devolve more decisionmaking about income determination and eligibility to state administrators, whereas the HUD policies are largely set by federal statute and regulation.", "While the income and rent policies that govern HUD's five main rental assistance programs are designed to accurately calculate and capture family incomes and financial circumstances, they can also lead to confusion among recipients as well as difficulties for local program administrators. In response to the rather complicated rules, stakeholders and some policymakers have called for changes to the current system; in fact, several laws were enacted in the 114th Congress to streamline income and rent calculations and those policy changes are in various stages of implementation.", "This report provides answers to some of the most common questions about the income and rent policies in federal rental assistance programs, including questions about where these policies came from and how they compare to other federal assistance programs that serve the same or similar purposes or populations.

Prior to the introduction of Section 8, public housing, which has existed since the 1930s, provided housing for \"low income\" families. While the federal law governing public housing included rules regarding rent-to-income ratios (e.g., a family's income could not be more than five times the rent), each PHA made the determination of what was considered \"low income\" for the area that it served. Further, two other multifamily housing programs enacted in the 1960s used different measures for income eligibility. The Section 221(d)(3) program generally based eligibility on costs to support a unit, but not to exceed area median income, while the Section 236 program set eligibility at 135% of public housing income limits.", "Proposals to standardize eligibility using median income came from HUD. In both 1970 and 1971, Administration-sponsored bills proposed to simplify income eligibility for FHA-insured multifamily housing programs, which at the time primarily consisted of the Section 236 program, by tying eligibility to median income rather than local public housing income limits. The rationale was that the variability of public housing income limits resulted in regional disparities in who was eligible for assistance in multifamily housing. The area median income measure was meant to \"provide the needed flexibility to serve all geographic areas equitably.\"", "The Administration proposals to standardize income eligibility were not adopted. However, a few years later when Congress enacted the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-383 ), it incorporated area median income into the newly enacted Section 8 program eligibility guidelines, as well as Section 236, setting eligibility at 80% of AMI. In addition, the term \"very low-income\" was introduced and defined as income that does not exceed 50% of area median income. P.L. 93-383 changed the law regarding public housing so that at least 20% of new units were available to very low-income families, but eligibility criteria for public housing generally were not changed to define low-income as 80% of AMI until 1981, as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 97-35 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Origin of the Income-Based Rent Setting Standard?", "paragraphs": ["Most families receiving federal rental assistance pay 30% of their adjusted income toward rent (or 10% of gross income, or welfare rent, if higher).

The Brooke Amendment limited tenant contributions toward rent in public housing at no more than 25% of family income. Prior to that time, tenant contributions toward rent were set by PHAs based on the cost of maintaining public housing. As public housing properties aged, the cost of maintaining them grew and families were asked to pay higher and higher rents. The Brooke Amendment was intended to cap tenants' contributions toward rent in public housing at a level that was deemed affordable. The 25% standard of affordability that was adopted under the Brooke Amendment was based on pre-Great Depression standards for mortgage qualification: a week's wages for a month's rent (or, 25% of income).

Rather than specifying maximum income eligibility for tenants, the LIHTC program sets standards that apply at the property level. In order for a property to receive tax credits under the program and be in compliance with program rules, either 20% of the units must be rented to families with incomes at or below 50% of local area median income, or 40% of units must be rented to families with incomes at or below 60% of median income. This effectively means that families must have income at either 50% or 60% of AMI in order to live in rent-restricted units. The LIHTC program uses the HUD definition of income.", "Low-income families in rent-restricted units pay flat, below-market rents rather than income-based rents.

Under the Medicaid MAGI income counting rules, the state will look at the individual's MAGI, deduct an amount equal to 5% of the Federal Poverty Level, which the law provides as a standard disregard, and compare that income to the new income standards set by each state in coordination with the federal government to determine if the individual meets the program's eligibility requirements.", "MAGI is defined as the Internal Revenue Code's (IRC's) adjusted gross income (AGI) plus certain foreign earned income and tax-exempt interest as calculated for tax purposes. AGI reflects a number of deductions, including trade and business deductions, losses from sale of property, and alimony payments, increased by tax-exempt interest and income earned by U.S. citizens or residents living abroad. From there, various types of income not included in AGI are added to calculate MAGI depending on the particular program (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA exchange and premium tax credits). Additionally, under Medicaid regulations, particular types of income may be subtracted from AGI to calculate MAGI for determining Medicaid eligibility. The inclusions and exclusions under MAGI differ substantially from the inclusions and exclusions used for determining adjusted gross income under HUD's rental assistance programs.", "Certain groups (e.g., individuals who are eligible for Medicaid through another federal or state assistance program such as foster care children and individuals receiving SSI, and the elderly) are exempt from income eligibility determinations for Medicaid based on MAGI.
