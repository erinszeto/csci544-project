The United States currently maintains robust sanctions regimes against foreign governments it has identified as proliferators (particularly Iran, North Korea, and Syria). If the 112th Congress takes up even a fraction of the proposals introduced by its predecessor involving economic sanctions, the President and the Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury\u2014those agencies that implement and administer the bulk of sanctions regimes\u2014will likely find the role of Congress in determining the use of sanctions also robust.", "This report offers a listing and brief description of legal provisions that require or authorize the imposition of some form of economic sanction against countries, companies, persons, or entities that violate U.S. nonproliferation norms.

While earlier legislation required the cutoff of foreign aid to countries engaged in specified nuclear proliferation activities and mentioned other sanctions as a possible mechanism for bringing countries into compliance with goals of treaties or international agreements, it was not until 1990 that Congress enacted explicit guidelines for trade sanctions related to missile proliferation. In that year a requirement for the President to impose sanctions against U.S. persons or foreign persons engaging in trade of items or technology listed in the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex (MTCR Annex) was added to the Arms Export Control Act and to the Export Administration Act of 1979. Subsequently, Congress legislated economic sanctions against countries that contribute to the proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons in a broad array of laws.", "The use of economic sanctions in furtherance of foreign policy or national security policy fell into disfavor in the mid- to late 1990s, in reaction to reports of the substantial toll paid by civilian populations when sanctions were cast broadly or wielded as a blunt force. At the same time, however, concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation shifted into high gear, fueled by nuclear weapons tests conducted by India and Pakistan (1998), and later by North Korea (2006 and 2009), North Korea's formal withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (2003), multiple missile tests by North Korea, reports of Iraq having weapons of mass production, possibly chemical and biological (leading into war in 2003); Iran's noncompliance with international agreements (which the International Atomic Energy Act began reporting in 2005), and the 2004 discovery that a leading nuclear scientist in Pakistan\u2014A.Q. Khan\u2014had been selling nuclear materials, technology, and knowledge to the highest bidder, including North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya, for more than a decade.", "The 111 th Congress enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, but some have expressed concern that the executive branch is taking full advantage of flexibility the Act provides in its implementation. The new Congress might revisit this legislation. Unfinished initiatives of the 111 th Congress raise the possibility that Belarus, Burma, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela are supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Events of recent weeks signaling North Korea's and Iran's belligerence, disclosure of classified diplomatic documents that has churned up speculation and conjecture in the policy making and policy analysis communities, and the shift in political power particularly in the House of Representatives, could all have an impact on the 112 th Congress's approach to both sanctions and proliferation concerns. Other foreign policy and national security concerns\u2014terrorism, regional stability, human rights, and the nexus among these issues that shape rogue regimes\u2014could result in increased use of economic sanctions. ", "President Obama has also initiated a scrutiny of U.S. export policy, with an eye toward streamlining licensing procedures and increasing exports. Many statutes that establish an authority or a requirement to impose economic sanctions to deter proliferation are implicated in export controls and thus are likely to be at least impacted by export control reforms, and perhaps will present an obstacle to that reform.", "This report offers an alphabetic listing and brief description of legal provisions that require or authorize the imposition of some form of economic sanction on countries, companies, or persons who violate U.S. nonproliferation norms.
