Ownership is represented by owning shares of stock outright or having the right to convert other financial instruments into stock.

ARRA increased the maximum leverage available to SBICs to up \"to three times the private capital raised by the SBIC, or $150 million, whichever is less, and $225 million for multiple licensees under common control\" and increased \"the maximum leverage amounts to $175 million for single funds and $250 million for multiple funds under common control who are licensed after September 30, 2009, and invest 50% of their dollars in low income geographic areas.\"", "As mentioned previously, P.L. 113-76 increased the annual leverage amount the SBA is authorized to provide to SBICs to $4 billion from $3 billion, P.L. 114-113 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, increased the SBIC program's multiple licenses/family of funds limit to $350 million, and P.L. 115-187 , the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017, increased the maximum amount of leverage for individual SBICs to $175 million.", "Advocates of increasing the SBIC program's leverage limits have argued that these actions are necessary to help fill a perceived gap in the SBA's \"array of capital access programs.\" In addition, they argue that the demise of the SBIC participating securities program and the current \"underutilization\" of the SBIC debentures program is preventing many small firms from accessing the capital necessary to fully realize their economic potential and assist in the national economic recovery. On the other hand, others worry about the potential risk that an expanded SBIC program has for the taxpayer, especially if investments are targeted at startup and early stage small businesses which, by definition, have a more limited credit history and a higher risk for default than businesses that have established positive cash flow."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Some Members of Congress have argued that the SBA should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. In their view, encouraging greater utilization of the SBIC program will increase small business access to capital, result in higher levels of job creation and retention, and promote economic growth. For example, on March 19, 2012, during Senate consideration of the INVEST in America Act of 2012, then-Senator Olympia Snowe argued ", "The amendment [ S.Amdt. 1833 ] I and Senator Landrieu introduced would also help small companies access capital by modifying the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, Program to raise the amount of SBIC debt the Small Business Administration, SBA, can guarantee from $3 billion to $4 billion. It would also increase the amount of SBA guaranteed debt a team of SBIC fund managers who operate multiple funds can borrow. The SBIC provisions in this amendment have bipartisan support, are noncontroversial, come at no cost to taxpayers and will create jobs. We do not get many bills of this kind in the Senate anymore. ", "One of the most difficult challenges facing new small businesses today is access to capital. The SBIC Program has helped companies like Apple, FedEx, Callaway Golf, and Outback Steakhouse become household names. As entrepreneurs and other aspiring small business owners well know, it takes money to make money. This legislation ensures that our entrepreneurs and high-growth companies have access to the resources they need so they can continue to drive America's economic growth and job creation in these challenging times. There is no reason why Congress should not approve this amendment to ensure capital is getting into the hands of America's job creators. ", "This amendment will spur investment in capital-starved startup small businesses, which will play a critical role in leading the Nation of the devastating economic downturn from which we have yet to emerge. For those who may be unfamiliar, despite significant entrepreneurial demand for small amounts of capital, because of their substantial size, most private investment funds cannot dedicate resources to transactions below $5 million. The Nation's SBICs are working to fill that gap, especially even during these challenging times.", "Others worry about the potential risk an expanded SBIC program may have for increasing the federal deficit. In their view, the best means to assist small business, promote economic growth, and create jobs is to reduce business taxes and exercise federal fiscal restraint. For example, Representative Sam Graves, then-chair of the House Committee on Small Business, indicated in the Small Business Committee's FY2013 \"views and estimates\" letter to the House Budget Committee that the House Small Business Committee supported an increase in the SBIC program's authorization to $4 billion from $3 billion. However, he indicated that the committee opposed funding for the SBA's early stage SBIC initiative and impact investment SBIC initiative because of their potential to generate losses that could lead to higher SBIC fees or to the need to provide federal funds to subsidize the SBIC program. Representative Graves wrote in the FY2013 views and estimates letter that ", "The debenture SBIC program is designed to provide equity injections to small businesses that have been operational and have a track record of cash-flow and profits. \u2026 The program is financially sound because the structure of repayments ensures that the government will not suffer significant losses. Thus, no changes are needed to the program and it operates on a zero subsidy basis without an appropriation. The SBA budget is fully supportive of this program and we concur in that recommendation, including raising the program level from $3 billion to $4 billion. ", "Presumably, some of the additional program level (which will cost the federal government no money) will be used to support two new variations in the Debenture SBIC Program [the early stage SBIC initiative and the impact investment SBIC initiative] \u2026 Neither initiative has received authority from Congress nor had its operational principles assessed by the Committee prior to implementation. The Committee reiterates its recommendation from last year's views and estimates \u2013 no funds should be allocated from the additional debenture program levels for these two programs. The Committee on the Budget also should provide further protection to the existing debenture SBIC program by requiring any modifications to the program, whether a pilot program or not, be based on a new subsidy calculation that ensures the current debenture program will operate at zero subsidy without any increase in fees due to losses stemming from the Impact and Early Stage Innovation programs.", "The House Committee on Small Business's FY2016 views and estimates letter reiterated the committee's opposition to the funding of these two initiatives and recommended that any modifications to the SBIC program \"whether a pilot program or not, be based on a new subsidy calculation that ensures the current debenture program will operate at zero subsidy without any increase in fees.\" ", "As these quotations attest, congressional debate concerning the SBIC program has primarily involved assessments of the ability of small businesses to access capital from the private sector and evaluations of the program's risk, the effect of proposed changes on the program's risk, and the potential impact of the program's risk on the federal deficit. Empirical analysis of economic data can help inform debate concerning the ability of small businesses to access capital from the private sector and the extent of the program's risk, the effect of proposed changes on the program's risk, and the potential impact of the program's risk on the federal deficit.
