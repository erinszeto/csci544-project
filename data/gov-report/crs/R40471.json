The unpredictable nature of the location and scale of natural disasters poses a significant fiscal management challenge to Congress. To alleviate the federal costs of disasters, Congress amended the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 in 1988 (P.L. 100-707), which was renamed the Robert T.

Structural mitigation activities may include physical changes to a facility or development of standards such as building codes and material specifications. Examples of physical changes to a structure are retrofitting a building to be more resistant to wind-hazards or earthquakes, or elevating a structure to reduce flood damage. Nonstructural activities may include community planning initiatives such as developing land-use zoning plans, disaster mitigation plans, and flood plans.

Communities are increasingly confronted with natural disasters that are devastating and costly, and public officials are being challenged with providing for the safety of established communities.", "Mitigation is an activity designed to reduce the impacts from such hazards or events. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines mitigation as follows:", "Mitigation is defined as any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to life and property from a hazard event. Mitigation, also known as prevention (when done before a disaster), encourages long-term reduction of hazard vulnerability. The goal of mitigation is to decrease the need for response as opposed to simply increasing the response capability. Mitigation can save lives and reduce property damage, and should be cost-effective and environmentally sound. This, in turn, can reduce the enormous cost of disasters to property owners and all levels of government. In addition, mitigation can protect critical community facilities, reduce exposure to liability, and minimize community disruption.", "Mitigation activities are generally categorized as structural and nonstructural.

As disasters increased in frequency, scope, and cost, Congress reconsidered this approach and passed legislation that would pro-actively establish guidelines for federal disaster assistance. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (Disaster Relief Act), and subsequent amendments, established the basis for current federal disaster assistance. Most of the amendments to the Disaster Relief Act were enacted in response to a series of major disasters: Hurricane Carla in 1962, Hurricane Betsy in 1965, Hurricane Agnes in 1972, and a devastating earthquake in Alaska in 1964. These disasters caused considerable loss of life and property. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 reduced the need to pass legislation each time a disaster occurred. While there was no longer a need to address each disaster individually, Congress was still concerned with the loss of life and increasing federal costs attributed to disasters. Hazard mitigation legislation provided a mechanism to enable Congress to address the impacts of disasters.

The HMGP provides grants for long-term hazard mitigation projects after a major disaster declaration. A major disaster declaration is issued by the President under the authority of the Stafford Act.

Long-term mitigation projects may include elevating properties, acquiring properties and converting them to open space, retrofitting buildings, and constructing floodwall systems to protect critical facilities.

After the Midwest floods in 1993, Congress once again evaluated hazard mitigation. The Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance Act of 1993 (Mitigation Act of 1993) resulted in a significant change in the HMGP. While the program authorized funds for hazard mitigation, many cash-strapped states were unable to provide the 50% match necessary to implement an HMGP project. As a way to encourage states to utilize hazard mitigation funding, the federal cost-share for the HMGP was increased. The Mitigation Act of 1993 increased the federal cost-share from 50 percent to 75 percent and increased the amount of HMGP funding by changing the formula. The statute also raised the ceiling of the program. The formula percentage used to determine the level of funding for HMGP was increased to 15 percent and the basis for funding was extended from just public assistance grant expenditures to all grant expenditures under Title IV of the Stafford Act, excepting administrative costs. The Mitigation Act of 1993 also added property acquisition and relocation assistance provisions to the Stafford Act to encourage the purchase of properties and conversion to open space in areas affected by the Midwest floods in 1993 and subsequent floods.

The FEMA administration wanted to see an increase in mitigation activities while the appropriators were looking for cost-saving measures. In response to these needs, Congress increased, once again, the ceiling on federal assistance under Section 404. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) increased the percentage cap by adding a provision that a state may be eligible for up to 20 percent of the total of public and individual assistance funds authorized for the disaster if the state has a FEMA-approved enhanced mitigation plan in place prior to the disaster.

Some perceive communication infrastructure and interoperability a response function rather than a mitigation function since it improves the response time for emergency assistance. Others argue that improvements to responder communication systems integrated into local mitigation plans address a life saving and property protection objective.

This \"spend now and save later\" theory was reflected in changes to HMGP percentages both before and after the MMC study.", "As discussed previously, the Mitigation Act of 1993 increased the basis for determining the HMGP amount by changing the calculation to include all Stafford Act Title IV assistance rather than just Section 406 assistance. The Mitigation Act of 1993 also increased the percentage of that basis from 10 percent to 15 percent. The DMA 2000 increased the percentage to 20 percent for states that undertake mitigation planning. Taken together, the Mitigation Act of 1993 and the DMA 2000 resulted in a significant estimated increase in HMGP federal share obligations.", "Under the \"spend now and save later\" theory, hazard mitigation is an effective policy tool in that it has been found to be cost effective and saves lives and property. Given that general understanding, the topic of fiscal management may be raised. One issue is how Congress can adequately estimate the cost of hazard mitigation and better anticipate funding levels. Estimating the impacts of changes to the formula used to determine the amount of funds available under the HMGP presents a fiscal management challenge. The difficulty Congress faces in allocating funds for hazard mitigation is evident in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate of the Mitigation Act of 1993 prior to its enactment. In a House committee report, CBO estimated that the Mitigation Act of 1993 would result in an average annual outlay increase of $18 million in fiscal year 1994. The actual average annual increase resulting from the Mitigation Act of 1993, shown in Table 2 , is approximately $344 million, which varies significantly from the CBO projected impact of $18 million in FY1994."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Assessment and Disaster Prediction Accuracy", "paragraphs": ["The successful implementation of programs such as HMGP relies heavily on the assumption that the location and scope of disasters can be adequately estimated. In order to successfully mitigate the impact of a disaster, communities must have an accurate estimate of where the hardest impact will be felt. The accuracy of risk assessments and impact predictions provide the foundation for fund prioritization at the local, state, and federal level.", "Communities have limited resources to commit to activities such as hazard assessment. Community leaders are often faced with choosing between relocating a school that resides in a flood plain or constructing a tornado shelter in the park that hosts a multitude of events for families. Risk assessment tools such as flood maps and computer simulations are used to make project prioritization decisions. An inaccurate risk assessment could adversely impact hazard mitigation project selection and result in an inefficient use of funds. Legislation was introduced in the 111 th Congress that would establish a National Hurricane Research Initiative (NHRI). The NHRI would conduct research to improve hurricane preparedness. Hurricane preparedness research includes evaluating hurricane intensity predictions, understanding ocean-atmosphere interactions, predicting storm surge, rainfall, and wind impacts, improving storm measurements, assessing structural vulnerability, and hurricane related technology and planning. Congress may wish to consider expanding this initiative to include assessing the accuracy of flood insurance rate maps utilized in hazard mitigation.", "Project selection is also dependent on tools such as the Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA). Local, state, and federal officials utilize this tool to make project funding decisions. The accuracy of risk assessment tools and a BCA depend on the accuracy of the information that is used. If a local or state government is using outdated flood maps, or relying on default variables in simulation models, the result may not be the best prediction of the location or impact from a disaster. State and local governments are limited in their capacity to evaluate the accuracy of risk assessment tools and to conduct a BCA. Though some federal grant programs provide funding for planning and technical assistance, Congress may wish to consider increasing the funding to provide a greater degree of technical expertise in risk assessment and disaster impact predictions.

The MMC was established in 1997 as a voluntary, advisory body of the National Institute of Building Sciences. The MMC study provided guidance on utilizing the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). A BCR is the statistical result of a BCA. A BCR of one (1) means that for every dollar spent, there is a dollar benefit. The BCA software for the HMGP assigns a dollar benefit to a wide array of variables so that less quantifiable benefits such as reduction in the risk of loss of life can be estimated. After the MMC study, the most-competitive mitigation projects were considered by FEMA to be those that had a BCR of four (4) or higher. This does not mean that a project with a BCR less than four (4) is not eligible for funding. However, the BCR serves as a tool for prioritizing projects. Projects with a higher BCR are often funded in lieu of projects with a lower BCR. With such emphasis on the BCR, Congress may wish to consider augmenting the technical expertise of the applicants and reviewers at the local and state level.

Some may contend that block granting all hazard mitigation programs could provide more effective grants administration at the state and federal level. Block grants allow for more flexibility in the use of funds and often reduces grant program requirements. Block grants also present more of a challenge for Congressional oversight because of the reduced requirements. Hazard mitigation block grants could also potentially address the decision-making complications for allocating HMGP funds by enhancing state discretion regarding risks and project selection priorities.

Bush attempted to replace HMGP with a competitive consolidated hazard mitigation grant program that would be not be linked to a disaster declaration. While Congress rejected the Bush Administration's budget proposal to eliminate HMGP, they did move resources into the existing Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program.

According to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, the project was \"designed to minimize recurrent flood damage to public and private structures in the area.\" Since completion of the project, storms resulted in substantially less flood damage to all structures, including private businesses.", "FEMA mitigation grants also provide funding for disaster planning.

Today, the burden for hazard mitigation still lies predominately with individuals and local government. The federal government encourages state and local governments to address hazards through various programs, notably HMGP. Understanding the fiscal management challenges of hazard mitigation programs is critical in evaluating current and future programs. Additionally, consideration of the federal role in hazard mitigation includes areas where complications in implementing hazard mitigation activities have arisen. One area of complication is the lag between a major disaster declaration and expenditure of federal hazard mitigation assistance. Another area is the structure of grants administration at the federal, state, and local level.", "A decision by Congress to increase federal hazard mitigation assistance would potentially address some problems and challenges; however, that approach may not ensure greater effectiveness. The potential cost savings of hazard mitigation has to be weighed against the fiscal management challenges of estimating the costs. Other approaches may include changing the structure of mitigation grants by consolidating federal programs, modifying grant eligibility criteria, and funding certain project types to provide a higher degree of technical assistance for risk assessment. An evaluation of the risk analysis used in federal programs and public safety regulations may also provide a higher degree of effective hazard mitigation.
