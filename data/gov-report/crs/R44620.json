Compared with conventional chemical drugs, biologics are relatively large and complex molecules. They may be composed of proteins (and/or their constituent amino acids), carbohydrates (such as sugars), nucleic acids (such as DNA), or combinations of these substances. Biologics may also be cells or tissues used in transplantation.", "A biosimilar, sometimes referred to as a follow-on biologic, is a therapeutic drug that is similar but not structurally identical to the brand-name biologic made by a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. In contrast, a generic chemical drug is an exact copy of a brand-name chemical drug. Because biologics are more complex than chemical drugs, both in composition and method of manufacture, biosimilars will not be exact replicas of the brand-name product, but may instead be shown to be highly similar. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates both biologics and chemical drugs.", "Biologics and biosimilars frequently require special handling (such as refrigeration) and processing to avoid contamination by microbes or other unwanted substances. Also, they are usually administered to patients via injection or infused directly into the bloodstream. For these reasons, biologics often are referred to as specialty drugs. The cost of specialty drugs, including biologics, can be extremely high.", "In April 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized for marketing in Europe the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone. The EMA lists a total of 40 biosimilars on its website; 2 products were refused authorization and 3 were withdrawn, leaving a total of 35 biosimilars authorized for the European market. The introduction of biosimilars in Europe has reduced prices for biologics overall, in some cases by 33% compared with the original price of the brand-name product. For one drug in Portugal, the price reduction was 61%.", "In contrast, the pathway to marketing biosimilars in the United States has had several barriers. FDA approved Omnitrope in June 2006, following an April 2006 court ruling requiring the FDA to move forward with consideration of the application. At the time Omnitrope was approved, FDA indicated that this action \"does not establish a pathway\" for approval of other follow-on biologic drugs and stated that Congress must change the law before the agency can approve copies of nearly all other such products.", "Four years later, in March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA by creating an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products demonstrated to be \"highly similar\" (biosimilar) to or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed biological product. The new authority was accomplished via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, enacted as Title VII of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148). Congress authorized FDA to collect associated fees via the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA, P.L. 112-144). The five-year biosimilars user fee authority was set to expire on September 30, 2017. Congress reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program via the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA, P.L. 115-52).", "As more biosimilars enter the U.S. market, analysts expect to see U.S. price reductions similar to those that have occurred in Europe. However, of the seven biosimilars approved by FDA, sales of five biosimilars have been delayed, or (allegedly) adversely impacted, by actions of the brand-name manufacturers. Three biosimilars (Erelzi, Amjevita, and Cyltezo) have had their marketing launch delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. In addition, Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson (J&J) alleging that J&J has entered into anticompetitive contracts with insurers that prevent coverage of Pfizer's biosimilar (Inflectra), a less expensive substitute for J&J's best-selling biologic (Remicade). The alleged anticompetitive practices would be expected to have a negative impact on another recently approved biosimilar (Renflexis).", "The high costs of pharmaceuticals in general\u2014and biologics in particular\u2014has led to an increased interest in understanding the federal government's role in the development of costly new therapeutics. In the case of six of the seven biosimilars approved by FDA, the associated brand-name drug was originally discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions.

A generic drug is chemically identical to its reference brand-name drug. The molecular structure of a commonly used chemical drug is much smaller than a biologic and therefore less complicated and more easily defined. For example, Table 1 shows that the chemical drug aspirin contains nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms while the biologic drug Remicade contains over 6,000 carbon atoms, almost 10,000 hydrogen atoms, and about 2,000 oxygen atoms. Inflectra, which is biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2016.", "The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) within FDA regulates what are often referred to as traditional biologics, such as vaccines, blood and blood products, allergenic extracts, and certain devices and test kits.

Examples of types of therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER are briefly described in the list below.", "Monoclonal antibodies\u2014proteins that bind to a specific substance in the body or a specific cell.

Cytokines\u2014proteins that control (stimulate or slow down) the immune system and are used to fight cancer, infections, and other diseases. Examples include interleukins, interferons, and colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim. Growth factors\u2014substances, such as hormones, made by the body that regulate cell division and cell survival, such as the human growth hormone somatropin. Enzymes\u2014proteins that speed up chemical reactions in the body. Enzymes take part in many cell functions, including cell signaling, growth, and division. In cancer treatment, enzyme inhibitors may be used to block certain enzymes that cancer cells need to grow. Immunomodulators\u2014substances, such as a vaccine, that stimulate or suppress the immune system and may help the body fight cancer, infection, or other diseases. ", "Biologics and biosimilars frequently require special handling (such as refrigeration) and processing to avoid contamination by microbes or other unwanted substances. Also, they are usually administered to patients via injection or infused directly into the bloodstream. For these reasons, biologics often are referred to as specialty drugs. In the past, biologics were often dispensed by pharmacies with specialized facilities and personnel. The term specialty drugs is now used to describe drugs that are expensive for any of several reasons, including the requirement for special handling. ", "The cost of specialty drugs, including biologics, may be extremely high. For example, the annual cost of some biologic medications, such as Soliris (eculizumab) and Vimizim (elosulfase alfa), exceeds $250,000 per patient. The use of biologics and spending on these products has been increasing; see for example Appendix C . Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, a 13% increase over 2015. The amount spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition in 2016 was $3.2 billion (3% of $105.5 billion), of which $2.9 billion was spent on \"original\" biologics and $0.3 billion was spent on biosimilars. Biologics spending has increased by 10% each year since 2011. ", "According to a December 2016 report to Congress by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), \"[i]ncreases in spending in the Medicare Part B program have been driven by increases in biologics. Spending on biologics between 2006 and 2014 grew by 13.3 percent annually, whereas spending on small molecule drugs grew by 0.7 percent annually during the same period. In 2014, biologics accounted for 63 percent of prescription drug spending in Part B.\"", "Biologic drugs are often more expensive in the United States than in Europe and Canada; see Appendix B . In Europe, the introduction of biosimilars has reduced prices for biologics, in some cases by 33% compared with the original price of the reference product; for one drug in Portugal, the price reduction was 61%.

By offering an alternative to brand-name drug products, the Hatch-Waxman Act has been credited with lowering the cost of drugs to consumers, as well as allowing the U.S. generic drug industry to expand.", "For chemical drugs, \"generic medications decrease prices 60% to 90% on branded oral-solid medications,\" according to some experts. The generic drug industry achieves cost savings by avoiding the expense of clinical trials, as well as the initial drug research and development costs incurred by the brand-name manufacturer. Before a generic drug is approved for marketing, the generic drug company must demonstrate to the FDA that the drug product is identical to the original product. This \"sameness\" allows the generic company to rely on, or \"reference,\" the FDA's previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the already approved drug. A generic drug is considered to be interchangeable with its reference (brand-name) drug and with other generic products that use the same reference drug. The sponsor of the generic drug must also meet manufacturing process standards and reporting requirements.", "During the time that Hatch-Waxman was debated by Congress and later implemented by the FDA, the biotechnology industry was developing its first biologics for use as human therapeutic agents. In 1982, FDA allowed on the market the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry, human insulin (Humulin-R). This was followed by human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986, tissue plasminogen activator (Activase) in 1987, and erythropoietin (Epogen) in 1989.", "Most biological products are regulated\u2014 licensed for marketing by FDA via a biologics license application (BLA)\u2014under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Biological products were originally regulated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its precursors. In 1972, this regulatory responsibility was transferred to FDA; see Appendix A of this report for further details. All chemical prescription drugs are regulated\u2014 approved for marketing by FDA via a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA)\u2014under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).", "The Hatch-Waxman Act provided a mechanism for the approval of generic drugs under the FFDCA, but it did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. As a result, after Hatch-Waxman, companies could submit follow-on biologics applications for FDA review only for the very small number of so-called \"natural source\" biologics that had been approved under the FFDCA. Companies were effectively blocked from submitting follow-on applications for the much larger group of therapeutic biologics that had been licensed under the PHSA.", "Historically, certain biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA rather than as biologics under the PHSA. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin. The hormone insulin is a small protein\u2014a short chain of 51 amino acids\u2014that regulates carbohydrate (sugar) metabolism. In the 1940s, insulin was obtained in the same way as many biologics\u2014extraction from animals\u2014hence the term \"natural source.\" Despite this similarity with other biologics, insulin was regulated as a drug by FDA rather than as a biologic by NIH. Besides insulin, a small set of other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA rather than as biologics under the PHSA: the hormone glucagon, human growth hormone, hormones to treat infertility, hormones used to manage menopause and osteoporosis, and certain medical enzymes (hyaluronidase and urokinase).", "Even when patent protection for specialty biologic drug products was approaching expiration, the market competition that occurred with chemical drugs via generics could not happen with therapeutic biologics because FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars. Although some entities, such as the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA, now called the Association for Accessible Medicines), advocated that the FDA establish a regulatory system for the approval of biosimilars under its existing statutory authority, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) filed a citizen petition with the FDA requesting a number of actions that would have inhibited the approval of biosimilars. ", "In contrast, the pathway to marketing biosimilars in Europe seemingly had fewer barriers. In April 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized for marketing in Europe the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone.

The court ruled that the FDA must move forward with consideration of the application, submitted by Sandoz in 2003, which presented Omnitrope as \"indistinguishable\" from the FDA-approved Genotropin, marketed by Pfizer. Sandoz \"alleged that the FDA had violated its statutory obligation to act on the Omnitrope application within 180 days, a time frame that the FDA characterized as merely a congressional aspiration.\" The 505(b)(2) pathway, created by the Hatch-Waxman Act, was used to approve Omnitrope.", "At the time of the Omnitrope approval in 2006, the FDA indicated in a document on the agency's website that this action \"does not establish a pathway\" for approval of other follow-on biologic drugs. \"The agency has said that Congress must change the law before it can approve copies of nearly all other biotech products, and lawmakers haven't moved on the issue.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Regulatory Pathway for Biosimilars", "paragraphs": ["In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA by creating an abbreviated licensure pathway in Section 351(k) of the PHSA for biological products that are demonstrated to be \"highly similar\" (biosimilar) to or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed biological product. This authority was accomplished via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, enacted as Title VII of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ).

The alleged mechanism used by the brand-name manufacturer against the biosimilar manufacturer is explained in a June 2017 JAMA article: ", "If a biosimilar manufacturer intends to upend the preferred position of the brand by offering a substantial price discount to the [insurer], the branded manufacturer can respond by withdrawing the rebate on the [branded] biologic, creating a \"rebate trap.\" For any patient continuing the [branded] biologic, a payer's cost for that patient will double once the rebate is withdrawn . . . . Even in [an] optimistic scenario, in which the price of the biosimilar is 60% less than the price of the brand after rebates and discounts, if the payer is only able to convert 50% of its patient users to the biosimilar [because existing patients will tend to stay on the original branded product], the rebate trap ensures that payer total costs actually increase relative to costs prior to biosimilar availability. ", "To avoid the rebate trap, any strategy to reduce spending on biologics through adoption of biosimilars requires a near-complete switch of patient users from the branded biologic to the biosimilar. However, for many chronic diseases, the proportion of patients new to a given biological therapy is less than 20% of the total patients taking that drug in a given year. The remainder represents a stable base of patients whose disease is well-maintained while they are using current therapy and thus are unlikely to switch [to the biosimilar].", "According to Pfizer's lawsuit, \"providers have declined to purchase Inflectra across the board, even for patients covered by insurance plans that do cover the product.\" The lawsuit states that as of September 1, 2017, about 90% of health care providers using infliximab had purchased no Inflectra at all, almost no national commercial health insurer provided coverage for Inflectra, and Inflectra had secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the United States. Since FDA approved Inflectra in April 2016, \"J&J has raised the list price of Remicade by close to 9% and increased the amount the U.S. government reimburses for Remicade by more than $190 per infused dose.\" Pfizer states in the lawsuit that if J&J's anticompetitive practices are allowed to continue, these tactics \"will become the playbook for biologic originator firms seeking to preserve their dominance in the face of biosimilar competition\u2014thus subverting the competition-enhancing objectives of the BPCIA.\"", "The president of J&J's Janssen Biotech, Scott White, said the following in a statement regarding the Pfizer lawsuit: \"We are effectively competing on value and price, and to date Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value to patients, providers, payers and employers.

The WHO selects INNs based on the advice of experts on a WHO advisory panel. In January 2016, the WHO released its voluntary Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal for biosimilar naming. \"The BQ is an additional and independent element used in conjunction with the INN to uniquely identify a biological substance to aid in the prescription and dispensing of medicines, pharmacovigilance, and the global transfer of prescriptions.

[A]ny differences in nonproprietary names generally signal pharmacological and chemical relationship differences between the products. Although the FDA's proposal will use the same USAN as the core name for each biosimilar and its reference biologic, based on historical practice, the addition of unique differentiating suffixes may lead physicians to believe mistakenly that the products necessarily have clinically meaningful differences. ... Differences in the nonproprietary names of biosimilars could contribute to misperceptions that the drug substance of a biosimilar should be identical, not \"highly similar\" to that of its reference biologic. [Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars contend that] the term identical is abused to instill fear and foster misunderstanding. Because biosimilars are new in the U.S., many physicians do not yet fully understand that a lack of identicality is inherent in biologics.

FDA recommends that the highlights section of the labeling contain a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" describing the biosimilar product's relationship to its reference product. The biosimilar product is not required by FDA to have the same labeling as the reference product; for example, the number of approved indications for use may differ. FDA recommends that comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity not be included in biosimilar product labeling \"to avoid potential confusion or misinterpretation of the comparative data.\" However, such comparative data are available to prescribers and the public on the FDA website. ", "Comments on the FDA labeling guidance reflected differing views: while the generic industry wants less information in biosimilar labeling, the brand-name industry would like FDA to require more information. For example, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA, now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) said that the Biosimilarity Statement \"not only is unnecessary but also may be confusing to patients and healthcare providers.\" In contrast, BIO, which represents makers of brand-name pharmaceuticals among other companies, stated that more information is preferable to less with regard to labeling. \"The prescribing physician needs to have access to all relevant information, including the relevant nonclinical and clinical data supporting the finding of biosimilarity, and the resulting labeling should be transparent to allow the prescriber to identify whether the described studies were conducted with the biosimilar or reference product.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition", "paragraphs": ["Under the BPCIA, biologics that were approved as drugs under the FFDCA will transition to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020.

Following passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, one major source of cost saving was the ability of a pharmacist to substitute a generic drug for a brand-name drug without the intervention of a health care provider. However, because a biosimilar is not structurally identical to its brand-name biologic, assessing interchangeability is a separate process.

Under BsUFA I, FDA collected six different types of fees from industry; fee amounts were based on inflation-adjusted PDUFA human drug application fee amounts for each fiscal year.
