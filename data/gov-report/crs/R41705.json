In FY2018, NIH used its over $34 billion budget to support more than 300,000 scientists and research personnel working at over 2,500 institutions across the United States and abroad, as well as to conduct biomedical and behavioral research and research training at its own facilities. The agency consists of the Office of the Director, in charge of overall policy and program coordination, and 27 institutes and centers, each of which focuses on particular diseases or research areas in human health. A broad range of research is funded through a highly competitive system of peer-reviewed grants and contracts.", "The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) provides the statutory basis for NIH programs, and funding levels are mostly provided through the annual appropriations process. In December 2016, Congress introduced major reforms and programs at the NIH through the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Prior to 2016, the last time Congress addressed NIH with comprehensive legislation was in December 2006, when it passed the NIH Reform Act (P.L. 109-482). Congress also gives direction to NIH through appropriations report language, but usually not through budget line items or earmarks. Historically, Congress has accepted, for the most part, the scientific and public health priorities established by the agency through its planning and grant-making activities that involve members of the scientific community and the general public.", "NIH has seen periods of both low and high funding growth.

Congress maintains a high level of interest in NIH for a variety of reasons. NIH funds extramural researchers in every state, and widespread constituencies contact Congress about funding for particular diseases and levels of research support in general. NIH is the largest and most visible contributor to the federal biomedical research effort; it represents about half of federal spending for non-Department of Defense research and development (R&D) and about one-fifth of total federal R&D funding. It has the largest budget of the eight health-related agencies that make up the Public Health Service (PHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In FY2018, discretionary appropriations to NIH constituted about 40% of all HHS discretionary budget authority. ", "NIH-funded research has contributed to major scientific advances. To date, 156 NIH-funded researchers have received Nobel Prizes for their work. NIH-funded research has led to major medical innovations such as treatments for heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. Such advances have been credited with helping increase life expectancy and prevent millions of deaths. However, in light of the high cost of new medical innovations, some question whether NIH priorities are too focused on research that leads to new treatments rather than on disease prevention or improving the value of medical care. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate. ", "NIH has seen periods of both low and high funding growth.

Congress designated the research laboratory the National Institute of Health in 1930 (P.L. 71-251). It moved to donated land in the Maryland suburbs in 1938. By 1948, several new institutes and divisions had been created, and the agency became the National Institutes of Health (P.L. 80-655). Congress has continued to create new institutes and centers, most recently in 2011 with the establishment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS, P.L. 112-74 ; see Table 2 ).

The individual institutes and centers (ICs) may focus on particular diseases (i.e., The National Cancer Institute), areas of human health and development (i.e., The National Institute on Aging), scientific fields (i.e., National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), or biomedical professions and technology (i.e., National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering). Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with OD. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 (all 20 institutes, NLM, and the 3 research centers) of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to a buildings and facilities account (see \" Budget \"). The institutes, NLM, and the three research centers have the authority to award research grants; the three operational support centers do not award research grants. Under President Trump's FY2020 budget request, the activities of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) would be consolidated into NIH as the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ), forming a 28 th IC. The creation of a new NIH institute would require an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) Section 401(d), which specifies that \"[i]n the National Institutes of Health, the number of national research institutes and national centers may not exceed a total of 27\" (see discussion in \" NIH Reform Act of 2006 \"). President Trump's FY2019 and FY2018 budget requests also proposed consolidating AHRQ and other HHS institutes into NIH; however, Congress did not adopt these proposals. ", "NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure has been an issue of concern. There are costs and complexities of administering an agency made of 27 ICs, each with its own mission, budget, staff, review office, and other organizational apparatus. The resulting fragmentation may create research duplication or gaps, and might adversely affect NIH's ability to respond appropriately to new scientific and public health challenges.

The 2003 NAS report found that \"the most common mechanism of origin of the institutes has been the congressional mandate responding to the health advocacy community.\" The first institute was the National Cancer Institute (NCI) established in 1937. \"From the middle 1940s to 1974, health advocates were successful in persuading Congress to establish additional institutes, often against the wishes of administrations, which generally opposed creation of new categorical institutes.\" Health advocacy \"groups have continued the long established pattern of pushing for creation of named entities at NIH to create focal points for developing more research funding for particular diseases. That has often resulted in the establishment by Congress of a named program at the office level. Through continued pressure, offices may then be elevated to centers and, in some cases, to institute status.\" The 2003 NAS report noted challenges with NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure, but said that any proposals for changing the number of ICs or OD program offices should be subject to a public evaluation process.

The law enhanced the authority of the NIH Director's Office to perform strategic planning, provided for trans-NIH initiatives by enacting the Common Fund into law and required strategic planning for the Fund. It established the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) within the Office of the Director and moved a number of individual program offices (coordinating research on AIDS, women's health, behavioral and social sciences, and disease prevention) in OD to DPCPSI. The law established the Council of Councils to advise the NIH Director on the policies and activities of DPCPSI and to participate in developing proposals for trans-NIH research. The law requires a biennial report from the Director to Congress assessing the state of biomedical research and reporting in detail on the research activities of NIH, including strategic planning and initiatives, and summaries of research in a number of broad areas.

Information from the tracking system assists the Director and DPCPSI in planning trans-NIH research initiatives that cannot be handled within individual ICs. The reporting system, called Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT), \"provides access to reports, data, and analyses of NIH research activities, including information on NIH expenditures and the results of NIH-supported research.\"", "The Reform Act did not contain any provisions on specific diseases or fields of research, nor did it eliminate or consolidate any existing ICs. However, it did provide certain authorities to HHS and NIH officials for making organizational changes to NIH. It also created the Scientific Management Review Board (SMRB) to provide advice on the use of those organizational authorities. SMRB is charged with formally and publicly reviewing NIH organizational structure at least once every seven years. SMRB may recommend restructuring but the number of ICs is capped at the current 27. The law set out time frames for the Director to take action on such recommendations, and provided for review by Congress.", "As required by the Reform Act, SMRB has conducted public reviews of NIH's organizational structure and processes. In its first report on organizational change and effectiveness at the agency in 2010, SMRB \"recognized that a far reaching overhaul of the NIH structure is neither advisable nor feasible.\" Instead, SMRB proposed a framework for considering and evaluating potential organizational changes at NIH. Since the first report, SMRB has issued evaluations of specific research areas or ICs at NIH, with recommendations for organizational change.

In 2017, federal dollars made up about 60% of all funding to higher education institutions for \"biological and biomedical sciences research,\" and 53% of all funding for \"health sciences\" research. One commentary, published in 2018, explored how universities rely on NIH funding for researchers' salaries and laboratory facilities. During the doubling period of NIH funding from 2000 to 2004, universities rapidly increased square footage of laboratory space and hired more scientists\u2014possibly assuming future increases in NIH funds to support their growth. The growth in laboratories heightened the need and competition for NIH grants. According to the author, universities have switched to mostly financing researchers' salaries with grant funds in the past few decades. In the 1970s, universities paid about 75% of researchers' salaries; in 2014, many researchers received, on average, 65% of their salary from grants (based on available evidence; many universities do not share salary data). ", "As a result of reliance on competitive grant funding, researchers are spending increasing amounts of their time writing grant applications rather than conducting science. The author argues that universities should commit more of their \"hard money,\" or institutional funds, for research salaries and facilities to ensure the sustainability of biomedical research.", "NIH Director Francis Collins alluded to this issue in a January 2010 interview, stating that universities are \"becoming too reliant on NIH money, allowing faculty members to obtain all their income from federal research grants.\" Dr. Collins indicated that when faculty members run multiple research projects at the same time, \"that turns that investigator into a grant-writing machine perhaps more than a doing-of-science machine.\" However, he said, any new restrictions on NIH grants \"would have to be phased in over a fairly long period of time because many universities and faculty members would find that quite disruptive.\" President Trump's FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 budget proposals have included initiatives designed to \"stretch available grant dollars.\" The FY2018 budget proposal would cap the indirect costs that could be covered by NIH grants (facilities and administrative\u2014or F&A\u2014costs) at 10% of the total grant award to reduce the overall cost of an RPG. Over the previous 10 years, approximately 28% of grants were used to cover F&A costs. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the proposal to cap F&A costs. The report accompanying H.R. 3358 ( H.Rept. 115-244 ) stated that the Trump Administration's proposed cap on indirect (F&A) costs was \"misguided and would have a devastating impact on biomedical research across the country.\" The FY2019 budget request proposed capping the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%. It also proposed capping investigator salaries at $152,000, a 19% reduction from the current $187,000 limit. In the report accompanying H.R. 6470 , the House Appropriations Committee stated that it did not include the general provision in the budget request to limit the percentage of a researcher's salary that may be paid for using NIH grant funds, as the impact of such a change is unclear. The report stated, \"The Committee requests an analysis of the projected impact of such a policy change on the number and average cost of NIH grants, as well as on academic institutions, in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification\" ", "The FY2020 budget request, again, included the proposal to cap the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%. In the requested analysis published in the FY2020 Congressional Justification, NIH stated that \"no previous research examines the impact of reducing the salary cap on the number of grants and the average cost per grant.\" NIH noted that a salary cap reduction in FY2011 did not reduce the average cost of NIH grants and that the number of NIH grants awarded decreased, though other factors may have affected grant numbers and average costs. NIH also noted that an unintended consequence of the policy could be that institutions will have to make up for the rest of researchers' salaries, which \"may limit the number of applicants with sufficient resources to participate in Federally-funded research.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIH Initiatives to Recruit and Retain a Research Workforce", "paragraphs": ["NIH is concerned about retaining and attracting new scientists for biomedical research careers. In the past two decades, early-stage scientists have received a declining percentage of NIH grants and have spent more time in low-paid postdoctoral training positions. The number of traditional faculty positions in biomedical research has declined, while the number of postdoctoral positions has increased, creating a highly competitive and pessimistic outlook for obtaining traditional academic research positions. A 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) report stated that, \"these obstacles to success have created a research career path that is increasingly unattractive in terms of pay, duration, culture, risk-taking, and future job prospects.\"", "A relatively large portion of NIH funding goes to older and more established researchers. Between 1998 and 2014, the proportion of NIH-funded investigators over the age of 65 increased from 5% to 12%, while those younger than 50 declined from 54% to 39%. The average age at which an investigator first obtained an independent grant increased by more than five years between 1990 and 2016. During that time, the average age at which a new investigator first obtained a R01 grant (independent research project grant) increased from 36 years for PhDs and 38 years for MDs, to 42 years for PhDs and 45 years for MDs, respectively. Another analysis from the NIH Office of Extramural Research also found that the percentage of the NIH workforce made up of new investigators and early-stage investigators had declined between 2009 and 2016.", "In addition, the success rate for new investigators fell from 40% in 1962 to 27% in 2013. A 2018 GAO analysis found that \"extramural investigators who had received at least one large NIH research grant during fiscal years 2013 through 2017 were more likely to receive such grants in subsequent application cycles than investigators who had not yet received such grants.\"", "According to a 2017 study, a minority of highly funded researchers have received an increasing percentage of NIH grants in recent years. In 2015, the top 10% of NIH grant winners by total award received 37% of NIH funding, an increase from the 32% received in 1985, but down from a peak of 40% of total funding in 2010. In contrast, the bottom 40% of principal investigators received 12% of total funding in 2015, down from 16% in 1985. Of note, 2010 and 2015 were years of low funding growth, and therefore NIH might have been expected to make fewer new grant commitments to new investigators in these years, in order to sustain funding for ongoing research. In addition, the authors of the study described a lack of mobility for investigators. They concluded that researchers who start at the top tend to remain there, while researchers receiving a lower portion of funding remain poorly funded. Scientists in the top 20% of funding have more publications and citations, which may help explain grant success. ", "As previously mentioned, the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ) established the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative (NGRI) within the office of the NIH Director. This initiative is intended to provide opportunities for earlier independence while enhancing workforce diversity. Superseding previous policy on early-stage investigators, it requires the NIH Director to develop new policies and programs that promote opportunities for new researchers to receive funding, enhance training, and encourage workforce diversity.", "NIH has faced challenges in attempting to implement NGRI. In May 2017, NIH proposed to cap funding for highly funded investigators through a measure termed the Grant Support Index (GSI) to free up funding to early-stage investigators and others who receive less funding. Some members of the scientific community strongly opposed the GSI, arguing that it represented a move away from a merit-based system of allocating funding, would discourage collaboration and training, and was based on flawed analysis. Others argued that the highly funded researchers and institutions who would be affected by the policy could afford to diversify their funding sources. Ultimately, NIH cancelled the proposal after facing criticism at a Council of Councils meeting.", "As an alternative to GSI, in August 2017 NIH announced the official policy for the NGRI, which called on ICs to prioritize awards that fund early stage investigators (ESI) and early established investigators (EEIs). The policy defined ESIs as those who had completed training within 10 years and were gaining their first independent research award, and EEIs as those who had completed training within 10 years and who were at risk of losing NIH support or were supported only one active award. Through NGRI, NIH would free up \"substantial funds\" from its base budget to support ESIs and EEIs. NIH announced the program would start with $210 million in FY2017 and increase to $1.1 billion in five years, pending funding availability. NGRI was established to complement existing grant award opportunities that support ESIs and EEIs, such as the New Innovator Award and the Early Independence Award. Under NGRI, ICs would develop evidence-based strategies to increase and retain ESIs/EEIs, and NIH would track their outcomes.", "NIH again faced criticism that the program would prioritize ESIs and EEIs at the expense of established investigators, and that the rules for who qualified to be an ESI or EEI were too strict. NIH revised the policy to eliminate the EEI category, instead prioritizing investigators at risk of losing funding regardless of age, and to be \"flexible\" in designating who qualified for ESI status. NIH has established a working group to advise NIH on NGRI policy development. Despite apparent challenges, NIH Director Francis Collins stated at an August 2018 congressional hearing that the agency expects to fund more early-stage investigators than ever\u20141,100 researchers\u2014with their first grant in 2018 as a result of NGRI. The FY2020 budget request included further details about NIH plans for NGRI. NIH stated that it regularly collects data and evaluates outcomes on NIH-funded trainees and their transition to an independent career. In addition, the FY2020 budget request would provide $100 million in dedicated funding for NGRI, and the request stated: ", "in response to an advisory committee recommendation and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences, NIH is creating a new pathway for applications from early-stage investigators that does not require preliminary data and continues to provide a separate review of applications. NIH is also lengthening the window for early-stage eligibility to 11 years with additional flexibility due to significant life events. ", "As referred to in the above quote, in 2018, NASEM published a report that identified policy reforms to better support the next generation of biomedical researchers. NIH was directed to fund the report through the FY2016 LHHS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 114-113 , Division H), and is required by the Cures Act to consider its recommendations and submit a report on actions taken to Congress in 2020. In the 2018 report, the NASEM committee found that while reductions in NIH purchasing power have constrained grant funding available to early-stage investigators, universities and research institutions have been slower to make reforms and less responsive to the needs of early-stage investigators than NIH. For instance, many universities and research institutions may provide inadequate career counseling or job opportunities for new researchers. The NASEM committee therefore recommended policies that hold universities and research institutions accountable alongside the NIH in supporting ESIs, and preparing them for diverse and nonacademic careers. The committee also made recommendations for Congress to create a council on ongoing challenges in biomedical research, and for NIH to strengthen its programs for ESIs, among many others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Workforce Diversity at NIH", "paragraphs": ["Apart from age and experience, other inequalities also persist in grant funding, such as by gender and race/ethnicity. NIH has found that women and racial and ethnic minorities make up a larger portion of new and early-stage investigators than experienced investigators, and generally make up a larger portion of the applicant pool than the awardee pool for grants. There is also less representation of women and minorities among faculty positions in the biomedical sciences.", "On average, women scientists are awarded smaller grant sizes than those awarded to men. One study found that from 1991 to 2010, while women made up half of all PhDs awarded in the biomedical sciences, one-third of first-time NIH research grants were awarded to women investigators. However, after winning their first grant, women were as likely as male scientists to win another grant. The researchers attributed these findings to women dropping out of an academic research career at a higher rate than men in early stages of their career. NIH has found that women tend to get their first grant award at a later age than men; however, the age differences between genders appears to have narrowed in recent years. ", "From 2002 to 2016, there was a 7.5% to 10.5% gap in funding rates between scientists from underrepresented minority groups compared to those from majority groups. A 2018 GAO analysis of NIH data from 2013 to 2017 found that 17% of investigators from underrepresented racial groups\u2014African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders combined\u2014who applied for large grants received them, compared to 24% of Hispanic or Latino applicants, 24% of Asian applicants, and 27% of white applicants. In addition, the percentage of underrepresented minorities in the NIH grant applicant pool increased from 2002 to 2016.", "GAO noted that NIH has taken steps to support a diverse workforce, such as by hiring a Chief Officer of Scientific Workforce Diversity, who then created a workforce diversity strategic plan. GAO found that although NIH has developed initiatives for diversity, these programs have not been evaluated and that the programs do not have adequate performance measures to track their success. NIH diversity initiatives have included bias training for the intramural hiring committees, training and fellowship opportunities targeted at underrepresented groups, and ongoing career development, such as mentoring and conferences, for scientists from underrepresented groups."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. vs. Global Research", "paragraphs": ["While the United States remains the lead funder of research and development, other countries\u2014particularly China\u2014have increased public funding for research in recent years.

It found that U.S. government research funding declined from 57% (2004) to 49% (2011) of the global total, as did that of U.S. companies (50% to 41%), with the total U.S. (public plus private) share of global research funding declining from 57% to 44%. Asian countries (China, Japan, South Korea, India and, Singapore) increased investment from $28 billion (2004) to $52.4 billion (2011). China, in particular, almost quadrupled funding on medical research, from $2 billion in 2007 to $8.4 billion in 2012. Globally, the United States continues to be the top supporter of research and development.

In 2011, the United States led the world in publication of biomedical research articles\u2014accounting for 33% of articles published. However, in 2011, China was the leader in life science patent applications\u2014filing 30% of such patents globally. The United States followed with 24% of life science patents. Academic scientists often seek partnerships with colleagues or recruit students from other countries to advance their work. Yet, as new discoveries are translated to commercial products, such partnerships could complicate the economic development goals of public investment in research. ", "Some Members of Congress have expressed concern over the investments being made by other countries in biomedical research. In Section 809, \"Policy Statement on Medical Discovery, Development, Delivery and Innovation,\" H.Con.Res. 27 found that the \"United States leadership role is being threatened, however, as other countries contribute more to basic research from both public and private sources\" and that the \"Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation [sic] predicts that China, for example, will outspend the United States in total research and development by the end of the decade.\"", "The growth in global biomedical research funding has contributed to a surge in research produced outside of the United States, as well as increasing collaboration between U.S. and international institutions. A study of articles published from 2004 to 2013 in PubMed (a database of biomedical research literature based at the U.S. National Library of Medicine) found that published research funded by non-U.S. government sources had increased significantly during that period. Publications authored by European and Asian authors had increased at a higher rate than those by American authors. Collaboration between U.S. and international institutions has also grown in the past few decades.

Some participants from the program have received NIH funding, though they represent a small portion of foreign researchers in the United States. The report makes recommendations to educate institutions about disclosing and monitoring international ties, and to enhance cybersecurity to prevent information breaches.

The primary rationale for a federal government role in funding basic research is that private firms do not perform enough such research relative to the needs of society. The federal government may also invest in research to advance national and economic security for the nation.", "There are competing views about what roles the federal government and private industry should play in biomedical research and development (R&D). In traditional economics terms, science\u2014especially basic science\u2014is viewed as a public good: scientific knowledge may have widespread benefits that are difficult for an individual firm to \"capture,\" and society may not produce enough of it through industry alone. In the traditional economic view, the public sector should fund basic research, while private firms will concentrate on applied research and product development. However, the line between basic and applied research is blurred. There is some concern that, given the size of federal research funding, some of the federal funding could possibly \"crowd out private-sector investment in R&D\"\u2014meaning that absent public investment, industry would fund more research. On the other hand, one 2019 economic analysis found no evidence that NIH funding crowded out private sector R&D funding. Economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the U.S. government has played a more directive role in strategically accelerating innovation in technologies and industries through research and development, including in pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies. Mazzucato argues that federal efforts have been a driving force behind \"high risk\" innovation. Others view the public and private sector's respective roles in pharmaceutical research and development as a necessary collaboration, given the scientific complexity of current medical innovations. Academic and industry partnerships are increasingly common, with public sector institutions contributing to the early discovery phases of new medical advancements, and the private sector conducting more late-stage product development and clinical trials. The correct balance of federal and industry contributions to biomedical innovation is difficult to determine, and a source of debate.", "In recent years, both NIH and industry have shifted their allocation of R&D investments. A 2015 study showed that industry shifted from funding less basic and translational research to spending more on clinical trials. From 2004 to 2011, the pharmaceutical industry increased spending by 36% for phase 3 clinical trials (late-stage clinical trials required to prove drug safety and efficacy), while it decreased spending by 4% for preclinical research activities (prehuman research; includes basic and applied) in the same period. According to the authors, \"[t]his shift toward clinical research and development reflects increasing costs, complexity, and length of clinical trials but may also reflect a de-emphasis of early discovery efforts by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\" In recent years, NIH has also shifted to spending a slightly larger percentage on applied research compared to basic research\u2014in FY2017, NIH allocated 48.8% of its research budget authority for applied research (as opposed to basic research), compared to 41.2% in FY2002. Thus, NIH may be shifting to spending more on research than was previously funded by the industry.", "One analysis found that in 2015, industry accounted for 67.4% of all U.S. expenditures on medical and health research, followed by the federal government (27%) and universities (5%). Some argue that federal support of basic research not only stimulates industry spending on applied research and development (R&D) through scientific discoveries that expand industry R&D opportunities, but also stimulates industry R&D by training many of the researchers that are hired by industry. The training provided by NIH programs \"enhances the productivity and profitability of the companies' R&D investments.\" In contrast, NIH funding may indirectly affect the number of researchers available for the private sector, which can indirectly affect the salaries of these researchers.

Public-private partnerships are facilitated by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH).", "Two recent controversies have invoked scrutiny of NIH's public-private partnerships. In March 2018, the New York Times published an investigative report about scientists and NIH officials who solicited funding from members of the alcohol industry to support a large clinical trial about the health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. The industry's donations to the study would have been channeled through the FNIH. After the article was published, NIH conducted an investigation and subsequently shut down the study in June 2018. In addition, in April 2018, NIH cancelled a planned opioids research partnership with dozens of pharmaceutical companies aimed at finding new therapies for addiction and pain as a part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative. The cancellation occurred after NIH faced criticism and a working group subsequently recommended to avoid \"reputational and ethical risks\" created by receiving funds from certain drug makers, who were involved in litigation for their role in the opioid crisis. NIH has continued to fund the initiative with federal dollars only, and without cash contributions from industry members.", "As a result of the controversies, members of the biomedical research community have called for the NIH to change its practices around public-private partnerships. In the Journal of the American Medical Association , two observers argued that NIH should issue standard guiding principles for public-private partnerships and should have full transparency about funding sources on all relevant webpages and materials. They also argued that NIH should limit undue influence and bias of the industry in research design and protocols. Another observer argued that NIH should broadly limit industry involvement in research because of the subtle ways industry may influence research\u2014by funding certain types of studies or researchers that may favor their industry. In a December 2018 New York Times editorial, one medical researcher argued that while industry bias in scientific research is important to address, many forms of bias exist in science and therefore advocated for \"open science,\" where researchers' methods, data, funding, and affiliations are maximally transparent. At an August 2018 Senate hearing, NIH Director Francis Collins defended NIH's use of public-private partnerships: \"It brings around the same table scientists from both public and private sectors who design together what the research ought to be, building on the strengths of both groups and it advances the cause of science more rapidly than might otherwise have been.\" He noted, however, that NIH should be careful when the funder has a \"vested interest in a particular outcome of the study.\"", "The FNIH is small in the context of NIH's large portfolio. In FY2017, the total revenues for FNIH were $64 million, including in-kind contributions. Federal funding of over $30 billion per year therefore dwarfs private contributions to the FNIH. However, private sector funding and influence has increased in the larger biomedical research context. A study found that from 1988 to 2008, the proportion of industry-funded studies in three prominent American medical journals had doubled, from 17% to 40% of all studies. Moving forward, NIH may continue to define its relationship with the private sector in advancing biomedical research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Publicly Funded Research and Pharmaceutical Drug Development", "paragraphs": ["NIH is involved, both directly and indirectly, in pharmaceutical drug development. NIH funding directly contributes to pharmaceutical development when NIH-funded scientists develop a chemical compound or other invention that is patented and then licensed to the pharmaceutical industry. NIH also funds a limited amount of clinical research on new or existing pharmaceuticals to assess drug safety and effectiveness for FDA approval. Since over 50% of NIH funding supports basic research, NIH funded research is, to a greater extent, indirectly involved\u2014by generating scientific knowledge and innovations that aid in pharmaceutical development. For example, important basic advances in research, such as recombinant DNA, can lead to the development of whole new classes of drugs. NIH also supports the education and training of biomedical scientists, some of whom then work for the pharmaceutical industry. It is therefore difficult to quantify and assign credit for the role of NIH funding in the development of a given drug.", "Drugs with a patent held by NIH or NIH-funded researchers represent a small portion of all FDA-approved drugs. An invention may be patented if it is \"any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof\" that is novel, useful, and nonobvious, and the inventor is the first person to file a patent application. NIH-funded researchers may discover drug candidates that are then patented by or licensed to the pharmaceutical industry. According to a 2011 study by Sampat and Lichtenberg, 9% of the new drugs (i.e., new molecular entities) approved by the FDA from 1988 to 2005 were based on a patent held by either a government agency or a nongovernmental institution that had received government support. NIH makes up a large portion of all government funding for medical research in the United States; therefore many of the drugs in the Sampat and Lichtenberg study were likely developed with NIH funding (although the authors did not specify whether NIH funded the research). However, in 2012, Rai and Sampat noted that federal funding can go unreported on patent applications, despite requirements to report such information. Therefore more drugs may have been developed with federal funding than is accounted for through patent information. ", "A study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. published in 2011 explored the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The Stevens study found that of the 1,541 drugs approved by FDA from 1990 through 2007, 143, or 9.3%, resulted from work conducted in public sector research institutions, including all universities, research hospitals, nonprofit research institutes, and federal laboratories in the United States. Of the 1,541 total drug applications, FDA granted priority review to 348 applications, and 66 of these (19%) resulted from publicly funded research. The authors stated that \"viewed from another perspective, 46.2% of the new-drug applications from PSRIs [public-sector research institutions] received priority reviews, as compared with 20.0% of applications that were based purely on private-sector research, an increase by a factor of 2.3.\" An FDA designation of priority review is for \"the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications.\" According to the authors, their data \"suggest that PSRIs tend to discover drugs that are expected to have a disproportionately important clinical effect.\"", "Some studies have focused on the public sector's role in developing the most innovative drugs. A 2015 study focused solely on the public sector's role in \"transformative\" drug development from 1984 to 2009. The researchers defined a transformative drug as both innovative and having a groundbreaking effect on patient care. They identified transformative drugs by surveying physicians from the top 30 U.S. academic medical centers. The researchers then focused on 21 transformative drugs and 5 drug classes and followed their development history through FDA documentation and interviews with scientists and drug developers. They found that most of these transformative drugs originated in academic and/or publicly funded institutions that conceptualized therapeutic approaches through basic research, and were then further developed by industry partners for clinical testing. Another study analyzing case histories of the same set of transformative drugs, published in 2016, concluded that only 4 out of 26 transformative drugs identified were developed by one sector alone\u2014either public or private. Although the public sector conducted most of the basic science activities to develop the drugs, the private sector accounted for most of the drug development activities in bringing the drugs to market. The authors estimated that total NIH funding would need to increase by 2.5 times to maintain the current level of drug development without industry support. However, the authors did not appear to account for potential revenues to NIH if the agency produced the drugs. ", "Rather than directly leading to a new drug, NIH-funded researchers are more often indirectly involved in drug development by producing scientific research and innovations that contribute to the knowledge base and available methods for the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, the methodology used by the Stevens et al. 2011 study \"excluded the role of PSRIs in the development of platform technologies that have contributed to the development of whole new classes of drugs.\" These platform technologies enabled the development of many of the products approved by FDA during the period evaluated in the study. The platform technologies were excluded \"because the PSRI scientists who developed the platforms generally did not use them to develop specific drug candidates.\" For example, the following platform technologies were developed with public funds and were excluded from the study:", "recombinant DNA technology (Cohen-Boyer patents); bacterial production methods for recombinant DNA (Riggs-Itakura patents); production and chimerization methods for antibodies (Cabilly patents); methods to produce glycosylated recombinant proteins in mammalian cells (Axel patents); and methods of gene silencing with the use of small interfering RNAs (Mello-Fire patents).", "These platform technologies have enabled the development of entirely new classes of drugs, such as the production of synthetic insulin and growth hormones using recombinant DNA technology, and antibody drugs using Cabilly patents. Without these underlying scientific innovations, the result may have been a vastly different economic outlook for the pharmaceutical industry.", "A few studies have aimed to ascertain the total impact of NIH funding on drug development. A 2018 study by Cleary et al. on the broad impact of NIH funding on drug development found that public funding contributed to every new molecular entity (NME) approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study, which looked at peer-reviewed literature and public data on NIH grant funding, determined that funding from NIH was \"directly or indirectly associated with every one of 210 NMEs approved from 2010-2016.\" Almost a third (29%) of the publications identified were directly associated with NIH-funded projects. The analysis in this study captured basic research, in addition to applied research on NMEs. The study found that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, or about $100 billion, \"was associated with published research that directly or indirectly contributed to NMEs approved from 2010-2016.\" The authors concluded that their results suggest that \"the NIH contribution to research associated with new drug approvals is greater than previously appreciated.\" A 2019 study by Azoulay et al. used a new economic method to measure the impact of NIH research funding on private industry, particularly on patenting by private-sector firms. The study determined that NIH investments in a particular research area increase subsequent private sector patenting in that area\u2014a $10 million increase in NIH funding for a research area results in 2.7 additional patents. Alternatively phrased, one private sector patent results from every two to three NIH grants. Though the authors faced difficulty measuring the economic value of such patents, they stated that, \"one rough calculation suggests that $1 dollar in NIH funding generates around $2.34 in drug sales.\"", "NIH-funded research has contributed to the development of new pharmaceutical drugs, largely by supporting and conducting the science that underpins the industry. In light of high list prices for certain branded drugs, some question whether the American public is getting an adequate return on taxpayer investment in biomedical research. Others argue that pharmaceutical drug development is an increasingly expensive endeavor, and therefore requires significant research and development contributions from both the public and private sector.
