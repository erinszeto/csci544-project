A.

The ONDCP Director presented testimony on the 2008 National Drug Control Strategy and the 2009 National Drug Control Budget.

Oversight activities are expected to resume in the 111th Congress, and measures to reauthorize ONDCP will likely be introduced and considered.", "ONDCP was created in 1988 and has now been reauthorized three times since then, most recently on December 29, 2006, when the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6344) was signed into law (P.L. 109-469), reauthorizing ONDCP through FY2010.", "The reauthorization act contains extensive amendments to current law. For example, it requires ONDCP's annual drug control budget to include all federal drug control activities, including demand reduction, supply reduction, and federally funded state, local, and tribal drug law enforcement. ONDCP revised its method for compiling the federal drug control budget in 2002, narrowing its scope. The act forces a return to more inclusive budget numbers for the federal drug control budget. It statutorily creates the position of U.S. Interdiction Coordinator (USIC) and the Interdiction Committee (TIC) within ONDCP. It contains numerous new reporting requirements, including South American and Afghan heroin strategies, a report on iatrogenic addiction caused by doctor-prescribed opioid analgesic pharmaceuticals, a national drug interdiction plan, a report on intelligence sharing within HIDTAs, and a study on the results of an awards program created by the act to fund demonstration programs on coerced abstinence. It allows the media campaign to focus on marijuana prevention.

It strengthened the Director's powers to influence the allocation of funds and personnel within and between federal drug control departments and agencies. It prohibited presidentially appointed ONDCP officials from participating in federal election campaign activities, except for making contributions to individual candidates. It required the Director to include, in every National Drug Control Strategy, an evaluation of the effectiveness of federal drug control efforts during the preceding year, and it mandated specific measures of effectiveness that the evaluation would include. It required the Director to assess periodically the accuracy of drug use statistics and the factors that restrict the availability of treatment services, and to propose corrective remedies.", "ONDCP was reauthorized again in 1998 when Congress rewrote the agency's statutory mandate. This time, Congress took advantage of the opportunity, through staff studies and several hearings, to assess the progress of the antidrug effort and to develop specific, measurable goals for reducing drug consumption and drug-related crime in the United States. Annual reports to Congress containing specified measures of progress in implementing the National Drug Control Strategy were again required of ONDCP. This second ONDCP reauthorization act expired during the first session of the 108 th Congress on September 30, 2003. Despite the act's sunset provision, however, Congress continued to appropriate funds to keep the agency alive until H.R. 6344 , the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, was signed into law ( P.L. 109 - 469 ) on December 29, 2006, reauthorizing ONDCP through FY2010.

Walters, \"entirely omits discussion of ONDCP's compliance with the Reauthorization Act despite repeated clear requests that these issues be addressed.\" The prepared testimony of the other two hearing witnesses, however, did cover the concerns of the subcommittee.", "Former ONDCP official John Carnevale expressed his disagreement with the Bush Administration's emphasis on supply reduction:", "By the 1990's we had learned that interdiction was a relatively ineffective way of reducing drug use\u2014and expensive besides. So we focused our efforts on demand reduction. Now, at the beginning of the new millennium we have\u2014inexplicably\u2014come to believe again that source and transit zone interdiction is an effective way to reduce drug use in America. There is no evidence to support this belief.... In short, what we now know is that so long as there is a demand for illicit drugs, supply will follow.", "He pointed out \"significant shortcomings\" in ONDCP's meeting of its statutory obligations and said, \"As a result of these failures, ONDCP is no longer seen as a serious player in the drug issue.\" He outlined some ways to restructure the agency so that it might regain \"a meaningful role in shaping drug policy in the next Administration,\" such as moving some of its programs to other drug control agencies so that ONDCP could return to being a policy office. According to Dr. Carnevale:", "ONDCP must rediscover its roots. By this statement, I mean that ONDCP should again focus on becoming a leader in policy formulation on behalf of the President to allow the Administration to develop a drug policy that is evidence-based and includes performance measurement to hold it accountable for results.", "The final hearing witness, Economist Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, co-Director of the Drug Policy Research Center at the RAND Corporation, testified on what research says about the reasonableness of the Bush Administration's priorities of national drug control. In her view, the 2008 National Drug Control Strategy supports programs in several areas that \"have already been shown to be completely ineffective\" or that have \"never been scientifically proven to be effective and which on analytic grounds seem unlikely to be successful.\" These include efforts in Colombia and Afghanistan intended to decrease the supplies in the United States of cocaine and heroin, respectively; random student drug testing; and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.", "According to Dr. Pacula, research conducted at RAND and elsewhere shows that source-country crop eradication and interdiction efforts along with prevention and education programs work best in emerging drug markets at the early stages of a drug epidemic. Later in the cycle, after the size of the market for a particular drug has grown, the epidemic reaches its mature phase and the number of new users declines. At this point, research shows that treatment programs directed at heavy and dependent users become more cost effective in addressing the problem and reducing use. \"Given that drug markets for our three primary drugs of abuse (marijuana, cocaine and heroin) are all in mature stages,\" her written testimony stated, \"the continued emphasis on supply-side strategies is inappropriate.\" She concluded:", "The Strategy in its current form is neither balanced nor cost-effective, and as such, suggests a need for Congress to carefully scrutinize the structure of the budget request. By cutting the budget for programs lacking scientific support or strong analytic arguments and reallocating those funds to program areas that are known to be effective, the nation will have a much better chance of successfully reducing substance abuse and its many costs on society. This would produce a Strategy that more closely addresses the drug situation that exists here in the United States.", "The first oversight hearing since enactment of the reauthorization act in 2006 thus provided criticisms and insights regarding ONDCP's leadership of the federal War on Drugs that might influence the appropriations process for FY2009 and beyond, inform future congressional oversight, and even provide the next Administration with ideas for restructuring ONDCP and rethinking the goals and strategies of the federal government's approach to the problem of drug addiction in American society."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reauthorization of ONDCP (P.L. 109-469)", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 6344 , the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, was introduced by Representative Souder on December 5, 2006.
