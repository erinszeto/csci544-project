Latin for \"guilty mind,\" the term mens rea refers to the defendant's mental state of culpability that the government must prove in order to secure a conviction. For instance, some laws require that the prosecution demonstrates that the defendant intentionally committed the act in question\u2014that is, committed the act with the conscious desire for the harmful conduct to occur\u2014while others require that the act be done with a lesser mens rea (e.g., willfully, knowingly, or negligently).

The Supreme Court has described the \"willful\" standard in the criminal context as generally requiring that the accused was aware her conduct violated the law. But, further adding to the complexity of the Espionage Act, the second prong of the mens rea requirements under Sections 793(d-e) does not apply to the disclosure of national-security-related documents and other physical material\u2014only national security information . Consequently, an additional burden of proof may be imposed when an individual communicates information to an unauthorized source rather than disclosing the document or other tangible material containing the information.

Section 793(f) appear to be rare, but at least two servicemembers were convicted under this provision, as applied through the UMCJ, for removing classified materials from a government workplace and failing to report or return the material upon discovering it had been removed.

A \"knowing\" mens rea generally requires the defendant to have been aware that his conduct amounted to criminal behavior. Other prohibitions on the disclosure of protected information incorporate the knowing standard either in conjunction with other mens rea requirements or standing alone. ", "In some cases, the available punishment depends on the defendant's mental state. For example, under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, those who disclose documents or information with \"intent\" to advantage a foreign nation or harm the United States face possible life imprisonment and a $100,000 fine, but those who act with a \"reason to believe\" information could advantage a foreign nation face a maximum of 10 years in jail and a $50,000 fine.

The Constitution protects the public right to access government information and to express opinions regarding the functioning of the government, among other things, but it also charges the government with \"provid[ing] for the common defense.\" Policymakers are faced with the task of balancing these interests within the framework created by the Constitution. ", "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press[.]\" Where speech is restricted based on its content, the Supreme Court generally applies \"strict scrutiny,\" meaning that it will uphold a content-based restriction only if it is necessary \"to promote a compelling interest,\" and is \"the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.\" The Supreme Court has described protection of the nation's security from external threat as a classic example of a compelling government interest. It has long been accepted that the government has a compelling need to suppress certain types of speech, particularly during time of war or heightened risk of hostilities. Speech likely to incite immediate violence, for example, may be suppressed. Speech that would give military advantage to a foreign enemy is also susceptible to government regulation.", "Where First Amendment rights are implicated, it is the government's burden to show that its interest is sufficiently compelling to justify enforcement. Whether the government has a compelling need to punish disclosures of classified information turns on whether the disclosure has the potential to cause damage to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States. Actual damage need not be proved, but potential damage must be more than merely speculative and incidental. On the other hand, the Court has stated that \"state action to punish the publication of truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional standards.\" And it has described the constitutional purpose behind the guarantee of press freedom as the protection of \"the free discussion of governmental affairs.\" ", "Although information properly classified in accordance with statute or executive order, if disclosed to a person not authorized to receive it, carries by definition the potential of causing at least identifiable harm to the national security of the United States, it does not necessarily follow that government classification by itself will be dispositive of the issue in the context of a criminal trial. However, courts have adopted as an element of the espionage statutes a requirement that the information at issue be \"closely held.\" Government classification will likely serve as strong evidence to support that contention, even if the information seems relatively innocuous or does not contain much that is not already publicly known. Typically, courts have been unwilling to review decisions of the executive related to national security, or have relied on a strong presumption that the material at issue is potentially damaging. Still, judges have recognized that the government must make some showing that the release of specific national defense information has the potential to harm U.S. interests, lest the Espionage Act become a means to punish whistleblowers who reveal information that poses more of a danger of embarrassing public officials than of endangering national security.", "The Supreme Court seems satisfied that national security is a vital interest sufficient to justify some intrusion into activities that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment\u2014at least with respect to federal employees. Although courts have not held that government classification of material is sufficient to show that its release is damaging to national security, courts seem to accept without much discussion the government's assertion that the material in question is damaging. It is unlikely that a defendant's bare assertion that such information poses no danger to U.S. national security would be persuasive without some convincing evidence to that effect or proof that the information is not closely guarded by the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prosecution of Leaks and Disclosures to the Press", "paragraphs": ["Although the criminal statutes prohibiting the disclosure of protected information have historically been used to prosecute individuals who made protected information available to foreign governments or against the agents of foreign governments themselves, courts have held that the Espionage Act is not limited to such \"classic spying\" cases involving foreign governments.

The lobbyists, Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, were indicted in 2005 for conspiracy to disclose national security secrets to unauthorized individuals, including Israeli officials, other AIPAC personnel, and a reporter for the Washington Post . Their part in the conspiracy included receiving information from government employees with knowledge that the employees were not authorized to disclose it and disclosing that information to others. The prosecution was criticized for effectively \"criminalizing the exchange of information,\" based in part on the government's theory that the defendants were guilty of solicitation of classified information because they inquired into matters they knew their government informant was not permitted to discuss, something that many journalists consider to be an ordinary part of their job. ", "Charges were eventually dropped, reportedly due to a judge's ruling regarding the government's burden of proving the requisite intent and concerns that classified information would have to be disclosed at trial. With respect to the intent requirement under the Espionage Act, the judge interpreted the term \"willfully\" in connection with the phrase \"reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States\" in Section 793 to require that the prosecution must prove that the defendant disclosed the information \"with a bad faith purpose to either harm the United States or to aid a foreign government.\" Later courts confronting the intent issue have differentiated this case to conclude that the \"reason to believe\" standard does not require the intent to do harm."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Civil Litigation in the Pentagon Papers Case", "paragraphs": ["With regard to the issue of possible prosecutions of the press for publishing information leaked by a government employee, the most relevant case is likely to be the Pentagon Papers case. In addition to the criminal prosecution of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo for disclosure of the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon Administration filed civil suits against the New York Times and Washington Post , seeking to prevent them from publishing the leaked documents. The consolidated case quickly reached the Supreme Court, which, in a terse per curiam opinion accompanied by a separate concurring or dissenting opinion by every member of the Court, rejected the government's request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring publication. Although the fact that the case concerned an injunction against publication in civil suits rather than a prosecution for publication is a significant distinguishing factor, the Supreme Court recognized a high level of First Amendment protection afforded to the press in the Pentagon Papers case. Its decision to deny the injunction may inform decisions involving criminal prosecutions of the press or other media organizations. ", "The Supreme Court's Pentagon Papers decision does not, however, foreclose the possibility that a newspaper or other media outlet could be convicted of a criminal violation for publishing protected information. Several Justices suggested in separate dicta that the newspapers\u2014along with the former government employee who leaked the documents to the press\u2014could be criminally prosecuted under the Espionage Act even if an injunction was not available. Still, in a later case, the Court stressed that any prosecution of a publisher for what has already been printed would have to overcome only slightly less insurmountable hurdles.", "The publication of truthful information that is lawfully acquired enjoys considerable First Amendment protection. The Court has not resolved the question \"whether, in cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by a source, government may ever punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well.\" (The Pentagon Papers Court did not consider whether the newspapers' receipt of the classified document was in itself unlawful, although it appeared to accept that the documents had been unlawfully taken from the government by their source.)", "In other First Amendment cases, the Supreme Court has established that \"routine newsgathering\" is presumptively lawful acquisition, the fruits of which may be published without fear of government retribution. However, what constitutes \"routine newsgathering\" has not been further elucidated. In a 2001 case, Bartnicki v. Vopper , the Court cited the Pentagon Papers case to hold that media organizations cannot be punished (albeit in the context of civil damages) for divulging information on the basis that it had been obtained unlawfully by a third party. The holding suggests that recipients of unlawfully disclosed information cannot be considered to have obtained such material unlawfully based solely on their knowledge (or \"reason to know\") that the discloser acted unlawfully. Under such circumstances, disclosure of the information by the innocent recipient would be covered by the First Amendment, although a wrongful disclosure by a person in violation of an obligation of trust would receive no First Amendment protection, regardless of whether the information was obtained lawfully.

", "In the trial of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, the Obama Administration sought to compel New York Times reporter James Risen to testify regarding classified information the prosecution believed Sterling had provided to Risen. Following Risen's motion to quash the trial subpoena, the district court concluded that, under the First Amendment, there is a qualified reporter's privilege that may be invoked when a subpoena seeks information about confidential sources or is intended to harass the journalist. The district court limited the scope of Risen's testimony such that he was not compelled to reveal his confidential source. On appeal, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the ruling, holding there is neither a First Amendment privilege nor a federal common-law privilege protecting journalists from being compelled to testify. Despite prevailing on appeal, the government did not call Mr. Risen to testify at the jury trial.", "In the investigation of Donald Sachtleben over leaks of covert efforts to foil a bomb plot on a U.S.-bound airliner, the Department of Justice was reported to have been unable to identify the source of the leaks until it issued subpoenas to obtain the calling records for 20 telephone lines associated with AP bureaus and reporters. The targets of the subpoenas at the AP were not notified that their information was being collected, prompting criticism in the press of the government's evidence-gathering methods. ", "Similarly, the case of former State Department contractor Stephen Jin-Woo Kim's disclosures to Fox News correspondent James Rosen generated attention when it was revealed that the Department of Justice subpoenaed Rosen's emails without notice. In its application for the search warrant, the government characterized Rosen as having acted \"much like an intelligence officer would run an [sic] clandestine intelligence source,\" and it asserted in a sworn statement that \"there is probable cause to believe that the Reporter has committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 793 (Unauthorized Disclosure of National Defense Information), at the very least, either as an aider, abettor, or co-conspirator of Mr. Kim.\" Although Rosen was never charged with a crime in connection with his alleged receipt of classified information, the affidavit's language suggesting he may be charged for violating the Espionage Act was met with considerable criticism in the press. The backlash was reported to have contributed to the Department of Justice's decision to revise its policies for investigating leaks.

Section 783). It would have been the first law to penalize disclosure of information to entities other than foreign governments or their equivalent solely because it is classified, without a more specific definition of the type of information covered. In short, the provision would have made it a crime to disclose or attempt to disclose classified information to any person who does not have authorized access to such information, with exceptions covering disclosures to Article III courts, or to the Senate or House committees or Members, and authorized disclosures to persons acting on behalf of a foreign power (including an international organization). The provision would have amended the espionage laws in Title 18 by expanding the scope of information they cover. The proposed language was intended to make it easier for the government to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information, or \"leaks\" of information, that might not amount to a violation of current statutes. The language was also intended to ease the government's burden of proof in such cases by eliminating the need \"to prove that damage to the national security has or will result from the unauthorized disclosure,\" substituting a requirement to show that the unauthorized disclosure was of information that \"is or has been properly classified\" under a statute or executive order.", "The 106 th Congress passed the measure as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. President Clinton, however, vetoed it, calling it \"well-intentioned\" as an effort to deal with legitimate concerns about the damage caused by unauthorized disclosures, but \"badly flawed\" in that it was \"overbroad\" and posed a risk of \"unnecessarily chill[ing] legitimate activities that are at the heart of a democracy.\" President Clinton explained his view that", "[a] desire to avoid the risk that their good faith choice of words\u2014their exercise of judgment\u2014could become the subject of a criminal referral for prosecution might discourage Government officials from engaging even in appropriate public discussion, press briefings, or other legitimate official activities. Similarly, the legislation may unduly restrain the ability of former Government officials to teach, write, or engage in any activity aimed at building public understanding of complex issues. Incurring such risks is unnecessary and inappropriate in a society built on freedom of expression and the consent of the governed and is particularly inadvisable in a context in which the range of classified materials is so extensive. In such circumstances, this criminal provision would, in my view, create an undue chilling effect.", "The 107 th Congress considered passing an identical provision, but instead directed the Attorney General and heads of other departments to undertake a review of the current protections against the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to issue a report recommending legislative or administrative actions. An identical measure was introduced late in the 109 th Congress, but was not reported out of committee.", "The Attorney General, in his report to the 108 th Congress, concluded the following:", "Although there is no single statute that provides criminal penalties for all types of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, unauthorized disclosures of classified information fall within the scope of various current statutory criminal prohibitions. It must be acknowledged that there is no comprehensive statute that provides criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information irrespective of the type of information or recipient involved. Given the nature of unauthorized disclosures of classified information that have occurred, however, I conclude that current statutes provide a legal basis to prosecute those who engage in unauthorized disclosures, if they can be identified. It may be that carefully drafted legislation specifically tailored to unauthorized disclosures of classified information generally, rather than to espionage, could enhance our investigative efforts. The extent to which such a provision would yield any practical additional benefits to the government in terms of improving our ability to identify those who engage in unauthorized disclosures of classified information or deterring such activity is unclear, however."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The Espionage Act on its face applies to the receipt and unauthorized dissemination of national defense information, which has been interpreted broadly to cover closely held government materials related to U.S. military operations, facilities, and personnel. Although cases involving disclosures of classified information to the press have not been common, it seems clear that courts have regarded such disclosures by government employees to be conduct that enjoys no First Amendment protection, regardless of the motives of the divulger or the value the release of such information might impart to public discourse. The question remains open as to whether the publication of unlawfully obtained information by the media can be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Thus, although unlawful acquisition of information might be subject to criminal prosecution with few First Amendment implications, the publication of that information may be protected. Whether the publication of national security information can be punished may turn on the value of the information to the public weighed against the likelihood of identifiable harm to national security, arguably a more difficult case for prosecutors to make."], "subsections": []}]}}
