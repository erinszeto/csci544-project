Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The inevitable tension between Congress and the Executive created by our constitutionally mandated system of separated but shared powers has been the source of continual interbranch conflict. One manifestation of this struggle occurs when congressional committees engage in oversight of the administrative bureaucracy; another when Members of Congress attempt to intervene in administrative proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the Member's constituency. Both such interventions involve varying degrees of intrusion into agency decisionmaking processes. On relatively rare occasions these interventions have resulted in court actions challenging the congressional intercession as exertions of undue political influence on agency decisionmakers which violate the due process rights of participants in the proceedings in question and impugn the integrity of the agency decisional processes; or in disciplinary proceedings before ethics committees of either House alleging that such Member actions violated institutional rules or other ethical standards. Such challenges have arisen in the context of congressional intercessions into rulemakings, ratemakings, informal decisionmaking, adjudications, and agency investigations that arguably would lead to an adjudicatory proceeding.", "Past high profile incidents raising questions regarding the legal and ethical propriety of congressional exertions of influence on administrative decisionmaking have surprisingly produced only a paucity of authoritative commentary on and analysis of the guiding principles and standards applicable to the constitutional bases of the roles Members play when they act as part of the committee oversight process or in their individual representative capacities. This report is designed to provide a contemporary overview of applicable guidelines and considerations in the judicial and congressional forums. Toward that end, Part II reviews the judicial development and application of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence will be deemed to have tainted an agency proceeding. It concludes that the courts, in balancing Congress's performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies, have shown a decided predilection for protecting the congressional prerogatives. Thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved, the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors Congress did not intend to make relevant. Where agency adjudication is involved a stricter standard is applied and the finding of an appearance of impropriety can be sufficient to taint the proceeding. But even here the courts have required that the pressure or influence be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions before they will intervene.", "Part III of the report examines the conduct of Members of Congress and their staffs intervening in administrative matters from the perspective of ethics and conflict of interest rules, statutes and guidelines bearing upon a Member's and staffer's official duties in this area. It notes that since congressional intervention and expressions of interest in administrative matters from a Member's office are recognized as legitimate, official representational and oversight functions and duties of Members of Congress, the primary focus of these ethical and statutory conduct restraints is limited to(1) any improper enrichment or financial benefit accruing to the Member in return for or because of his or her official actions and influences, including the receipt of gifts or payments, or existing financial interests in, or relating to the matter under consideration; and (2) any overt coercion or threats of reprisals, or promises of favoritism or reward to administrators from the Member's office which could indicate an arguable abuse of a Member's official representational or oversight role. Additionally, there are ethical guidelines in Congress incorporating broad \"appearance' standards for Members which could raise ethical concerns in relation to the acceptance of gifts, favors, donations, and benefits, including campaign contributions, by Members from those who are directly affected by the Member's official duties, even in the absence of a showing of any corrupt bargain, express payment, or any direct connection to an official act. While campaign contributions from private individuals to Members have a facial legitimacy and necessity in our government and electoral system which other forms of monetary transfers to legislators (such as gifts) do not, and may be treated differently, both Houses of Congress advise members and staff to avoid any appearance of a \"linkage\" between campaign contributions and interventions. Such guidance would counsel a Member to adopt office procedures and systems for evaluating requests for assistance which would prevent any appearance that interventions decisions are based upon the receipt of things of value, particularly legitimate campaign contributions, and which would assure that decisions to intervene are, rather, based on the merits of a particular matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "II. Current Judicial Standards Governing Congressional Influence on Agency Decisionmaking", "paragraphs": ["Support for claims that an exercise of congressional influence in an agency proceeding may serve as basis for a challenge to the end product of that decisional process rest on two foundation cases, a 1966 decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Pillsbury Co. v. FTC and a 1971 ruling of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe , and a relative handful of judicial rulings since then which have grappled with the question of whether particular instances of exertion of congressional pressure would serve to taint such a proceeding. While this case law makes it clear that there are limits to congressional intercession, whether those limits have been breached in a particular instance is often far less clear. Analysis has been made difficult by the relative dearth of decisions and the reluctance of courts in those cases to venture beyond the factual confines of the dispute. The absence of a congressional spokesperson in most of the cases to present the legislative interest may also be a complicating factor.", "Close analysis of the apparently disparate and sometimes seemingly conflicting judicial decisions, however, reveals a consistent underlying pattern that allows for rationalization of the holdings and for the formulation of guidelines for application in future situations. The determinative factors for the courts appear to be the nature of the proceeding involved, the impact the political pressure had on the decisionmaker, and whether the object of the political intercession is to reflect the views of members on issues of law and policy. This part of the report will examine the extant case law to explicate the manner in which the courts are formulating the differing standards that are applied to the various types of administrative proceedings and the underlying rationale for their actions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A. The Nature of the Proceeding", "paragraphs": ["The law of undue influence is a still-evolving, difficult to define area of jurisprudence that does not as yet yield ready answers when applied to particular complex and often politically charged fact situations. The relatively small body of case law that has developed, however, reflects the growing sensitivity of the courts to appearing to be engaging in unwarranted intrusions into the political process.", "Problems in this area are not subject to easy categorization or generalizations; case by case evaluations have been the norm. However, the case law does provide broad guidelines within which analysis may proceed: Where agency actions resembles judicial action, where it involves formal or informal adjudication, or formal rulemaking, insulation of the decisionmaker from political influence through public pressure or unrevealed ex parte contacts has been deemed justified by basic notions of due process to the parties involved. But where agency action involves informal rulemaking of generally applicable policy, thus closely resembling the legislative process, there is deemed to be far less justification for judicial intervention to protect the integrity of the process", "In practice, however, these categorizations serve only as useful starting points for analysis. The courts have eschewed mechanical application of these categories. That is, an agency proceeding that has adjudicatory elements will not be pigeonholed automatically as a case requiring the highest level of judicial scrutiny. Similarly, an informal rulemaking may not be reflexively dealt with as a matter of pure policymaking and accorded extreme deference. Rather, the courts appear to be making their determinations in this area by ascertaining where on the adjudication/policymaking continuum the proceeding falls and then applying the factors most appropriate to that particular situation. The task of analysis in such cases is thus threefold: (1) determination of the type of proceeding involved; (2) identification and application of the factors relevant to that type of proceeding; and, if taint is involved, (3) determining the remedies that may be available. The following discussion will treat each of these issues in turn. It seems useful, however, to start with an overview and description of the distinguishing elements of the various proceedings in the continuum as it moves from adjudication toward varieties of informal, non-record decisionmaking.", "Administrative action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is either adjudication or rulemaking. The two processes differ fundamentally in purpose and focus and as a consequence have imposed on them sharply divergent statutory and constitutional procedural requirements. Thus the APA defines \"adjudication\" as the \"agency process for the formulation of an order.\" The term \"order\" is then defined as \"the whole or part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than a rulemaking but including licensing.\" A \"rulemaking\" is the \"agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.\" Finally, a \"rule\" is defined to mean:", ". . . the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing.", "The definitive explanation of the interrelationship of these definitions and the dichotomous scheme of the APA was provided the Attorney General in 1947.", "The object of the rule making proceeding is the implementation or prescription of law or policy for the future, rather than the evaluation of a respondent's past conduct. Typically, the issues relate not to the evidentiary facts, as to which the veracity and demeanor of witnesses would often be important, but rather to the policy-making conclusions to be drawn from the facts . . . Conversely, adjudication is concerned with the determination of past and present rights and liabilities. Normally, there is involved a decision as to whether past conduct was unlawful, so that the proceeding is characterized by an accusatory flavor and may result in disciplinary action.", "In sum, then, rulemaking involves the formulation of a policy or interpretation which the agency will apply in the future to all persons engaged in the regulated activity. Adjudication is the administrative equivalent of a judicial trial. It applies policy to a set of past actions and results in an order against (or in favor of) the named party. The focus of rulemaking is prospective. The primary focus of adjudication is retrospective.", "Administrative rulemaking and adjudication may be conducted pursuant to either informal or formal procedures. Informal rulemaking requires the administrative agency, following publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register, to provide \"interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views or arguments.\" Courts reviewing such proceedings are required to uphold informal rulemaking decisions unless those decisions are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.", "Formal rulemaking is invoked when \"rules are required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for agency hearing.\" Under the APA, formal rulemaking must include a trial-type hearing at which a \"party is entitled to present his case or defense or oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" Judicial review of formal rulemaking requires a court to set aside a rule that is \"unsupported by substantial evidence\" on the record.", "Formal adjudication is governed by section 554 of the APA and arises in \"every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\" Section 554 incorporates the procedural requirements of section 556 and 557 and affords parties to a formal adjudication the right to present evidence and to conduct cross examination. Judicial review of formal adjudication, like that of formal rulemaking, is governed by the substantial evidence standard.", "Informal adjudication occurs when an agency determines the rights or liabilities of a party in a proceeding to which section 554 does not apply. The APA makes no provision for informal adjudications\u2014adjudications unaccompanied by the protections of an on the record, formal, judicial-like trial. But since these informal adjudications involve individual rights rather than issues of general policy, the courts have recognized they implicate constitutional due process values. Thus, although due process does not generally require a full scale judicial trial, informal adjudications must nevertheless conform \"with the notion of a fair hearing and with the principles of fairness implicit in due process.\" In such proceedings, the agency's final decision is reviewed under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard which requires a court to conduct a \"searching and careful\" inquiry based upon \"the full administrative record that was before the [agency decisionmaker] at the time he made his decision.\"", "It is important to note that informal decisionmaking, that is, governmental actions that are taken without an evidentiary hearing and formal record, constitute by far the vast bulk of government decisionmaking. As one commentator has noted:", "... However defined, informal action is the mode in which government operates. A common and loose figure is that ninety percent of the government's business is accomplished by informal action. The figure is much too low. In terms of quantity, surely much less than one percent of the actions of the federal government are based upon evidentiary hearings. And, if one were possessed of a divine calibrator that could measure \"importance,\" it is doubtful that weighing the transactions by their importance would reduce the predominance of informal action in the operations of government.", "As a consequence, this category of decisionmaking has been accorded special attention by the courts.", "A final important category of agency action that has been the subject of undue influence litigation is investigation. Most administrative action, including much of that which occurs in an informal as well as in a formal proceeding, is conditioned by information obtained through an agency's prior investigation. Administrative agencies do not have unrestricted power to demand information merely for satisfying their curiosity. The agency's command can be enforced only if it is authorized by law and issued in a lawful manner. Additionally, constitutional limitations hedge administrative power to investigate. Within these constraints, the courts have acknowledged the importance of judicial deference to administrative agencies in conducting investigations. Agency decisions to conduct investigations are deemed \"committed entirely to agency discretion\" and are unreviewable except where they are made in \"bad faith\" and the enforcement of the administrative process would be an abuse of the judicial process.", "The cases indicate, at least in their rhetoric, that identification and categorization of the subject proceedings are significant. We turn now to a review of the pertinent case law which serves to illustrate the types of factors the courts have identified as relevant in different kinds of proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "B. The Foundation Cases", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1. Pillsbury Co. v. FTC", "paragraphs": ["The seminal case with respect to the nature and extent of permissible congressional intercession into agency adjudicatory or quasi-adjudicatory proceedings is the 1966 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Pillsbury Company v. Federal Trade Commission, which held a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) divestiture order invalid because the Commission's decisional process had been tainted by impermissible congressional influence. At issue was an intense interrogation at a Senate subcommittee hearing of the FTC Chairman and several members of his staff on a key issue in an antitrust adjudication involving the Pillsbury Company which was then pending before the Commission. The Senators expressed opinions on the issue and criticized the FTC for its interpretation of section 7 of the Clayton Act in a previous interlocutory order in Pillsbury's favor. The clear message of the Senate committee criticism was that the FTC should have ruled against Pillsbury. In its subsequent final decision the Commission ruled as the Committee had suggested. The appeals court found the Senate inquiry to be an \"improper intrusion into the adjudicatory process of the Commission.\" The court based its holding on the fact that the agency was acting in a judicial capacity. As a consequence, the private litigants had a \"right to a fair trial\" and the \"appearance of impartiality\" as part of the general guarantees of procedural due process when the agency is acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. The court emphasized the judicial nature of the function the agency was performing and explained that in order to protect the integrity of that type of process, it was proscribing the subcommittee's action because it cast doubt upon the \"appearance of impartiality\" of the decisionmakers, and not because of any finding that the Commission had actually been influenced.", "... However, when [a congressional] investigation focuses directly and substantially upon the mental decisional processes of a Commission in a case which is pending before it, Congress is no longer intervening in the agency's legislative function, but rather, in its judicial function. At this latter point, we become concerned with the right of private litigants to a fair trial and, equally important, with their right to the appearance of impartiality, which cannot be maintained unless those who exercise the judicial function are free from powerful external influences ...", "To subject an administrator to a searching examination as to how and why he reached his decision in a case still pending before him, and to criticize him for reaching the \"wrong\" decision, as the Senate subcommittee did in this case, sacrifices the appearance of impartiality\u2014the sine qua non of American judicial justice\u2014in favor of some short-run notions regarding the Congressional intent underlying an amendment to a statute, unfettered administration of which was committed by Congress to the Federal Trade Commission.", "It may be argued that such officials as members of the Federal Trade Commission are sufficiently aware of the realities of governmental, not to say \"political,\" life as to be able to withstand such questioning as we have outlined here. However, this court is not so \"sophisticated\" that it can shrug off such a procedural due process claim merely because the officials involved should be able to discount what is said and to disregard the force of the intrusion into the adjudicatory process. We conclude that we can preserve the rights of the litigants in a case such as this without having any adverse effect upon the legitimate exercise of the investigative power of Congress. What we do is to preserve the integrity of the judicial aspect of the administrative process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2. D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe", "paragraphs": ["D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe, decided by the D.C. Circuit five years later, provides an apt counterpoint to Pillsbury . D.C. Federation also involved a claim of undue congressional influence but not within the context of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding. The principles enunciated by the court as necessary to establish a claim of taint in such a situation mark out the boundaries of permissible congressional action which have influenced courts since then. D.C. Federation involved the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of construction of the Three Sisters Bridge across the Potomac River. Two issues were presented: first, whether the Secretary failed to comply within statutory requirements prior to approval of construction; and second, whether the Secretary's determinations were tainted by extraneous pressures. With regard to the first issue, a majority of the court found that in a number of critical respects the Secretary had failed to comply with applicable statutory standards which therefore required a remand for further agency determinations.", "Although this finding would have been sufficient to dispose of the case, Judge Bazelon chose to deal with the \"taint\" issue. That involved the allegation that threats by the Chairman of the House appropriation subcommittee, which had jurisdiction over the funding of District of Columbia's transportation construction projects to deny funds for the District's proposed subway system unless the bridge project was approved and whether those threats had a legal impact on the Secretary's subsequent approval decision. Judge Bazelon stated that he was \"convinced that the impact of this is sufficient, standing alone, to invalidate the Secretary's action. Even if the Secretary had taken every formal step required by every applicable statutory provision, reversal would be required, in my opinion, because extraneous pressure intruded into the calculus of considerations on which the Secretary's decision was based.\"", "Judge Bazelon pointed out that he was alone in this opinion: \"Judge Fahy, on the other hand, has concluded that since critical determinations cannot stand irrespective of the allegations of pressure, he finds it unnecessary to decide the case on this independent ground.\" But it is to be noted that the disagreement between Judges Bazelon and Fahy was not as to the applicable principle of law but rather as to whether the district court below had found there had been any consideration by the Secretary of extraneous influence:", "While Judge Fahy is not entirely convinced that the District Court ultimately found as a fact that the extraneous pressure had influenced the Secretary\u2014a point which is for me clear\u2014he has authorized me to note his concurrence in my discussion of the controlling principle of law: namely, that the decision would be invalid if based in whole or in part on the pressures emanating from Representative Natcher. Judge Fahy agrees, and we therefore hold, that on remand the Secretary must make new determinations based strictly on the merits and completely without regard to any considerations not made relevant in the applicable statute.", "Judge Bazelon's opinion makes it clear that the court's standard\u2014that extraneous congressional influences actually shown to have had an impact on an agency decision will taint such administrative action \u2013is crafted for the special administrative circumstances of the situation before it: where the decisional process was neither judicial or legislative in nature.", "The District Court was surely correct in concluding that the Secretary's action was not judicial or quasi-judicial, and for that reason we agree that much of the doctrine cited by plaintiffs is inapposite. If he had been acting in such a capacity, plaintiffs could have forcefully argued that the decision was invalid because of the decisionmaker's bias or because he had received ex parte communications. Well-established principles could have been invoked to support these arguments, and plaintiffs might have prevailed even without showing that the pressure had actually influenced the Secretary's decision. With regard to judicial decisionmaking, whether by court or agency, the appearance of bias or pressure may be no less objectionable than the reality. But since the Secretary's action was not judicial, that rationale has no application here.", "If, on the other hand, the Secretary's action had been purely legislative, we might have agreed with the District Court that his decision could stand in spite of a finding that he had considered extraneous pressures. Beginning with Fletcher v. Peck , the Supreme Court has maintained that a statute cannot be invalidated merely because the legislature's action was motivated by impermissible considerations (except, perhaps, in special circumstances not applicable here). Indeed, that very principle requires us to reject plaintiffs' argument that the approval of the bridge by the District of Columbia City Council was in some sense invalid. We do not sit in judgment of the motives of the District's legislative body, nor do we have authority to review its decisions. The City Council's action constituted, in our view, the approval of the project required by the statute.", "Thus, the underlying problem cannot be illuminated by a simplistic effort to force the Secretary's action into a purely judicial or purely legislative mold. His decision was not \"judicial\" in that he was not required to base it solely on a formal record established at a public hearing. At the same time, it was not purely \"legislative\" since Congress had already established the boundaries within which his discretion could operate. But even though his action fell between these two conceptual extremes, it is still governed by principles that we had thought elementary and beyond dispute. If, in the course of reaching his decision, Secretary Volpe took into account \"considerations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant,\" his action proceeded from an erroneous premise and his decision cannot stand. The error would be more flagrant, of course, if the Secretary had based his decision solely on the pressures generated by Representative Natcher. But it should be clear that his action would not be immunized merely because he also considered some relevant factors.", "Thus, the court appeared to view undue influence cases as classifiable on a continuum, with the applicable standard dependant on where on the continuum the nature of the case places it. If a proceeding is one in which judicial or quasi-judicial functions are being exercised, then the highest standard of conduct is required, and only a showing of interference with merely the \"appearance of impartiality,\" without proof of actual partiality or other effect of the extraneous influences, is necessary. If the decisionmaking is \"purely legislative\" (policymaking) in nature, such as takes place in informal rulemaking, then the courts will be most deferential, even in the face of heavy extraneous pressures, to the political nature of the process. Finally, where a decisional process involves application of ascertainable legislative standards by an agency official in a situation that cannot be categorized as either judicial or legislative, i.e. , informal decisionmaking, then a claim of impermissible interference will be sustained only on a showing of actual effect. The courts appear to have been guided by this suggested mode of analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3. The Critique of Pillsbury and D.C. Federation", "paragraphs": ["The rulings in Pillsbury and D.C. Federation have received surprisingly limited attention over the years, but what commentary there is has been generally critical, emphasizing both courts' failure to give proper weight to the values of the political process in such cases. An influential 1990 article by Professor Richard J. Pierce, Jr., a leading administrative law scholar, reflects practical concerns raised by the decisions. Pierce agrees that the Pillsbury court reached a defensible result in light of the circumstances presented: the contested issues of fact were at least arguably adjudicatory in nature rather than legislative and the intense interrogation could be viewed as pressure to resolve the facts against Pillsbury, thereby creating the appearance of impropriety. Thus, even though it is impossible to determine whether the FTC's resolution of those facts was in fact influenced by the hostile questions, Pierce argues that one could infer that the FTC purposely resolved adjudicative facts against Pillsbury in response to the committee's attacks. Pierce's concern, however, is that the 5 th Circuit did not decide the case on this narrow ground, but announced the far broader principle that \"[w]hen [a congressional] investigation focuses directly and substantially upon the mental decisional processes of a Commission in a case before it, Congress is . . . intervening [impermissibly] in the agency's adjudicatory function.\" Application of such a broadly stated prohibition in future cases, Pierce asserts, could result in findings attributable to congressional pressure without regard to the actual context of the congressional proceeding and", "would constitute an unjustified judicial interference with the political process of policymaking. Whether to apply the rule of reason or a per se rule to acquisitions under the Clayton Act is purely a policy decision . . . Legislators should be free to express their views on this policy issue, and FTC commissioners should be free to change their minds and adopt those views. This is the political process functioning properly. It is of no consequence to the judiciary whether the FTC changes its policy because it is persuaded by the merits of the legislators' arguments, or because it fears that the legislature will retaliate . . . Similarly, the courts should not distinguish between policy decisions made through rulemaking and policy decisions developed in adjudicatory proceedings. To paraphrase Justice Holmes, judicial process values should trump political process values only when an agency has singled out an individual for adverse treatment.", "While finding Pillsbury ' s holding defensible, Professor Pierce deems D.C. Federation indefensible, \"stand[ing] for the principle that two politically accountable branches cannot compromise their frequently differing policy preferences.\" In Pierce's view, the case was about a political dispute over the allocation of transportation funds between the administering agency and the key congressional appropriating subcommittee. The secretary preferred seeing a subway built; the subcommittee (and Congress) wanted a bridge built. After a heated public dispute, a political compromise was effected whereby both projects would go forward. But the appeals court intervened finding that the secretary's decisions, which were part of the political deal, were infected with impermissible bias as a result of legislative branch pressure. In the words of the court, \"the impact of this pressure is sufficient, standing alone, to invalidate the Secretary's action.\" In Professor Pierce's view:", "D.C. Federation is hard to explain in a democracy in which two politically accountable branches of government share the power to make policy. The agency was not adjudicating a dispute involving individual rights; nor was it resolving contested issues of adjudicative fact. Perhaps the case stands for the principle that the two politically accountable branches cannot compromise their frequently differing policy preferences. But if so, it is a singularly arrogant decision. The Constitution created a system of shared and coordinated policymaking by the two politically accountable branches. The Framers included many features to force compromise between the two branches: The President's role in the legislative process, the Senate's role in approving policymaking officials for the executive branch, the Senate's role in ratifying treaties and the exclusive power of the House to initiate tax and appropriations bills. Our nation would be ungovernable in the absence of constant policy compromises between the executive and legislative branches.", "As will be seen in the following review of the undue influence case law since the decisions in Pillsbury and D.C.

There, a congressional subcommittee held oversight hearings on the administration of the Act while the proceedings in question were pending. The district court, however, found that the hearings went substantially beyond the oversight function.", "The hearings took place during the time that the validity of certain claims being advanced by the plaintiffs was being litigated before the Secretary and following upon earlier correspondence which the Congressman had addressed to various subordinates of the Secretary. The stated purpose of the hearings was to present a forum for discussing the implementation of the Act but in fact the Committee, through its chairman and staff members, probed deeply into details of contested cases then under consideration, indicating that there was \"more than meets the eye.\" The entire rule-making process was re-examined, travel vouchers and other information were sought to probe the adequacy of the investigations made, all papers in the pending proceedings were demanded, the accuracy of data and procedures was questioned, and constantly the Committee interjected itself into aspects of the decisionmaking process.", "When the departmental officials expressed concern about the integrity of the quasi-judicial administrative process, the Chairman several times stated that it was not his purpose to pressure the Department, but he many times stated his doubts that the law was being properly carried out. The court noted: \"On key issues now in dispute before the Court, representatives of the Government were obligated to take positions as to the interpretation of the Act. A strenuous effort was made by the Chairman to encourage protest and appeals, coupled with comments indicating his clear impression that all that could be done was being done and that some of the results being reached were contrary to congressional intent.\"", "Two days before the Secretary made his determination on the eligibility of the villages, the Chairman sent a letter to him requesting that he postpone his decision on the matter pending a review and opinion by the Comptroller General because it \"appears from the testimony [at the hearings] that village eligibility and Native enrollment requirements of ANSCA have been misinterpreted in the regulations and that certain villages should not have been certified as eligible for land selections under ANSCA.\" On these facts the district court vacated the Secretary's eligibility decisions and reinstated the decisions initially rendered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).", "On appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of appeals disagreed in part with the lower court's application of the relevant law but not with its validity. Thus, with regard to the Chairman's conduct of the hearings, the appeals court found fault with the district court's ruling because none of the agency officials subjected to the Chairman's interrogations was an agency decisionmaker.", "The hearings in question were called by Congressman Dingell in June of 1974 at the time the Board and the Secretary were considering most of these cases.... During the hearings Congressman Dingell made no secret of his displeasure with some of the initial BIA eligibility determinations. Nevertheless, we think the Pillsbury decision is not controlling here because none of the persons called before the subcommittee was a decisionmaker in these cases. One possible exception was Mr. Ken Brown, a close advisor to the Secretary who briefed him on the cases at the time he decided to approve the Board's recommended decisions. However, even if we assume that the Pillsbury doctrine would reach advisors to the decisionmaker, Mr. Brown was not asked to prejudge any of the claims by characterizing their validity. See Pillsbury Co. v. FTC, supra at 964. The worst cast that can be put upon the hearing is that Brown was present when the subcommittee expressed its belief that certain villages had made fraudulent claims and that the BIA decisions were in error. This is not enough.", "With regard to the Chairman's letter, however, the court of appeals found \"it compromised the appearance of the Secretary's impartiality,\" and thereby tainted the decision, citing Pillsbury approvingly.

In Gulf Oil Corporation v. FPC, for example, petitioners sought to overturn a Federal Power Commission (FPC) order requiring delivery of larger quantities of natural gas. In upholding the order, the appeals court rejected a claim that members and staff of the FPC had been subjected to improper interrogation and interference in the decision of the matter by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee at hearings and in correspondence. The court recognized the relevance of Pillsbury to such an adjudicatory proceeding but acknowledged that it had to be sensitive to the legislative importance of congressional committees in oversight and investigation and recognized that \"their interest in the objective and efficient operation of regulatory agencies serves a legitimate and wholesome function with which we should not lightly interfere.\" Balancing the interests of integrity of an adjudicatory proceeding and congressional oversight, the court found determinative distinctions between Pillsbury and the case before it. First, the court found that the subcommittee was not concerned with the merits of the agency's decision, as was the situation in Pillsbury, but \"was directed at accelerating the disposition and enforcement of the FPC's compliance procedures.\" Nor did the court find any effort to influence the Commission in reaching any decision on the specific facts of the case or any factual prejudice. Any intrusions into the merits of the FPC's decision were found to be \"incidental to the purpose of accelerating\" the agency's disposition of the case. Those \"incidental intrusions\" were found not to have had serious influence on the agency because (1) the interrogation did not reflect the majority view of the subcommittee; (2) the agency did not accede to Members' requests and continued with the show cause proceeding; and (3) the ultimate resolution of the issue was the same as it had been in proceedings concluded a year prior to the hearings in question. Concluding that the claim of prejudice could not be sustained under the facts and circumstances of the case, the court recapitulated the factors it had taken into consideration:", "Weighing these factors\u2013the importance and need for Congressional oversight of regulatory agencies, the Commission's evident strong backbone in resisting subcommittee pressure, the Commission's identical resolution of each issue in its prior decision, the entirely legal nature of the Commission's decision, and our agreement with that decision\u2013against our commitment to the principle that administrative agencies must be allowed to exercise their adjudicative functions free of Congressional pressure, we conclude that the legislative conduct in this case did not affect the fairness of the Commissions proceedings and does not warrant our setting aside the Commission's order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3.

FERC , an applicant for a license to build a hydroelectric facility challenged the award of a conditioned license on the grounds, among others, that letters from the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee unduly influenced, and thereby tainted, the entire sequence of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders which resulted in the conditioned license, relying on the Pillsbury case. In three letters to FERC, the Chairman complained that the agency had not followed the recently enacted dispute resolution procedures under the Federal Power Act. In response to those complaints, FERC reopened dispute resolution negotiations with State and federal fish and wildlife agencies prior to the conclusion of the licensing process. The Chairman also sent two letters to the agency urging it to review its two decades old interpretation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) that a hydroelectric project sponsor was not required to obtain a right-of-way permit over public lands from the Bureau of Lands Management of the Department of Interior because FERC had exclusive jurisdiction over federal hydroelectric development.

Congressional opposition to ATX arose even prior to the filing of its application, based largely on the perceived reputation of Frank Lorenzo, its founder and majority owner, from his previous record of management of a major airline. Twenty one Members of Congress wrote the Secretary of DOT urging him to deny ATX's application even before it had been filed, because of Lorenzo's alleged unfitness to own and operate an airline. Most of the signatures on the letter were members of the House committee with jurisdiction over DOT, including the chair of the full committee, the chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, and the chair of the Oversight Subcommittee. After ATX filed its application, 125 House and Senate members wrote the Secretary to declare their opposition to Lorenzo. Two congressmen introduced legislation to prohibit Lorenzo from re-entering the airline industry. The Secretary responded by acknowledging receipt of the letters, refusing to comment on the merits, and putting the correspondence in a file for \"contacts outside the record of the case.\" During the hearing on the application one of the congressional letter writers was allowed to testify as to his opposition. Ultimately the Department rejected the application on the ground that ATX \"lacked both managerial competence to operate an airline and a disposition to comply with regulatory requirements.\"", "In rejecting the undue influence challenge, the court acknowledged that the size, vocality, and source of the congressional opposition toward the applicant in this quasi-judicial proceeding required close judicial scrutiny to allay due process concerns with the alleged appearance of bias. The court explained", "...

Under this framework, it is apparent that none of the congressional pressure challenged by ATX is sufficient to invalidate the adjudication.", "The court commented that the influence with which it was concerned is \"when congressional influence shapes the determination of the merits.\" The court commented that the lengthy opinion supporting the decision based on the administrative record \"was clear and open to scrutiny and [the] decision was fully supported by the record. There is no reason for us to infer that the letters influenced his decision inasmuch as he did not reverse the ALJ's recommendation nor was the merits decision a close one on the record.\" The testimony of the congressman at the hearing did not create \"a fatal appearance of bias as it was based almost entirely on information already available to the ALJ, was void of threats and was not relied on in any of the decisions, which were accompanied by extensive findings and reasons.\" The court concluded:", "In addition we find no evidence that the legislative activity actually affected the outcome on the merits.

Congress as well as the courts has responsibility to protect the decisional integrity of such an agency.", "However, despite this rhetorical obeisance to the spirit of Pillsbury , the court did not disqualify the agency, because the producers, though fully aware of all these facts, failed to ask the Commission to disqualify itself. The court said that a party cannot, with knowledge of the alleged taint, stay silent in hopes of a favorable decision, and then, when the decision is unfavorable, seek its reversal on the ground of partiality: \"A party, knowing of a ground for requesting disqualification, cannot be permitted to wait and decide whether he likes subsequent treatment that he receives.\" But the court did not end its analysis there.

The adjudication was to be held to determine whether an aggregation of 51 irrevocable agricultural trusts was entitled to large subsidies in the face of a statute that limited farm subsidies to $50,000 per \"person.\" The effect of the trust scheme would have been to allow DCP Farms $1.4 million in subsidies for the 1989 crop year. Prior to the award decision, the Department's Inspector General (IG) issued a report on abuses of the farm subsidy program which highlighted DCP Farms as an example of \"egregious violations of the $50,000 per person limit.\" The report received considerable publicity and reached the attention of the jurisdictional subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee. Staff of the subcommittee chairman met with Department officials to discuss the issues raised by the IG report in late 1989. DCP Farms was specifically discussed. In December 1989 the Chairman wrote to the Secretary of Agriculture about the reports of abuses in the subsidy program and cited DCP Farms as an example of the continued abuse of the statutory limit. He urged careful review of schemes involving irrevocable trusts, particularly in light of the fact that he had had assurances in the past from USDA officials that no legislative action was needed with respect to the treatment of such trusts. The chairman received assurance from the Secretary that the DCP Farms case was under administrative review and that the Department would \"take a very aggressive position in dealing with this case.\" In June 1990 an administrative decision was issued finding that DCP Farms had adopted schemes to evade the payment limitation provisions of the law and was ineligible to receive any subsidy payments for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 crop years.

HEW, after consulting with the plaintiff and several other interested groups, first announced it would form one statewide PSRO. But after a lengthy meeting with Senator Wallace Bennett, sponsor of the PSRO legislation, and a senior staff member of the Senate Finance Committee, an HEW official abruptly changed his mind and called for the division of Texas into nine PSRO's.", "The court noted that while it had no evidence as to what Senator Bennett or the staffer may have said during the meeting, HEW was unable to adequately explain its sudden reversal of decision with regard to the number of PSRO's so soon after the meeting.

Furthermore, the importance to effective regulation of continuing contact with a regulated industry, other affected groups, and the agency to win needed support for its program, reduce future enforcement requirements by helping those regulated to anticipate and shape their plans for the future, and spur the provision of information which the agency needs.", "However, the court inferred from the statutory scheme that oral comments \"of central relevance to the rulemaking\" should be placed in the record. Although the court conceded that this allows the agency to decide in its own discretion which comments are relevant, the court did not find this to be a persuasive enough consideration to require a more stringent rule.", "EDF is understandably wary of a rule which permits the agency to decide for itself when oral communications are of such central relevance that a docket entry for them is required. Yet the statute itself vests EPA with discretion to decide whether \"documents\" are of central relevance and therefore must be placed in the docket; surely EPA can be given no less discretion in docketing oral communications concerning which the statute has no explicit requirements whatsoever. Furthermore, this court has already recognized that the relative significance of various communications to the outcome of the rule is a factor in determining whether their disclosure is required. A judicially imposed blanket requirement that all post-comment period oral communications be docketed would, on the other hand, contravene our limited powers of review, would stifle desirable experimentation in the area by Congress and the agencies, and is unnecessary for achieving the goal of an established, procedure-defined docket, viz ., to enable reviewing courts to fully evaluate the stated justification given by the agency for its final rule.", "The appeals court concluded that none of the non-docketed post-comment meetings, including those with the Senate majority leader and the President, required docketing. It underlined its view that informal rulemaking involving general policymaking is akin to the legislative process and therefore the courts should be wary of attempting to probe too deeply. It stated that before an administrative rulemaking could be overturned simply on the grounds of political pressure, it had to be shown that \"the content of the pressure on the [decisionmaker] is designed to force him to decide upon factors not made relevant by Congress in the applicable statute\" and also that the determination made \"must be affected by those extraneous considerations.\" Although the meetings were called at the behest of the majority leader \"in order to express 'strongly' his views\" on the subject of the rulemaking, it found that the agency made no commitments to him nor was there evidence that he used \"extraneous\" pressures to further his position. The court characterized the Senator's efforts, since they were exerted in a rulemaking proceeding, as within the accepted boundaries of the political process.", "... Americans rightly expect their elected representatives to voice their grievances and preferences concerning the administration of our laws. We believe it entirely proper for Congressional representatives vigorously to represent the interests of their constituents before administrative agencies engaged in informal, general policy rulemaking, so long as individual Congressmen do not frustrate the intent of Congress as a whole as expressed in statute, nor undermine applicable rules of procedure. Where Congressmen keep their comments focused on the substance of the proposed rule\u2014and we have no substantial evidence to cause us to believe Senator Byrd did not do so here\u2014administrative agencies are expected to balance Congressional pressure with the pressures emanating from all other sources. To hold otherwise would deprive the agencies of legitimate sources of information and call into question the validity of nearly every controversial rulemaking.", "Similarly, with regard to a meeting involving the President, the court held that as long as there is factual support in the record for the agency's outcome, it does not matter that \"but for\" the Presidential input it would have gone the other way.", "Of course, it is always possible that undisclosed Presidential prodding may direct an outcome that is factually based on the record, but different from the outcome that would have obtained in the absence of Presidential involvement. In such a case, it would be true that the political process did affect the outcome in a way the courts could not police. But we do not believe that Congress intended that the courts convert informal rulemaking into a rarified technocratic process, unaffected by political considerations or the presence of Presidential power."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "F. Influence That Could Abuse the Agency Investigatory Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1. SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.", "paragraphs": ["On rare occasions the claim is made that an agency investigation has been instigated by congressional pressure or influence and the claim is made by the subject of such investigation that it is tainted by the political intervention. On even rarer occasions agencies have sought to fend off congressional oversight of closed or ongoing investigations because of concern that present and future open cases could be compromised by turning over requested internal deliberative documents. Agencies argue that such disclosures, even from closed investigations, might be utilized by attorneys representing potential targets of investigations, or defendants in civil and criminal actions, as evidence that the investigations or prosecutions are politically motivated and not driven by legitimate investigatory concerns and are thereby tainted. This notion is said to be supported by the appellate court ruling in SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. It is argued that Wheeling-Pittsburgh precludes any agency contact with Members of Congress which would give the appearance that an agency is acting at the behest of a Member or committee and that its proper course is to avoid any appearance that its enforcement efforts are being pursued at Congress' bidding. The claim, however, does not appear to be an accurate portrayal of either the Wheeling-Pittsburgh ruling or the case law that preceded or followed it. The Wheeling-Pittsburgh court made it clear that a court will deem a request for the enforcement of an administrative subpoena an abuse of the judicial process only if it was in fact shown that the subpoena was issued because of congressional influence, the agency knew its process was being abused, that it knowingly did nothing to prevent the abuse, and that it vigorously pursued the frivolous charges. Under the standard articulated by the appeals court the motivation of the Members of Congress is irrelevant; the focus is on the actual impact of the congressional intercession on the motivation of the agency itself. Simply the appearance of impropriety is not enough to taint the proceeding.", "SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp . involved the initiation of an informal investigation of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation after the receipt by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a letter from a United States Senator suggesting that Wheeling had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and rule 10b-5a promulgated thereunder. During the period of the initial informal investigation, there was considerable contact between the SEC staff attorney conducting the investigation and the Senator's office and with competitors of Wheeling who were in alleged complicity with the Senator. The Senator was also actively pursuing the passage of legislation that would prevent Wheeling from obtaining Federal loan guarantees if it was under investigation by a Federal agency. Thereafter, the SEC ordered a formal investigation of the matter. Pursuant to the formal investigation order, the SEC issued a subpoena duces tecum to Wheeling and its chief executive officer. He refused to answer certain questions and the agency sought enforcement. Wheeling defended on the grounds, inter alia , that the subpoena was issued in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment; and that the investigation constituted an abuse of the SEC's investigatory power by competitors of Wheeling who were opposed to the grant of certain Federal loan guarantees to Wheeling.", "The district court refused to enforce the subpoena. Although it specifically rejected the claim of bad faith on the part of the agency, it concluded that, \"under the totality of circumstances,\" enforcement would be an abuse of the court's process. The court reached this conclusion because it believed that the SEC had allowed biased third parties to improperly influence the investigation process, although it conceded that the agency did not adopt the biased motives of the third parties.", "A panel of the Third Circuit reversed, concluding that a court could not refuse to enforce administrative subpoenas issued in good faith pursuit of a statutorily authorized purpose. The court concluded that bias of third parties was irrelevant where the agency had proceeded in good faith and that to invalidate agency action on the basis of an abuse of process theory independent of the bad faith defense was improper.", "The case was reargued before the Third Circuit en banc , which by a 6-4 vote remanded the case to the district court in light of its ruling that even in the absence of bad faith on the part of an agency, it would not enforce an administrative subpoena if it was issued because of congressional influence and it was shown that the agency knew its process was being abused, that it knowingly did nothing to prevent the abuse, and that it vigorously pursued the frivolous charges.", "We do not doubt the usefulness to administrative agencies of information gained from third parties. Nor do we doubt that frequently the motivations of informants are less than altruistic. See United States v. Cortese , 614 F.2d 914 (3d Cir. 1980). But we cannot simply avert our eyes from the realities of the political world: members of Congress are requested to, and do in fact, intrude, in varying degrees, in administrative proceedings. One commentator has said recently of the Internal Revenue Service:", "[A]though the IRS ultimately must be accountable to Congress, whose members are in turn accountable to the people, the IRS also has a constitutional duty to execute the tax law faithfully by determining and administering it properly. The IRS must give congressional comments only as much deference as they deserve on the merits, for the agency has no duty to placate particular congressmen or committees. Given the fine line between lawmaking and law enforcement, it is always difficult to say when one shades into the other, but clearly there is an inevitable tension between congressional oversight powers and the executive exercise of delegated powers to interpret, articulate, and execute the tax laws.", "Parnell, Congressional Interference in Agency Enforcement: The IRS Experience, 89 Yale L.J. 1360, 1368 (1980) (footnotes omitted). The duty of the SEC, therefore is not to ignore information given to it by congressmen, but to \"give congressional comments only as much deference as they deserve on the merits.\" Id. An administrative agency that undertakes an extensive investigation at the insistence of a powerful United States Senator \"with no reasonable expectation\" of proving a violation and then seeks federal court enforcement of its subpoena could be found to be using the judiciary for illicit purposes. We need not lend the process of the federal courts to aid such behavior.", "The appeals court made it clear that the bad faith defense need not be the sole basis for denial of enforcement, and that agency acquiescence in an abuse of its own process may lead to a finding of abuse of the court's process. The court distinguished between the two, noting that \"bad faith connotes a conscious decision by an agency to pursue a groundless allegation,\" while \"an agency may be found to be abusing the court's process if it vigorously pursued a charge because of the influence of a powerful third party without consciously and objectively evaluating the charge.\"", "The court also emphasized the point that it was improper for the district court to have taken into account the motivation of third parties in determining either bad faith or abuse of process. \"This court has previously made clear that the proper focus in a challenge to an administrative subpoena is motivation of the agency itself, not that of third parties,\" citing United States v. Cortese , 614 F.2d 914, 921 (3d Cir. 1980). The requirement of a finding of \"institutional\" bad faith rather than that of an individual agent, or the refusal to allow attributing the motives of third parties to an agency, is well established.", "The court concluded:", "At bottom, this case raises the question whether, based on objective factors, the SEC's decision to investigate reflected its independent determination, or whether that decision was the product of external influences. The reality of prosecutorial experience, that most investigations originate on the basis of tips, suggestions, or importunings of third parties, including commercial competitors, need hardly be noted. That the SEC commenced these proceedings as a result of the importunings of Senator Weicker or CF&I, even with malice on their part, is not a sufficient basis to deny enforcement of the subpoenas. See Cortese , 614 F.2d at 921. But beginning an informal investigation by collecting facts at the request of a third party, even one harboring ulterior motives is much different from entering an order directing a private formal investigation pursuant to 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5 (1980), without an objective determination by the Commission and only because of political pressure. The respondents are not free from an informal investigation instigated by anyone, in or out of government. But they are entitled to a decision by the SEC itself, free from third-party political pressure, that a \"likelihood\" of a violation exists and that a private investigation should be ordered. See 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.2(a). The SEC order must be supported by an independent agency determination, not one dictated or pressured by external forces. If an allegation of improper influence and abdication of the agency's objective responsibilities is made, and supported by sufficient evidence to make it facially credible, respondents are entitled to examine the circumstances surrounding the SEC's private investigation order. The court should be guided by twin beacons: the court's process is focus of the judicial inquiry and the respondent may challenge the summons on any appropriate ground.", "In sum, then, it would appear that the Third Circuit, while accepting the possibility of finding that political pressure can taint an investigative proceeding under a variety of theories, has imposed on a litigant the burden of establishing the factual predicate to support such a determination which may prove quite formidable. It certainly appears no less an obstacle than the showing of actual effect required in other non-adjudicatory situations.", "On the other hand, Wheeling-Pittsburgh represents something of a liberalization in an area where court review of agency requests for enforcement of administrative subpoenas has traditionally been severely circumscribed and narrow. Indeed, the development has been severely criticized, and some courts appear to have rejected Wheeling-Pittsburgh and are adhering to the traditional standard of high deference to agency subpoena issuance decisions. In fact, it may be that the somewhat more expansive review of such situations afforded by Wheeling-Pittsburgh may be limited to cases arising in the Third Circuit. In any event, we are aware of no court that has utilized the Wheeling-Pittsburgh standard to refuse to enforce an administrative subpoena because of alleged undue congressional influence. Indeed, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh court itself did not find that the SEC had been guilty of an abuse judicial process; it remanded the case to the district court to make findings consonant with its opinion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2. United States v. Armada Petroleum Corp.", "paragraphs": ["Several courts have subsequently applied the Wheeling-Pittsburgh rationale in cases involving the issuance of subpoenas by the Department of Energy to resellers of petroleum products who had refused to voluntarily supply documents in the course of a valid agency audit. In each case the defendant company claimed, inter alia , that the Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee had exerted improper influence on the agency official making the decision to issue the subpoena. In each instance the courts rejected the claims. In United States v. Armada Petroleum Corp. , for example, the court acknowledged Wheeling-Pittsburgh ' s holding that an agency may not order an investigation \"because of political pressure to do so,\" but found that where, as in the case before it, \"the Congressional involvement is directed not at the agency's decision on the merits but at accelerating the disposition and enforcement of the pertinent regulations, it has been held that such legislative conduct does not affect the fairness of the agency's proceedings and does not warrant setting aside its order.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3. United States v. American Target Advertising, Inc.", "paragraphs": ["In the most recent decision in which the target of an administrative investigation invoked Wheeling-Pittsburgh principles, the 4 th Circuit, in United States v. American Target Advertising, Inc., rejected the claim of the defendant that the issuance of an investigative subpoena was a tool of harassment and intimidation exercised by the agency (the Postal Service) at the behest of a Senator who, the court conceded, \"has demonstrated a fair degree of hostility toward\" the defendant. But the appeals court reiterated that that was not enough. The appellant \"must show that the party actually responsible for initiating the investigation, i.e., the Postal Service, has done so in bad faith.\" The court found no evidence of bad faith and rejected American Target's request for discovery before the district court, noting \"that such discovery is prohibited in these types of summary enforcement proceedings absent 'extraordinary circumstances.'\" The appeals court advised that in order to obtain discovery, the target must distinguish himself \"from the class of the ordinary respondent, by citing special circumstances.\" The 4 th Circuit concluded that it had not done so there, stating: \"when presented with evidence of unlawful conduct, the Government is not bound to investigate only those potential wrongdoers who support its policies. Because American Target failed to distinguish itself from the ordinary disgruntled respondent, it is not entitled to discovery regarding the genesis of the Postal Service's inquiry.\"", "In sum, it would appear that the assertions with respect to the Wheeling-Pittsburgh precedent is unduly restrictive. That case does not establish an \"appearance of partiality\" standard with respect to congressional contacts.

Summary and Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A review of the undue influence case law since 1966 indicates that the courts, in balancing Congress's performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies, have increasingly looked to the role of the political process in all types of agency decisionmakings and have attempted to give weight to that process on a case-by case basis. The result has been a strong predilection of the courts to accept congressional prerogatives. Thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved, the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors Congress did not intend to make relevant. Where agency adjudication is involved a stricter standard is applied and the finding of an appearance of impropriety can be sufficient to taint the proceeding. But even here the courts have required that the pressure or influence be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions before they will intervene. And where congressional intrusion in an agency's investigative process is involved the courts will intervene only if it is in fact shown that an inquiry was instituted and subpoenas issued because of congressional influence, the agency knew its process was being abused, that it knowingly did nothing to prevent abuse, and that it rigorously pursued frivolous charges.", "A 1989 legal commentary has severely criticized this decisional trend, arguing that the case law in this area means that:", "... Members of Congress can intervene in ongoing agency proceedings by contacting either the close personal aides or the immediate superiors of the ultimate decisionmaker, convey their judgments on how those questions should be decided and avoid judicial review of their actions while knowing full well that their message will find its way to the relevant agency official. In short, the actual influence standard of D.C. Federation is manipulable at the whim of Congress and, in the words of Judge Gesell, those seeking to invoke the Pillsbury doctrine must now \"shoulder the virtually impossible burden of proving whether and in what way ... the agency was actually influenced\" by congressional intervention.", "As a remedy, the author calls for the judicial application of Pillsbury ' s \"appearance of impartiality\" standard to any instance of informal congressional intercession, regardless of the nature of the proceeding in question, \"as a legitimate and useful tool for controlling congressional abuse of the informal oversight mechanisms which are likely to see wider use in the post- Chadha era.\" The comment suggests that the use of such informal oversight mechanisms is an unlawful circumvention of the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha , which invalidated the use of legislative veto devices, because it allowed Congress to evade the presentment and bicameralism requirements of the legislative process mandated by the Constitution. \"If Congress determines through the use of oversight mechanisms that an agency has misinterpreted a statute, the appropriate response is to take the formal step of amending the law, not to use informal means to alter the agency's interpretation.\"", "The comment would appear to misconceive the nature and scope of Congress' constitutional oversight and investigatory authority and the judicial recognition and approbation of informal congressional techniques to influence agency actions as both directly flowing from that authority and as being an integral part of the checks and balances mechanism underlying our scheme of separated but shared powers. Thus it is well settled that Congress in legislating pursuant to the powers granted it under Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, has the authority, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 18, to create the bureaucratic infrastructure of the Executive branch and to determine the nature, scope, and power of the duties so created. Moreover, as a general matter, the Supreme Court has spoken very broadly of the legislative power over offices. Where Congress deals with the structure of an office \u2013 its creation, location, abolition, powers, duties, tenure, compensation and other such incidents \u2013 its power is virtually plenary. Only where the object of the exercise of the power is clearly seen in the particular situation as an attempt to effect an unconstitutional purpose, e.g. , congressional appointment or removal of an officer, have the courts felt constrained to intervene.", "Equally well settled is the breadth of Congress' authority to effectively monitor the work of its creations. Supreme Court rulings have firmly established that the oversight and investigatory power of Congress is so essential to the legislative function as to be implied from the general vesting of legislative power in Congress. In the absence of a countervailing constitutional privilege or a self-imposed statutory restriction upon its authority, the Congress (and its committees) has plenary power to compel information needed to discharge its legislative function from executive agencies, private persons, and organizations, and within certain constraints, the information so obtained may be made public.", "Moreover, Congress' power to influence executive and other governmental conduct is not confined to its utilization of its lawmaking authority. The courts have long recognized congressional authority to investigate, and to express its opinion, in an attempt to influence the manner in which the laws are executed. In upholding the exercises of similar kinds of authority, courts have acknowledged that the issuance of a subpoena to the executive, the mandate of a report and wait provision, and the expression of disapprobation or the focusing of public attention on executive action, do not themselves constitute improper control of executive decisionmaking.", "The Supreme Court has also recognized Congress' right to investigate the Government's conduct of civil and criminal litigation. In the leading case of McGrain v. Daugherty , the Senate had appointed a select committee to investigate the alleged failure of the Justice Department to prosecute and defend certain civil and criminal actions to which the government was a party. The Supreme Court upheld the action of the Senate in citing the brother of the Attorney General for contempt of Congress for failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the select committee. The Court determined that the subject of the investigation\u2013\"whether the Attorney General and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes and enforce appropriate remedies against the wrongdoers\"\u2013was clearly one on which legislation could be enacted and was within the jurisdiction of the Senate to investigate.", "Additionally, the courts have explicitly held that agencies may not deny Congress access to agency documents, even in situations where the inquiry may result in the exposure of criminal corruption or maladministration by agency officials. As the Supreme Court has noted, \"But surely a congressional committee which is engaged in a legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to a halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to a witness in some distinct proceeding . . . or when crime or wrongdoing is exposed.\"", "Thus, the courts have recognized the potentially prejudicial effect congressional hearings can have on pending cases. While not questioning the prerogatives of Congress with respect to oversight and investigation, the cases pose a choice for the Congress: congressionally generated publicity may result in harming the prosecutorial effort of the Executive; but access to information under secure conditions can fulfill the congressional power of investigation and at the same time need not be inconsistent with the authority of the Executive to pursue its case. Nonetheless, it remains a choice that is solely within Congress' discretion to make, irrespective of the consequences.", "The foregoing review of the case law concerning Congress' oversight and investigatory authority appears to abundantly demonstrate that the decisional law development in the area of undue influence is hardly aberrational but is, rather, a subset, and therefore a mirror, of the broad oversight power the courts have accorded Congress over Executive agencies generally. In all such cases the courts balance Congress' constitutional oversight and investigatory prerogatives against the interests of the agencies or private parties involved. In a non-adjudicatory setting involving general policymaking, it is hardly surprising that the congressional prerogatives are likely to be weighed and found persuasive unless the subject matter implicates countervailing constitutional privileges of the President or the pressure brought to bear results in a decision that ignores applicable statutory considerations or procedures. Thus the Sierra Club court noted that a rulemaking would be overturned because of congressional pressure only if two conditions were met: first, if the content of the pressure was designed to force the decisionmaker to decide on the basis of factors not made relevant by Congress in the applicable statute and, second, if the decision was in fact affected by those extraneous considerations. The court explained its rationale as follows: \"We believe it entirely proper for Congressional representatives vigorously to represent the interests of their constituents before administrative agencies engaged in informal, general policy rulemaking, so long as individual Congressmen do not frustrate the intent of Congress as a whole as expressed in statue, nor undermine applicable rules of procedure.\"", "On the other hand, underlying the greater judicial sensitivity to public or secret ( ex parte ) exertions of political pressure on an agency adjudication is the premise that such adjudications, whether formal or informal, involve individual rights rather than issues of general policy, and thus implicate constitutional due process values. Although due process does not generally require a full-scale judicial trial, informal adjudications must nonetheless conform to the \"fundamental notions of fairness implicit in due process.\" Both public and secret congressional attempts to influence agency decisionmaking may undermine the due process rights of parties to informal adjudications in several respects. Where the contacts are unrevealed, parties to the adjudication are deprived of notice and an opportunity to respond with relevant information, a violation of fundamental canons of fairness. Moreover, whether overt or concealed, political pressure compromises the appearance of impartiality and objectivity of the decisionmaker, qualities traditionally regarded as essential to due process. Thus the decisions in this area reflect a common purpose of the courts \"to preserve the integrity of the judicial aspect of the administrative process.\"", "But even in the adjudicatory setting the judicial deference to congressional prerogatives is apparent. Taint will not be found unless the pressure is directly on the decisionmaker, concerns the merits of the case, and is not minimal. The Gulf Oil MEUA, California v. FERC and ATX litigations serve to illustrate the current judicial practice. All four cases involved proceedings adjudicatory in nature but in none was taint found. In Gulf Oil the court found the following factors determinative: the subcommittee interrogations were not concerned with the merits of the agency's decision but with its compliance procedures; there was no attempt to influence a factual determination of the agency; the Commission in fact resisted the political pressure as evidenced by its resolution of key issues in a manner identical to the way it had decided them before the committee hearings; and the fact that the nature of the agency's decision was entirely legal. In the MEUA case, the Second Circuit found the ex parte communications involved there to be de minimis . The challenged communications were not secret and were in fact promptly placed in the public record; they contained no new factual information; and no opportunity for rebuttal was either required or necessary. In California v. FERC the court emphasized that the congressional intercessions were meant to correct procedural problems and to question whether the agency was applying the proper legal standard and that the agency determination made in each instance was based on its own independent, on-the-record analysis of the congressional objections and was accompanied by a reasoned explanation. The court viewed the matter as properly involving the congressional interest in policymaking and policy application. Finally, the intense congressional pressure in ATX to deny an application to operate a new airline was found not to taint the proceeding because close examination showed that it did not affect the outcome of proceeding. The court pointed to the absence of threats, the insulation of the immediate decisionmaker, and that the findings of material facts were very well supported by the evidentiary record, including the extensive evidence of previous wrongdoing and maladministration by the applicant. In short, the courts are looking to see if the agency itself protected the integrity of its own decisional process.", "Gulf Oil , MEUA, FERC and ATX then may be said to be reflective of the marked preference of the courts for upholding agency action wherever it is on the decisionmaking continuum. It would appear that unless a decisionmaker in an adjudication is directly contacted with respect to the merits of the case before him, or the situation involves particularly outrageous and/or pervasive congressional interference in a rulemaking, informal decisionmaking or investigative context which actually influences the decisionmaker, it is unlikely that a court will void a challenged agency action. Indeed, since the Pillsbury decision in 1966, only one challenge based on adjudicatory interference has been successful ( Koniag v. Andrus ) and that turned on the fact of a direct communication by letter to the agency decisionmaker by the chairman of a congressional committee which pointedly addressed the merits of the pending proceeding. Similarly, only one rulemaking has been found tainted during that same period ( Texas Medical Association v. Mathews ). And in all instances in which a proceeding has been found tainted, the judicial remedy has been a remand to the agency for reconsideration of the decision in question.", "In the final analysis, judicial deference in this area appears to reflect the pragmatic conclusion that maintenance of Congress' ability to communicate as freely as possible with the administrative bureaucracy is essential to sustaining the public acceptability of the modern administrative state. As one commentator has explained:", "The legitimacy and acceptability of the administrative process depends on the perception of the public that the legislature has some sort of ultimate control over the agencies. It is through the Congress that the administrative system is accountable to the public. If members of Congress \"be corrupt, others may be chosen.\" The public may not, however, directly remove agency officials. The public looks to its power to elect representatives as its input into the administrative process. The public will perceive restrictions on Congress's power to influence agency action as reducing the accountability of agency officials. This will negatively affect the legitimacy of agency actions, as well as seriously erode notion of popular sovereignty. Even administrators, who may not perceive legislative intrusions into the administrative process as being particularly desirable, recognize congressional supervision as a necessary function in a democratic society. The nature of the government requires that the legislature maintain a careful supervision over agency action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "III. Ethical Standards and Considerations", "paragraphs": ["This part of the report discusses the ethical considerations and issues which may arise when a congressional office or a Member of Congress contacts an administrative or regulatory agency or otherwise intervenes in an administrative matter on behalf of a private constituent or other private entity with interests affecting the Member's constituency.", "Any discussion of the \"ethics\" of a Member of Congress intervening in an administrative matter on behalf of a constituent or other individual must be set within the context of the traditional role of a Member of Congress, in which the Member is often seen as his or her constituents' most immediate elected \"representative\" to the entire United States Government. Contacting an agency, department or Government bureau, and representing or intervening in administrative matters on behalf of constituents have often been characterized as among the official responsibilities of Members of Congress on behalf of those whom they represent, and such \"representational\" duties, above and beyond purely \"legislative\" acts, have evolved as a traditional and longstanding discretionary practice of Members of Congress.", "In discussing the theoretical, as well as the ethical context for these representational activities, the late Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, in his valued work Ethics in Government, noted that congressional intervention in the administrative and executive process is grounded firmly in our concepts of checks and balances in a representative democracy, as well as our natural and historical distrust, as a nation, of unelected governments:", "Much of the mail and time of members of Congress is devoted to the requests of constituents about matters concerning which they, the constituents, are dealing with the administrative agencies of the government. In countries dominated by civil servants, such as imperial Germany and to a lesser degree Great Britain, any intervention by legislators in such administrative matters is severely discouraged. The bureaucracy in these countries contends that the function of the legislators is to make the laws and that of the public administrators is to administer them, and that consequently neither should interfere with the work of the other. ... These men, consciously or unconsciously, regard the civil service officials as devoted public servants ... [in contrast to] the \"impure\" legislator .... [Such attitude] is fostered by those who would create an \"administrative state\" in which the real directing power would be exercised by self-selecting and self-perpetuating group of officials rather than by elected representatives of the people. At its roots there is a concealed but deep distrust of democratic government and democratic processes.", "* * *", "The truth is that legislation and administration should not be kept in air-tight and separate compartments. In order that each group may perform its own job adequately, it should within limits interest itself in the work of the other. There is then, a sound ethical basis for legislators to represent the interests of constituents and other citizens in their dealings with administrative officials and bodies.", "Besides this ethical justification, there is a practical necessity for it. Out of a deep instinctive wisdom, the American people have never been willing to confide their individual or collective destinies to civil servants over whom they have little control. They distrust and dislike a self-perpetuating bureaucracy, because they believe that ultimately it will not reflect the best interests of the people. They therefore turn to their elected representatives to protect their legitimate interests in their relationship with the public administrators.", "The importance of the case-work or service function of representing constituents' individual interests before the agencies and officials of the federal executive bureaucracy was recognized and discussed in an important treatise on congressional ethics authored by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Congress and the Public Trust :", "The casework or service function has become a major responsibility of Members of Congress today. In the performance of this function, a Senator or Representative negotiates in his constituent's behalf a whole range of problems and difficulties that arise out of their relations with the Federal government. This can involve the Member in helping to obtain a federal contract for his district, interceding on behalf of a selective service registrant, inquiring why a constituent's Social Security check has not been delivered, setting up a meeting with a Federal official, and arranging for a tour of the White House for an important constituent.", "The practice of intervening in administrative and executive matters on behalf of constituents and other individuals has, therefore, not been perceived historically in the United States as an inherently wrongful act, necessarily involving undue or improper \"political\" influence over executive or administrative matters, but rather has customarily been seen as a discretionary, and arguably, an expected function of one's representative in Congress. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, for example, advises Members and employees of the House that: \"An important aspect of a House Member's representative function is to act as a 'go-between' or conduit between his constituents and administrative agencies of the Federal Government.\" Similarly, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics has stated that: \"It is a necessary function of a Senator's office to intervene with officials of the executive branch and independent regulatory agencies on behalf of individuals when the facts warrant ....\"", "There are, of course, opportunities and potential for abuse in this area, and there are, therefore, statutory as well as ethical restraints and considerations in relation to such activities, as there are for most official activities and duties of Members of Congress and their staff. The most prominent and clear restriction is upon the receipt of compensation or anything of value in return for, or because of, such representational activity.", "The Supreme Court of the United States in 1905 had occasion to rule on the propriety of a United States Senator intervening in an executive matter, and noted that such activity, although not required of a Member, is within the Member's discretion, may be done \"without impropriety,\" and is not violative of statutory restraints as long as no compensation is accepted for the activity. The Court in Burton v. United States, in ruling that a statute barring a Senator from receiving compensation for representing an individual before the agencies of the Government did not unduly interfere with a Member's constitutional duties to represent and present his views before those agencies, explained:", "A statute like the one before us ... can be executed without in any degree ... interfering with the discharge of the legitimate duties of a Senator. The proper discharge of those duties does not require a Senator to appear before an executive Department in order to enforce his particular views, or the views of others, in respect of matters committed to that Department for determination. He may often do so without impropriety, and, as far as existing law is concerned, may do so whenever he chooses, provided he neither agrees to receive nor receives compensation for such services.", "The initial ethical considerations thus concern the receipt of things of value by a Member or staff from persons or organizations on whose behalf interventions before or inquiries to federal agencies were made. Prudence and caution must, of course, be exercised by Members of Congress and staff in accepting gifts at any time from private individuals or groups, and even more so in accepting any gifts, offers of entertainment, or other things of value which could be interpreted as a reward, payment or additional compensation for doing one's official duties in assisting constituents or others in matters before federal agencies. Since campaign contributions are a more common, and arguably a more acceptable and necessary monetary transfer from private individuals to Members of Congress than are outright gifts, some of the more common, but difficult questions in this area concern the receipt, acceptance, or solicitation of campaign contributions from those whom the Member or his or her staff has assisted in matters before federal agencies.", "In addition to statutory and rule restrictions relating to such things as the receipt of payments or gifts in return for representational activity, or concerning a Member's or staff's own personal interest in a matter, there are also general ethical considerations and guidelines which are concerned with the prevention of undue or improper influence by those in the legislative branch over the duties and functions of executive officers and employees, separate from the issue of compensation or reward. These considerations and guidelines are based in some respects on the separation of powers doctrine, as well as on the notions of due process and fairness in administrative proceedings, and the issues of the use or abuse of political influence over matters which are expected to be based substantially on competitive, merit principles, or which are to be decided strictly on particular statutory or regulatory criteria. Executive or administrative decisions on some matters, such as certain federal contracts or hiring in the civil service, are often expressly required to be made on a competitive, merit basis, and may be expressly required not to be made on the basis of political affiliation or influence."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A.

An illegal gratuity may be received even after an official act is performed, as a \"thank you\" or in appreciation for doing an act that would have been done in any event, uninfluenced by the gratuity; while a bribe, on the other hand, must be shown to be the \"prime mover\" influencing the act.", "Although no specific wrongful bargain, or \"corrupt\" intent, in receiving an illegal gratuity need be shown, there is a criminal intent required of an illegal gratuity which would distinguish this wrongful receipt of a payment from a mere gift unrelated to any official act, or from such things as lawful campaign contributions given to an elected public official \"because of\" his stand, vote, or position on an issue. The intent has been described by one court as the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded for a particular official act or acts:", "...[U]nder the gratuity section, \"otherwise than as provided by law ... for or because of any official act\" carries the concept of the official act being done anyway, but the payment only being made because of a specifically identified act, and with a certain guilty knowledge best defined by the Supreme Court itself, i.e. , \"with knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act ... evidence of the Member's knowledge of the alleged briber's illicit reasons for paying the money is sufficient.\"", "While some cases in the circuits had gone so far as to find that a specific official act need not be contemplated or identified for a payment or compensation to constitute an \"illegal gratuity\" as long as payments were given to a recipient who is in a \"position to use his authority in a manner which could affect the gift giver,\" the Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond in 1999 clarified that such so-called \"status gifts,\" unconnected to any identified official act, were not a violation of the illegal gratuities provision.", "In addition to the intent requirement, under the illegal gratuities clause it must be shown that the compensation received by the public official was received \"personally,\" or as stated in the earlier version of the law, \"for himself.\" If things of value are directed to independent third parties or entities, such payments might not be considered to have been received or sought with the requisite intent to \"compensate\" the public official \"personally\" for his acts, because they were not received by the official \"for himself\" or \"personally,\" but rather by another entity or person."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3.

So, if a Congressman receives compensation for services rendered by him to a person in relation to any matter in which the United States is interested, before any Government department, he is guilty of violating the statute, even though the service rendered was a proper act on his part. A Congressman cannot legally receive compensation from a private person for doing his duty in respect to something in which that person and the United States have interests. The gist of the offense is the receipt of compensation, not the nature of the act done by the recipient in consequence thereof.", "Although similar in nature and necessary proof to the illegal gratuities clause, the statute is not necessarily duplicative of the illegal gratuities provision because the \"services\" rendered, for which compensation may not be accepted under \u00a7203, need not be within the \"official duties\" of the officer or employee accepting such compensation, as it must be for the illegal gratuities clause of the bribery law.

However, for a \"bribe\" to be present in the case of campaign contributions, there must be shown a specific quid pro quo , that is, a corrupt agreement or understanding between the parties that the public official will do some specific official act in return for the receipt of certain valuable consideration. When such a corrupt agreement exists ( e.g. , \"I will intervene in this matter in return for your providing a campaign contribution to my political committee\"), there exists the requisite element of being \"influenced\" to do the act \"in return for\" the campaign contribution. When there is only a campaign contribution and a subsequent official act favorable to the donor, or an official intervention with an agency and a later campaign contribution, but no evidence of such an agreement directly linking the motivation for the official act to the contribution, then there is no bribe. This is why the Supreme Court has noted that bribery is among the least subtle, and most blatant forms of public corruption.", "As to campaign contributions generally, the courts have noted that: \"No politician who knows the identity and business interests of his campaign contributors is ever completely devoid of knowledge as to the inspiration behind the donation.\" While campaign contributions can be bribes where there exists a corrupt bargain (a quid pro quo arrangement), campaign contributions given to a candidate or official merely as support, or in appreciation or thank you for certain official acts, positions or votes taken, as is the case for many or most campaign contributions, are not considered to be bribes. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in United States v. Anderson, supra, for example, where a conviction of a lobbyist was upheld for bribing a Senator with \"campaign contributions\" to influence the Senator on particular postal rate legislation, approved the jury instructions given by the trial judge which \"exonerated campaign contributions inspired by the recipient's general position of support on particular legislation.\"", "Campaign contributions may also be in the nature of general contributions, donations or payments to causes, entities or to other persons, sometimes called \"goodwill\" payments, which are given merely to create a favorable atmosphere or feeling of gratitude in the recipient, or with \"some generalized hope or expectation of ultimate benefit on the part of the donor,\" but which are not given nor received in the context of any express or implied agreement, and are therefore not considered \"bribes\" under the statute. Political contributions to entities such as a candidate's political campaign committee do not in themselves constitute bribes \"even though many contributors hope that the official will act favorably because of their contributions.\" A Court of Appeals in United States v.

They do not express or create overriding obligations, that is, there is no absolute obligation on the part of the contributor to recognize past work by the candidate, and there is no absolute obligation on the part of the candidate to do the work the contributor expects. Absence of absolute obligation creates one difference between contributions and bribes.", "It has been theorized that there may be some incidental \"reciprocity\" expected between donor and recipient in our political process. Legislators in Congress, unlike judges, have a specific constituency which they represent and on whom, in return, they rely for the donation of funds to their campaigns. Judge Noonan argued that to some extent, campaign contributions, or at least large ones, may be a kind of \"access\" payment to our representative which is expressly permitted in practice in our system of private funding of campaigns for elective office:", "Campaign contributions may be considered a subspecies of a larger class \u2013 access payments. \"I'm not paying for my congressman's vote,\" the large contributor will say. \"I simply want to be sure he will listen to my side of the case.\" ...

The judge's office is modeled on the paradigm of the transcendent Judge of the Bible and a sharp line distinguishes him from the litigants before him. The legislator, on the contrary, is his constituent's representative .... A certain identity of interest is expected to exist between constituent and legislator.... Given the acceptance of this mutuality of purpose between contributor and legislator, the prevailing assumption in America has been that campaign contributions normally fall in the range of cases where specific votes are not being bought. ... At times \"campaign contribution\" has been a code word used as a flimsy cover for a payment intended to enrich an official personally in exchange for an official act benefitting the payor.

If he wishes to be very correct, he will also state that he is asking for nothing more than fair consideration on the merits of the case. A second procedure is to vouch for the applicant in some way; this amounts to a recommendation for the constituent, although not necessarily of his request. The third step is to recommend that favorable action be taken on the matter at issue. This may be done indirectly as well as directly, and may be simply stated or argued at length with supporting data and explanations. It is this third procedure which gives rise to ethical problems.", "* * *", "Legislators have at least two moral obligations in these matters of reference. One is to make sure that they are seeking to push cases only on their merits. It is always possible to make sure that there is no personal economic interest which is involved. But it is more difficult for a legislator to draw the line between proper and improper personal interests which are essentially political in character. That is, a legislator who is seeking support in a pending election (and elections are always pending) may feel that the noble objective of reelecting a stout defender of the public interests may justify his guiding the hand of justice just a little in a relatively minor matter.", "A second moral obligation is to make sure that the methods of intervening in administrative matters are not themselves so inherently damaging to the administrative process or to legislative-administrative relations that they offset any public benefit that might be gained from any such legislative pressure.", "Senator Douglas in his later work and collection of lectures entitled Ethics in Government expressed general ethical principles in relation to congressional intervention into administrative matters which he propounded with the caveat that: \"Probably there can be no fixed set of rules governing the relationships between legislators and administrators which will be perfectly satisfactory in all respects.\" The ethical principles which Senator Douglas submitted \"for consideration\" included the following:", "(1) A legislator should not immediately conclude that his constituent is always right and the administrator is always wrong, but as far as possible should try to find out the merits of each case and only make such representations as the situation permits.", "(2) A legislator should, of course, not accept any money for representing constituents or anyone else before government departments.... If a legislator accepts money, entertainment, or valuable presents in return for his services, he is using his public office in reality not for the common good but for private gain.", "(3) In representing individual interests before administrative bodies, the legislator should be courteous and know the merits of the case; he should not try to bully or intimidate the officials involved and he should make it clear that the final decision is in their hands."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "House Committee's Wright Investigation", "paragraphs": ["The ethical guidelines expressed by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in Advisory Opinion No. 1, and as suggested for consideration by the late Senator Douglas, came into play in the investigation of the former Speaker of the House, Representative James C. Wright. One of the charges investigated by the Committee and its special counsel concerned the \"possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.\" Although there were several incidents of intervention and contacts between Speaker Wright and members of the Bank Board, and although certain Bank Board members such as Edwin Gray felt that the Speaker \"attempted to coerce them,\" the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct did not find reason to believe that the Speaker exercised undue influence over the Board, as there was no evidence of \"a reprisal or threat to agency officials.\"", "The Special Counsel's Report in the Wright matter argued that \"undue influence\" could be evidenced by either the \"exercise of influence for improper ends or by the use of improper means.\" The first intervention examined concerned a meeting in Congressman Wright's office between Edwin Gray, then Bank Board Chairman, several Bank Board staff and four Members of Congress from Texas, including Representative Wright. The substance of the meeting was that the Members of Congress had heard of reports that Bank Board regulators were using \"heavy handed\" and \"Gestapo-like\" tactics against certain savings and loan banks in Texas, and the Members present expressed and \"passed their concerns on\" to the Bank Board members. They emphasized the poor economic conditions in Texas, and their belief that such conditions were only temporary. Representative Wright had left the meeting early, and the other Congressmen stayed. The Special Counsel found that the meeting between the Congressmen and the Bank Board staff \"represented a proper interaction.\"", "The second intervention and contact concerned inquiries and statements by Representative Wright to Edwin Gray about an individual (Hall) and his financial institution, and the conduct of a representative of the Bank Board who the Speaker felt was not \"as flexible or understanding\" as he should be. The Speaker asked Chairman Gray \"if there wasn't anything I [Gray] could do about this.\" Gray testified that Representative Wright \"did not threaten him or use coercive terms,\" but that because of the Member's position, Gray felt that he had to do something, and believed that the Congressman \"wanted the Bank Board to change its position regarding Hall.\" It further appears that Representative Wright may later have held up a recapitalization bill affecting the Bank Board \"to show his displeasure with the Bank Board's treatment of Hall specifically and of Texas savings and loans in general.\" Although the Special Counsel argued that these actions may have constituted improper activity because no merits of the case were argued in asking for reconsideration of an agency decision, and because of the alleged use of holding legislation \"hostage\" to express the Member's displeasure, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, as noted above, did not issue even a \"statement of alleged violations\" because of such activity, and thus dropped all charges of undue influence concerning these contacts.", "Other activities and interventions included: \"intercession on behalf of a constituent who expressed a complaint\" about the Bank Board, and the Congressman's expression to the Board for his hope for \"improved\" regulatory conditions; complaints from the Congressman to Edwin Gray that a friend and political fundraiser had been \"mistreated\" by Bank Board regulators, that Gray needed to meet with his friend personally to hear his story, and that because of Speaker Wright's power, Gray decided to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the constituent's treatment by the Bank Board; that in expressing complaints to then Chairman Gray about over-zealous regulators, the Congressman said that he had heard that certain regulators were homosexuals and had \"established a ring of homosexual lawyers\" in Texas, and that the Member asked if Chairman Gray could \"get rid of\" one regulator in particular; Representative Wright's intervention directly with the Chairman Gray to ask for a delay in a closing of a thrift institution in Texas, and asking Gray to report back; a meeting initiated by Bank Board personnel, and an alleged indirect request from Representative Wright to have another Bank Board litigator removed.", "The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, examining the activity of Speaker Wright concerning all of these interventions and contacts, found no undue influence or abuse of his official influence or position in his expressions of interest in agency regulatory matters. The Committee believed that some of the Congressman's conduct may have been \"intemperate,\" but that displeasure with the personality and techniques of a Member in his expressions of interest in a matter to an executive agency can not be used to interfere with or override the important duty of a Member to \"effectively represent persons and organizations having concern with the activities of executive agencies.\" Specifically, in dismissing these charges against Speaker Wright, the Committee found:", "It is clear that under our constitutional form of government there is a constant tension between the legislative and executive branches regarding the desires of legislators on the one hand and the actions of agencies on the other in carrying out their respective responsibilities. The assertion that the exercise of undue influence can arise based upon a legislator's expressions of interest jeopardizes the ability of Members effectively to represent persons and organizations having concern with the activities of executive agencies.", "Accordingly, while it may well be that Representative Wright was intemperate in his dealings with representatives of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Committee is not persuaded that there is reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency. In sum, such a finding cannot rest on pure inference or circumstance or, for that matter, on the technique and personality of the legislator, but, instead, must be based on probative evidence that a reprisal or threat to agency officials was made."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "E.

These amendments, which were passed in 1993 and went into effect in February of 1994, had expressly prohibited a Member of Congress from making a recommendation on behalf of an applicant for federal employment to most positions in the Federal Government on any basis, including the basis of one's political affiliation, except that a Member may have provided a \"statement\" which \"relates solely to the character and residence of the employee or applicant.\" Additionally, the amended statute had prohibited an applicant or an employee from seeking or requesting from a Member of Congress or from a congressional employee any recommendation for employment or other personnel action, other than the character reference described above. However, in 1996 Congress amended the prohibitions on referrals and recommendations which had been in effect since 1994, and returned the state of the law to that which it was prior to those 1994-effective changes.

This language has in the past been interpreted as actually anticipating that such referrals and recommendations will be made, and as indicating that Members are not necessarily prohibited from taking such action on behalf of applicants. Current federal law continues to protect against potential political abuses in civil service hiring by prohibiting the consideration of political factors by appointing officials in referrals from Members, the general prohibition for anyone in the federal service to consider in recommendations or statements factors other than those that evaluate work performance, ability, qualifications and suitability, and the express prohibition on discriminating in employment matters on the basis of \"political affiliation.\"", "Considering the statutory restraints on referrals, the rules against the consideration of factors other than evaluation of work performance and suitability, and the prohibitions on political influence in federal hiring, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has advised that with respect to competitive service employments:", "If the Member does not have personal knowledge of the applicant's work ability or performance, the letter of recommendation may address only the applicant's character or residence.", "Furthermore, the Committee notes that if a Member does not have personal knowledge of the applicant's work ability or performance, either through that constituent's work for or with the Member's office, then such \"recommendation\" for the competitive civil service should not be on official congressional letterhead stationery, but rather on the Member's personal stationery.", "With regard to letters of recommendations concerning positions in the competitive service the Senate Select Committee on Ethics has advised its Members that:", "...Members are now free to write a letter on behalf of or relating to a persons who is applying or under consideration for a position, or who is up for a promotion in the Executive Branch, and may include any information bearing on the suitability of the person for the position.

Judicial Intervention", "paragraphs": ["Members' offices are strongly cautioned by the ethics committees in both the House and Senate regarding any informal interventions into or communications to a court with respect to the merits of matters in the judicial process. As a general matter, the separation of powers concept dictates that the authority over resolution of individual legal cases and challenges resides within the judicial branch of Government, and not the legislative branch. Furthermore, it is intended under our system of Government that this judicial branch be composed of an \"independent\" judiciary which will, in consideration of basic notions of due process and fairness, make decisions on the facts before it grounded in the rule of law and/or equity, and not based upon political pressures, partisan considerations or personal influences of those wielding authority in other branches of Government.", "More specifically, there are provisions of law and rule which limit, restrict and prohibit the receipt of ex parte communications by a decision maker in an adjudicatory process, and efforts to circumvent such rules may place a judge or magistrate in an uncompromising ethical position, and thus prove counterproductive to one's objective. The general ethical standards of conduct for judges prohibit them from receiving or considering any ex parte communications on a pending matter, that is, off-the-record or other informal communications from persons who are not parties to the legal proceeding in question. The American Bar Association's Model Code of Judicial Conduct, in a provision which has been adopted by the Judicial Conference of the United States for federal judges, provides at Canon 3 that: \"A judge should ... , except as authorized by law, neither initiate nor consider ex parte or other communications concerning a pending or impending proceeding.\" Similar ethical obligations concerning the making or the receipt of ex parte communications attach to administrative law judges or other administrative personnel in adjudicatory matters before federal agencies, under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.", "Certain requests may, of course, be made from Members of Congress and Members' offices to the judiciary, including seeking from a clerk of the court information on the status of a judicial matter, and the request for information on the public docket. Furthermore, while informal attempts at persuasion or influence of a court or over a judge are not deemed proper, it is acceptable for a Member of Congress who feels strongly about a legal matter, such as when the outcome of the matter may affect large numbers of his or her constituents or otherwise impact his or her State or district, to seek to formally intervene in a legal proceeding as a party, or to file a brief amicus curiae (friend of the court) in a matter on appeal.", "The Senate Select Committee on Ethics specifically advises as follows:", "The general advice of the Ethics Committee concerning pending court actions is that Senate offices should refrain from intervening in such legal actions (unless the office becomes a party to the suit, or seeks leave of the court to intervene as amicus curiae ) until the matter has reached a resolution in the courts. The principle behind such advice is that the judicial system is the appropriate forum for the resolution of legal disputes and, therefore, the system should be allowed to function without interference from outside sources.", "Similarly, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct explains:", "Where a Member believes it necessary to attempt to affect the outcome in a pending case, he or she has a variety of options. A Member who has relevant information could provide it to a party's counsel, who could then file it with the court and notify all parties. Alternatively, the Member could seek to file an amicus curiae, or friend of the court brief. Yet another option, in an appropriate case, might be to seek to intervene as a formal party to the proceeding. A Member could also make a speech on the House floor or place a statement in the Congressional Record as to the legislative intent behind the law. A Member should refrain, however, from making an off-the-record communication to the presiding judge, as it could cause the judge to recuse him- or herself from further consideration of the case.", "Where a Member does have personal knowledge about a matter or a party to a proceeding, the Member may convey that information to the court through regular channels in the proceeding (e.g., by submitting answers to interrogatories, being deposed, or testifying in court).

Conclusions Concerning Ethical Issues", "paragraphs": ["Contacting regulatory and administrative agencies or intervening into administrative matters by a Member of Congress on behalf of constituents and others with interests affecting the Member's district or State, is considered an important discretionary function of an elected representative for those whom he or she represents. It has become a fairly traditional role for Members of Congress to express concern for, and to sometimes act as a \"liaison\" or spokesman for their constituents to the unelected, and arguably less responsive, bureaucracy of the Federal Government. In the process of such intervention it is expected that some \"tension\" between the desires of legislators and those in the executive branch will naturally exist in our constitutional form of government.", "While it may be a common, discretionary practice for a Member to intervene with or contact an agency for a constituent there may, similar to any other official acts of Members, be several ethical issues that arise in such interventions. In the first instance, it is important to assure that nothing of value from a private source is received in connection with, in return for, because of, or as compensation for the Member's or the office's intervention. Campaign contributions are of a particular concern in this area. Although outright \"bribes\" or \"extortion\" in relation to the receipt of campaign contributions and official interventions would require specific factual evidence of corruption and would cover only the most blatant forms of misconduct, there are other, more common and subtle ethical concerns concerning such contributions. Members have been advised to avoid any indications of a connection or \"linkage\" between donations or solicitations of campaign funds to or for the Member, and the assistance provided by that Member.", "In light of the guidance, opinions and rules in the House and Senate on administrative intervention and campaign funds, Members may be advised to institute office practices and procedures which assure that requests for intervention are handled and evaluated in a substantially similar manner for all constituents, and that decisions whether to act on any particular request are made on the merits of the matter. The strength of the constituent's position and case, the principles of fairness or justice that may be involved in the matter, the overall public interest in the matter, the consistency with past practices of the office, and the consideration of the type of administrative proceeding involved and the type of intervention that would be necessary, are all factors that may be involved in decisions on whether to intervene or not. In no event should decisions be based on whether or not a constituent or other private petitioner has contributed to or assisted the Member's campaign; and merely because one has contributed to the Member's campaign does not disqualify that person from representation by the Member.", "Members and staff should also be aware that there is no personal financial interest in the subject matter of the intervention. As far as staff are concerned, recusals or written waivers may be pursued in those instances.", "Finally, the means and methods of intervention by Members and the Members' offices are matters of ethical standards and guidelines expressed by the House and the Senate. The ethical \"guidance\" expressed on the subject of the methods of intervention is generally directed at assuring that a Member of Congress does not attempt to exert \"undue influence\" upon, and therefore cause an unfair or unjustified governmental decision or action by, an agency through coercive activities such as threats of reprisal against or promises of rewards for federal regulators and administrators. This does not mean that a Member or staff may not, when appropriate, express an opinion on a policy matter, argue a matter on the merits, or ask for consideration or reconsideration of an action or decision based on statutory, regulatory, or legal interpretative factors. While an office should not attempt to intimidate an administrator, it is obvious that some administrators and regulators are more \"thin skinned\" than others, and a Member's conduct will most likely be judged not on the subjective feelings of the administrator, but on the more objective conduct of the Member involved. In most of the cases of constituents asking for assistance, a contact or intervention consisting of no more than a status inquiry, a request to be kept informed of the process, an introduction of the constituent to the agency, and/or a request for a fair and expeditious resolution of the issue, will be sufficient to express, and to alert the agency of, the interest of the Member and the Member's office in the matter."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
