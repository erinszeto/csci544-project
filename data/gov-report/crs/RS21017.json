Introduced in the Senate the following month,the measure, afternegotiation with the executive branch and further refinement, was cleared for President Gerald Ford's signature onSeptember 14,1976. (5)", "As enacted, the National Emergencies Act consisted of five titles. The first of these generally returned all standby statutorydelegations of emergency power, activated by an outstanding declaration of national emergency, to a dormant statetwo years after thestatute's approval. However, the act did not cancel outstanding 1933, 1950, 1970, and 1971 national emergencyproclamations,because these were issued by the President pursuant to his Article II constitutional authority. Nevertheless, it didrender themineffective by returning to dormancy the statutory authorities they had activated, thereby necessitating a newdeclaration to activatestandby statutory emergency authorities.", "Title II provided a procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the President and prescribed arrangements for theircongressional regulation. The statute established an exclusive means for declaring a national emergency. Furthermore, emergencydeclarations were to terminate automatically after one year unless formally continued for another year by thePresident, but could beterminated earlier by either the President or Congress. Originally, the prescribed method for congressionaltermination of a declarednational emergency was a concurrent resolution adopted by both houses of Congress. This type of so-called\"legislative veto\" waseffectively invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1983. (6) The National Emergencies Act was amended in 1985 to substitute a jointresolution as the vehicle for rescinding a national emergency declaration. (7)", "When declaring a national emergency, the President must indicate, according to Title III, the powers and authorities being activated torespond to the exigency at hand.

The proclaimed national emergency activated authority for the seizure of Iranian governmentproperty, includingassets, and prohibition of economic transactions with Iran. Such national emergency actions were also subsequentlytaken againstNicaragua, South Africa, Libya, Panama, Iraq, Haiti, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Burma, and Sudan. On severaloccasions since 1983, when the Export Administration Act of 1979 automatically expired and awaitedreauthorization, nationalemergencies were declared to activate authority by which to continue the operative status of the statute's exportcontrol regulations.
