Since then it has begun to increase again as recovery has commenced. The financial crisis caused U.S. imports to drop faster than U.S. exports, but that trend has reversed as U.S. demand for imports recovers.", "Exports of goods of $1,497 billion in 2011 increased from 2010 by $209 billion or 16%, while imports of goods of $2,236 billion in 2011 increased by $302 billion, also 16%, over 2010. Though both exports and imports increased by 16%, this led to an increase in the overall merchandise trade deficit (i.e., the trade balance became more negative) for 2011 of $93 billion or 15% over 2010. Because imports are greater than exports, exports must increase at a greater percentage than imports to maintain the current trade balance.", "In 2011, the trade deficit in goods reached $738 billion on a balance of payments (BoP) basis, still lower than the previous peak of $836 billion in 2006, but greater than the deficits in 2009 and 2010 of $506 billion and $645 billion. The 2011 U.S. deficit on merchandise trade (Census basis) with China was $295.4 billion, with the European Union (EU27) was $99.9 billion, with Canada was $34.5 billion, with Japan was $63.2 billion, and with Mexico was $64.5 billion. With the Asian Newly Industrialized Countries (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the trade balance moved from a deficit of $5.5 billion in 2007 to surpluses increasing from $2.2 billion in 2008 to $15.4 billion in 2011.", "Related to the goods trade balance is the balance on the current account, which includes merchandise and services trade plus investment income and unilateral transfers. The deficit on the current account grew in 2011 to $466 billion from $442 billion in 2010. This smaller increase in the current account deficit ($24 billion), as compared to the increase in the goods trade deficit ($93 billion), reflects an increase in the U.S. surplus in both services trade and investment income.", "Trade deficits are a concern for Congress because they may generate trade friction and pressures for the government to do more to open foreign markets, to shield U.S. producers from foreign competition, or to assist U.S. industries to become more competitive. Overall U.S. trade deficits reflect excess spending (a shortage of savings) in the domestic economy and a reliance on capital imports to finance that shortfall. Capital inflows serve to offset the outflow of dollars used to pay for imports. Movements in the exchange rate help to balance trade. The rising trade deficit (when not matched by capital inflows) places downward pressure on the value of the dollar, which, in turn, helps to shrink the deficit by making U.S. exports cheaper and imports more expensive. However, interventions in foreign exchange markets by countries such as China and South Korea can keep the value of their currencies from rising too fast, thus keeping the dollar strong and imports cheaper.", "Areas to watch in 2012 in international trade include the energy and transportation sectors. In energy, unconventional oil and gas production are increasing U.S. domestic supply, reducing imports, and increasing exports. In transportation, U.S. automakers appear to be exporting well to growth markets such as China.", "Note: This report is current through U.S. Department of Commerce annual data revisions, published June 8, 2012, and Bureau of Economic Analysis revisions published June 14, 2012."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["International trade in goods and services along with flows of financial capital affect virtually every person living in the United States.

Although the United States is one of the three largest exporters in the world (China and Germany are the other two), U.S. sales abroad are overshadowed by the huge demand by American consumers and industry for imported products. Since 1976, the United States has incurred continual merchandise trade deficits with annual amounts increasing steadily until the plateau of years 2005 through 2008. Then in 2009 the U.S. trade deficit on goods declined roughly 39%, as U.S. imports fell much faster than exports during the recession.

As the trade deficit rises relative to the total economy, the risk increases that the dollar will weaken, prices will rise, financial markets will be disrupted, and the economic well-being of the population will be reduced. A large trade deficit, however, naturally follows a booming economy as robust domestic demand generates purchases of both domestic and imported goods. At the strategic level, trade ties often lead to a deepening of bilateral relations with other nations that can develop into formal free trade agreements (FTAs) or political and security arrangements. Trade also can be used as a tool to accomplish strategic objectives\u2014particularly through providing preferential trading arrangements or by imposing trade sanctions. At the microeconomic level, imports of specific products can generate trade friction and pressures from constituent interests for the government to shield U.S. producers from foreign competition, provide adjustment assistance, open foreign markets, or assist U.S. industries to become more competitive. At the household level, rising trade deficits and free trade agreements are often associated with employment, particularly concerns over a loss of jobs, a highly relevant issue for the American public.", "This report provides an overview of the current status, trends, and forecasts for U.S. import and export flows as well as certain trade balances.

The U.S. recession would have been worse without the shrinking U.S. trade deficit. However, the faltering global economic conditions that caused the declining U.S. demand for imports, and hence the fall in the trade deficit, also caused a decline in demand for U.S. domestic goods and services. While U.S. imports declined in 2009, they rose in 2010 and 2011, forcing companies competing with imports to continue to face diminished demand as the domestic economy remained sluggish. These conditions create increased pressures on political forces to protect domestic industry from imports, not only in the United States, but around the world. As the world is recovering from the great recession countries are vying to capture the increase in global trade by keeping the value of their currencies low, particularly China.", "The global financial crisis made 2009 a very difficult and negative year for the United States and other developed countries' trade by any measurement metric.

Figure 4 below shows imports and exports of goods and services, both in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). By both measures trade is on the rise in the United States. In 1991 total trade was equal to about 20% of GDP and grew to more than 30% of GDP by 2011.", "While total trade has increased, imports have grown faster than exports, causing an increase in the trade deficit.

At that level, other countries have experienced problems paying for imports and maintaining the value of their currency. Given the \"safe haven\" effect (investors seeking a safe investment) associated with U.S. Treasury securities, however, foreign investors continue to buy U.S. securities. As a result, U.S. interest rates have remained relatively low and the United States remains able to finance the excess of imports over exports. The U.S. trade deficit, however, does cause a weakening of the exchange value of the dollar."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Trade Deficit and the Dollar", "paragraphs": ["Overall U.S. trade deficits reflect a shortage of savings in the domestic economy and a reliance on capital imports to finance that shortfall. A savings shortfall is the analogue of excessive spending that is financed by borrowing. Households borrow for consumption; businesses borrow to invest; and the government borrows to cover its budget deficit. At the international transaction level, the savings shortfall is manifest when foreign capital flows into the United States to pay for its excess of imports (trade deficit).", "Whether this foreign borrowing is beneficial for the U.S. economy depends on how the imports of capital are used. If they are used to finance investments that generate a future return at a sufficiently high rate (they raise future output and productivity), then they may increase the well-being of current and future generations. However, if the imports are used only for current consumption, the net effect of the borrowing will be to shift the burden of repayment to future generations without a corresponding benefit to them.", "U.S. trade balances are macroeconomic variables that may or may not indicate underlying problems with the competitiveness of particular industries. The reason is that overall trade flows are determined, within the framework of institutional barriers to trade and the activities of individual industries, primarily by macroeconomic factors such as rates of growth, savings and investment behavior (including government budget deficits/surpluses), international capital flows, and exchange rates.", "Changes in the trade balance (defined as exports minus imports) are a component in deriving the nation's GDP. In the U.S. economy, where consumer spending and business investment are the largest components of the annual change in economic growth, changes in the trade balance generally reflect changes in these other, much larger, components of the economy. According to GDP accounting, the trade balance can be represented as contributing positively or negatively to the overall rate of growth in the economy, depending on activity in the other components in the accounts. For instance, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when spending by consumers and businesses waned, growth in exports provided a boost to the overall rate of growth in the economy. Again in 2008, when consumer spending and business investment were weak, exports provided a comparatively large contribution to the rate of GDP growth. In 2008, exports accounted for about 9% of the rate of growth in national GDP, compared with the 5.9% contribution recorded in 1990. In 2009, as U.S. GDP declined by 3.5%, exports provided some impetus for growth, primarily due to a 30% drop in imports. The effects of exports, imports, and trade balance exert complex forces on the domestic economy. For instance, a large trade deficit naturally follows a booming economy, as increases in domestic demand lead to more purchases of imported goods.", "Many economists fear that the rising U.S. trade and current account deficits could lead to a large drop in the value of the U.S. dollar. The current account deficit has placed downward pressure on the dollar, although the \"safe haven\" effect comes into play to have the opposite effect. A weaker dollar boosts exports by making them cheaper, narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. Compared to a Federal Reserve index of major currencies weighted by importance to U.S. trade, the dollar has lost nearly one-third of its value since 2002, but has been rising in 2012 (see Figure 5 ). The dollar had fallen against the euro, yen, British pound, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar. In fact, the U.S. dollar fell to parity with the Canadian dollar in September 2007 for the first time in 30 years, but between July and November 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies as the global financial crisis increased \"safe haven demand\" for the dollar. Since November 2009, the dollar lost some value, partly due to the Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates. However, as the Eurozone debt crisis developed in 2010, global investors again sought the safety of U.S. Treasury securities and bid up the price of dollars.", "Although a weakened dollar helps to reduce U.S. trade imbalances, it also may reduce the dollar's attractiveness to foreign investors. If foreign investors stop offsetting the deficit by buying dollar-denominated assets, the value of the dollar could drop\u2014possibly precipitously. In that case, U.S. interest rates would have to rise to attract more foreign investment; financial markets could be disrupted; and inflationary pressures could increase. As shown in Figure 6 , in terms of individual currencies, since January 2008, the dollar has been weakening with respect to the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi but strengthening with respect to the euro and South Korean won.", "Currently, foreign investment in dollar assets along with purchases of securities by investors seeking a safe haven as well as from central banks of countries such as China have bolstered the value of the dollar. China's central bank has intervened in currency markets to keep its exchange rate relatively stable.", "A recent development in foreign country holdings of dollars and other reserve currencies is that some governments are turning toward creating sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). These are funds owned by governments that are invested in stocks, bonds, property, and other financial instruments denominated in dollars, euros, or other hard currency. For China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the oil-exporting nations of the Persian Gulf, the source of capital for these funds is coming from governmental holdings of foreign exchange. For China and Japan, for example, foreign exchange reserves have traditionally been invested by their respective central banks primarily in low-yielding but low-risk government bonds (i.e., U.S. Treasury securities). The purpose of sovereign wealth funds is to diversify investments and to earn a higher rate of return. For example, in September 2007, China created a sovereign wealth fund\u2014the China Investment Corporation (CIC)\u2014with initial capital of $200 billion. Depending on how these funds are managed and what leverage they acquire, they could affect U.S. interest rates (foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities tend to reduce U.S. interest rates), corporate activities (if funds buy significant voting shares of companies), and foreign access to technology and raw materials. The U.S. trade deficit provides some of the foreign exchange that goes to finance these sovereign wealth funds.", "How long can the United States keep running trade deficits? U.S. deficits in trade can continue for as long as foreign investors are willing to buy and hold U.S. assets, particularly government securities and other financial assets. Their willingness depends on a complicated array of factors including the perception of the United States as a safe haven for capital, relative rates of return on investments, interest rates on U.S. financial assets, actions by foreign central banks, and the savings and investment decisions of businesses, governments, and households. The policy levers that influence these factors affecting the trade deficit are held by the Federal Reserve (interest rates) as well as both Congress and the Administration (government budget deficits and trade policy), and their counterpart institutions abroad.", "In the 112 th Congress, legislation directed at the trade deficit has been taking several strategies. Some bills address trade barriers by particular countries, particularly China. Others are aimed at preventing manipulation of exchange rates or at imposing import duties to compensate for the arguably undervalued Chinese currency, as tracked in greater detail by other CRS reports.

Also important is the concept of total merchandise trade, total exports plus total imports. In 2011, total merchandise trade reached $3,688 billion, a 16% increase over the 2010 value. This follows a 22% increase in 2010 (to $3,191 billion) and a 23% decrease in 2009 (to $2,616 billion).", "Merchandise exports in 2011 totaled $1,480 billion, while imports reached $2,208 billion (Census basis).

As shown in Figure 8 , the growth of imports has also been steady, although they too fell by 6.4% in 2001 before recovering in 2002. In 2003, import growth was nearly double export growth, although in 2004, export growth almost caught up with that of imports, and in 2005, the rate of increase for both dropped slightly. Growth in exports and imports slowed in 2007 with exports rising by 12.3% and imports by 5.7%. Likewise in 2008, exports grew faster than imports (12.4% versus 7.3%), but the trade deficit still increased. This is because U.S. imports are greater than U.S. exports, so exports must grow significantly faster than imports just for the deficit to remain constant. Then in 2009, with the full force of the financial crisis, exports decreased more slowly than imports (-17.9% versus -25.9%), before each took a sharp upward turn in 2010 as recovery began. In 2010 exports rose by 21%, followed by a slowing to 16% growth in 2011. U.S. imports grew 23% in 2010 followed by 15% in 2011.

Unilateral transfers are international transfers of funds for which there is no quid pro quo . These include private gifts, remittances, pension payments, and government grants (foreign aid). Data on the current account are announced several months later than those on trade in goods and services.", "Because the merchandise trade balance comprises the greater part of the current account, the two tend to track each other ( Figure 9 ).

Since Americans are such large investors in foreign economies, the United States traditionally also has a surplus in its investment income, $184 billion in 2010 and $227 billion in 2011, but the deficit in unilateral transfers (primarily dollars sent abroad by foreign workers and recent immigrants) totaled $131 billion in 2010 and $133 billion in 2011.

The 2011 deficit on current account, at 3.1% of GDP, closely followed the 2010 deficit on current account of 3.0% of GDP.

Chinese and U.S. trade data differ primarily because of the treatment of Hong Kong as an entrepot . Although Hong Kong reverted back to China in 1997, it is a separate customs area from mainland China, and Beijing counts Hong Kong as the destination for its exports sent there, even though the goods may be transshipped to other markets. For example, China would count a laptop computer that is assembled in Shanghai but shipped through Hong Kong before being exported to the United States as a sale to Hong Kong. By contrast, the United States and many of China's other trading partners count Chinese exports that are transshipped through Hong Kong as products from China, not Hong Kong, including goods that contain Hong Kong components or involve final packaging in Hong Kong. The United States also counts Hong Kong as the destination of U.S. products sent there, even those that are then reexported to China. However, Chinese statistics include many of such reexported goods as U.S. exports to China. So by U.S. figures, U.S. exports to China tend to be understated, while by Chinese figures, Chinese exports to the United States tend to be understated. The net result in 2011, for example, is that the trade surplus with the United States that China reported, $206 billion, was about two-thirds the U.S. deficit with China of $295 billion reported by the United States.", " Table 8 lists the U.S. top deficit trading partners in merchandise trade, on a Census basis, with U.S. export and U.S. import data for additional insight. In 2000, China not only overtook Japan as the top U.S. deficit trading partner, but its continuing growth in annual U.S. trade deficits since 2000 has been notable. In 2011 the U.S. trade deficit with China increased by 8%, with Japan 5%, and fell (became less negative) with Mexico by 3%. These countries were the top U.S. deficit trading partners. They were followed by Germany, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Ireland. ", "Total merchandise trade, exports plus imports, presents a clearer picture of countries' overall importance in U.S. trade relations than any other flow. As seen in Table 9 Canada continues to be the United States' largest total merchandise trading partner. Canada was followed by China, Mexico, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Brazil, and France. Canada was historically the largest supplier of U.S. imports, until 2007 when China's exports to the United States first surpassed those from Canada.

As shown in Figure 11 , in both 2010 and 2011, the United States ran trade surpluses with Australia, Singapore, Chile, Peru, Morocco, Bahrain, Jordan, and collectively with the group of countries in the U.S-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The United States ran deficits with NAFTA partners and Israel in both 2010 and 2011, and with Oman in 2011. Figure 11 also shows the U.S. merchandise trade balance with the three new U.S FTA partners, Colombia, Peru, and South Korea. These three FTAs, however, were not in effect in 2010 or 2011, so the trade balances should not be interpreted as a result of these agreements.", "U.S. FTA partners in total represented 35% of U.S. trade in 2011. Due to Canada and Mexico's great importance in overall U.S. trade, NAFTA alone accounts for over 80% of all U.S. trade with FTA partners. Total U.S. goods trade with Canada and Mexico was over $1 trillion in 2011.

While trade in services, flows of income from investments, and remittances home by foreign workers are considerably smaller than merchandise flows, as the U.S. economy has become more globalized and service-oriented, these components of the current account have become more important. In many cases, the bilateral current account balances are quite different from bilateral balances on merchandise trade only. For example, the U.S. surplus in services and investment income with Canada turns a $38 billion deficit on goods into a $27 billion surplus on current account.", "Flows of investment income vary largely by country. In 2011, the United States had a large investment income surplus with the European Union and Canada, but large investment income deficits with China and Japan. Since Japan has invested considerable amounts in securities, equities, and factories in the United States, the United States ran a deficit of $32 billion in investment income with that country in 2011. This more than offset the surplus of $18 billion in trade in services with Japan. As a result, the current account deficit with Japan of $82 billion in 2011 exceeded the bilateral merchandise trade deficit of $65 billion. Likewise with China; the U.S. deficit on investment income of $33 billion far overshadowed the U.S. surplus of $15 billion in services.", "The rising deficit with many countries in investment income reflects the accumulating debt of the United States relative to various countries and country groups of the world. Inflows of capital to compensate for the U.S. trade deficit and a low U.S. savings rate help to maintain the value of the dollar, but interest paid and other income that accrues to that capital is often repatriated to the home countries. That means more capital must be invested in the United States or the United States must export more to compensate for the outflows of investment income.", "Despite increasing debts, again, in 2011, the United States ran an overall surplus of $227 billion in investment income with the rest of the world. The U.S. surplus in services at $179 billion also continued to grow. The deficit of $133 billion in unilateral transfers reflects the many workers in the United States who remit funds back to their home countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advanced Technology, Transportation, and Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "High Technology Trade", "paragraphs": [" Table 11 shows U.S. trade in advanced technology products.

The U.S. trade balance in high technology products was last in surplus in 2001.", "From 2002 to 2005, the United States ran a trade deficit in high technology products which grew roughly $10 billion dollars per year. In 2006 this deficit dropped to $38 billion, but in 2007 resumed its former growth path, jumping to $61.9 billion. In 2008, the U.S. advanced technology deficit stabilized at $61 billion, in 2009 decreased to $56 billion, and in 2010 jumped to $81 billion. The 2011 deficit then grew to $100 billion. This deficit does not necessarily imply that the United States is losing the high technology race, since many of the high technology imports are from U.S. companies or U.S. corporate affiliates, particularly in information and communications and optoelectronics, who assemble the products overseas.

For example, although the United States has an overall deficit in energy trade, it has a small trade surplus in coal. This surplus offsets the deficits in other energy products, such that the U.S. trade deficit in crude oil ($335 billion) is actually larger than the overall energy trade deficit ($324 billion).
