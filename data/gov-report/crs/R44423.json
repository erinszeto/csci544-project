Many commentators agree that the mission of the CSE program has changed over the years. It began as a program to recover the costs of providing cash welfare (AFDC ) to families with children. The amendments in the 1980s broadened the mission to reflect service delivery to both welfare and non-welfare families. Some commentators assert that the service-delivery goal was reemphasized in the 1996 welfare reform legislation, which established the \"family first\" policy. To help ensure that former welfare recipients stay off the TANF rolls, the \"family first\" policy requires that such families are to receive any child support arrearage payments collected by the state before the state and federal governments retain their share of collections. Moreover, it is widely agreed that since the late 1990s the CSE program has been effective in improving the well-being of families by making child support a more reliable source of income.", "The CSE program provides services to both welfare families (who are automatically enrolled free of charge) and non-welfare families (who must sign up and pay an application fee). Families who have never received welfare must also pay a $25 annual user fee if the CSE agency collects at least $500 per year for them.", "The program provides seven major services on behalf of children: (1) locating absent/noncustodial parents, (2) establishing paternity, (3) establishing child support orders, (4) reviewing and modifying child support orders, (5) collecting child support payments, (6) distributing child support payments, and (7) establishing and enforcing support for children's medical needs. All 50 states and four jurisdictions (the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) operate CSE programs. They are generally operated at the county level of government. In addition, about 60 tribal nations operate CSE programs.", "The CSE program is administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), which is in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The federal government reimburses each state for 66% of all allowable expenditures on CSE activities. The federal government's funding is \"open-ended,\" in that it pays its percentage of expenditures by matching the amounts spent by state and local governments with no upper limit or ceiling. Moreover, states collect child support on behalf of families receiving TANF to reimburse themselves (and the federal government) for the cost of TANF cash payments to the family. Federal law requires families who receive TANF cash assistance to assign their child support rights to the state in order to receive TANF (i.e., child support payments go to the state instead of the family, except for amounts that states choose to \"pass through\" to the family as additional income that does not affect TANF eligibility or benefit amounts). In addition, such families must cooperate with the state if necessary to establish paternity and secure child support. The federal government also gives states an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective CSE programs. Federal law requires states to reinvest CSE incentive payments back into the CSE program or related activities.", "Child support collection methods used by state CSE agencies include income withholding; intercept of federal and state income tax refunds; intercept of unemployment compensation; liens against property; reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus; intercept of lottery winnings; sending insurance settlement information to CSE agencies; authority to withhold or suspend driver's licenses, professional licenses, and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe past-due support; and authority to seize assets of debtor parents held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions. Federal law authorizes the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents. All jurisdictions also have civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws, and federal criminal penalties may be imposed in certain cases. Federal law requires states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) and expand full faith and credit procedures, and it also provides for international enforcement of child support.", "The CSE program has the potential to impact more children and for longer periods of time than most other federal programs. In FY2014, the program served 16.3 million children (22% of the 73.6 million children in the United States). Total CSE expenditures amounted to $5.7 billion and the program collected $28.2 billion in child support payments from noncustodial parents. The CSE program collected $5.25 for every $1 it spent in that year.", "According to Census Bureau data, 29% of custodial families have income below the federal poverty level.

However, it was not until 1950 that the federal government took its first steps into the child support arena.", "Despite legislation in 1950, as well as limited legislation in 1965 (P.L. 89-97) and 1967 (P.L.90-248), the number of families resorting to public welfare (i.e., the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program) continued to increase. By the early 1970s, Congress realized that the composition of the AFDC caseload had changed drastically. In earlier years, the majority of children needed financial assistance because their fathers had died; by the 1970s, the majority needed aid because their parents were separated, divorced, or had never married.", "Up until the mid-1970s, there was a fierce tug-of-war between the federal government and the states over child support. States maintained that child support was a family issue and it should be dealt with in the privacy of the family court system at the local level of government. In contrast, the federal government maintained that the high cost of supporting welfare families who had been abandoned by a parent, usually because fathers were not meeting their financial responsibility to support their children, made it a federal issue.", "In effect, the federal government won the debate. The CSE program was signed into law by President Ford in January 1975 as part of the Social Services Amendments of 1974 ( P.L. 93-647 ). The program was a response by Congress intended to reduce public expenditures on welfare, namely AFDC, by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents on an ongoing basis and by helping nonwelfare families get support so they could stay off welfare. Another goal of the program was to establish paternity for children born outside of marriage so that child support could be obtained for them. The CSE program is considered a federal-state program because it is financed in part by the federal government with federal rules and regulations but it is operated by the states.", "The chief sponsor of the 1975 CSE legislation was Senator Russell Long, who was at the time the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. During the debate on the CSE legislation, Senator Long stated:", "Should our welfare system be made to support the children whose father cavalierly abandons them\u2014or chooses not to marry the mother in the first place? Is it fair to ask the American taxpayer\u2014who works hard to support his own family and, to carry his own burden\u2014to carry the burden of the deserting father as well? Perhaps we cannot stop the father from abandoning his children, but we can certainly improve the system by obtaining child support from him and thereby place the burden of caring for his children on his own shoulders where it belongs. We can\u2014and we must\u2014take the financial reward out of desertions.", "President Ford expressed \"reservations\" when he signed the enacting legislation. While supporting the objectives of the amendments, he contended that certain provisions \"go too far by injecting the Federal Government into domestic relations.\" He complained of \"serious privacy and administrative issues,\" and promised to propose legislation to correct defects.", "In subsequent years, as Congress made changes to the CSE program, many presidents expressed support for holding parents accountable with respect to financially taking care of their children. Ten years after President Ford expressed his reservations regarding the CSE program, such concerns had for all intents and purposes disappeared. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, P.L. 98-378 , were passed by the House unanimously on November 16, 1983, and by the Senate unanimously on April 24, 1984. The 1984 amendments had a wide range of support from such groups as the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, American Public Welfare Association, National Council of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators, National Governor's Association, and National Women's Law Center. Representative Barbara Kennelly, the sponsor of the bill, remarked during the House debate on the amendments that the reason traditionalists and feminists could support the bill was because both groups agreed that parents should take responsibility for their children seriously.", "When President Reagan signed the amendments into law on August 16, 1984, he hailed them as \"legislation that will give children the helping hand they need.\" He also stated:", "The goal of our efforts is not just the transfer of funds. We also hope to discourage abandonment and, if families do split up, to encourage the absent parents to invest time and love in their children. Permitting individuals to ignore parental obligations and giving the bill to the taxpayers in the form of higher welfare costs have been tantamount to a stamp of approval. And this is not the kind of message public policy should be sending out.", "Four years later when President Reagan signed the Family Support Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-485 ), into law, he said that the legislation represented:", "the culmination of more than 2 years of effort and responds to the call in my 1986 State of the Union Message for real welfare reform\u2014reform that will lead to lasting emancipation from welfare dependency.\u2026 First, the legislation improves our system for securing support from absent parents.", "In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-193 ) into law. He stated:", "The bill I'm about to sign, as I have said many times, is far from perfect, but it has come a very long way. Congress sent me two previous bills that I strongly believe failed to protect our children and did too little to move people from welfare to work. I vetoed both of them. This bill had broad bipartisan support and is much, much better on both counts.", "He also said:", "It includes the tough child support enforcement measures that, as far as I know, every Member of Congress and everybody in the administration and every thinking person in the country has supported for more than 2 years now. It's the most sweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents in history. We have succeeded in increasing child support collection 40 percent, but over a third of the cases where there's delinquencies involve people who cross State lines. For a lot of women and children, the only reason they're on welfare today\u2014the only reason\u2014is that the father up and walked away when he could have made a contribution to the welfare of the children. That is wrong. If every parent paid the child support that he or she owes legally today, we could move 800,000 women and children off welfare immediately. With this bill we say, if you don't pay the child support you owe, we'll garnish your wages, take away your driver's license, track you across State lines, if necessary, make you work off what you pay\u2014what you owe. It is a good thing, and it will help dramatically to reduce welfare, increase independence, and reinforce parental responsibility.", "In 1998, President Clinton signed the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-187 ) into law. He stated:", "This bill today is a gift to our children and the future. The quiet crisis of unpaid child support is something that our country and our families shouldn't tolerate. Our first responsibility, all of us, is to our children. And today we all know that too many parents still walk away from that obligation. That threatens the education, the health of our children, and the future of our country.... The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 deals with child support evaders in the most serious cases. From now on if you flee across State lines and refuse to pay child support you may be charged with a Federal offense, a felony offense, and may land in jail for up to 2 years. One way or the other people who don't support their children will pay what they must.", "Less than one month later, President Clinton signed the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-200 ) into law. He stated:", "H.R. 3130 will build on this progress and help ensure that parents give their children all the support they need and deserve. First, the new law puts in place additional tough penalties for States that fail to automate their child support computer systems on time. Under this new law, States that fail to establish these State-wide systems face automatic and escalating penalties, ranging from 4 percent of Federal child support enforcement funds for the first year to 30 percent for the fifth year in which a State fails to meet national certification standards. Second, H.R. 3130 incorporates a proposal that my Administration sent to the Congress last year to reward States for their performance on a wide range of key child support goals, such as the number of paternity establishments and child support orders, rather than only on cost-effectiveness, as current law provides. Third, the law will make it easier for States to secure medical support for children in cases in which the non-custodial parent has private health coverage, by facilitating the creation of a medical support notice that all health plans will recognize.", "Since its enactment in 1975, almost 50 laws have made changes to the CSE program.
