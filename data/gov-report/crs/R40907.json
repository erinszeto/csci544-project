", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA 89, P.L. 101-239 ) created the RB-RVS-based Medicare fee schedule, which went into effect January 1, 1992. Under the RB-RVS fee schedule, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) assigns relative value units (RVUs) that reflect physician work (i.e., time, skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service), practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The adjusted relative values are then multiplied by a conversion factor to derive the actual payment amount in dollars. Medicare pays providers the lesser of the actual charge for the service or the allowed amount under the fee schedule.", "Expenditure targets have been a factor in the calculation of Medicare physician payment updates since the current fee schedule was first implemented in 1992. In the first year, one overall conversion factor was used to calculate the update. Then, two (surgical and non-surgical services) and eventually three conversion factors were used for different categories of services (surgical, primary care, and other nonsurgical services). However, under the Medicare Volume Performance Standard (MVPS) method, targets were set (and typically exceeded) each year; there was no cumulative goal and no significant consequence to exceeding the expenditure target. The current SGR method for calculating annual updates was created partly in response to the shortcomings of the prior method."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Updates and the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) System", "paragraphs": ["The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97, P.L. 105-33 ) replaced the MVPS with the SGR, with the objective of creating a sustainable growth path for Part B expenditures. First, BBA97 added cumulative spending criteria that resulted in actual consequences for failing to meet expenditure targets; beginning with April 1, 1996, as the starting point, actual program expenditures are compared to growth targets to determine annual updates. Second, BBA 97 introduced the rate of growth in the per capita amount of the gross domestic product (GDP) into the SGR calculation and also provided for the use of a single conversion factor instead of three. By tying the expenditure targets to the growth in GDP per capita, this system attempted to hold Medicare physician expenditures to a level that would not consume an ever-increasing share of national income.", "The SGR system was established because of the concern that the Medicare fee schedule itself would not adequately constrain overall increases in spending for physicians' services. While the fee schedule limits the amount that Medicare will pay for each service, there are no limits on the volume or mix of services. The SGR system was intended to serve as a restraint on aggregate spending. While the SGR targets are not limits on expenditures, they represent a \"sustainable\" trajectory for cumulative spending on Medicare physician services from April 1996 forward. The annual fee schedule update thus reflects the success or failure in meeting the goal. If expenditures over a period are less than the cumulative spending target for the period, the update is increased. However, if spending exceeds the cumulative spending target over a certain period, the update for a future year is reduced, with the goal to bring spending back in line with the target.", "Since the conversion factor applies to all services, the update to the conversion factor is the key component for determining how reimbursements change from year to year.

In the longer run, as the population ages and the number of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries increases, this should increase the target rate of allowed expenditures. ", "Prior to 2003, the SGR formula included as a component the annual rate of growth in the economy (i.e., the growth in inflation-adjusted GDP per capita). From 1997 through 2000, per capita GDP grew faster than Part B expenditures, at more than 4% annually; Part B expenditures were relatively stable from 1996 to 1998 and then started to increase in 1999 and 2000. However, economic growth slowed at the turn of the century, while Part B expenditures grew at a faster rate from 2000 on. Thus, the relative health of the economy effectively masked the increases in total Part B expenditures for the first few years under the SGR system, but as the economy slowed and expenditures continued to increase, the updates as determined under the SGR system turned negative in order to bring projected actual expenditures back in line with target expenditures. To remove some of the volatility in the target from cyclical economic changes, the Medicare Modernization Act ( P.L. 108-173 ) changed the measure to a (10-year moving average) real GDP per capita growth rate. ", "Beginning in CY2010, there was a technical adjustment to the calculation of the SGR relating to how physician services are measured. Specifically, physicians have argued that physician-administered drugs (which are reimbursed under Part B) should be excluded from the calculation of expenditures subject to the SGR because physicians have no control or influence on the price of these drugs. To address this issue, CMS changed the measurement of physician services to exclude physician-administered drugs from the calculation of allowed and actual expenditures beginning in CY2010 and all subsequent years. For comparison purposes, they also calculated cumulative allowed and actual physician-expenditures excluding physician-administered drugs for all prior years as well (see Figure 1 ). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that removal of physician-administered drugs from the target should reduce the difference between actual and targeted spending in the future as spending for physician-administered drugs has historically grown faster than physician services.

Use of both the prior year adjustment component and the cumulative adjustment component allows any deviation between cumulative actual expenditures and cumulative allowed expenditures to be corrected over several years rather than a single year. As provided under Section 1848(d)(3)(D) of the Social Security Act, the adjustment factor cannot be less than minus 7% or more than plus 3%. Thus, despite calculations which would have led to larger reductions, the UAF adjustment has been minus 7% for the last several years. The caps on the adjustment limit the annual reduction or increase. Thus, the gap between cumulative actual spending and cumulative allowed spending grows larger each year and is exacerbated whenever Congress overrides the reductions, since the targets are never modified under current law."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Historical Updates and Legislative Overrides", "paragraphs": ["Under the update formula, if actual expenditures do not exceed target expenditures, the update generally would be positive and payments would increase for all services under the fee schedule subject to the single conversion factor. In the first few years of the SGR system, the actual expenditures did not exceed the targets. Figure 1 shows the difference between the cumulative actual allowed (i.e., the target) and cumulative actual expenditures for two different measures of physician services. Prior to 2010, physician services included physician-administered drugs, which resulted in a larger difference between the cumulative targeted expenditures and the cumulative actual. As a consequence, cumulative actual expenditures exceeded the cumulative target expenditures for the first time in the first quarter of 2005 when physician-administered drugs are excluded, as opposed to the second quarter of 2002 when the drugs are included (as shown in Figure 1 ). Under this measure, the updates to the physician fee schedule were close to the MEI in the first two years (2.3% in 1998 and 1999, compared with MEI of 2.2% in 1998 and 2.3% in 1999). For the next two years, in 2000 and 2001, the actual physician fee schedule update was more than twice the MEI for those years (5.5% update vs. MEI of 2.4% in 2000, 5.0% update vs. MEI of 2.1% in 2001).

By excluding physician-administered drugs, the difference between actual and targeted expenditures (the solid line in Figure 1 ) is not as large. ", "The most significant consequence of exceeding the target consistently since 2002 is that the SGR formula dictates a reduction in the physician fee schedule to recoup the overage. However, beginning in 2003, Congress repeatedly passed legislation that has overridden the cuts (see Table 1 ) . Greater details about these legislative changes can be found in the Appendix . ", "Despite the change in the measurement of physician services, the consequences of exceeding the target and subsequent legislative overrides would have led to a projected reduction in the conversion factor due to the SGR calculation of 20.1% beginning January 2014.

Congress will need to address the situation again before the end of March 2015 when the override is due to expire.", "In addition to overriding the payment reductions, Congress has also included provisions in several of the laws to increase Medicare physician payments in other ways. For example, Congress has altered the geographic adjustment factor for physician work, one component used in making regional adjustments to payments under the physician fee schedule. MMA set a floor on the work geographic adjustment index at 1.0 for 2004-2006, thereby slightly increasing the payment amounts in some areas. This floor has been extended multiple times, most recently by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240 ), which maintained the floor through 2013, and the Pathway for SGR Reform Act ( H.J.Res. 59 ), which extended the floor through March 31, 2014.", "Some of the bills also modified the cap on the conversion factor, which has led to the current situation where the consequence of not overriding the reduction would lead to cuts in excess of the 7% cap. TRHCA specified that the override of the reduction that would have been implemented under the statutory formula was to be treated as if it did not occur. Therefore, the starting base for the 2008 calculation was 5% below the actual 2007 conversion factor. MMSEA overrode the reduction for the first six months of 2008 and provided for a 0.5% increase for that period. However, the legislation again specified that the override of the statutory formula was to be treated as if it did not occur.

In addition, any permanent change would likely be quite costly because the CBO baseline must assume current law, which estimates that a reduction in the conversion factor will occur for the next several years. In addition to the impact on federal outlays, any change in the update formula will also have implications for beneficiaries; because Part B beneficiary premiums must cover about 25% of Part B program costs, any overall increase in spending results in a proportional increase in premiums. Suggested modifications have ranged from modifying the current formula to replacing the formula and linking updates to payment adequacy and/or quality measures.

The first approach emphasizes stable fee updates, while the second automatically adjusts fee updates if spending growth deviates from a predetermined target. GAO stated that \"the choice between the two approaches may hinge on whether primary consideration should be given to stable fee increases or to the need for fiscal discipline within the Medicare program.\" The second approach would end targets as an explicit measure for moderating spending growth.

Providing separate targets attempts to address, among other things, the criticism that the current update calculation penalized (or rewarded) all physicians identically regardless of the individual's or the specialty's contribution towards meeting or exceeding the aggregate expenditure target. Some physicians and health care professionals are able to increase volume to offset declining reimbursement rates while others are not. For example, even though imaging services have grown faster than other types of physician services (including evaluation and management services, tests, major procedures, and other procedures) the resulting impact on the annual update factor applies to all services across all specialties.", "As shown in Table 2 , H.R. 3162 , the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007 (CHAMP), was introduced in the 110 th Congress and includes six expenditure targets. Some have raised concern that too many expenditure targets may not be appropriate since the targets do not distinguish between the appropriateness of certain services. For example, some of the increase in imaging services may have allowed for the earlier detection of disease conditions such as cancer, which may have produced savings for other services and specialties (e.g., nuclear medicine and oncology services). Thus, the second approach in H.R. 3961 , the Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009 (111 th Congress), would only have had two expenditure categories: (1) evaluation, management, and preventive services; and (2) all other services. This approach would distinguish between primary care and non-primary care services and would be similar to the MedPAC proposal discussed below. One rationale for this approach is to improve access to primary care providers. As noted earlier, the greatest threat to access over the next decade is concentrated in primary care services.", "Most proposed changes to the SGR would also change the base year in the calculation of future expenditure targets (essentially starting over), which could increase overall physician expenditures allowed in the baseline. One issue to consider with any proposals that increase total spending on physician services (by rebasing and changing the expenditure targets) is that the impact of the proposal would be felt not only by physicians but also by other parts of the Medicare program, the Department of Defense TRICARE program, and beneficiaries under Medicare Part B. Not only would physician reimbursements under the Medicare physician fee schedule increase, but expenditures under the Medicare Advantage (MA) program would increase because per beneficiary spending for fee-for-service beneficiaries would increase as a result of the bill, raising the \"benchmarks\" that Medicare uses to determine the capitation payments for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. TRICARE expenditures would rise because its physician reimbursements are based on Medicare's physician fee schedule.

Earlier reports to Congress from MedPAC have included recommendations for updating payments for physicians' services based on the estimated change in input prices for the coming year less an adjustment for savings attributable to increased productivity. Specifically, input prices would be measured using the MEI (without regard to the CMS adjustment for productivity increases). The recommended productivity adjustment would be used across all provider services.", "On several occasions, MedPAC has sent to Congress specific recommendations for addressing the SGR and Medicare physician payments. The recommendations acknowledge the criticisms of the SGR system as well as the concern that beneficiary access to providers willing to accept Medicare patients may be affected in coming years should the uncertainty about fee schedule reimbursements continue.

The freeze on reimbursement rates for primary care services would apply only to those service codes. Thus, a primary care provider could provide some services where the reimbursement rates would be frozen as a result of the MedPAC proposal and other services where the reimbursement rates would be subject to a decrease. Similarly, two different physicians could bill for the same code, yet one could be paid at the frozen reimbursement rate while the other would be paid at a reduced rate.

Section 601 of the act averted the SGR-determined reduction and maintained the Medicare physician fee schedule payments at then-current rates through December 31, 2013. ", "Each of the three committees of jurisdiction passed bills in 2013 that would repeal the SGR system (see Table 2 ). On July 22, 2013, the Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 2810 , the Medicare Patient Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2013, by a 51-0 vote. On December 12, 2013, the Senate Finance Committee passed S. 1871 , the SGR Repeal and Medicare Beneficiary Access Improvement Act of 2013, by unanimous voice vote, and the Ways and Means Committee passed H.R. 2810 , the Medicare Patient Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2013.", "While there are differences among the three bills, they share several overarching concepts. First, each of the bills would provide an initial period of payment stability: the Energy and Commerce bill would increase MPFS payments by 0.5% each year from 2014 to 2018, the Senate Finance Committee bill would freeze the payments (0% increase) for 10 years from 2014 to 2023, and the Ways and Means bill would increase payments by 0.5% in 2015 and 2016. Second, they each establish the development of new payment systems while maintaining fee-for-service payment in a manner similar to the existing system. Third, they each create incentives for physicians to transition to the new payment systems over time, generally by establishing different rates of increase over time for the new payment systems compared to fee-for-service. The bills also vary in which non-SGR provisions are included; S. 1871 includes several health care and human service program extenders (including the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs), while H.R. 2810 as reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee includes provisions that would modify evidentiary rules and practices regarding medical malpractice claims. None of these bills include budgetary offsets.", "The CBO scores for each of the three bills reflect a range of costs, with Title I of the Senate bill (dealing with the SGR) adding $111.5 billion to direct federal spending from 2014 to 2023, while H.R. 2810 as considered by the Ways and Means Committee would add $121 billion. CBO initially scored H.R. 2810 as reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee as adding $175 billion over the same period, but revised the figure to $146 billion, reflecting subsequently enacted legislation as well as modifications specified in the physician fee schedule final rule for 2014.", "On December 26, 2013, the President signed into law H.J.Res. 59 , which included the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Division A) and the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 (Division B).

H.R. 4015 / S. 2000 propose five years of 0.5% payment increases for the Medicare physician fee schedule before freezing payments at that level for five additional years. Changes to the payment level in subsequent years would be determined by many factors, including participation in alternative payment models and provider performance in the newly created Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for those who choose to remain in the fee-for-service payment system. MIPS would subsume some of the current physician payment incentives (e.g., the meaningful use criteria for electronic health records and the value-based payment modifier), while others would be sunset (e.g., certain quality reporting incentives). As an incentive for providers to choose to participate in alternate payment models, payment rate increases would be greater for APMs (1.0% per year beginning in 2024) than for the FFS/MIPS system (0.5% per year beginning in 2024). CBO has scored these identical bills as adding $138.4 billion to direct spending from 2014 to 2024 (11 years, rather than the typical 10).", "On March 14, 2014, the House passed H.R. 4015 , with an amendment submitted by Chairman Camp.

The CBO scored the amended version of H.R. 4015 as reducing direct federal spending by $31.1 billion over the 11 years from 2014 to 2024, as the delay of the individual mandate penalty would reduce spending by $169.5 billion, more than offsetting the direct cost of the SGR repeal and replace provisions.
