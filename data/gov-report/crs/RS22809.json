The resulting transfer of state power from one political party to another, a historically uncommon occurrence in post-independence sub-Saharan Africa, signified Ghana's further maturation as a democracy following a transition from \"no-party\" rule that began in 1992, and provided a sharp contrast to recent counter-democratic developments in Africa. Ghana was chosen for the trip, presidential African affairs aide Michelle Gavin stated, because the election had demonstrated that \"Ghana is a truly admirable example of a place where governance is getting stronger, a thriving democracy,\" in contrast to multiple other African countries.", "The keystone of the president's trip to Ghana was a speech to the Ghanaian parliament.

The overarching theme of the speech was on the need, in Africa particularly, for \"strong institutions and a strong will\" in order to ensure \"democracy, opportunity, health, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.\" ", "The speech focused, in particular, on the importance of good governance and the need to institutionalize of a vibrant and collaborative interplay between elected officials, the three main branches of government, voters, the press, civil society and private sector businesses in achieving such ends. The speech also highlighted the importance of anti-corruption efforts and transparency, and focused on the key role played by national self determination and achievement in attaining socio-economic and political development, in contrast to donor-led development. President Obama also referred to the need for careful management of Ghana's energy revenues, and the \"undeniable peril and extraordinary promise\" of oil and other energy resources for development. He also highlighted his Administration's emphasis on U.S. assistance to Africa in such areas as education, healthcare, and trade capacity-building, and its commitment to \"public-private partnerships that invest in better roads and electricity; capacity-building that trains people to grow a business; financial services that reach not just the cities but also the poor and rural areas.\"", "In contextualizing the Africa portion of President Obama's trip in relation to his preceding visit to Russia and Italy, Ms. Gavin characterized the Ghana visit as \"quite intentional.\" She said it was meant to underscore \"the point that Africa is integrated broadly into\" the Administration's foreign policy strategy and that \"African voices are an important part of global discussions on key global issues.\" She and other briefers highlighted African governments' participation in a number of meetings at the G8 summit that immediately preceded the President's trip to Ghana. Gavin also drew a correlation between the issue themes discussed at the summit and policy challenges faced by African countries, such as a need for economic resilience, a capacity to weather the current economic downturn, achieve socio-economic development goals, as well as global issues, such as climate change\u2014and what she characterized as the underlying importance of good governance in successfully addressing them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mills Administration", "paragraphs": ["President Mills took office on January 7, 2009, succeeding former President Kufuor at the end of his second term in office.

Mills's election was viewed by some as a test of the depth of democratization in Africa, following highly contested, volatile elections in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria, and a range of other democratic challenges elsewhere on the continent. The election signified Ghana's further maturation as a democracy following a transition from \"no-party\" rule, beginning in 1992, by a government that initially came to power in a coup d'\u00e9tat.

In 2004, he again triumphed over Atta Mills, winning 52% of votes in a poll that was generally calm, peaceful, and transparent, though marred by limited violence.", "The 2008 election campaign was contested vigorously but was reportedly largely peaceful, with a few highly localized exceptions. While ethnic tensions occur in Ghana, regional rivalries and disparities are sometimes viewed in ethnic terms, and voting tends to occur in ethnic blocs, Ghana generally enjoys inter-ethnic harmony, and overt ethnic antagonism does not appear to have played a key role in the election. ", "Focal electoral issues included public dissatisfaction over electricity and water shortages, rising food, fuel, and utility prices, and reports of corruption. Recent economic expansion and prospective oil revenue-fueled growth, however, were seen as benefitting the NPP, as were divisions in the NDC, from which a dissenting faction broke away to form a new splinter party.

Former Foreign Affairs Minister Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo won the NPP nomination in the first round of voting, surprising some observers, given that President Kufuor had reportedly favored another candidate. The NPP nomination process drew some criticism because the $25,000 party nomination fee, in a country with an average income of about $520, was seen as barring contenders who lacked wealth or could not raise large amounts of cash to rally support.

Key problems highlighted at the time of the vote reportedly included temporary shortages of voting materials at some polling places, along with limited, minor allegations of irregularities, mainly in two constituencies, Asutifi South and Akwatia. Some observers analyzing the election over the longer term, however, have contended that there were also other, potentially more serious, problems. These included lack of sufficient investigation of possible anomalies, such as an alleged \"inflated voters' register\" linked to \"implausibly high turnout\" in some areas, among other possible indications of limited but \"serious malpractices and electoral fraud,\" and some reports of intimidation of party poll observers in constituencies dominated by their rival party. There was also a possibly politically motivated effort to disenfranchise selected voters as a result of a selective closure of Ghana's borders. Despite such problems, many observers attribute the election's overall success to adherence to the rule of law regarding the electoral process, in large part as a result of widespread public support for that end, which politicians by and large appear to have heeded, albeit sometimes under pressure from party or national leaders. Efforts to legally challenge selected polling processes or results after the first round, which could have prompted a drawn out, potentially volatile contestation of the vote, were ultimately abandoned\u2014reportedly, in part, in response to a call by then-incumbent President Kufuor for all candidates to respect the results of the voting process.", "In the initial presidential vote, John Mills of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party won almost 48% of votes. His main rival, former Foreign Affairs Minister Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the NPP, President Kufuor's party and the then-majority party, won just over 49% of votes.

These results failed to decide the election, however, because incorrect allocations of voting materials were delivered to one constituency, Tain District, potentially disenfranchising voters. This discrepancy prompted the Electoral Commission to order a repeat of runoff balloting in Tain, an outcome that conferred on the district's 53,000 or so voters the potential power to decide the outcome of the race. The Tain vote garnered international attention, given the closeness of the election and because it prolonged the vote and the potential that the outcome would be contested and potentially lead to political volatility.

Rawlings had first come to power in a 1979 military coup, after which elections were held. He led a second military coup in 1981, establishing a populist, reform-oriented ruling civil-military entity, the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC). The PNDC coup followed 15 years of coups d'\u00e9tat and a string of military-dominated, often corrupt governments that ruled after the military ousted Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first elected Prime Minister, in 1966. He was toppled shortly after he transformed Ghana into a one-party state. Nkrumah, famous advocate of African unity and socialism, led Ghana to independence from Britain in 1957. Ghana celebrated its 50 th year of independence in 2007.", "Kufuor's first-term agenda emphasized efforts to bolster national unity and social equity after the 2000 election; to fight reportedly widespread corruption; to reassert the rule of law; and to revive a flagging economy. Upon taking office, he faced diverse poor economic indicators: flat growth; currency deflation; poor or declining prices for key commodity exports (gold and cocoa); high inflation, interest, and unemployment; and dependence on foreign aid. Kufuor vowed to tackle these problems aggressively, but faced a roughly evenly party-divided legislature and a NDC-dominated bureaucracy. He met these challenges by taking steps to privatize state firms, diversify the economy, increase Ghana's world market access, and pursue politically difficult fiscal austerity policies, measures which he pursued in his second term in office.

While initial press reports suggested that the bid was a strong one, it was rebuffed by Kosmos, which reiterated that it was committed to staying on as an oil producing firm in Ghana, rather than selling its stakes. It is not clear why the offer was refused, given that it was significantly higher than the Exxon Mobil deal that Kosmos had recently so strongly supported. One possibility has been suggested by press accounts that report that the value of Kosmos's assets may be significantly higher than $5 billion. A September 2010 recent research opinion report regarding Anadarko Petroleum's stake in Jubilee, which is equal to that of Kosmos, is said to indicate that the Anadarko asset\u2014and, by implication, Kosmos's holdings\u2014is worth an estimated $6.75 billion. In addition, ongoing discovery evaluations and finds by Tullow and other firms suggest that the estimated value of Kosmos's assets may rise. Kosmos, which reportedly faces capital gains tax losses if it does not sell its assets before Jubilee production begins and could face a changed earnings environment if Ghanaian laws are altered, may also be attempting to elicit a higher bidding price by negotiating a possible initial public offering with Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup. Such a strategy may also be intended \"to placate [Kosmos] private equity backers Blackstone and Warburg Pincus, both of which are keen to recover their investments.\" The GNPC, by contrast, has incentives to see a lower price, both because the \"higher the price the new entrant pays [\u2026] the more the new owner can claim in costs and so reduce its liabilities for the additional petroleum tax\" and because a lower price would make a GNPC buyout less costly to Ghana and/or its financial backers.
