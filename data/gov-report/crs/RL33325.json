The top four firms slaughtered 69% of all U.S. cattle in 2006. In 1985, the then-top four packers accounted for 39% of all cattle slaughter, according to industry and USDA statistics. Since 2007, however, some approved and planned acquisitions in the beef packing sector could further alter these statistics. In the beef sector, one company now accounts for a large and growing share of the market and may push the four-firm concentration ratio in this sector to as much as 75%. Live hog production has seen sweeping changes over the past 25 years. Four firms slaughtered 64% of all U.S. hogs in 2006, compared with 32% in 1985. The number of U.S. farms with hogs has declined sharply, and those remaining have become much larger and less diversified. Many hogs today are sold through production contracts, where a pork processor might provide the pigs and other inputs, and a contracting producer (farmer) provides facilities and labor.", "Debate has revolved around the impacts of such changes on farm prices, consumers, global competitiveness, and the traditional U.S. system of independent farms and ranches. Inherent in these questions is the role government should play in monitoring and regulating agricultural markets. Some groups believe that federal officials have not enforced existing laws designed to prevent anti-competitive behavior, and/or that the laws themselves should be strengthened to better address today's market realities.

Laws such as the Packers and Stockyards (P&S) Act of 1921 were enacted specifically to address concerns in the livestock and poultry sectors. Other laws, such as the 1967 Agricultural Fair Practices Act (AFPA), were enacted to provide protection to producers from buyers of their products.

These include provisions that change AFPA definitions of associations and handlers and require USDA to issue rules and specify requirements regarding breach of contract and the venue for any litigation. The farm bill also requires USDA to issue an annual report detailing investigations into possible violations under the P&S Act.

The \"four-firm concentration ratio,\" which measures the four largest firms' share of total shipment values, is commonly cited as a summary indicator of concentration and overall structural change in the industry. As shown Figure 1 , the four-firm concentration ratio for cattle and hog slaughter indicates that, over time, the top four firms are accounting for a growing share of the overall market (based on slaughter volumes). Four-firm concentration ratios from 1963 to 2004 rose from 26% to 72% of the cattle slaughtered, and from 33% to 66% of all hogs slaughtered. Continued consolidation and recent mergers could raise these concentration ratios even more, particularly in the beef sector.", "Although observations about concentration and vertical integration are often ascribed to the meat and poultry sectors as a whole, individual production and marketing segments within these sectors do differ in how they are structured and function. The following discussion focuses primarily on the beef and pork industries, with some limited information for poultry production focused mostly on broiler meat. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Beef Production", "paragraphs": ["Most U.S. beef cattle are born, bred, and pastured on a large number of widely dispersed, often small-sized farms and ranches, called cow-calf operators. These operators keep some heifer calves from each year's crop for breeding herd replacement; the rest generally are sold at from 6 to 12 months of age to feedlots (or sometimes to an intermediary known as a backgrounder who readies them for feedlots). These lots fatten them to slaughter weight and sell them to the packing houses.", "Overall, the trend in U.S. agriculture is toward fewer, larger farms. This is also true in the beef industry: the number of beef operations has declined dramatically over the past few decades, and the largest operations now account for a growing share of total marketings. Still, operations with small herd sizes continue to provide calves to feedlots and backgrounding operations, and despite concentration in larger operations, the cattle sector remains structurally diverse.", "Cattle feeding has also become more concentrated into larger feedlots, fewer facilities, and fewer states. A relatively small number of feedlots now fatten and market a significant portion of fed cattle (those ready for slaughter). In 2008, the top 10 companies had the capacity to feed more than 3.2 million cattle in 58 feedlots, representing about one-fourth of all cattle on feed on January 1, 2008 (at facilities with 1,000+ capacity feedlots). At these larger facilities, the top 30 operations account for nearly one-half of all cattle on feed. There were 2,170 feedlots with 1,000+ capacity in 2006. Feedlots with a one-time capacity of less than 1,000 head still account for a large share (about 95%) of all U.S. feedlots, but these facilities account for a small share (less that 10%) of annual marketings. Cattle feeding is now concentrated in the middle part of the country, where five states marketed 80% of all fed cattle: Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and California. Beef cow facilities are more widely dispersed, but also tend to be located in the central states.", "Meatpacking is more concentrated than the production phase. Since the 1970s, the number of meatpacking plants has decreased from nearly 2,500 plant to 1,400 plants in 1992. In meat processing, the number of facilities remained more or less unchanged. Concentration in meatpacking has increased: In 1985, the then-top four firms claimed 50% of all steer/heifer slaughter and 39% of all cattle slaughter; by 2007, four firms slaughtered 84% of all young cattle (steers and heifers), and 72% of U.S. cattle of all types. Recent concentration numbers approach those of the early 1900s, when 50% to 75% of the market was dominated by five firms that slaughtered several species.", "Another way the federal government weighs concentration is the so-called Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is considered to be a more comprehensive measurement than the four-firm percentage cited above. An industry with an HHI below 1,000 is considered to be unconcentrated. An industry with an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 is considered to be moderately concentrated; an HHI above 1,800 is highly concentrated. The beef packing industry reached the highly concentrated level by the mid 1990s; its 2004 HHI was 1,900.", " Table 1 shows the market shares and related information for the top U.S. packers and feeding companies based on available data.", "Market concentration in the U.S. beef sector could increase considerably following a series of mergers and acquisitions starting in 2007. In July 2007, JBS\u2014a Brazilian company regarded as the world's largest meat processor\u2014purchased the U.S. beef processor Swift & Co., then the third-largest U.S. beef processing company. In February and March 2008, JBS signed agreements to acquire the fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. beef packers, National Beef Packing Company and the Smithfield Beef Group, respectively. These planned acquisitions have undergone customary regulatory review by the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Antitrust Division. In October 2008, DOJ and 13 states filed a complaint in U.S. District Court to block the JBS buyout of National Beef Packing Company, citing concerns that it could contribute to higher consumer prices and also to lower producer prices. That same day DOJ announced it would not challenge the JBS acquisition of Smithfield Beef Group, which was later purchased by JBS.", "Some in Congress publicly applauded DOJ's lawsuit; opinion within the U.S. meat industry is mixed. If the DOJ lawsuit is not successful and JBS acquires National Beef in addition to Smithfield, this could raise the JBS combined share of the U.S. commercial cattle slaughter market to about 30%, assuming it does not divest some facilities. JBS's acquisition of Five Rivers Ranch Cattle Feeding, which was part of the Smithfield deal, made JBS the largest cattle feeder in the United States.

These integrators contract with independent farmers to \"grow out\" broiler chicks to market weight, and to produce replacement breeder hens for hatcheries. This relationship is formalized under a production contract, whereby the integrator provides the farmer/grower with chicks, feed, and veterinary and transportation services, while the farmer provides labor, capital in the form of housing and equipment, and utilities. Typically, the birds are sent to slaughter after five to nine weeks on the farm, and the farmer is paid for its growing services.", "Among broiler processors, market shares for the top four U.S. companies accounted for nearly three-fourths of all broiler meat processed in 2007 ( Table 2 ). Broiler production is more highly concentrated within the area between Delaware, Georgia, and Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas.

Supply chains bypass traditional commodity markets and rely on contractual arrangements among the chain participants to manage the transformation of livestock on the farm to meat in the cooler.\"", "This business model was pioneered in agriculture by the poultry industry, which began to integrate shortly after World War II. Poultry producers were \"the clear leader\" in delivering nutritional and convenient products to consumers while at the same time sharply controlling costs, according to Barkema. The hog industry has been closely following in poultry's footsteps. Now typical are contract production arrangements with large integrators who may provide the genetics, pigs and other inputs, and a contracting producer (farmer) who provides facilities and labor. These arrangements take the form of agricultural contracts or agreements between farmers and their commodity buyers that are reached before harvest or the completion of a livestock production stage.

Contracts enable a farmer to shift some financial risk to the buyer, cushion widely fluctuating price swings, and guarantee an outlet for production.

Consumers also benefit through lower prices, consistently higher quality, and a wider array of convenient products, it is argued. \"The growth in contracting has come largely at the expense of spot (or cash) markets, where farmers retain full autonomy and receive prices based on prevailing market conditions and product attributes at the time of sale,\" USDA observes. It distinguishes two types:", "Production contracts are when the farmer provides a service to the contractor who usually owns the commodity. The farmer's payment may resemble a fee for service rather than a payment for the commodity's value. For example, in poultry production, processing companies provide the chicks, feed, veterinary services, transportation and production specifications to farmers who raise the chicks for the companies, usually in facilities the farmers own. Marketing contracts emphasize the value of the commodity rather the farmer's services. They can specify in advance the basis for the price that will be paid, the quantity to be delivered and where, and product attributes, but the farmer retains major management control and ownership of the commodity until delivery.", "In 2005, contracts (production or marketing) covered 50% of all livestock production value, up from 33% in 1991-1993.

Use of contracts in cattle production has been more or less constant at about 20%.
