The term \"deeming resolution\" is not officially defined, nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation. Instead, the use of a deeming resolution simply represents the House and Senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis.", "The form and content of a deeming resolution is not prescribed, so it may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand.

This report deals largely with the seven years in which the House and Senate did not reach final agreement on a budget resolution.

Either chamber may initiate its own budget enforcement procedures by adopting a \"deeming resolution\" in the form of a simple resolution. This report describes substantive enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution, explains the concept of a \"deeming resolution,\" discusses House and Senate action on deeming resolutions, and provides information on a related topic, waiving a bar against the consideration of budgetary legislation for a fiscal year before a budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Substantive Enforcement of the Budget Resolution", "paragraphs": ["The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-344 , as amended) requires the adoption by April 15 of each year of a concurrent resolution on the budget. The annual budget resolution sets forth aggregate levels of revenues, spending, the debt limit, and the surplus or deficit, as well as allocations of spending (both budget authority and outlays) by each of major functional categories of the budget. The congressional budget process was first implemented in 1975 for FY1976, with full implementation of the process occurring the following year. Over the years, the time frame of the budget resolution has lengthened from one fiscal year to at least five fiscal years (and sometimes as many as 10 fiscal years, plus revisions to the current fiscal year).", "Enforcement of the budget resolution relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliation procedures. Point-of-order provisions contained in the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, which sometimes are supplemented by point-of-order provisions carried in annual budget resolutions, allow any Member in either chamber to prevent the consideration of legislation that would violate budget resolution policies. Of course, points of order are not self-enforcing and may be waived with a sufficient majority, thereby allowing legislation in violation of budget resolution policies to be considered. In the Senate, most of the points or order pertaining to budget enforcement require the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the membership (60 votes, if no seats are vacant) in order to be waived.", "With regard to the substantive enforcement of the budget resolution (i.e., enforcement of budgetary levels), the major points of order under the 1974 Congressional Budget Act are found in Sections 311 and 302, which deal with the enforcement of budget aggregates and committee spending allocations, respectively. House and Senate rules and practices differ somewhat with regard to these two points of order.", "Section 311(a) generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the aggregate budget authority and outlays levels for the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution, and any revenue measure that would violate the aggregate revenue level for the first fiscal year or the sum of all fiscal years covered by the budget resolution.", "Section 302(a) generally requires that the aggregate amounts of spending recommended in the annual budget resolution be allocated by committee; the House and Senate Appropriations Committees receive an allocation for only one fiscal year, but the remaining House and Senate committees receive allocations for all of the years covered by the budget resolution. Section 302(b) requires the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to subdivide their allocations by subcommittee. Section 302(f) generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the committee spending allocations made under Section 302(a) or the Appropriations Committees' suballocations of spending made under Section 302(b). In view of the different time frames for making committee spending allocations, the spending levels are enforceable for one year in the case of the Appropriations Committees but are enforceable for a multi-year period in the case of the other House and Senate committees.", "Reconciliation is a two-step process. Under the first step, reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution, directing one or more committees in each House to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues (or both) by the amounts specified in the budget resolution. If more than one committee in each House is given instructions, each instructed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective Budget Committee, which incorporates all submissions, without any substantive revision, into a single, omnibus budget reconciliation measure. Under the second step, the omnibus budget reconciliation measure is considered in the House and Senate under expedited procedures (for example, debate time in the Senate on a reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane). The process culminates with enactment of the measure, thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The \"Deeming Resolution\"", "paragraphs": ["When the House and Senate do not reach final agreement on a budget resolution in a timely manner (or fail to reach final agreement altogether) during a session, they are faced with a mixed situation regarding budget enforcement for upcoming fiscal years. The multi-year budget levels in the prior year's budget resolution remain in effect and provide some basis for enforcing points of order with respect to revenue and mandatory spending legislation. Changing economic and technical factors over the past year, however, may have rendered the prior budget levels out of date, thereby undermining their value as a realistic basis for enforcement of present policies. Further, the House and Senate must adopt a new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually appropriated spending levels to be continuous. If a budget resolution is not adopted for a fiscal year, there is no allocation of spending made to the Appropriations Committees under Section 302(a) and no basis for them to make the required spending suballocations under Section 302(b).", "Consequently, when the House and Senate have been presented with such situations, they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide a basis for updated enforcement. The term \"deeming resolution\" is not officially defined, nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation. Instead, the use of a deeming resolution simply represents the House and Senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis.", "Inasmuch as the form and content of a deeming resolution is not prescribed, its form and content may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand.

The House and Senate did not reach final agreement on budget resolutions for FY1999, FY2003, FY2005, FY2007, FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. In most of the 31 years for which a budget resolution was adopted, final agreement on the measure was reached in April, May, or early June, allowing the House and Senate to bring the regular appropriations bills and other budgetary legislation to the floor with little or no delay.", "In some instances, however, the final budget resolution was not in place until late June, or even until August or October. The general practice of the Senate in such years, particularly with regard to the regular appropriations bills, was to consider legislation within the framework of the Senate-passed budget resolution but not to adopt a deeming resolution. For example, spending levels provided in the appropriations bills generally were consistent with the spending allocations to the Senate Appropriations Committee and the spending suballocations thereunder that would have been made had the Senate-passed levels become the final ones. Consideration of the measures usually occurred by unanimous consent.", "The tardy adoption of budget resolutions has been more of a problem for the House than the Senate, especially because the House usually begins the consideration of the regular appropriations bills at an earlier point in the session. In 1990, the House made a procedural change to allow the consideration of the regular appropriations acts to begin if the budget resolution was not finalized in a timely manner. The Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990 (Title XIII of P.L. 101-508 , as amended) added a temporary provision to the 1974 Congressional Budget Act authorizing the chairman of the House Budget Committee to issue a provisional spending allocation to the House Appropriations Committee (consistent with the statutory limits on discretionary spending set by the BEA) if the budget resolution were not agreed to by the April 15 deadline. In 1997, the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1997 (Title X of P.L. 105-33 ) repealed Section 603 (and all of the other sections in Title VI of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act), but incorporated a modified version of the provision into Section 302 as a permanent part of procedure. The modification requires the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to be consistent with the most recently agreed to budget resolution rather than the statutory limits on discretionary spending (the statutory limits expired at the end of FY2002).", "Notwithstanding the authority established in 1990 for making provisional spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee based on prior budget resolutions, the House on several occasions has adopted deeming resolutions so that consideration of regular appropriations acts could proceed under more updated spending allocations. Special rules on regular appropriations bills have sometimes included provisions that deemed a House-passed budget resolution to be in effect (until superseded by final House-Senate agreement on a budget resolution), or that deemed a particular spending allocation to be in effect.", "In 1990, when the final adoption of the budget resolution for FY1991 was delayed until October 9 (while extensive negotiations were conducted in a budget summit between the Administration and Congress), the Senate adopted a deeming resolution to allow consideration of the regular appropriations acts for that year to proceed. S.Res. 308 , which set forth FY1991 allocations of $680.512 billion in new budget authority and $690.606 billion in outlays to the Senate Appropriations Committee \"for purposes of section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,\" was adopted by the Senate on July 12, 1990, by unanimous consent.

House and Senate action on deeming resolutions for these years is summarized in Table 2 and discussed in more detail below. The Appendix sets forth the text of the deeming resolutions.", "As Table 2 shows, the House and Senate have followed different patterns in terms of action on deeming resolutions. For each of the seven fiscal years, the House used the same approach, adopting a deeming resolution in the months following the prescribed date for reaching final agreement with the Senate on a budget resolution.", "In six of the seven fiscal years for which a deeming resolution was utilized, the legislative vehicle was a special rule reported by the House Rules Committee. Four of these special rules provided for the initial consideration of an appropriations act (three regular appropriations acts and one supplemental appropriations act). Each of these special rules contained a separate section setting forth the deeming resolution provisions. In the final case, the legislative vehicle was not a special rule, but a freestanding resolution that also included other provisions related to budget enforcement. This resolution, H.Res. 1493 (111 th Congress), was automatically adopted when the House agreed to H.Res. 1500 , a special rule reported by the House Rules Committee providing for consideration of a Senate amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill.", "In the House, initial deeming resolutions have been renewed by the adoption of a new resolution beginning the next session of Congress. Such additional deeming resolution provisions have been adopted by the House as part of the opening-day rules package, usually numbered H.Res. 5 (in 2007, the rules package was H.Res. 6 , which was approved by a separate vote on each title over the first two days).", "The initial deeming resolution first used by the House, for FY1999, only provided spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee. In five other instances (FY2003, FY2005, FY2007, FY2012, FY2013), the initial deeming resolution had a broader application, putting into effect the entire budget resolution at its latest stage of action (House passage or House agreement to the conference report). The deeming resolution for FY2011 provided spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee, and, among other things, extended enforcement provisions of the FY2010 budget resolution. Deeming resolutions frequently included language blocking the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution increasing the public debt limit, as provided for under former House Rule XXVII, forcing a debt-limit increase under regular legislative procedures.", "The Senate has employed varied practices with respect to deeming resolutions. For FY1999, it adopted two simple resolutions for this purpose in a single session (the first only provided spending allocations to the Senate Appropriations Committee, but the second had a much broader application). In the following instance, for FY2003, the Senate did not adopt a deeming resolution, despite several attempts to do so. In two instances, for FY2005 and FY2007, the Senate included deeming resolution provisions in statute, including a regular appropriations act (enacted in August) and a supplemental appropriations act (enacted in June). These latter two deeming resolutions focused principally on establishing new allocations of total discretionary spending to the Senate Appropriations Committee, and repealing or making inapplicable appropriations caps for the pertinent fiscal years, included in the prior year's budget resolution, that were considered obsolete and too restrictive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Actions for FY1999", "paragraphs": ["Overall budget policy for FY1999 had been outlined the previous year, in 1997, under the terms of a five-year agreement reached between Congress and President Clinton.

On May 18, 2006, the House agreed to H.Res. 818 ( H.Rept. 109-469 , May 17, 2006), a special rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 5386 , the Interior Appropriations Act for FY2007; the House agreed to the measure by a vote of 218\u2013192. Section 2 of H.Res. 818 put into effect the budget policies embodied in the FY2007 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 376 , as adopted by the House, as well as the procedures under Title III of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act used to enforce them. In addition, Section 2 barred the automatic engrossment of a measure raising the debt limit by the amount recommended in the budget resolution, an action otherwise required under House Rule XXVII whenever a budget resolution is finally agreed to by the House and Senate. Congress and the President increased the debt limit in 2006 under regular legislative procedures ( P.L. 109-182 , March 20, 2006).", "Several weeks following House action on the deeming resolution provision, the Senate addressed the matter as well. As had been the case two years earlier, Senate action on the regular appropriations acts for FY2007 was subject to a cap established in the budget resolution for the prior year that was judged to be too tight. The FY2007 budget resolution passed by the Senate, as well as by the House, reflected a cap on appropriations for the fiscal year of $873 billion, but the cap for that fiscal year established in the FY2006 budget resolution was $7 billion lower, at $866 billion. This situation raised the same problems that the Senate faced in 2004.", "On June 15, 2006, the Senate resolved the matter by adopting the conference report on H.R. 4939 , the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery for FY2006. President Bush signed the measure into law the same day, as P.L. 109-234 . Section 7035 (120 Stat. 489-490) of the act, which took effect upon enactment, established the revised level of $873 billion as the allocation of new budget authority to the Senate Appropriations Committee for purposes of Section 302(a) of the 1974 act (and made the outdated limit of $866 billion in the prior year's budget resolution inapplicable). Further, the $873 billion cap was made subject to provisions in the Senate-passed budget resolution pertaining to limitations and adjustments applicable to emergency spending.", "The following year, in 2007, the House took additional actions pertaining to budget enforcement for FY2007. During the first two days of the 110 th Congress, January 4 and 5, the House adopted H.Res. 6 , a measure setting forth its standing rules. Separate votes were taken on each title of the measure (rather than a single vote on adoption of the measure in its entirety); the first two titles were agreed to on January 4 and the remaining three titles were agreed to on January 5. Title V, which dealt with various special orders and miscellaneous matters, was agreed to by a vote of 232\u2013200.", "Special orders pertaining to the budget process and other matters were set forth in Section 511 of the resolution. Section 511(a)(4)(A) made the provisions of the FY2007 budget resolution adopted in the preceding year ( H.Con.Res. 376 ) effective for purposes of budget enforcement in 2007, pending adoption of a FY2008 budget resolution.", "In addition, Section 511(a)(4)(B) of H.Res. 6 directed the chairman of the House Budget Committee, when elected, to have the committee spending allocations and other budgetary information printed in the Congressional Record . On February 6, 2007, Representative John Spratt, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, submitted the information required by H.Res. 6 .", "The House and Senate reached final agreement on the FY2008 budget resolution ( S.Con.Res. 21 ) on May 17, 2007. In addition to recommending spending levels for FY2008-FY2012, the measure revised the spending levels for FY2007. In the House, the revised spending levels for FY2007 effectively superseded the levels established in the deeming resolution automatically (because the deeming resolution was in effect only until the FY2008 budget resolution was adopted). In the Senate, however, affirmative action had to be taken to terminate the deeming resolution, thereby avoiding any conflict with the newly revised spending levels. Accordingly, Section 208 of the FY2008 budget resolution stated that \"Section 7035 of P.L. 109-234 shall no longer apply in the Senate.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions for FY2011", "paragraphs": ["Several events occurred in early 2010 that may have affected the unfolding of the FY2011 budget process, including the adoption of a budget resolution. First, congressional consideration of health care reform legislation extended several months into 2010, when Congress is typically beginning work on the budget resolution. Combined with the new legislation's impact on long-term direct spending, this may have inhibited support for adopting of a budget for FY2011. Second, in February of 2010, Congress passed the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, establishing a budget enforcement mechanism designed to prevent new direct spending and revenue legislation from increasing the deficit over a congressional session. With the enactment of Statutory PAYGO, Congress created enforceable parameters to which new direct spending and revenue legislation must adhere, arguably reducing the need to adopt a new budget resolution.", "Lastly, also in February 2010, President Obama issued an executive order creating the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (the Fiscal Commission), tasked with devising a plan that would balance the federal budget by FY2015. The commission comprises 12 sitting Members of Congress, appointed by Senate and House leaders, and 6 additional members appointed by the President. The recommendations of the commission must be submitted to the President by December 1, 2010, with 14 out of 18 votes needed to report recommendations, and some congressional leaders stated a desire to await the recommendations of the President's Fiscal Commission before taking a vote on a long-term budget plan.", "In spite of these factors, the Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 ( S.Con.Res. 60 ) on April 26, 2010, but the Senate took no further action to consider the measure. The House Budget Committee did not report a budget resolution amidst reports of an impasse over discretionary spending levels.", "On June 22, 2010, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer stated that, \"It isn't possible to debate and pass a realistic, long-term budget until we've considered the bipartisan commission's deficit-reduction plan, which is expected in December. I believe that Congress must take up and vote on that plan.\" He went on to say that the House was \"working to adopt a budget enforcement resolution written by [Budget Committee] Chairman John Spratt, which will set limits on discretionary spending that require further cuts below the President's budget; reinforce our commitment to PAYGO; direct committees to identify reforms to eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiencies within their jurisdiction; endorse the goals of the president's bipartisan fiscal commission; and reiterate the commitment to vote on the commission's recommendations.\"", "As the House was preparing to take action on a deeming resolution, the Senate signaled that it would not move forward on the budget resolution reported from the Senate Budget Committee in April. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad stated, \"Obviously, I'd prefer that we do what I've done, which is take a budget resolution through the committee, prepared to take it to the floor. But if [the House is] not going to do it, it makes no sense for us to do it, because you can't reach conclusion ... What does make sense, to me, is to put in a budget enforcement mechanism, like the one [the House is] discussing, so that you do have spending limits put in place.\"", "On July 1, 2010, the House agreed to H.Res. 1500 , a special rule providing for consideration of Senate amendments to H.R. 4899 , making emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and summer jobs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes. H.Res. 1500 also included provisions modifying the House PAYGO rule, as well as a provision adopting H.Res. 1493 , which provided for budget enforcement for FY2011 until the beginning of the 112 th Congress.", "H.Res. 1493 , referred to as a \"budget enforcement resolution,\" set forth enforceable spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee for FY2011 and included other provisions, such as extending discretionary spending enforcement provisions from the FY2010 budget resolution. H.Res. 1493 granted authority to the House Budget Committee chairman to exclude the effect of any \"current policy adjustment\" from a determination of the budgetary effects of any provision in a bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report. This provision replaced a provision in the prior year's budget resolution that granted similar authority to the House Budget Committee chairman.", "H.Res. 1493 also included non-binding \"sense of the House\" language on deficit reduction stating, among other things, that the budget should be in primary balance by 2015; that House committee chairs should identify changes in law that help achieve deficit reduction by reducing waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement; and that prior to the close of the 111 th Congress, any recommendations made by the President's Fiscal Commission and approved by the Senate shall be brought to a vote in the House. Lastly, H.Res. 1493 stated that any deficit reduction achieved by the enactment of recommendations made by the President's Fiscal Commission should be excluded from the determination of budgetary effects of such legislation in the House so that, for the purposes of PAYGO, it is not available as an offset for any subsequent legislation.", "On January 5, 2011, the House adopted H.Res. 5 , a measure setting forth House standing rules for the 112 th Congress. Section 3(b) of the resolution, which establishes separate orders, directs the chairman of the House Budget Committee to insert in the Congressional Record budget aggregates and allocations as would be included in a budget resolution and stated that these levels shall be considered as contained in a concurrent resolution on the budget for FY2011. This was similar to action taken for FY1999, discussed above.", "The Senate did not agree to a formal deeming resolution specifying an enforceable 302(a) spending allocation for the Senate Appropriations Committee.

After all, such motions are subject to extended debate, and any Senator can raise an objection to a unanimous consent request. An extended debate on a motion, and an objection to a unanimous consent request, occurred only once (both occurred in August 1984 in connection with the Agriculture appropriations bill for FY1985).
