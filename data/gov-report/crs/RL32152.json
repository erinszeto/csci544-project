If early detectionis achieved, it is predicted that therapeutic agents could be provided in a timely manner to thoseexposed, reducing the effectiveness of such an attack and averting the potentially catastrophic natureof mass pathogen releases.

These filtersare manually collected at regular, reportedly 24-hour, intervals (6) and are analyzed for potentialbiological weapon pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. (7) While filters from theBioWatch program were initially shipped to and tested at a federal laboratory in California, state andlocal public health laboratories now perform the analyses.

It wasdeveloped by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories prior to the anthrax mailings of2001. It provides confirmatory testing in all 50 state public health labs, and in additionallocations. (15) There arecurrently 118 member labs in the LRN.", "BioWatch equipment is heavily based on the Biological Aerosol Sentry and InformationSystem (BASIS), a system developed within the Chemical and Biological National Security Programof the National Nuclear Security Administration (now part of the Department of Homeland Security)by scientists at Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories. (16) BASIS is comprised ofan air collector coupled to a series of filters. Airborne particles passing through the system arecaptured on a filter. The filter mechanism is designed to roughly determine when an attack occurredby using sequential filters automatically rotated on an hourly basis. Filters are removed and testedusing PCR for the presence of select pathogens.

These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, andmass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use themwithout the least hesitation. (23)", "A goal of the BioWatch program is detection of large releases of biological weapons, someof which might potentially cause thousands of casualties. (24) Early notification of a biological attack is presumed to providea significant advantage in preventing and treating casualties. Such a \"detect to treat\" (25) warning system may limitcasualties and fatalities by allowing earlier medical service to the exposed, avoiding diseaseprogression. A modeling study concludes that while the earliest possible detection of a hypotheticalurban anthrax release still cannot prevent all deaths, the proportion of lives saved by detection andintervention within the first day after the event (before symptoms appear in those exposed) isapproximately 40%. (26) With increasing delay between detection and treatment, greater casualties occur.", "Some experts question whether mass biological attack is the most probable terrorist threat,and suggest that more localized attacks are more likely. (27) It is suggested by some that the BioWatch monitors would notlikely detect indoor or underground releases, such as within a building or a subway system. (28) There are historicalexamples of both indoor releases, the U.S. anthrax mailings in 2001, and outdoor releases, such asthe suspected accidental anthrax release at Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), Russia in 1979. (29) ", "Factors influencing the choice of locales to be monitored are another area of discussion. BioWatch monitors are reportedly deployed in major cities. A successful mass biological attack ona large city would likely cause high casualties. The perceived prestige conferred upon a terroristgroup following a successful, large-scale attack may lead terrorist groups to preferentially targetcities. (30) Some positthat these factors, among others, require special consideration for major cities. For example, in thedebate over homeland security spending, some have asserted that homeland security funds shouldbe allocated using formulas that take into account threats, population density, and the presence ofcritical infrastructure, rather than on a per capita basis. (31) In contrast, some have claimed that successful aerosoldissemination near a major city is less likely due to the higher probability that such an event wouldbe noticed by officials or citizens. (32) ", "Some feel that the existence of bioterrorism countermeasures can themselves serve as adeterrent to the use of these agents. In theory, the BioWatch program might have this effect, withpotential bioterrorists knowing that cities have early warning capability due to the BioWatchprogram being deterred from using biological weapons. Some may conclude that this deterrent valueis enhanced by the general secrecy surrounding BioWatch program details, such as monitor locationsand pathogen lists. The deterrence value may be difficult to measure, and may alternately directterrorists toward locations lacking such detectors. Also, the general secrecy surrounding theBioWatch program details may lead potential bioterrorists to underestimate the system's truecapability, decreasing the deterrent effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sensor Siting Issues", "paragraphs": ["Technical issues regarding placement of BioWatch monitors are raised as potentiallimitations to the system's effectiveness. Some BioWatch monitors are reportedly co-located withpreexisting EPA air quality monitors, (33) though potentially the monitors could be relocated should theneed arise. (34) Regulations regarding placement of EPA air quality monitors are found at 40 CFR 58, and, amongother criteria, placement is designed to assess the impact of potential pollutant sources for a givenarea. Since these criteria are different from those designed for biological detection, the placementof the EPA air quality monitors may not place the BioWatch monitors in an optimal configurationfor a given area. Some outdoor pathogen releases, particularly those that might be small, reportedlymight avoid detection due to gaps or limitations in coverage due to siting, even though the monitorsthemselves were very sensitive. (35) ", "The exact locations of the BioWatch monitors are not public knowledge. The Departmentof Homeland Security does not confirm the locations of BioWatch monitors. (36) If the locations of thesemonitors were known with great certainty, it might become possible to avoid them, to degrade theirdetection capability, or to provide them false signals or information. The locations of the BioWatchmonitors determine the detection coverage areas and the security of the monitors. Some lawenforcement concerns which may have been employed in developing priorities for placing andoperating BioWatch monitors include: assuring the physical security of the monitors so that notampering occurs; guaranteeing that monitor filters arrive at the testing location in the same conditionas when they were removed from the monitor; and providing that the chain of custody for potentialforensic evidence is established. ", "A further concern regarding placement of some BioWatch monitors near EPA air quality sitesis that EPA monitors are not equally spaced within a city or an area. Even if the EPA monitors meetthe above criteria with respect to security, privacy, and access, the irregularity of placement andpotential gaps in coverage between these sites may cause them to be not entirely appropriate asBioWatch monitors. It is suggested by some that an outdoor biological warning system wouldrequire the placement of monitors as closely spaced as 300-500 meters. (37) Neither the officialrationale for BioWatch monitor placement nor who established the placement criteria has beendisclosed. It may be that the reported choice of sites reflects an effort to provide maximal coveragefor the population in a particular metropolitan area. An unnamed spokesman for the Department ofHealth and Human Services stated that the goal of BioWatch siting is to provide coverage for 80%of the population of a particular area. (38) Alternately, cost and ease of access are suggested as possibleadditional reasons for the reported use of EPA co-locations. (39) ", "Following a positive signal from a BioWatch monitor, the likely affected area might bedetermined through analysis and modeling of potential releases. Those determined to be inside areasaffected by the release might receive priority treatment. A recent Congressional hearing (40) cast light on the diversityof programs able to model gaseous releases, but also highlighted that there is not a single,acknowledged best method for determining the area of effect of a given release, especially in urbanareas where wind patterns and the effects of turbulence from building geometries is only partiallyknown. (41) Thus,determining the exact areas impacted by the release, and hence those individuals requiring prioritytreatment, may be more difficult if the monitors are sub-optimally deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analytical Issues", "paragraphs": ["As stated above, the BioWatch Program is built from the successes of BASIS, developed bythe Department of Energy. (42) BASIS, which employs similar technology, was tested by theDepartment of Energy in a variety of situations, including laboratory environments and deploymentat the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002. (43) It is not fully known what potential changes were made to theBASIS equipment when it was adapted to serve BioWatch, and how applicable previous testingresults for BASIS are to BioWatch. Some question the ability of the BioWatch test methods todetect pathogens in a large city environment, especially one with considerable pollution and airborneparticulate matter that might affect analysis. (44) ", "Some are concerned that there may be naturally-occurring background levels of somepathogens in surveyed cities, leading to positive findings in the BioWatch program which do notresult from bioterrorism. (45) While PCR is a sensitive technique, it reports the presence orabsence of a DNA sequence, providing only a coarse scale of the amount of initial material. Thediseases caused by anthrax, plague, and tularemia bacteria, all on CDC's Category A list of biologicalterrorism agents, are not commonly found in humans, but they are diagnosed as naturally-occurringinfections each year in the U.S. (46) Certain of these agents are considered endemic, regularly presentin the environment, in certain parts of the country. The BioWatch Program appears to be premisedupon the assumption that all positive detections merit further investigation, even if there may be adetectable background level of these pathogens in some areas. In this regard, the BioWatch Programis a simpler methodological design than surveillance systems that detect deviations from ananticipated background event level. Such systems have the added burden of determining thresholdsabove background which are significant. Those concerned about detection of naturally occurringbackground pathogens question how response plans might take this possibility into account. Whenairborne tularemia bacteria was detected by BioWatch sensors in Houston, Texas, other information,such as the appearance of human illness, was sought to clarify the BioWatch result.", "Further concerns with BioWatch implementation relate to the verification of positive resultsand the use of further testing to guide governmental response. While the number of false positivesarising with BASIS was determined to be very small, (47) it is unknown whether that rate is directly applicable to BioWatchequipment. The BioWatch collection filters, under vacuum airflow for several hours, have thepotential to dessicate and kill organisms collected on them, yielding positive PCR results that cannotbe directly confirmed by growth of a pathogen in culture. (48) PCR methods are based on the detection of DNA signatures;they do not require that the organisms be viable, nor do they distinguish whether organisms areviable or not. For many pathogens of bioterrorism concern, the \"gold standard\" confirmatory testis based on growth of the sample in culture. Besides providing clear confirmation of preliminaryresults, growing the organism provides options for further testing. For example, having viablesamples of the pathogen allows for molecular \"fingerprinting\" and other techniques to supportepidemiologic and law enforcement investigations, as well as allowing determination of antibioticresistance. There may be analytical techniques, other than culture, used to clarify PCR results fromBioWatch, and other activities that could be undertaken to corroborate initial findings, but whetherprotocols for these activities are established and communicated to the state and local authorities thatwould implement them is not publicly known.", "The public health testing model for bioterrorism, in place during the anthrax attacks of 2001,incorporates confirmatory testing as one of its operational cornerstones. LRN laboratories usetrained personnel to expedite testing that confirms or refutes preliminary findings. One goal of theLRN is to minimize the time between an initial signal, such as a \"positive\" on a field-screeningdevice that is expected to yield some false positive findings, and a confirmed result. This processis designed to launch a public health response swiftly when it is needed, and avoid doing so whenit is not. A large-scale aerosol release of biological agents would necessitate a public healthemergency response of the highest order. While the BioWatch program is designed to detect apotential aerosol release quickly, if confirmatory testing is not available, it could lead to triggeringresponse activities erroneously, potentially consuming limited resources and damaging publicconfidence. ", "A final concern is the threshold for pathogen detection in the BioWatch system. Since PCRcan amplify very small amounts of DNA, such a system could be very sensitive, theoretically ableto detect a single pathogen. On the other hand, the pathogen deposition onto the filter depends onthe rate of air flow into the monitor. Thus, the pathogen release detection limit is a combination ofat least three factors: the concentration of aerosols passing over the detector; the duration that theaerosol mist is passing over the detector; and the amount of air collected through the filters duringthat time. (49) Since thesethree parameters of equipment performance are not publicly available, the actual detection limit forBioWatch is not publicly known. As a consequence, analyst opinion is mixed as to the utility ofthese monitors, with some expressing confidence that small releases could be detected, and othersexpecting that smaller outdoor releases would fall below the detection limit. (50) A very low detection limitis desirable because for some of the potential agents of bioterrorism, the infective dose in someindividuals may also be very low. (51) ", "The BioWatch program is considered labor intensive. (52) Collection of filters fromthe monitors, processing of the filters, and laboratory analysis all require human intervention. Additionally, the required laboratory work regularly consumes chemical reagents and disposableequipment, incurring significant operational cost. Finally, there are additional costs in administering,overseeing, and managing personnel and mandatory reporting related to this program. Initialestimates of the costs of the BioWatch program are reported to be approximately $1 million in initialequipment costs per city, followed by operational costs of $1 million per city per year. (53) Since the BioWatchProgram was launched in January 2003, it is likely that a more exact accounting of the recurringcosts of this program will become available in the future.

(54) The public healthconsequence management plan for the BioWatch program is not publicly available, but based on ageneric model for public health activities following a bioterrorism event, it is likely to include suchactivities as: expanded laboratory investigation, identification of affected populations, guidelines forcountermeasure distribution, considerations for management of mass casualties, and potentialrestriction of movement of individuals in the case of a communicable agent. (55) A likely first step wouldbe aimed at further sampling to quickly confirm and clarify any positive results from the BioWatchsystem, including an attempt to isolate viable organisms, but with an urgency to minimize the timespent between an initial alert and a decision to launch a public health response. The public healthresponse to a suspected aerosol pathogen release is likely to be massive and difficult to implementin a limited manner. It is, in fact, the intent of the BioWatch program that the public health responsebe launched as quickly as possible following a detected release. An often cited theoretical modelof casualties following mass exposure to anthrax concluded that rapid distribution of antibioticsfollowing detection of the event is a critical element in reducing fatalities, and could represent apotential bottleneck in the response.

One priority settingdecision might be the extent to which the BioWatch system is further deployed. This decision mayprompt additional policy questions. Will further installation of these systems occur only inmetropolitan areas, or will smaller urban, suburban, and/or rural areas also be eventually includedunder BioWatch coverage? Should more monitors be installed in cities currently under BioWatch,so as to increase the likelihood of detecting a small release? Should monitors be installed insidebuildings or public transportation, where people may be concentrated? Some experts have criticizedthe BioWatch program for being primarily designed to detect large releases while not detecting thepotentially more likely small releases. (72) Others point out that during the Salt Lake City Olympics BASISwas successfully installed in sporting venues and transport hubs where small releases might bedetected. (73) On theother hand, deploying multiple sensor units within a particular area may lead to significant overlapbetween sensors, providing diminishing returns per monitor. A complicating factor is the cost ofexpanding the BioWatch Program and the increased likelihood of false positives. Since biologicalterrorism is often considered to be a low probability/high consequence event, the risk of an eventoccurring is balanced against the costs of maintaining the detection infrastructure necessary to detectthe event. Unlike previous investments in public health preparedness, the BioWatch Program maynot have dual-use application, being predominantly applicable only as an anti-bioterrorism program. Congress may choose to fund other programs which have greater dual-use application to gain benefitfrom such funds if no bioterror event occurs.", "Another area of potential interest to Congress may be the method DHS used to prioritizedevelopment and deployment of national monitoring systems. Other federal agencies have programsto develop biodetectors and monitoring systems. These systems use a variety of techniques to detectaerosolized pathogens, but have often contained undesirably high false positive rates or lowsensitivity. For example, the Department of Defense is developing a \"stand-off\" detection systemfor some uses rather than a point detection system, as is employed by DHS in the BioWatchProgram. (74) In militarysettings, the ability to determine whether a threat is posed by an aerosol cloud at a distance, allowscombat troops to don appropriate gear and equipment. Also, the Department of Defense focuses ondetection systems with real-time detection, (75) attempting to develop a \"detect-to-warn\" rather than a\"detect-to-treat\" capability. These systems provide higher false positive rates than that reported forBASIS. Because of the ready availability of protective equipment, including masks and suits, andthe high training provided to troops regarding this equipment's use, false positives requiring thedonning of protective gear are more acceptable than in a civilian setting. Further research into suchtechnologies and assessment of the potential performance of these military detector systems whenplaced in a civilian environment may be areas for future study.

One way to address these concerns is by disseminating information about performance characteristicsof the BioWatch Program. This type of information is available for other military systems, especiallychemical detectors. For example, the Department of Defense released the detection levels for somechemical detection equipment, (77) and some performance characteristics, such as false positiverates, are provided for BASIS. (78) Even if these metrics were not publicly disseminated, providingconcrete information at the state and local level might enhance the BioWatch effectiveness. Advantages from early detection depend on a timely response to a biological release. If state andlocal officials lack confidence in the monitor performance, consequence management may bedelayed, leading to greater casualties. (79) Alternatively if officials overestimate the monitor capability,consequence management activities may be engaged even when there is no need, consumingvaluable resources and generating unnecessary public anxiety. In the case of the BioWatch detectionof airborne tularemia in Houston, the distribution of countermeasures was not begun, pending thecollection of additional information. One option would be to further refine the decision-makingprocess invoked upon a positive finding to more optimally achieve the goals of rapid response to abioterror event. ", "Determining the effectiveness of the BioWatch Program in achieving its public health goal,to minimize casualties by detecting exposures more rapidly than would otherwise have occurred, willbe difficult in any circumstances. Assessments of public health effectiveness are typicallyconsidered in the context of opportunity cost; are allocations of funds and person-hours worthwhile,or might they be better used elsewhere? BioWatch, designed to detectlow-probability/high-consequence events, is unlike public health surveillance programs, which trackconditions expected to occur in the population. CDC publishes an evaluation protocol forsurveillance systems, \"to promote the best use of public health resources through the developmentof efficient and effective public health surveillance systems.\" (80) Information about anumber of the performance characteristics typically described for surveillance systems -- includingflexibility, data quality, and representativeness -- is not available to the public for the BioWatchProgram. A senior CDC official stated that BioWatch is in the \"proof of concept\" phase, a relativelyearly stage of technology development, and notes that CDC is, \"trying to build systems to assure thatonce we have true positives, we can mobilize a response rapidly, but also develop a system for falsepositives which we feel could be a potential problem in the future.\" (81) Efforts to explain thesystem to those needing to know, and to coordinate the activities of multiple agencies at the federal,state and local levels, are ongoing. (82) ", "The BioWatch Program draws upon the expertise of three federal agencies, the Departmentof Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services (through the CDC), and theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Which agency is best suited to provide oversight and evaluationof the BioWatch program is an unresolved question. DHS funds and currently oversees the program,but some may argue that the BioWatch Program is inherently a public health program. In this case,the Department of Health and Human Services, potentially through the CDC, would be best equippedto assess the effectiveness of the program. The CDC has experience in federal/state relationsregarding public health and in the evaluation of public health surveillance systems. Also, the CDCmay be best qualified to judge the validity of response and consequence management plans followinga BioWatch positive. Advocates for such a view might point to the retention of bioterrorism-relatedcivilian countermeasure research and development by HHS, in the Homeland Security Act ( P.L.107-296 ), as indicative of the expertise retained within that Department. Others may assert that theBioWatch Program is a homeland security program, in which case DHS is the logical choice for soleoversight and assessment of this program. Since the technologies involved during BioWatchdevelopment originated with elements of DHS, that agency may be uniquely qualified to assess thestate of development and deployment of the system.", "Because this program cuts across the expertise of different federal agencies, oversight andevaluation of the BioWatch Program will likely include the federal agencies involved. The precedentset in the Homeland Security Act ( P.L. 107-296 ), where a collaborative approach between theSecretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security is required withrespect to civilian human health-related research and development activities relating tocountermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear and other emerging terroristthreats, (83) may be amodel for assessment of the BioWatch Program. Determining the relative authorities of theparticipating agencies may be an area of Congressional interest.", "The Homeland Security Act ( P.L. 107-296 ) also established a Homeland Security Institute. The Act allows this institute, following a determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security, totake on the duties of \"evaluation of the effectiveness of measures deployed to enhance the securityof institutions, facilities, and infrastructure that may be terrorist targets,\" \"assistance for Federalagencies and departments in establishing testbeds to evaluate the effectiveness of technologies underdevelopment and to assess the appropriateness of such technologies for deployment,\" and \"designof metrics and use of those metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of homeland security programsthroughout the Federal Government, including all national laboratories.\" (84) Some may advocate thatsuch an institute would provide the necessary mixture of federal, private, and public opinions to fullyevaluate the different components of the BioWatch Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for the BioWatch Program", "paragraphs": ["The degree to which DHS should focus its spending on such a program is an area of potentialCongressional interest.

(89) It is managed and fundedat the federal level by the Department of Homeland Security, with state and local public healthagencies responsible for on-the-ground management of laboratory activities and response to positivefindings. The LRN, in contrast, was developed by the CDC, FBI, and state and local health agencies,with the first set of test methods developed prior to the anthrax mailings of 2001.
