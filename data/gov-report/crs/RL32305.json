The key issue in Congress then became howmuch flexibility to grant the Defense Department in allocating the funds.

It makes substantial cuts in a fewhigh-profile weapons programs, including the Space-Based Radar and the TransformationalCommunications Satellite. It approves funding to begin construction of the Navy DD(X) destroyerand Littoral Combat Ship.", "One other major defense policy issue was resolved in action on the energy and waterappropriations bill.

For more extensive backgroundon these issues, see the \"Issues for Congress\" section below. ", "Funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Theappropriations conference agreement provided $25 billion in emergency funding foroperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The remaining issue for the authorizationconference is whether to add reporting requirements. The Senate version of theauthorization requires quite extensive additional reporting on operations in Iraq inparticular. Authorization conference outcome: Authorized $25 billion, asexpected, including $435 million for body armor, $572 million for up-armoredHumvees, and $100 million for bolt-on armor. Requires a number of reports,including quarterly accounting for operations conducted as part of the Global War onTerrorism, a report on the post-major combat operations phase of Operation IraqiFreedom, and a report on training for post-conflict operations.", "Oversight of prisoner abuse in Iraq and elsewhere. TheSenate-passed bill includes an amendment proposed by Senator Patrick Leahy thatstates it is U.S. policy not to abuse prisoners in its control and that requires theAdministration to produce a number of documents related to treatment of U.S.-heldprisoners. The House has rejected a number of proposals to require production ofsimilar documents. Conference outcome: Includes a sense of the Congress sectionregarding abuse of detainees, development of a policy to prevent abuse, and reportsto Congress on the policy.", "Army and Marine Corps end-strength. The Houseauthorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee and passed on thefloor, increases Army end-strength by 10,000 and Marine Corps end-strength by3,000 in each of the next three years, for a total increase of 39,000. The bill alsoestablishes the new end-strength totals as statutory minimums. In floor action onJune 17, the Senate adopted an amendment by Senator Jack Reed to increase Armyend-strength by 20,000 in FY2005. The House and Senate appropriations billsprovide funds for the higher troop levels within the $25 billion provided for Iraq andAfghanistan. Conference outcome: Agreed to increase Army end-strength by20,000 and Marine end-strength by 3,000 in FY2005 and establishes the increasedtotals as minimums. Also authorizes, but does not require, additional increases of10,000 in the Army and 6,000 in the Marine Corps over the next four years, but doesnot yet establish them as minimums.", "Military base closures. The House approved a measure in theauthorization bill that would delay the next round of military base closures, nowplanned for 2005, until 2007, and that would require a number of reports in theinterim. By a vote of 49-47, the Senate rejected an amendment to its version of theauthorization that would have delayed domestic base closures until 2007. This issueis likely to be a major conference item because the Administration has threatened aveto if the final bill includes a delay in base closures. (1) Conferenceoutcome: Does not agree to the House proposal to delay base closures by two years. Requires approval of 7 of 9 commissioners to add a facility to the base closure listthat the White House will propose.", "Health care for reservists. In a key floor vote, the Senateapproved an amendment to the authorization bill by Senators Lindsey Graham andTom Daschle to provide health insurance through the military-run TRICAREprogram for all non-deployed reservists and their dependents, with the DefenseDepartment paying the employer share of the costs. Earlier, the Senate ArmedServices Committee had approved a more limited measure to establish a healthinsurance program for non-deployed reservists and their dependents, calledTRICARE Reserve Select. Under the program, employers could agree to pay part ofthe cost of the program, with reservists paying the remaining cost, or reservists couldsign up by paying the full cost. The House authorization includes neither provision. Instead, the House bill establishes a three-year demonstration program for providinghealth insurance through TRICARE for reservists without access toemployer-provided health insurance. The Senate bill also provides for a similartwo-year demonstration program. Conference outcome: Does not approve theSenate proposal to provide TRICARE for all non-deployed reservists. Instead, whoserve 90 consecutive days in active service or more and who agree to sign up for anadditional year or more of service in the reserves one year of access to TRICAREafter demobilization.", "Military Survivor Benefit Plan. The House authorizationincludes a measure that was adopted in markup to phase in increased benefits for62-and-older surviving dependents of military retirees to 55% of retired pay (nowprovided to younger survivors) over four years through 2008. The Senate approveda floor amendment to the authorization bill that increases benefits for 62-and-oldersurvivors from the current 35% of retired pay to 45% after September 2008 and to55% after September 2014. Conference outcome: As in the House, phases in full55% benefit level by 2008. ", "KC-767A tanker acquisition. The House authorizationapproved a measure to require the Air Force to enter into a contract to acquire Boeing767 tanker aircraft. The Senate approved a floor amendment to the authorization billthat establishes quite strict requirements before any funds can be obligated for 767tanker acquisition. Conference outcome: Does not approve the House mandate toenter into a contract for 767s by next March. Repeals the lease-purchase programapproved last year. Instead, prohibits leasing and authorizes multi-year procurementof 100 new aerial refueling aircraft (which could be 767s or an alternative).", "Renewal of authorization for public-private partnerships toprovide military family housing. After this year, a statutory cap on funding formilitary housing privatization expires, and virtually all of the congressional defensecommittees called for extending it. Repealing the cap, however, would increasemandatory spending, so advocates struggled to find an offset for the extension -- aneffort to extend the program in House action on the military constructionappropriations bill was defeated on a point of order. Conference outcome: Theauthorization conference agreement repeals the funding cap, offset by savings fromrepealing the KC-767 lease-purchase plan, which CBO had scored as mandatoryspending.", "Limits on defense offset agreements and Buy Americanprovisions. The House authorization includes a measure that would prohibit theUnited States from purchasing foreign-made defense items unless the seller agreesto provide trade \"offsets\" equal, as a share of value, to the offsets the selling nationapplies to purchases from the United States. The provision may be waived if theSecretary of Defense certifies that a purchase is necessary to meet U.S. nationalsecurity objections. In contrast, the Senate adopted an amendment to theauthorization bill by Senator McCain ( S.Amdt. 3461 ) that would allowthe Secretary of Defense to exempt several allies from existing Buy Americanrequirements. Conference outcome: Rejects the House provision that would limitpurchases and substitutes a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense todevelop a comprehensive acquisition trade policy to ensure that U.S. firms are notdisadvantaged by foreign offsets.", "Limits on arms sales and technology transfers to China. TheHouse authorization includes one provision that would tighten restrictions on transferof technology with potential military utility to China by U.S. or by foreign firms andanother to expand the number of Chinese firms defined as \"military companies\" towhich sales are restricted. The Senate bill includes no similar provisions. Conference outcome: As in the House bill, would expand the number of Chinesefirms defined as \"military companies.\"", "Disposition of nuclear waste at Department of Energy nuclearweapons production facilities. The Senate authorization includes a measure thatwould allow liquid waste stored at the Savannah River nuclear weapons productionplant to be redefined as low-level waste that could be stabilized and storedindefinitely on site. The Senate narrowly rejected a floor amendment to delete theprovision. The House bill does not address the issue. Conference outcome: Approves the Senate provision with some amendments, including requiring aNational Academy of Sciences study of alternatives for waste cleanup.", "Development of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator andother new nuclear weapons. Both the House and the Senate rejected amendments tothe defense authorization bill to eliminate funds requested for RNEP and other newnuclear weapons development. The House-passed version of the FY2005 energy andwater appropriations bill ( H.R. 4614 ), however, eliminates the $36million requested for the programs in the Department of Energy budget.

Both theHouse- and Senate-passed versions of the defense appropriations bill included $25billion, as the Administration requested on May 12, to cover costs of ongoingmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through the first few months of FY2005. The main issue in Congress was how much flexibility to provide the DefenseDepartment in allocating the funds among budget accounts. The conferenceagreement provides $3.8 billion of the money in a flexible transfer account, called theIraq Freedom Fund, and the remainder in regular appropriations accounts. The levelof detail in which the funds are provided is quite narrow, as in the House-passedappropriations bill, and the Defense Department will have to seek advance approvalfrom the congressional defense committees to shift funds to other uses. (2) Of the $3.8billion in the Iraq Freedom Fund, $1.8 billion is for classified programs, so $2 billionis available for unforseen expenses.", "Repeal of FY2004 rescission. The FY2004 ConsolidatedAppropriations Act ( P.L. 108-199 ), enacted last January, rescinded $1.8 billion offunds in earlier defense appropriations bills. The conference agreement repeals therescission. The Congressional Budget Office scores this as a reappropriation offunds. So the total of emergency appropriations for the Defense Department in theFY2005 defense appropriations bill is $26.8 billion, with additional amounts forother agencies.", "Emergency funding for non-defense programs. The defense billincludes emergency funds for a number of other programs, including $685 millionfor State Department operations in Iraq,$95 million to respond to the humanitariancrisis in the Darfur region of Sudan and Chad, $400 million to fight wild fires in theWest, $50 million for security at the upcoming Democratic and Republican politicalconventions, and $26 million to make up a shortfall in Federal Judiciary defenderservices.", "Navy DD(X) and LCS ship construction. The Administrationrequested $221 million in R&D funding for the DD(X) destroyer program to beginconstruction of the first ship of the class and $107 million, also in R&D funds, tobegin construction of the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The House authorizationcut money for ship construction from both programs, though it approved continueddevelopment funding. The Senate authorizers approved the requested constructionfunds for both programs and also added $99 million in design funds for the DD(X)to accelerate production of a second ship. The House Appropriations Committeeagreed with the House authorization in cutting money for DD(X) construction andadded $125 million for advance procurement for an additional DD-51 destroyer inplace of the DD(X). The House appropriators did not, however, agree to trim fundsfor the LCS and instead added $107 million (for a total of $214 million) to fully fundconstruction of the first ship. Like the Senate authorization, the SenateAppropriations Committee approved the requested construction funds for bothprograms and added $99 million for the DD(X), though it shifted the $221 millionrequested for DD(X) construction from R&D to the procurement accounts. Theappropriations conference agreement provides $221 million for DD(X) construction,but in procurement rather than in R&D. The agreement also provides $214 millionto fully fund construction of the first LCS in the R&D accounts. So the Houseauthorization cuts did not prevail in final congressional action onappropriations.", "F/A-22 fighter. The Senate Armed Services Committeetrimmed the request from 24 to 22 aircraft, saving $280 million. The Houseauthorization and the House and Senate appropriations bills, however, all supportedthe full 24 aircraft, $4.2 billion procurement request. The appropriations conferenceagreement trims $30 million from the request for assumed efficiencies, but supportsthe full 24 aircraft request.", "Army Future Combat System (FCS). The House authorizationtrimmed $245 million from the FCS program and imposed a requirement that theArmy more fully justify the program. The Senate provided the full $3.2 billionrequested. The House Appropriations Committee cut $324 million and eliminatedfunds for the non-line of sight launch system (NLOS-LS), while providing fullfunding for the non-line of sight cannon (NLOS-C). The Senate appropriations billprovided the full $3.2 billion requested and the committee report specificallyapproved funding for NLOS-LS. The appropriations conference agreement trimmed$268 million from the program, but included $58.2 million forNLOS-LS.", "Space programs. The House appropriators shifted $91 millionfrom the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program to the Space-BasedInfrared System-High (SBIRS-High) program, as the Air Force requested. Senateappropriators, however, cut $100 million from the EELV due to delays but did notadd anything to SBIRS-High. The appropriations conference agreement cuts $100million from the EELV and adds $91 million to SBIRS-High. The Houseappropriators cut $100 million from the $775 million requested for theTransformational Communications Satellite program, following the Houseauthorization, while the Senate appropriators cut $400 million. The appropriationsconference agreement cuts $300 million, which will require the Air Force tosubstantially restructure the program. The House appropriators essentially terminatedSpace-Based Radar development, leaving $75 million for a more basic technologydevelopment effort, while the Senate appropriators cut $100 million from the $327million requested.

The issue became particularly acute days later when Army Chief of Staff GeneralPeter Schoomaker was asked about it in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearingon February 10. Schoomaker said he was \"concerned ... on how we bridge betweenthe end of this fiscal year and whenever we could get a supplemental in the next year.And I do not have an answer for exactly how we could do that.\" General MichaelHagee, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, echoed Schoomaker's concern.", "In response, the next day, February 11, DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim helda press briefing to explain that Pentagon leaders were sure they could meet Army andMarine Corps requirements into next Spring by \"cash flowing\" regular FY2005appropriations.

DOD and also the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), hesaid, were certain that they could manage FY2005 funding in a similar way. Zakheim also argued that it was appropriate to delay requesting funds for Iraqbecause of great uncertainty about costs, particularly following the planned transferof sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government on June 30.", "Subsequently, a number of related issues emerged.", "One issue is what precedents earlier wars provide. Last year,a CRS memo reported that the initial funding for most conflicts -- from World WarII, to Korea, to Vietnam, to the 1991 Persian Gulf War -- was generally providedthrough supplemental appropriations. (11) That memo did not, however, address fundingfor wars after the initial phases. On that question, the precedents are mixed. Whilethe Korean conflict was financed mainly with supplementals, World War II andVietnam were funded both with supplementals and with regular appropriations. (Fora review of methods used to fund operations since 1991, see CRS Report RL32141 , Funding for Military and Peacekeeping Operations: Recent History and Precedents ,by Jeff Chamberlin.) Vietnam therefore, is the most recent truly comparableexample. In that case, the Administration first asked for a $700 millionsupplemental for FY1965 in May of 1965; then for a $1.7 billion addition to theregular FY1966 defense appropriations bill, which was requested as a budgetamendment in the summer of 1965; and then, in January of 1966, as troop levels inSoutheast Asia were climbing, a supplemental of $12.3 billion for FY1966 andregular appropriations of $10.3 billion for FY1967, both requested when the FY1967budget was submitted. So, in the case of Vietnam, the Johnson Administration askedfor emergency supplementals when necessary, but also requested funds in regularappropriations bills as soon as those bills were on the congressional agenda, eventhough troop levels were in flux and the duration of the conflict could not beforeseen.", "As the defense bills were being marked up, there was also somediscussion in Congress about the adequacy of FY2004 funding for Iraq. In testimonybefore the House Armed Services Committee on April 21, 2004, General RichardMyers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the military services hadidentified a preliminary shortfall of about $4 billion through the end of the fiscalyear. He also said that the Defense Department was in the midst of a budget reviewwhich the service chiefs thought would be able to find enough money in, forexample, underexecuting acquisition programs, to cover the shortfall. General Myersreiterated that assessment in testimony before the Senate Defense AppropriationsSubcommittee on May 12, 2004. In its review of the issue, CRS found that FY2004shortfalls could be substantial but that funds to cover costs are also available, so thatthe Defense Department may, indeed, be able to get through FY2004 (see CRS Report RL32381(pdf) , Adequacy of the Army's FY2004 Funding for Operations in Iraq ,by [author name scrubbed]). More recently, the Government Accountability Office calculatedthat the Defense Department was as much as $12 billion short and would have to haltplanned training and make other substantial changes in plans to pay the bills(Government Accountability Office, Military Operations: Fiscal Year 2004 Costsfor the Global War on Terrorism Will Exceed Supplemental, Requiring DOD to ShiftFunds from Other Uses, GAO-04-915, July 21, 2004). In the end, Congress madethe $25 billion it provided in emergency funds available immediately on enactmentof the legislation, so funds were available in August, and the Administration tappedabout $2 billion for immediate costs.", "A final related issue is whether the Defense Department hasrequested enough money for everyday equipment for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,including equipment for force protection -- that is, for items such as up-armoredHumvees, body armor, robots and other devices for coping with improvisedexplosive devices (IEDs), night vision goggles, and other equipment of immediatevalue to troops on the ground. Senator Jack Reed pointed to a Defense Departmentreprogramming request that would allocate $619 million for urgent Iraq needs. (12) And in theApril 21 House Armed Services Committee hearing with General Myers,Representative Curt Weldon cited a number of shortfalls in such equipment that theArmy identified in its annual unfunded priorities list.

After several years in which mounting budget deficits were apparently ofless interest in Congress than tax cuts, Medicare prescription drug coverage, andincreased benefits for military retirees, old-time deficit cutting religion appeared toundergo a bit of a revival. The Administration proposed a budget plan which it saidwill cut the federal budget in half by FY2009, though there is considerable debateabout whether it would actually accomplish that. In their versions of the FY2005budget resolution, both the House and the Senate imposed somewhat tighterrestrictions on total discretionary spending than the Administration, and the Senatevoted to reimpose procedural restrictions, known as \"PAYGO\" rules, both onincreases in mandatory programs and on reductions in revenues.

Congress passed revisedmeasures to limit deficits in 1987, 1990, 1993, and 1997. It was only after 1998 thatan economic boom, together with several rounds of tax increases and measures tolimit spending, led, though only temporarily, to budget surpluses. The deficit battles,as well as the end of the Cold War, were a major factor affecting defense spending. Adjusted for inflation, the defense budget declined in real terms for 14 straight years,from FY1986 through FY1999, and began to turn up again only in FY2000 as deficitpressures eased.", "The re-emergence of the deficit as an issue, therefore raises an obviousquestion: to what extent might ongoing efforts to control budget deficits eventuallylimit the amounts available for defense? This year, there was a serious debate inCongress about the total amount for defense for the first time in several years. In theSenate, Budget Committee Chairman Don Nickles proposed, and the full committeereported, a budget resolution that reduced the recommended total for national defenseby $6.9 billion below the Administration request. In the House, Budget CommitteeChairman Jim Nussle initially proposed a $2 billion cut in defense in an attempt tomake the point that everything -- even defense -- needed to be on the table to controllong-term spending. While Congress did not, in the end, support cuts in defense, thelong-term budget situation may raise the issue again in the future.", "Congressional Action.

In a floor vote on March 10, however, theSenate approved an amendment by Senator John Warner to restore the funds. In theHouse, Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle dropped his proposal to recommend$2 billion less for defense than the Administration requested. The House resolution( H.Con.Res. 393 ), as reported by the Budget Committee and as passedby the full House, recommended the requested level of funding for national defense,though $2.6 billion of the request was shown in a new budget function for HomelandSecurity.

The Senate, however, never took up the budget resolution. This compelled theSenate to begin acting on FY2005 appropriations bills with the level of funding fortotal discretionary programs set at the level projected in the FY2004 budgetresolution, which was $814 billion in new budget authority.

As a way of coping with the $7 billion gap with theHouse, the Senate Appropriations Committee designated $7 billion in the regularFY2005 defense appropriations bill as \"emergency\" funds. The effect was to allowallocations of funds to other, non-defense appropriations bills to equal the total in theHouse. If House conferees had accepted this approach, it would have freed up $7billion for additional funding for non-defense bills within the $821 billion cap ondiscretionary funding. The House leadership objected. The solution was to includein the FY2005 defense appropriations bill a measure \"deeming\" a total of $821billion in discretionary budget authority to apply in the Senate as in the House.

Many things explain the trend: (1) the steadily growing cost of operating and maintaining new generations of morecapable and sophisticated weapons; (2) efforts to improve the extent and quality ofmilitary training; (3) efforts to ensure that the quality of life in the military keeps upwith the quality of life in the civilian sector as the military has shifted to an allvolunteer, older, more commonly married, and more skilled force (this is reflected,among other things in growing health care costs and in expenditures to operatefacilities); and (4) modest but steady real growth in the compensation of DODcivilian personnel, most of whom are paid with O&M funds.

Efficiency measures -- including base closures, outsourcing,business process reforms, and attempts in the acquisition process to improveweapons reliability -- may have had some effect, but not enough to slow thelong-term trend perceptibly. Experience during the Clinton Administration may bean object lesson. Pentagon officials often projected that O&M costs would level off. When they did not, more money had to be found to make up O&M shortfalls,sometimes at the expense of procurement accounts and at other times from increasesin the defense total.
