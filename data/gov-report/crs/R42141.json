The FLSA requires employers to pay covered employees at least $7.25 an hour and at least one-and-a-half times their regular hourly wage for hours worked over 40 hours a week at a given job. However, the FLSA includes a number of exemptions that exclude certain employees from the minimum wage and overtime standards of the act.", "Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA exempts from both the minimum wage and overtime pay standards of the act any person who is employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional occupation (the EAP exemption). Before 1990, employees in computer-related occupations were exempt if they met the requirements of the EAP exemption.", "In 1990, Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that would allow \"computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other similarly skilled professional workers\" to qualify as exempt executive, administrative, or professional employees under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA. The 1990 legislation also directed Congress to apply the EAP exemption to employees in computer-related occupations if they were paid on an hourly basis at a rate of at least six-and-a-half times the basic federal minimum wage. At the time, the federal minimum wage was $4.25 an hour. Thus, hourly computer employees were exempt if they met the job duties test and were paid at least $27.63 an hour. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a final rule that implemented the 1990 legislation. The regulations treated computer employees as professional employees under the EAP exemption.", "In 1996, Congress amended the FLSA to add a specific exemption for computer employees. The amendments fixed the minimum hourly wage for computer professionals at $27.63 an hour and included in statute much of the regulatory language from the 1992 regulations that defined the primary duties of computer professionals.", "In 2004, DOL issued new regulations that revised the salary and duties tests for the EAP exemption. The regulations also simplified the duties test for computer professionals to reflect the 1996 amendments to the FLSA. Under the 2004 regulations, whether they are paid by the hour (at a minimum rate of $27.63) or the week (at a minimum rate of $455), computer professionals are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime standards of the FLSA if they meet the job duties test provided in regulations.", "Employees in certain computer-related occupations are not exempt and must be paid at least the minimum wage and time-and-a-half for overtime. The exemption for workers in computer occupations does not include employees engaged in the manufacture or repair of computer hardware. Employees whose work is highly dependent on the use of computers but who are not engaged primarily in computer systems analysis, programming, or other similarly skilled computer occupations are not exempt. Depending on their job duties, Information Technology (IT) Support Specialists may not be exempt from the minimum wage and overtime standards of the FLSA.", "In recent Congresses, legislation has been introduced that would expand the statutory exemption for computer employees to include workers whose job duties include network or database analysis and workers who manage or train employees who qualify for the exemption."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets minimum standards for hourly wages, overtime pay, and child labor.

Exemptions apply to higher-paid professional and other employees, employees who may not work a fixed schedule from week to week, and employees whose work hours may be difficult for employers to monitor. In both 1990 and 1996, Congress amended the FLSA to exempt certain computer-related occupations from the minimum wage and overtime standards of the act.", "Under current law, computer systems analysts, programmers, software engineers, and similarly skilled computer employees are exempt from both the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA.

One argument is that no worker should be paid less than a living wage. Another argument is that a fair wage should be paid to workers employed in jobs that require limited skills. A third argument for a minimum wage is that it can increase the purchasing power of low-wage workers and, therefore, raise aggregate demand for goods and services and reduce unemployment. In opposing a minimum wage, others argue that it diminishes the employment opportunities of less-skilled workers and does little to raise the incomes of low-income families\u2014because many low-wage workers do not live in low-income families or because many low-income families do not have earners.", "Requiring employers to pay time-and-a-half for overtime has two policy objectives. First, time-and-a-half is intended to reduce involuntary unemployment. It is argued that paying more for overtime hours can shorten the workweek and increase overall employment. The second reason for overtime pay is to reduce overwork. During debate over the FLSA, proponents argued that some employees work overly long hours, which is harmful to individual health and public safety. Opponents of overtime pay argue that it does not increase employment and amounts to government interference in labor markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FLSA Exemption for Professional Employees", "paragraphs": ["When the Fair Labor Standards Act (P.L. 75-718) was enacted in 1938, Section 13(a)(1) provided an exemption, from both the minimum wage and overtime sections of the act, for bona fide executive, administrative, and professional employees (the EAP exemption). The act did not define the terms executive, administrative, or professional employee. Instead, the law stated that the terms would be defined in regulations issued by the administrator of the newly created Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of DOL. Under regulations issued by the administrator, executive, administrative, and professional employees were exempt if they met both a salary test and a job duties test. ", "Employees in computer occupations may be exempt from the minimum wage and overtime standards of the FLSA under the EAP exemption. In addition, in 1990 Congress amended the FLSA to exempt certain employees in computer-related occupations. Regulations that implemented the 1990 amendments treated computer employees as professional employees. Professional employees include the traditional professions of law and medicine, but they also include engineers, accountants, nurses, social workers, and others. ", "During hearings and debate before the FLSA was passed in 1938, very little was said about the reasons for the exemption for professional employees. The exemption had its roots in the National Industrial Relations Act of 1933 (NIRA, P.L. 73-67). In addition to funding public works projects, the NIRA allowed industries to establish \"codes of fair competition.\" Many of these codes excluded professional employees from any minimum wage and overtime pay requirements.", "Despite limited congressional discussion of the reasons for the professional exemption, two explanations are often given. The most common justification for the exemption is that, compared to less-skilled workers, professional employees are better able to bargain individually over wages, hours, and working conditions. A second explanation is that professional employees may not work a fixed schedule. They may be called on to work evenings or weekends. In addition, if they travel it may be difficult for employers to monitor the total number of hours worked.

The regulations added that the areas where the professional exemption may apply were expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic degrees are offered in new fields and employees who are trained in these fields may be exempt as learned professionals. The regulations said that computer programmers and systems analysts were not learned professionals because there were no universally accepted academic requirements for employment in these occupations. ", "At the time of the 1990 amendments to the FLSA, the EAP exemption applied to employees who met either a \"long\" or a \"short\" test.

Salaried workers had to be paid their full salary for any week in which they worked, regardless of the number of days or hours they worked.
