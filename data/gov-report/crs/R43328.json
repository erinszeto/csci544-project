Often the individual's disability or condition results in the need for hands-on assistance or supervision over an extended period of time. Medicaid plays a key role in covering LTSS to aged and disabled individuals. As the largest single payer of LTSS in the United States, federal and state Medicaid spending accounted for $149.4 billion or 42.5% of all LTSS expenditures in 2015 ($351.8 billion). LTSS are also a substantial portion of spending within the Medicaid program relative to the population served, accounting for 31% of all Medicaid spending in 2015. Of the 68.5 million total enrolled Medicaid population, an estimated 4.1 million (or 5.9%) received LTSS in FY2013.", "Medicaid funds LTSS for eligible beneficiaries in both institutional and home and community-based settings, though the portfolio of services offered differs substantially by state. Moreover, states are required to offer certain Medicaid institutional services to eligible beneficiaries, while the majority of Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) are optional for states. In recent decades, federal authority has expanded to assist states in increasing and diversifying their Medicaid LTSS coverage to include HCBS. As a result, the share of Medicaid LTSS spending for HCBS has nearly tripled, accounting for 18% of Medicaid LTSS spending in 1995 to over half (53%) of total Medicaid LTSS spending in FY2014.", "States now have a broad range of coverage options to select from when designing their LTSS programs. In general, Medicaid law provides states with two broad authorities, which either cover certain LTSS as a benefit under the Medicaid state plan or cover home and community-based LTSS through a waiver program which permits states to disregard certain Medicaid requirements in the provision of these services, subject to approval. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) established or extended several Medicaid state plan options and grant activities to enhance or expand states' LTSS delivery systems. Given the range of available coverage options, states continue to enhance or expand their LTSS delivery systems to cover additional services or target services to specific populations with a focus on HCBS. In FY2016 and FY2017, most states reported activities to expand HCBS (46 and 47 states, respectively), which include expanding Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver authority programs or the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option, among other programmatic changes.", "This report provides a description of the various statutory authorities that either require or otherwise allow states to cover LTSS under Medicaid.

These flexibilities under Medicaid law have led to widespread variation in state Medicaid LTSS benefit packages offered to elderly and disabled individuals.", "One important issue for Medicaid LTSS coverage is its perceived bias in favor of institutional care. The original 1965 Medicaid law established that eligible Medicaid beneficiaries are entitled to nursing facility care. In more recent decades, federal Medicaid statutory authority has expanded to assist states in increasing and diversifying their Medicaid LTSS coverage to include optional HCBS. For example, the addition of the Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver to Medicaid law in 1981 and subsequent statutory amendments that created new Medicaid state plan benefit options have allowed states to further the provision of HCBS. Subsequent legislative and administrative activities to expand Medicaid HCBS, in part, were prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. , which held that the institutionalization of people who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As a result, states have a broad range of coverage options to select from when designing their LTSS programs. Moreover, the share of Medicaid LTSS spending for HCBS has nearly tripled over time, from 18% of Medicaid LTSS spending in FY1995 to over half (53%) of total Medicaid LTSS spending in FY2014.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) further added to the range of options available to states that want to pursue HCBS coverage expansion.

In FY2016 and FY2017, a majority of states reported activities to expand HCBS in 46 and 47 states, respectively. Most states reported using Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver programs or the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option to expand their HCBS offerings (42 states in FY2016 and 41 states in FY2017). About half of states that reported activities to expand HCBS plan to implement or expand the financing and delivery of Medicaid LTSS through managed care arrangements (19 states in FY2016 and 18 states in FY2017).

Thus, there is tremendous state-to-state variation in naming conventions and service definitions across Section 1915(c) waiver programs.", "States must target a Section 1915(c) waiver to a specific population, such as individuals under age 65 with physical disabilities, individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, individuals ages 65 and older, or individuals with mental illness. As a result, states typically have more than one approved Section 1915(c) waiver, with each waiver program offering a specialized package of HCBS to a specific population. On January 16, 2014, CMS released a final rule that provides states the option to combine target groups within one waiver program. Prior to this change, a Section 1915(c) waiver could only serve one of the following three target groups: (1) older adults, individuals with disabilities, or both; (2) individuals with intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, or both; or (3) individuals with mental illness. Whether states use this flexibility to combine waiver target groups into one waiver program, which may reduce the total number of waiver programs both across states and within a state, remains to be seen. Eligible waiver participants must meet certain financial requirements (including income and resource requirements) and state-defined level-of-care criteria that demonstrate the need for LTSS. That is, individuals must have a level of need for LTSS that would otherwise be covered under a Medicaid institutional benefit, such as nursing facility care, Intermediate Care Facility for the Individual with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/ID), or hospital care.", "Under Section 1915(c), the HHS Secretary has the authority to waive Medicaid's \"statewideness\" requirement to allow states to offer HCBS in a limited geographic area. The HHS Secretary may also waive the \"comparability\" requirement that services be comparable in amount, duration, or scope for individuals in particular eligibility categories. States may use the Section 1915(c) waiver to limit the number of individuals served by capping enrollment. The Section 1915(c) waiver is time limited and waiver approvals are subject to reporting and evaluation requirements. State-approved Section 1915(c) waivers must also meet a \"cost-neutrality\" test where average Medicaid expenditures for waiver participants cannot exceed institutional care expenditures that would have been incurred absent the waiver. A majority of states with Section 1915(c) waivers (88%) use cost-containment strategies in addition to the federally mandated cost neutrality requirement, such as fixed expenditure caps either applied to individual participants or in aggregate as well as service limitations, and geographic limits. Expenditures under these waivers are matched at the state's regular FMAP rate.", "In 2013, more than 1.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries were receiving services under Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers. At that time, 47 states and DC offered at least one Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver, with states generally offering multiple waivers targeting HCBS to different groups. Nationwide, there were 289 Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers active in 2013. For FY2014, Medicaid expenditures for Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers were $41.5 billion. The majority of waivers target the aged and disabled populations (48%), followed by waivers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD, 41%), with the remaining 11% targeting other populations such as persons with physical disabilities, children with special health care needs, and individuals with traumatic brain injuries, HIV/AIDS, and mental health needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Projects", "paragraphs": ["Section 1115 provides the HHS Secretary with broad authority to waive certain statutory requirements, thus allowing states to conduct research and demonstration projects under several programs authorized by the SSA, including Medicaid. Under Section 1115, the HHS Secretary may waive Medicaid requirements contained in Section 1902 of the SSA including, but not limited to, \"freedom of choice\" of provider, \"comparability\" of services, and \"statewideness.\" The HHS Secretary may also use Section 1115 waiver authority to provide federal funds for costs that are not otherwise matched under Section 1903 of the SSA. States must submit proposals outlining terms and conditions for proposed waivers to CMS and receive approval before implementing these programs.", "Expenditures under approved Section 1115 waivers are financed through federal and state matching funds at the regular FMAP rate. However, unlike traditional Medicaid, costs associated with Section 1115 waiver programs must be \"budget neutral\" to the federal government over the life of the waiver program. To meet the budget neutrality test, estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the state's existing Medicaid program. For example, costs associated with an expanded population (e.g., those not otherwise eligible under Medicaid), must be offset by spending reductions elsewhere within the Medicaid program. Several methods are used by states to generate cost savings for such waivers such as (1) limiting benefit packages for certain eligibility groups; (2) providing targeted services to certain individuals so as to divert them from full Medicaid coverage; and (3) using enrollment caps and beneficiary cost-sharing to reduce the amounts states must pay. Section 1115 waivers are time limited and approvals are subject to reporting and evaluation requirements.", "Some states use Section 1115 waivers, either in addition to or in lieu of Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers, to provide HCBS to targeted populations. Compared to Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers, the use of Section 1115 waivers offers states some additional flexibilities in the design of the HCBS benefit package, the organization of payments for services, and/or the delivery of care. For example, some states have used Section 1115 waivers to provide HCBS services to beneficiaries under managed care. Other states have used such waivers to allow beneficiaries to self-direct their LTSS by providing them with an individual budget to directly purchase services and hire legally responsible family members (e.g., spouse or parent) to provide care. A state may obtain approval for these practices and a variety of other self-directed activities under a Section 1115 waiver, including (1) changing the Medicaid eligibility requirements (e.g., allowing an individual to have more income and still qualify for Medicaid); or (2) waiving the requirement that the state only pay those agencies, or practitioners, that have provider agreements with the state.", "In 2013, three states (Arizona, Rhode Island, and Vermont) used Section 1115 waivers to administer statewide Medicaid programs that include HCBS instead of Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers. Five states (Delaware, Hawaii, New York, Tennessee, and Texas) use Section 1115 waivers for Medicaid managed care programs that include HCBS for certain populations and/or specific geographic areas in their states in 2013. These states also use Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers for other home and community-based services. For FY2014, Medicaid expenditures for HCBS authorized under managed care authorities, including Section 1115, were $5.9 billion.", "Appendix A. Legislative History of Medicaid Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS)", "Prior to the enactment of Medicaid in 1965, homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by a combination of direct payments made by individuals from their Old Age Assistance benefits, and vendor payments made by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals. The Kerr-Mills Medical Assistance to the Aged program enacted in 1960 (P.L. 86-778) allowed states to provide medical services, including skilled nursing care, to persons who were not eligible for Old Age Assistance cash payments, thereby expanding the covered population.", "In 1965, when Kerr-Mills was incorporated into the new federal-state Medicaid program, Congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care for beneficiaries age 21 and older, requiring all states to offer this service under the expanded program. It also gave skilled nursing facility care the same priority status as hospital and physician services. Subsequent amendments allowed states to provide care in \"intermediate care facilities\" for persons who did not need skilled nursing facility care, but needed assistance beyond room and board alone. In 1987, Congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities (effective in 1990) in the Medicaid program. Medicaid law now refers collectively to these facilities as nursing facilities.", "These early legislative developments helped stimulate growth in the nursing home industry. A significant increase in the number of nursing homes was seen from 1960 to 1970. Over that time period the number of nursing homes more than doubled, from around 9,600 to almost 23,000, and the number of beds more than tripled from 331,000 to more than 1 million. Since 1970, the count of nursing homes nationwide has declined, but the number of beds has increased. For example, in 2014, the total number of nursing homes nationwide totaled 15,600 while the number of beds totaled about 1.7 million.", "Home care services also received some congressional attention in Medicaid's original authorizing statute. Under the 1965 law, home health care was established as one of the optional services that states could provide. In 1968, three years after Medicaid was established, Congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their state Medicaid plans (effective in 1970). Over time, states were authorized to cover other types of home and community-based services (HCBS) as optional benefits under the Medicaid state plan. For example, the optional personal care benefit was first available in 1978. To enable states to make improvements in the management of care for their LTSS beneficiaries and other groups, Congress added an optional case management benefit in 1986.", "Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waivers", "During the 1970s, the former Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) devoted increased attention to alternatives to nursing home care through a variety of federal research and demonstration efforts. These efforts were undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high cost of nursing facility care, but also to respond to the desires of persons with disabilities to remain in their homes and in community-based settings, rather than in institutions. However, it was not until 1981 that Congress took significant legislative action to expand HCBS when it authorized the Medicaid Section 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Waiver Program.", "Congress established the Section 1915(c) waiver program in response to general concerns about the lack of federal funding for home and community-based care. The waiver program was also intended to respond to specific concerns that Medicaid provided far greater support for nursing facility care than home and community-based care. Prior to 1981, many of the non-skilled personal care and supportive services needed by chronically impaired persons to remain in the community were not covered under Medicaid. With approved waiver programs, states were authorized to cover a wide variety of nonmedical, social, and supportive services designed to assist individuals with independent living. ", "The Olmstead Decision", "In 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a landmark case for individuals with disabilities, Olmstead v. L.C. The Court held that institutionalization of people who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This case prompted federal administrative and legislative activities to encourage efforts to provide expanded HCBS to persons with disabilities. Since this time, every state has taken up either the Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver program option or a comparable waiver under the authority of Section 1115 of the SSA, to offer HCBS to certain LTSS beneficiaries. To assist states in Medicaid LTSS delivery system transformation toward HCBS, in FY2001 Congress first appropriated funding for the Real Choice Systems Change Grants for Community Living Program. CMS awarded over 350 grants to states between FY2001 and FY2010 for a total of approximately $288.6 million.", "The Deficit Reduction Act", "Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ), Congress established two optional state plan Medicaid benefits that allow states to cover certain HCBS for eligible beneficiaries. One option gives states the authority to cover a new waiver-like HCBS state plan option (i.e., Section 1915(i) of the SSA) without requiring a Secretary-approved waiver for this purpose. Under this option, states may offer selected benefit packages to targeted populations so as to delay and/or prevent the need for institutional care. The second state plan option, under Section 1915(j) of the SSA, provides states the authority to offer consumer-directed personal care services with features such as individual budgets and the ability to purchase non-traditional goods and services. Among other things, these options incorporated certain elements that had previously only been allowed under Medicaid waivers, giving states greater flexibility to offer HCBS while targeting benefits to certain populations which may assist states in controlling related spending. The DRA also established the Money Follows the Person (MFP) Program, a demonstration grant program to provide assistance to eligible Medicaid beneficiaries who want to move from institutional settings\u2014such as nursing homes\u2014back to their homes or other community residential settings.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) provided a number of new options under Medicaid for states to further efforts to increase coverage of HCBS. First, the ACA added the Community First Choice (CFC) Option, a new authority under Section 1915(k) of the SSA, which authorizes states to offer personal care attendant services, among other services. States that choose this option will receive an increased FMAP rate of 6 percentage points. The ACA also expanded the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option established under the DRA. Among other changes, the ACA increased the amount of income individuals may have to qualify for the benefit and added new flexibility for states to target different benefit packages to specific populations with LTSS needs. In addition, ACA expanded the list of services states may cover to include state-selected services, other than room and board, that are approved by the HHS Secretary, which is similar to Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver programs. The ACA also granted states the option to establish a new Medicaid eligibility pathway for certain qualifying beneficiaries who meet the Section 1915(i) benefit's financial and needs-based criteria. Finally, the ACA established a four-year incentive payment program, referred to as the Balancing Incentive Payments (BIP) Program, and extended the Money Follows the Person (MFP) demonstration through 2016 by providing additional funding to support the original state grantees and to award grants to additional states.", "Appendix B.
