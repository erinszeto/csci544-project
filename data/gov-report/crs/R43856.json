After the Patent Office Building\u2014the home of the U.S. Patent Office from 1842 until 1932\u2014was completed, one of its first uses was to display the European art collection of John Varden, a prominent Washingtonian. While not, perhaps, the first display of art in a federal building in the District of Columbia, the display of Varden's collection was significant as he was named the first \"'curator' of the newly created 'National Institute' for government-owned artistic and historic items,\" and his collection formed the basis of the new institute's collections.", "Upon his death in 1829, James Smithson\u2014a British scientist\u2014bequeathed his fortune to the United States \"to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase & diffusion of knowledge among men.\" In 1846, Congress formally accepted Smithson's gift and founded the Smithsonian Institution. Since then, it has grown to 20 museums in Washington, DC, and New York City. Further, in creating the Smithsonian, Congress consolidated existing \"objects of art, natural history, etc., belonging to the United States in Washington\" into a single organization.", "Since the creation of the Smithsonian Institution, Congress has used its authorizing statute as a template for establishing other museums. These include museums that have become part of the Smithsonian Institution (e.g., the National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of African American History and Culture) and museums that operate independently (e.g., the National Gallery of Art and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum).

In the latter scenario, Congress evaluates the gift offer and decides whether to accept the collection and create a new museum.", "Several examples of donations to the United States have resulted in the creation of new museums. For example, Joseph H. Hirshhorn donated his modern art collections to the Smithsonian. In 1966, Congress authorized the acceptance of Hirshhorn's collection, transferred land on the National Mall to the Smithsonian for a new museum and sculpture gardens, and authorized funds \"necessary for the upkeep, operations, and administration of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\"", "Similarly, in 1937, the National Gallery of Art was created following the donation of artwork and the then to-be-built west building by Andrew W. Mellon.

As part of its final report to Congress, the commission recommended that the national museum \"develop collections that are complementary to, not competitive, with the holdings of local museums,\" with a \"continuing exchange of ideas and specialized knowledge\" and \"reciprocal promotion of mission\" among museums.", "Evaluating a proposed museum's subject matter and potential impact on other museums provides Congress with an understanding of how the new museum might fit into the existing landscape. It could also be important for the proposed museum's ultimate success. Congressionally chartered, federal museums could be seen as having an advantage over privately held or nonprofit museums. With the potential backing of the federal government for collections and/or operational expenses, nonfederal museums could feel that a new federal museum might impede their ability to collect material, draw visitors, and educate the public. ", "For recent authorizations, Congress has authorized commissions to examine these issues in depth. For example, the African American Museum Commission conducted a survey of existing African American museums and found that 87.5% \"supported the establishment of a national museum in Washington, DC,\" while \"12.5% expressed concern that the National Museum would pose competition in terms of attendance, collections, or funding.\" Information gathered by a commission could be valuable for Congress.

Following their recommendations and approvals, Congress could then approve a site location.", "Creating a site selection process might mirror the current process used to select sites for memorials in the District of Columbia. As part of the CWA, Congress created the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee to aid Congress in the evaluation of potential site locations pursuant to specific criteria on the types of memorials that could be placed in various areas of Washington, DC. A similar set of guidelines could be created for the siting of future museums, thus allowing city planners to make recommendations to Congress on where a museum might be located.", "Providing for a process for museum siting could remove control of museum siting from Congress. If, for example, Congress were to cede control over the site selection process and vote only to approve or disapprove a recommended site, individual Members who might otherwise be influential in the congressional debate over a site location might have their influence diminished. If the process is similar to that used under the CWA, individual Members might have to work outside of Congress to influence the recommended site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding", "paragraphs": ["Federal museums in the District of Columbia have historically been completely funded through appropriations. Recent museum authorization statutes, however, have prescribed that design and construction costs be split between federal and nonfederal sources. For example, the National Museum of African American History and Culture statute requires equal cost sharing between federal and nonfederal sources.", "Using a combination of federal and nonfederal funds may provide a museum\u2014regardless of whether it would be located within the Smithsonian\u2014the assurance that at least some of the costs for design and construction are accounted for. Additionally, providing some public funds can serve as an incentive for donors to contribute to the project. In December 2009, G. Wayne Clough, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, testified before the House Committee on Appropriations about the creation of the Smithsonian's Legacy Fund\u2014an appropriation that required the Smithsonian to raise matching funds in order to get access to federal funds\u2014and stated, \"I am confident the new language of the Legacy Fund will be a great incentive for donors.\" ", "Providing federal money as an incentive for donors could reduce the overall federal costs of designing and building a new museum. Relying heavily on private donations can, however, be risky. If donors are not willing to provide continued funding, or if economic situations dictate a change in donation behavior, funding levels could be affected.", "In addition to appropriations for construction, Congress has also previously authorized appropriations for operations. The National Museum of African American History and Culture was authorized $17 million for FY2004 and \"such sums as necessary for each fiscal year thereafter.\" Similarly, the National Museum of the American Indian was authorized $10 million for FY1999 and \"such sums as necessary for each succeeding fiscal year.\" Of recently authorized museums, only the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum was authorized such sums as necessary for all fiscal years. Not all funding for museum operations, however, comes from federal sources. For example, in FY2012, the Holocaust Museum received federal appropriations for approximately 56% of its budget and raised 44% from nonfederal sources.", "Whether to provide appropriations could be a consideration for future museum authorizations. Without federal funds, the museum sponsor group would likely be responsible for raising the necessary funds. Prohibiting federal funds might make future museum creation difficult, as raising funds sufficient to cover the costs of designing and construction of a new museum could be difficult. For example, the proposed National Women's History Museum has been estimated to cost approximately $300 million for design and construction alone. This does not include annual operation costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of Commemorative Works Act", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted to guide the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia.

Recently authorized museums have either been exempt from the CWA (e.g., National Museum of African American History and Culture) or have been located on land not under the jurisdiction of the NPS or GSA (e.g., National Museum of the American Indian and the Holocaust Memorial Museum).", "Whether the CWA applies to museums is an open question. Past statutes suggest that museums are barred more broadly within the District of Columbia\u2014on any lands administered by the NPS or the GSA. The statute that authorized the National Museum of African American History and Culture ( P.L. 108-184 ), for example, specifically exempted the museum from the CWA. As a result of the exemption, the CWA could be interpreted to apply to museums at any District location if they are located on NPS- or GSA-administered land. The CWA does, however, specifically prohibit the placement of a museum in Area I or East Potomac Park.", "Congress could specifically apply the CWA process to museums. This could standardize the process for creating museums in the District of Columbia. Codifying congressional intent could also streamline the museum creation process, set guidelines for the placement of museums in certain locations within the District of Columbia, and clarify the role of third-party organizations for the creation, fundraising, and design of future museums in a manner similar to the CWA for monuments and memorials.", "Congress could also exempt future museums from the CWA, as was done for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Further exemptions would potentially allow museums to be built in almost any agreeable location with the District of Columbia, regardless of statutory prohibitions. Such siting and building would still likely need approval from the agencies tasked with oversight over the District of Columbia\u2014the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Since before James Smithson's gift to the United States, Congress authorized most new federal museums in the District of Columbia. That involvement continues today with current legislative proposals for a new National Museum of the American Latino and a National Women's History Museum. The process used to create new museums has varied historically. In some cases, Congress has accepted donations of collections and buildings from prominent citizens (e.g., the National Gallery of Art and the National Museum of the American Indian). In other instances, Congress has taken the recommendation of presidential and congressional advisory commissions to create new museums (e.g., the Holocaust Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture). In authorizing a new museum, Congress could decide whether it should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, part of another agency, or a stand-alone entity. These decisions could be made with or without a private sector donation or a commission's recommendations. ", "Recent practices suggest that the use of commissions to make recommendations on the potential creation of a new museum has been prevalent over the last 30 years. Using an advisory commission to make recommendation on future museums can provide Congress with valuable information, as the commission's members are subject matter experts in the proposed museum's subject and museum management. Following the issuance of a commission's report, which could address virtually any topic Congress believes is relevant, Congress can make a decision about the museum's subject matter, funding, location, management and operations, and whether the CWA should apply.", "The desire to continue to build new museums does not seem likely to abate in the coming years. How new proposals might be considered and if any standard process should be applied to the museum evaluation and authorization process could be a useful tool for Congress. Since the number of museum proposals, however, is generally not large in any given Congress, prescribing specific processes for the evaluation of new museum ideas might not be necessary or warranted."], "subsections": []}]}}
