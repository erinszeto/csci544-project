DARPA, for example, has a built-in customer (the U.S. military), which ARPA-E does not have. Further, some analysts have argued that industrial relationships and characteristics of the energy sector (including powerful incumbent firms and the wide array of energy-dependent products) have the potential to stop the dissemination of disruptive innovations. It is not clear whether these early concerns have become actual challenges for ARPA-E, or whether ARPA-E has been able to adjust and respond to its unique position. It is also possible that factors perceived (rightly or wrongly) as key to the success of DARPA may not be as important to the success of ARPA-E.", "Other early congressional concerns focused on whether ARPA-E would compete with, duplicate, or otherwise undermine other DOE research units, such as the Office of Science, and on whether the agency would focus too closely on late-stage technology development and commercialization activities that some policymakers perceive as best left to the private sector. The Government Accountability Office investigated such concerns in 2012 and found that ARPA-E had taken steps to avoid duplication with other DOE offices and that \"most ARPA-E projects could not have been funded solely by the private sector.\""], "subsections": []}]}}
