With headquarters in Fort Belvoir, VA, DLA operates three supply centers: DLA Aviation, DLA Land and Maritime, and DLA Troop Support. Military uniforms are procured through DLA Troop Support in Philadelphia, PA.", "DLA Troop Support is responsible for procuring nearly all of the food, clothing, and medical supplies used by the military, including about 90% of the construction material used by troops in the field, and repair parts for aircraft, combat vehicles, and other weapons system platforms. According to DLA Troop Support's website, \"Each year, DLA Troop Support supplies and manages over $13.4 billion worth of food, clothing and textiles, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and construction and equipment supplies in support of America's warfighters worldwide and their eligible dependents.\" Within DLA Troop Support, the Clothing and Textile (C&T) Directorate supplies more than 8,000 different items ranging from uniforms to footwear and equipment.

The Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) site is the electronic, government-wide entry point for information on all federal government contracts over $25,000; DOD Instruction 4160.1-R, DOD Supply Chain: Materiel Management Regulation, which describes the process of materiel management within the DOD supply chain system; and DOD Instruction 4140.63, Management of DOD Clothing and Textiles (Class II), which outlines the authority, policy, and responsibilities for the management of the DOD clothing and textiles, and directs the establishment of the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board.", "In addition, military uniforms are procured in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), DLA's own internal regulations, the Berry Amendment, and the Buy American Act (BAA). The Berry Amendment (Title 10 U.S.C. 2533a), which dates from the eve of World War II, was established for a narrowly defined purpose: to ensure that U.S. troops wore military uniforms wholly produced in the United States and that U.S. troops were fed food products wholly produced in the United States. ", "There are exceptions to the Berry Amendment that waive the domestic source restrictions. One such exception allows DOD to purchase specialty metals and chemical warfare protective clothing from countries where the United States has entered into reciprocal procurement memoranda of understanding (MOUs).", "A Deputy Secretary of Defense's memorandum of May 1, 2001, stated that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and the Secretaries of the military services have the authority to determine that certain items under the Berry Amendment are not available domestically in quantities or qualities that meet military requirements. Such decisions are called \"domestic nonavailability determinations\" or DNADs. This authority may not be re-delegated. Use of DNADs requires an analysis of the alternatives and certification of the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Are Military Uniforms Procured?", "paragraphs": ["Military uniforms are generally procured through competitive contracts. C&T maintains access to a variety of supplies and uniform-related products. C&T specialists may also procure textiles and materials directly from the textile industry, and then provide textiles and materials to the contractors.

Prospective bidders should obtain specifications prior to submitting an offer. ", "According to DFARS Parts 204, 212, and 252, contractors must first register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to the administration of contract awards, basic ordering agreements, or blanket purchase agreements, unless the award results from a solicitation issued on or before June 1, 1998. ", "DLA has stated on its website that price is not always the sole determination in contract awards, as described here.", "Many of our acquisitions (most notably our negotiated acquisitions) involve a review of a contractor's technical capability; corporate experience; quality; past performance and surge capability (as well as price). This methodology is used because it makes good business sense and ensures reliable contractors with proven performance records will deliver quality products at the lowest possible costs. This concept, known as Best Value, is defined as any competitive negotiated acquisition where the contracting officer uses discriminating factors, in addition to price, in the evaluation of proposals and award of a contract. Within DLA Troop Support, this would encompass virtually all our awards with the exception of low price, technically acceptable source selection and sealed bidding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Initiatives Passed that Affect Military Uniform Procurement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 352 of P.L. 113-66, the NDAA for FY2014", "paragraphs": ["Section 352 of 113-66, the NDAA for FY2014, requires all military services to adopt and field a joint combat camouflage uniform by October 1, 2018.
