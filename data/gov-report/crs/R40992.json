The Basic Law stipulates that the \"ultimate aim\" is the selection of Hong Kong's Chief Executive and the members of its Legislative Council (Legco) by \"universal suffrage.\" However, it does not designate a specific date by which this goal is to be achieved.", "On November 18, 2009, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen released the long-awaited \"consultation document\" on possible reforms for the city's elections to be held in 2012. The document was immediately met by sharp criticism from representatives of Hong Kong's \"pro-democracy\" parties. Five Legco members resigned on January 21, 2010, as a form of protest, forcing a by-election on May 16, 2010. The five incumbents were re-elected.", "On June 7, 2010, Chief Executive Tsang submitted two motions to Legco increasing the size of the Election Committee (EC) for Chief Executive to 1,200 members and adding 10 new seats to Legco\u2014five elected by geographical districts and five elected by \"functional constituencies.\"", "Initially, the pan-democratic Legco members announced they would vote against the motions. However, a last-minute agreement between the pro-universal suffrage Democratic Party and the Chinese government led to a split among the pan-democrats, a coalition of parties that support a more rapid transition to universal suffrage. Legco passed both motions\u2014one on June 24; the second on June 25\u2014the first significant changes in Hong Kong's political system since the Handover on July 1, 1997.", "To implement the election changes, Legco will need to pass enabling ordinances detailing how to carry out the election reforms. On December 10, 2010, Chief Executive Tsang submitted two bills to amend Hong Kong's election laws. The bill governing the election of the Chief Executive specifies how the additional EC members are to be allocated and sets the nomination threshold at 150 EC members. The bill governing the 10 new Legco seats will allow the Electoral Affairs Commission to determine how to allocate the five geographical seats (based on population projections) and establishes a \"District Council (second) functional constituency\" to elect the other five new Legco members. Under the new law, every Hong Kong voter will be able to vote for at least one functional constituency member of Legco.", "The 2012 election reforms are important to Hong Kong's democratization for two reasons. First, they are an indication of the Hong Kong government's willingness to press for democratic reforms. Second, the Chief Executive and Legco selected in 2012 will have the power to implement universal suffrage for the Chief Executive election in 2017 and the Legco election in 2020, if they so choose.

As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong. This will remain equally true after June 30, 1997.\" Section 301 of the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act required an annual report from the State Department to Congress on the status of Hong Kong, which was to include a description of \"the development of democratic institutions in Hong Kong.\" Section 202 gave the President the authority to suspend Hong Kong's separate treatment from China if he determines that China is not fulfilling \"the terms, obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint Declaration with respect to Hong Kong.\"", "The 111 th Congress continued past congressional interest in Hong Kong's quest for democracy. On March 11, 2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ) appropriated not less than $17 million for \"the promotion of democracy in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan \u2026\"", "In addition, China's stance on Hong Kong's democratization may also signal its intentions regarding political reforms on the Mainland and its preferred path to reunification with Taiwan. China's formulation of the \"one country, two systems\" policy in 1981 not only formed the legal basis for Hong Kong's Handover, it also provided China's framework for future relations with Taiwan. Given Taiwan's recent advances in democracy, it is uncertain if the \"one country, two systems\" model remains viable, especially if China appears reluctant to allow significant political change in Hong Kong. ", "Under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the city's quasi-constitution, the \"ultimate aim\" is the selection of Hong Kong's Chief Executive and the members of its Legislative Council (Legco) by \"universal suffrage.\" However, the Basic Law also stipulates that the selection of the Chief Executive and the Legco members is to be done \"in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.\" In addition, the Basic Law requires that any change in Hong Kong's election process be approved by both the Chief Executive and two-thirds of the Legco members.", "Over the last 12 years, the issue of democratic reforms has been one of the preeminent political concerns in Hong Kong. Efforts by the Hong Kong government to modify Hong Kong's election system have been stymied by local opposition or intervention by the Chinese government. Proposed changes for Hong Kong's elections of 2007 and 2008 were rejected by Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) in 2005. Formal consideration of possible democratic reforms for the 2012 elections was terminated in December 2007 when China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) issued a decision precluding universal suffrage, but allowing for some limited reforms for the 2012 elections. Since then, there has been an active and vibrant debate over if and when Hong Kong will establish a fully democratic election system.", "On June 24 and 25, 2010, Hong Kong made the first significant changes in its election system since the 1997 Handover. Legco passed a motion on June 24 that expanded the size of the selection committee for the Chief Executive from 800 to 1,200 members starting with the 2012 election. The following day, Legco passed a second motion that increased its size from 60 to 70 members\u201435 elected by geographical districts and 35 selected by so-called \"functional constituencies.\" These two motions\u2014which only days before looked destined to be defeated\u2014were passed because of a last-minute agreement between Hong Kong's pro-universal suffrage Democratic Party and representatives of China's central government.", "To some, the passage of the two motions is the first step in Hong Kong's gradual progress towards universal suffrage. To others, the brokered last-minute agreement may prove to be a setback for Hong Kong's democratic development, as it has caused a rift among the pan-democratic coalition and major infighting among the Democratic Party. More may be known about the implications of the passage of the two motions when Legco considers implementing ordinances for the election reforms. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Background", "paragraphs": ["From 1842 to 1997, Hong Kong was a British Crown Colony, ruled by a Governor appointed by the Queen of England. In 1843, the British Parliament passed legislation establishing a Legislative Council (Legco) in Hong Kong\u2014appointed by the Governor\u2014to advise the Governor and his administration. Over time, Legco's powers were expanded, giving the body an effective veto over the decisions of the Governor. In addition, the appointed Legco was transformed into a semi-democratic institution. Despite these changes, for over 150 years, Hong Kong's political system mainly consisted of a more powerful Governor and a less powerful Legco.", "In 1985, Legco had its first \"elected\" members, including 12 selected by \"functional constituencies\"\u2014professional or special interest groups considered important for the economic and social well-being of Hong Kong. Ten years later, Hong Kong's last Legco under British rule was selected under political reforms proposed by Governor Chris Patten. The final British Legco consisted of 60 members\u201420 elected by regional plebiscites, 10 selected by a special Election Committee, and 30 selected by 29 functional constituencies. Other important aspects of Patten's reforms were the abolishment of \"corporate\" votes in the functional constituencies and the expansion of the functional constituencies so that most adults in Hong Kong could vote in one of the functional constituencies.", "While many hailed Patten's reforms as a belated effort to implement democratic reforms in Hong Kong, the Chinese government viewed the Governor's actions as a violation of the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong (the Joint Declaration), the official document governing the transfer of Hong Kong. Although the Joint Declaration made provision for the separate legislative power in Hong Kong, it also stipulated that the \"laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged.\" The Chinese government maintained that Patten's Legco reforms were inconsistent with this provision of the Joint Declaration. China subsequently reversed Patten's reforms by abolishing the 1995 Legco and seating the Provisional Legislative Council after the Handover.", "A political movement for democracy in Hong Kong arose even before the end of British rule. A few of Hong Kong's political parties\u2014most notably, the Democratic Party and the Frontier Party\u2014began advocating the election of the Chief Executive and Legco by universal suffrage as soon as possible. Other Hong Kong political parties\u2014in particular, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and the Liberal Party\u2014supported a more gradual and cautious approach to election reforms."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Basic Law and Hong Kong Elections", "paragraphs": ["The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China was passed by the National People's Congress on April 4, 1990, establishing the new government structure for Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty. Much like under British rule, the Basic Law created an executive-led government, headed by a Chief Executive, as well as a representative legislature called the Legislative Council (Legco). The first Chief Executive chosen after the Handover was to be selected by an Election Committee consisting of 800 people, chosen by the Chinese government, and equally divided among four \"sectors\" of Hong Kong society. The first post-Handover Legco was to consist of 60 members, some elected based on geographical districts and some selected by functional constituencies.", "Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law state that the \"ultimate aim\" is the selection of Hong Kong's Chief Executive and the members of Legco by \"universal suffrage.\" The processes of reforming the selection process for the Chief Executive and Legco are specified in Annex I and II of the Basic Law. Both annexes precluded changes in the election process until after 2007. To amend the selection process for the Chief Executive, Annex I stipulates that the proposal must be endorsed by two-thirds of Legco, consented to by the Chief Executive, and approved by the NPCSC. To amend the selection process for Legco, Annex II requires the proposal must be endorsed by two-thirds of Legco, consented to by the Chief Executive, and \"reported to\" the NPCSC. As a result, both the Chief Executive and Legco in office must approve changes in Hong Kong's election laws, including the transition to universal suffrage.", "Following the Handover, democratic reforms emerged as one of the main political issues in Hong Kong. The \"pan-democracy\" parties and other organizations (such as Basic Law Article 45 Concern Group) continually pressured the first Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, and the Hong Kong government to take steps to advance democracy in Hong Kong. On March 10, 2005, Tung submitted his resignation in part because of public dissatisfaction with his failure to support universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

There was apparent widespread opposition to the proposal, as indicated by the large turnout at a December 4, 2005, rally for democracy in Hong Kong. Among the main objections to the proposal were the inclusion of non-elected District Council members on the Election Committee, the expansion of the number of functional constituency seats in Legco, and the lack of a roadmap to universal suffrage. On December 21, 2005, Tsang's proposal failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds vote in Legco when 24 \"pro-democracy\" members voted against the measure.", "The failure to amend the election process in 2005 meant that the 2007 Chief Executive election and the 2008 Legco election would take place under the existing system. The focus of Hong Kong's democratic movement shifted to the concurrent Chief Executive and Legco elections scheduled for 2012. Chief Executive Tsang initiated a process of public consultation on the subject of \"constitutional development,\" that involved the formation of the Commission on Strategic Development to study the issue of universal suffrage in Hong Kong. The pro-democracy forces advocated the selection of the Chief Executive and all members of Legco by universal suffrage in the 2012 elections, while others favored more modest, incremental election reforms.

However, the decision also stated that the Chief Executive may be directly elected by universal suffrage in 2017, provided certain conditions were met. The NPCSC also decided that all members of the Legco may be elected by universal suffrage after the direct election of Chief Executive has taken place, effectively setting 2020 as the first possible year for fully democratic Legco elections.", "However, the NPCSC's decision also indicated that it was possible to make changes in election procedures before 2017, subject to certain constraints. While the Chief Executive would still be selected by the Election Committee, it was possible to alter the size, constitution, and regulations governing the conduct of the Election Committee. Also, while the 50-50 split between the geographical and functional constituency seats in Legco could not be altered, the number of seats in Legco could be changed and the nature of the functional constituencies could be amended or revised.", "A final important element of the decision was its specification of the process whereby changes in Hong Kong's election system were to be made.

The purpose of the Consultation Document was to identify for the public the key issues to be considered when proposing amendments for Hong Kong's 2012 elections and narrowing the list of possible amendments to propose to Legco after the public consultation is completed in February 2010. Regarding the Chief Executive election process, the document identified five key issues: (1) the number of members in the Election Committee; (2) the composition of the Election Committee; (3) the electorate base of the Election Committee; (4) the nomination process for Chief Executive candidates; and (5) the political affiliation of the Chief Executive. Regarding the Legco election process, there are only three key issues identified: (1) the number of seats in Legco; (2) the electorate base of the functional constituencies; and (3) restrictions on the number of seats that can be held by people who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries. In addition to identifying various alternatives associated with these eight key issues, the consultation document indicated the view of the Hong Kong government at this time on each of these issues. Table 2 lists the Hong Kong government's recommendations.", "Most of the key issues and the Hong Kong government's views are self-explanatory, except for those involving the \"electorate base\" of the Election Committee and the functional constituencies. Under the current system, the registered \"voters\" for some of the functional constituency seats in Legco are corporations and other legal entities, not people. In addition, when selecting representatives to the Election Committee, some of the \"voters\" are corporations. Critics of this system see this as an anti-democratic provision that violates the goal of election by universal suffrage. It had been suggested that the voting rights be transferred to the specific directors or executives of the corporations or entities in question.", "The release of the Consultation Document was viewed by some as Tsang breaking his campaign promise to provide a \"final resolution\" for universal suffrage. While the document contains analysis and recommendations on possible reforms for the 2012 elections (see Table 2 below), it purposely avoids presenting a roadmap or blueprint for Hong Kong's eventual election of the Chief Executive and Legco by universal suffrage.

Chan's other major concern about the proposal was the setting the threshold for District Council functional constituency seat nomination at 15; the CCCD consider 10 a more reasonable number.", "Chan's criticisms of the proposed legislation were echoed in an article by Robert Keatley, published in the January 2011 issue of the Hong Kong Journal . Keatley states that \"pro-democracy parties\" in Hong Kong would have preferred more diversity in the additional 400 members of the Election Commission. He also points to the disparities in the size of the electorates for the functional constituencies and the creation of \"super-legislators.\" ", "During a press conference announcing the pending submission of the two bills, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam Sui-lung was asked about the decision to have candidates for the five new functional constituency seats run in a single election rather than divided them into five smaller districts. Secretary Lam stated that the Hong Kong government thought the proposed arrangement would be a fair arrangement to enable Hong Kong people to choose political parties, large and small, as well as independent candidates to represent them. ", "Another important factor will be how the Chinese government responds to the proposed legislation. Some analysts have speculated that the Chinese government may question the creation of \"super-legislators\" who can claim greater public support than the Chief Executive. It is possible that, if the \"pro-democratic parties\" successfully modify the legislation to eliminate the \"super-legislators,\" the Chinese government may support the changes. By contrast, most analysts surmise that the Chinese government supports the proposed process for expanding the Election Committee.

Given that Hong Kong is an executive-led government, the 2017 Chief Executive election may be more crucial, especially given that the transition to universal suffrage for Legco elections is conditional upon the achievement of universal suffrage in the Chief Executive election. However, since Legco has the ability to block proposed policy changes by the Chief Executive, reforms of Legco elections in 2012 and 2016 are also important.", "The path from nomination and selection of the Chief Executive by the Election Committee to the election of the Chief Executive by a popular plebiscite appears to be less problematic. The current speculation is that the Election Committee will be transformed into a purely nominating body, which will fulfill a condition specified in Article 45 of the Basic Law. Once the nominees have been selected, the public will then elect the Chief Executive, subject to the approval of the NPCSC. It is generally thought that the transformation of the Election Committee into a nominating committee will provide the Chinese government with enough insurance that the elected Chief Executive will be approved by the NPCSC, thereby avoiding an embarrassing and unpleasant situation.", "The main potential source of political struggle over the election of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage will be the size and constituency of the members of the nominating committee. In general, the pan-democrats would prefer a larger committee consisting of more elected members with a lower nomination requirement. By contrast, the Chinese government and its sympathizers in Hong Kong support a smaller nominating committee that is largely based on the Election Committee and a higher nomination requirement. Where the balance of these two forces lies is difficult to determine at this time.", "The path for the transformation of Legco into a body in which all members are elected by universal suffrage is more difficult to see, especially given the 2010 reforms. One of the fundamental dilemmas of Hong Kong's democratization process is the condition that any changes must be approved by two-thirds of the Legco members. At present, that means at least 10 of the functional constituency members must vote in favor of the proposed reforms; in the future it will require at least 12. However, both of the most commonly discussed scenarios for a fully democratic Legco imply a loss of power for the existing functional constituency members of Legco or voters in their electoral base.", "There are two leading scenarios by which Legco can be transformed into a body elected by universal suffrage. The first scenario involves the elimination of the functional constituencies, transforming Legco into a body with members elected only by geographical districts. The second scenario retains functional constituency seats, but either redefines their electoral base or increases the number of functional constituencies so that every voter in Hong Kong can vote in at least one functional constituency. There is skepticism that enough functional constituency members of the current Legco, or the members to be elected in 2012 and 2016, will be willing to eliminate their seats as of 2020. Similarly, it is unclear if enough members of Legco will support the second scenario, given the implicit dilution of their power.
