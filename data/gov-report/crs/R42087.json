Heightened concern over the national debt crisis, the economic recession, and stubbornly high unemployment has resulted in renewed congressional interest in the cost and effectiveness of the system. This report reviews various reform proposals and presents several potential options for Congress, ranging from maintaining the current system to a national commission to review military compensation, benefits, and retirement.", "The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit plan which guarantees a specific monthly payment after 20 or more years of service. Vesting occurs at 20 years of service, regardless of age, and is therefore an \"all or nothing\" proposition. Retirement age varies, but most military retirees are young enough to pursue private-sector careers following their military service. Most observers note that ,while effective as a retention tool, military retirement is also very expensive\u2014in FY2010 there were 2,271,000 retirees and survivors receiving a total of $50.842 billion from the federal government. However, because of the way the government accounts for military retirement, the direct cost to the Department of Defense (DOD) is significantly less. In FY2009, DOD paid $17.5 billion to the Military Retirement Fund to fund the future retirement of the military cohort who entered the military during 2009.", "Critics of the military retirement system frequently cite several points in addition to cost: (1) It is inefficient because it defers too much compensation until the completion of a military career; (2) It is inflexible because it does not facilitate force management or encourage longer careers; and (3) It is inequitable because most servicemembers never qualify or vest.", "The military retirement system has evolved over time (see \"Major Legislative Reforms of Military Retirement\"). Today, active component servicemembers choose between two retirement systems at their 15th year of service (either High-3 or Redux), reservists are restricted to one system (a modified version of High-3), and disability retirees also have the opportunity to choose between two systems (High-3 or Disability retirement). Many observers have agreed that a reformed retirement system could enhance retention, provide an improved force management tool, and provide an equitable retirement regardless of component or special situation. A review of past legislative proposals finds that they have been controversial, unpopular with DOD and servicemembers, and generally focused on reducing the cost of military retirement. The Redux option, in particular, has become a less attractive option and fewer and fewer servicemembers are selecting it.", "The cost factor, combined with the recent emphasis on reducing costs in DOD and the overall federal deficit, resulted in a number of studies, commissions and reports in 2010. However, these efforts did not result in comprehensive policy changes. In addition to the most recent commission and think tank reports, two other efforts within the past five years included detailed recommendations for retirement reform. The 2005 Defense Advisory Committee on Military Compensation (DACMC) established a framework for a comprehensive restructuring of military retirement. This was followed in 2008 by the 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) that further modeled, refined, and amplified on the work of the DACMC. Both efforts supported applying a reformed military retirement system to new entrants only; currently serving and already retired members would be grandfathered."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the 1948 Hook Commission, few military subjects have generated as much interest or commentary as the military retirement system.

As Congress addresses the deficit, the escalating cost of military retirement is an area of concern. ", "Positions on the issue of military retirement reform can range from intense criticism to intense support among the community of defense manpower analysts, politicians, veterans support organizations, and military personnel. Those who are critical generally find fault with the 20-year \"cliff\" vesting, the generous retirement benefits to youthful beneficiaries, the overall cost of the system, the lack of force management flexibility, and the inefficiency of the system. Those who defend the current 20-year retirement system argue that it is compensation for a career of arduous, and frequently hazardous, service and sacrifice for the nation and that it is relatively consistent with retirement systems for other high-risk occupations. Others view the retirement annuity as a \"retainer\" since retired military personnel can be recalled to active duty at any time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Retirement System", "paragraphs": ["The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit system that is viewed as a significant incentive in retaining a career military force.

These retirement variations are all separate but interrelated. Retired pay is subject to federal income tax. ", "Active duty personnel become eligible for retirement by completing 20 years of service, regardless of age, but may, under certain conditions, remain on active duty for up to 40 years. Retirement eligibility for reserve component personnel is based on \"points\" and equivalent years of service but reservists do not generally begin to receive their retired pay until age 60. Those who are retired due to physical disability will receive retired pay regardless of their length of service. Disability retirement offers a choice between two retirement options: one based on years of service and one on the severity of the disability. Servicemembers who voluntarily separate prior to completing the minimum 20 years of service will generally receive no retirement benefits.", "The military retirement system shares some similarities with private sector retirement systems, but it exists for very different purposes. According to the Department of Defense, military retirement is intended to support:", "\"The provision of a socially acceptable level of payments to members and former members of the Armed Forces during their old age. The provision of a retirement system that will enable the Armed Forces to remain generally competitive with private-sector employers and the Federal Civil Service. The provision of a pool of experienced military manpower that can be called upon in time of war or national emergency to augment the active-duty forces of the United States, and the establishment of a mechanism whereby persons in this pool can move into and out of active duty smoothly. The provision of a socially acceptable means of keeping the military forces of the United States young and vigorous, thereby insuring promotion opportunities for younger members.\" ", "Military retirees are subject to an involuntary recall to active duty and therefore remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice to enforce the recall authority. In contrast to many private sector plans, the military retirement system also does not provide for the gradual vesting of benefits, it is an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition based on serving a minimum of 20 years.

This amount is multiplied by 2.5% for each full year of service (plus 1/12 th for each complete month less than a full year) and then multiplied again by the number of years of service. The product of 2.5% and years of service is referred to as the Computation Base. As a result, a servicemember who completes exactly 20 years of service will retire with 50% of their final monthly base pay, a member with 30 years of service will retire with 75% of their final base pay and a member with 40 years of service will retire with 100% of their final base pay.", "An active duty member who entered the service prior to September 8, 1980 will have at least 31 years of service by the end of 2011.

At this point (age 62), the Redux and High-3 retirement pays are equal. However, the CPI then reverts back to the previous formula of CPI minus 1% after age 62 and there are no further adjustments.", "At no point in time does the accrual under Redux exceed that under the High-3 system.

In the six decades since then, there have only been three significant modifications or reforms of the system, mostly focused on the cost of the system. In 1980, the Final Pay methodology was changed to the High-3 calculation. Six years later, a major reform initiative, focused on saving $2.9 billion, resulted in the \"1986 Act\" or Redux plan. Redux reduced the retirement benefit at 20 years from 50% to 40% but kept it the same at 30 years of service (75%) to encourage longer careers. It also reduced the annual Cost-of-Living (COLA) increase by 1% per year until age 62. By 2000, Congress was convinced that Redux had a negative impact on retention and allowed servicemembers to choose either High-3 or Redux, while adding a $30,000 Career Status Bonus to the Redux plan to incentivize participation.

To the contrary, the Department of Defense is steadfastly opposed to the significant degradation in future combat readiness that would result from the changes required to achieve the mandated reduction. I am particularly concerned about the potential loss of mid-level leadership and technical know-how so vital to the defense mission.

Cox, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel stated:", "we opposed both of these alternatives. We believe that the deep cut in retirement benefits associated with either alternative will severely hamper our ability to retain the high quality personnel we need, and would therefore pose an unacceptable risk to our future combat readiness.

To incentivize longer careers, it increases the multiplier to 3.5% per year between years 20 and 30 and would thus equal 75% of High-3 at 30 years of service. Since the 75% cap on retired pay was lifted, Redux increases the multiplier by 2.5% per year between years 30 and 40. As a result, compared to the High-3 method, Redux pays less for 20 to 29 years of service but the same as High-3 for 30 years of service and beyond.

This annual amount paid into the Fund will earn interest until the funds are distributed to pay future retirees through the General Fund of the Treasury. As noted in Table 1 , in FY2010 there was a total of $50.842 billion paid to 2,271,000 military retirees and survivors from the Military Retirement Fund within the U.S. Treasury.

Basic pay is a primary factor in all of the formulas for determining retired pay. As basic pay increases, the cost of future retirement also increases. Over the past 10 years, basic pay has increased by nearly 37% in part to offset inflation and in part to increase the attractiveness of military service during continued combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These increases will be reflected in higher retired pay in the future.", "The military retired pay COLA has been inflation-protected since 1986 and indexed to increases in the CPI, a system similar to the inflation protection provided to Social Security recipients. Since 2002, COLA has increased by nearly 21.7% for those retired under the Final Pay and High-3 systems (1% less annually for those retired under the Redux system).", "Another aspect of the cost issue is the fact that military retirees begin receiving their monthly retirement annuity immediately, regardless of age. The average enlisted member is 42 years old and has 22 \u00bd years of service at retirement while the average officer is almost 45 years old and has nearly 24 years of service. In contrast, other public and private sector retirement plans typically do not begin providing an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65, although the age is often lower for those in 'high risk\" public sector jobs such as firefighting and law enforcement.

So even though \"retired\" and receiving retired pay, a second public or private-sector career is usually essential.

Current and previous studies have recommended different vesting formulas from 5 years (to be consistent with many private-sector pension plans) to 10 or 15 years. Others have recommended some type of transition or separation pay as either a deferred annuity or as a lump sum payment. However, the 20-year vesting rule has been maintained.", "Some observers also note that a 20-year retirement encourages relatively short military careers during a time of lengthening life spans and longer careers in the private sector. These observers disagree with the military's emphasis on youth and vigor. To gain perspective on whether a 20-year career and immediate receipt of retired pay is appropriate, it may be useful to compare it with other \"hazardous\" or \"arduous\" occupations. ", "One possible comparison is with federal law enforcement professionals, fire fighters, air traffic controllers, and nuclear waste management personnel. These federal employees become eligible for an immediate annuity after 25 years of service which compares favorably with the military eligibility requirement of 20 YOS. As a result, most of these special category federal employees are also under the age of 55 at retirement. Table 4 compares the FERS retirement requirements with the requirements for these special category personnel and the current military retirement system. ", "Another aspect of the \"youth and vigor\" argument involves the health concerns as the military population ages. The military has emphasized youth, vigor and physical fitness since before WWII. However, today's force is somewhat older because its all-volunteer and more heavily reliant on the reserve component. In 2010, 62% of the active duty force was 25 years old or older and 37% was 30 or above. Statistics from ten years of U.S. combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan confirm that older servicemembers are more vulnerable to injuries and more likely to face long recoveries. According to many experts, youth and vigor remain important, so retirement eligibility at 20 YOS may still be the most appropriate approach.
