Senators are also mindful that Justices\u2014unlike persons elected to legislative office or confirmed to executive branch positions\u2014receive the opportunity to serve a lifetime appointment during good behavior.", "The appointment of a Supreme Court Justice might or might not proceed smoothly.

Of the 44 nominations that were not confirmed, 12 were rejected outright in roll-call votes by the Senate, while nearly all of the rest, in the face of substantial committee or Senate opposition to the nominee or the President, were withdrawn by the President, or were postponed, tabled, or never voted on by the Senate.

A new appointee to the Court, Senators recognize, could have a potentially decisive impact on the Court's currently perceived ideological \"balance\" and on whether past rulings of the Court will be upheld, modified, or overturned in the future.

In that debate, some Thomas supporters argued that the Senate, as a rule, should defer to the President's judgment concerning a nominee except when unfavorable information is presented overcoming the presumption in the nominee's favor.

In previous Congresses, the typical practice in calling up a Supreme Court nomination was for the majority leader to consult with the minority leader and interested Senators and to ask for unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session and consider the nomination. The leader asked for unanimous consent to proceed to executive session to consider the nomination immediately, or at some specified time in the future.", "A unanimous consent request also could include a limit on the time that will be allowed for debate and specify the date and time on which the Senate will vote on a nomination.

Conversely, if the Senate agrees by unanimous consent to consider a nomination, but does not provide for a time limit on debate or specify when, or under what circumstances, a Senate vote will take place, extended debate is possible, although not necessarily inevitable.

In 1986, a cloture motion was filed on a third Supreme Court nomination, this time of sitting Associate Justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice.

The 48 opposition votes would have been more than enough to defeat a cloture motion if one had been filed.

In fact, however, the new Justice actually takes two oaths of office\u2014a judicial oath, as required by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and a constitutional oath, which, as required by Article VI of the Constitution, is administered to Members of Congress and all executive and judicial officers. ", "Until recently, the most common practice of new appointees had been to take their judicial oath in private, usually within the Court, and, as desired by the Presidents who nominated them, to take their constitutional oaths in nationally televised ceremonies at the White House. In 2009, however, in a departure from that practice, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, after Senate confirmation, took both her constitutional and judicial oaths of office at the Supreme Court\u2014with the constitutional oath administered in a private ceremony, and the judicial oath broadcast on television (\"marking the first live coverage of such a ceremony in the institution's history\"). This break from the practice of administering one of the oaths at the White House was attributed, in one report, to President Obama \"heeding concerns expressed by some justices\u2014most recently John Paul Stevens\u2014that a White House ceremony sends the inappropriate message that justices are beholden to their appointing president.\" Following Sonia Sotomayor's example, President Obama's second Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, took both her constitutional and judicial oaths of office at the Supreme Court as well. More recently, in contrast, Neil Gorsuch took the judicial oath of office at a public ceremony at the White House and the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony in the Justices' conference room at the Supreme Court building.", "Subsequently, the Court itself, in its courtroom, also affords public recognition to the new Justice's appointment, in a formal ceremony called an \"investiture,\" at which the Justice is sworn in yet again. This invitation-only event, for which reserved press seating is made available, is attended by the Court's other Justices, by family, friends, and former associates of the new Justice, and by outside dignitaries who may include the President and the Attorney General. The investiture typically occurs before the new Justice publicly takes his or her courtroom seat alongside the other members of the Court."], "subsections": []}]}}
