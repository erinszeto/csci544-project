This report provides background information on the issues most likely to be takenup in the first session, analyzes the congressional role in shaping U.S. policy on these key issues, andlists CRS products that provide more detailed discussion and analysis.", "The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon dramatically altered the U.S. political environment, pushing issues of war and homeland security to the top of the policy agenda. Of particular concern to 108th Congress as it begins its first session will be the progress of theongoing war on terrorism, a possible war with Iraq, the unfolding crisis with North Korea, anddealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles. Each of thesetopics receives particular attention in this report.", "This report also describes foreign policy tools that the 108th Congress will consider in dealing with a wide range of challenges affecting U.S. interests around the globe. It discusses major foreigneconomic and security assistance programs which Congress may consider funding, including theMillennium Challenge Account, global HIV/AIDS programs, humanitarian aid to Afghanistan,counter-terrorism activities in Southeast Asia and Africa, and possible reconstruction andhumanitarian assistance in Iraq. It examines how U.S. relations with NATO and policies towardcountries such as Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, and Pakistan may affect U.S.counter-terrorism and non-proliferation efforts. Other issues covered include potential global flashpoints - such as the Israel-Palestinian conflict, China-Taiwan relations, and the Balkans - and U.S.concerns in Latin America, such as drug trafficking.", "A number of defense issues are likely to receive considerable attention in the 108th Congress, including managing defense related costs within budgetary constraints, guiding Department ofDefense (DOD) \"transformation\" initiatives, setting priorities on major weapons systems, andassessing whether the military is the proper size to meet the demands of current or anticipatedmissions. Other defense issues covered include whether to allow \"concurrent receipt\" of militaryretired pay and Veterans' Administration disability benefits, the appropriate role of DOD inhomeland security, and oversight of reforms in defense management and business operations.", "Congressional consideration of U.S. bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile and Singapore, and other trade issues are discussed in this report as well. The 108th Congress will likelymonitor U.S. negotiations on FTAs with Morocco, Central America, the South Africa CustomsUnion, Australia, and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Its agendamay include WTO compliance issues, the re-authorization of the Export Administration Act, the FreeTrade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA), and the Doha Development Agenda.

As the global campaign against terrorism continues and a possible war with Iraq looms,Congress must complete action on the FY2003 appropriations bills and begin consideration of thebudget for FY2004. Congressional actions are likely to reflect the reality that the September 11,2001, terrorist attacks on the United States (hereafter referred to as 9/11) have, in some fundamentalways, changed America and the way it looks at the world. For many, 9/11 destroyed the illusion thatthe United States is invulnerable to attack from a determined enemy. The Administration andCongress are shifting U.S. policy and resources accordingly.", "The new priorities appear to include the following: First , in order to diminish U.S. vulnerabilities to attack that were exposed by 9/11, a whole new structure for \"homeland security\"is being built. Second , the United States and a coalition of countries are continuing a worldwidecampaign to destroy Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that target U.S. citizens and facilities.While the initial phase of removing the Taliban government and destroying Al Qaeda bases inAfghanistan was successful, the effort to defeat the terrorists is by no means finished. Theintelligence community believes that Al Qaeda is regrouping in Pakistan and elsewhere. Many keyleaders have not been captured or killed and the organization is believed to be capable of mountingnew threats. Third , the United States is intensifying its efforts to remove what the Administrationand many in Congress consider the related threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in thehands of \"rogue\" governments. The concern is that they might be tempted to use such weaponsagainst the United States and its allies or to supply them to terrorist organizations. The U.S.showdown with Iraq is the main focus at present, but President Bush has identified North Korea andIran, as well as Iraq, as forming an \"axis of evil.\" In October, 2002, North Korean leaders admittedthat they have an ongoing nuclear weapons program in violation of international agreements. Sincethen, they appear to be reactivating nuclear installations shut down under a 1994 agreement and haveexpelled International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, threatening a full-scale international crisis. ", "While the world rallied in support of U.S. actions after 9/11, the Administration and Congress must also contend with the fact that many countries are becoming increasingly wary and evenalarmed about how unconstrained U.S. military power might be used and the direction of U.S.policy. Some concern has been present ever since the United States became the sole superpower ina less predictable world, in contrast to the U.S.-Soviet balance of power which existed for half acentury. However, worries seem to have been heightened by the perceived U.S. shift of focus fromthe war against Al Qaeda to Iraq and the \"axis of evil\"and by the U.S. assertion of a doctrine ofpreemption. ", "Other countries still seek and welcome U.S. leadership on global issues, but they increasingly complain that the United States is deciding and acting on its own and pursuing narrow self-interests. They see the Administration as consulting partners only after decisions are made, when theirassistance is needed, and without taking their views into account. Such complaints are even voicedby close U.S. allies in Europe and Asia who wonder whether the U.S. is downgrading long-standingalliances as it pursues short-term \"coalitions of the willing.\" International grievances about U.S.unilateralism include a litany of complaints about specific U.S. policies, such as its opposition to theInternational Criminal Court, rejection of environmental agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, andits withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Some urge the Administration to seriouslyaddress allied differences on these issues; others see U.S. positions as correct and view some of theprotestations as hypocritical and self-centered.", "Congress faces other new issues and challenges that are in some ways related. As it deliberates and votes on accepting seven new members into NATO, the 108th Congress may reexamine the rolethat U.S. alliances play in the new circumstances. There is concern among some observers that ifU.S.-allied differences continue to mount, they could begin to erode the foundations of relations. Since the end of the Cold War, there are fewer clear and present dangers that absolutely necessitateformal alliances. Increasingly, voices can be heard in the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea,and elsewhere that question the need for them. Some in other countries are beginning to see closeassociation with U.S. policy as making them more vulnerable to terrorist or WMD threats. On theU.S. side, some go-it-alone advocates see allies primarily as an impediment to U.S. freedom ofaction, while not contributing much to U.S. strength, especially given that the gap in their militarycapabilities and spending has continued to widen. At present these seem to be minority views. Others would probably still argue that U.S. policy should continue to define U.S. interests in termsof broader shared allied interests. There is concern that the current U.S. preponderance, if not usedin a multilateral way, might be difficult to sustain and could even hasten the emergence of competingpower centers or coalitions. Many would argue that strong alliances are still among the greatest U.S.assets and sources of long-term U.S. political, economic, and military strength. ", "Congress faces issues concerning continuing U.S. assistance and engagement in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and other recent conflict areas and may also need to prepare for a possiblelong-term and costly military presence in Iraq. This again raises for Congress the controversialquestion of \"nation-building\" and the appropriate U.S. role in post-conflict peacekeeping andreconstruction efforts. Many argue for leaving such efforts principally to other countries. At present,the United States is drawing down its forces in the Balkans. However, some experts argue that itwould not serve U.S. interests or the prospects for stability in these countries, if the U.S. were towithdraw completely. ", "Congress will likely review U.S. foreign aid priorities after 9/11 and take up the President's large new foreign aid initiative, the Millennium Challenge Account, which would substantiallyincrease foreign assistance to developing countries with a record of good performance in key areas. The initiative may derive at least in part out of recognition that poverty makes countries breedinggrounds for terrorism and other ills, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. It is believed to be a root cause of strife and instability in many parts of the world.", "At the same time, other challenges remain on the congressional agenda. These include oversight of U.S. foreign policy toward regions and countries of the world, including rising powerssuch as China and major countries undergoing significant transition such as Russia. Congress islikely to continue to focus considerable attention and resources to fighting HIV/AIDS and othercommunicable diseases, especially in Africa and Asia. Transnational problems such as internationalcrime, drugs, environmental problems, and human rights concerns remain important congressionalconcerns. ", "The global economy has profoundly changed international relations and the ability of governments to control developments even within national borders. International developmentsimpact on the domestic policy as never before. The benefits of globalization are considered farreaching, spurring world productivity, economic growth, and access to information. Along with thebenefits come significant new challenges that may require further congressional attention.Globalization brings economic dislocations in some areas. Financial uncertainties threaten differentregions. In the trade area, the 108th Congress will likely face decisions on approving one or morefree trade agreements and monitoring the negotiations on others which the Bush Administration hasinitiated or proposed. The negotiations include bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade liberalizingagreements. ", "Many believe that strong U.S. leadership in a multilateral framework will be necessary to find cooperative solutions to world problems. Others remain suspicious of international organizations andreluctant to enter into agreements that they believe would cede a degree of U.S. sovereignty to them. ", "The 108th Congress will confront underlying ambiguity, controversy, and uncertainty regarding the proper directions and priorities for U.S. defense policy when it opens in early 2003-a hugechange from the degree of underlying consensus which marked the opening of the 107th Congressin early 2001. Before the attacks of 9/11, U.S. strategic priorities and military contingency planningwere centered almost exclusively around preparation for possible hostilities with threateningnation-states. Since 9/11, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been waging a war of episodicintensity against active terrorist and terrorist-related forces throughout the world; since early 2002,it has been preparing for a war against Iraq, if diplomatic efforts fail to eliminate any weapons ofmass destruction it may possess. ", "At the same time, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has been vigorously propounding the underlying assumptions of the technology-driven \"Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA),\" and,accordingly, emphasizing lightness, mobility, technological sophistication, and hardware overfirepower, sustainability, size of the force, and quantity of weapons and units. He has done this overvarying degrees of doubt and opposition from within and without the military services and theirsenior uniformed leadership, the Congress, and nongovernmental commentators and analysts ondefense issues.", "The Administration appears to have decided to fight a major war with Iraq if necessary; continue the RMA-driven modernization of the armed forces; and maintain the existing level ofeffort in the war against terrorism centered in and around Afghanistan-without greatly enlarging thesize of the active duty armed forces. The Administration appears to have tacitly decided, so far, toprosecute the current anti-terrorism operations, and possibly the imminent ones against Iraq, withinthe constraints of existing active and reserve military force structure, weapons and equipmentinventory, and personnel strengths. It is not clear how long this level of military effort can besustained without requiring a substantially larger active duty force, and much greater levels ofprocurement spending, so as to avoid gross unreadiness in those forces not actually deployed to partsof the world where hostilities are taking place.", "In the background are issues of defense strategy and resource allocation which the terrorism war and related matters have temporarily crowded off of literal and virtual front pages. It was going tobe difficult enough to finance what the Administration regarded as minimally necessary increasesin peacetime defense spending out of then predicted budget surpluses. When hostilities cease, orgreatly diminish in intensity, how will crucial modernization and readiness programs be funded nowthat deficits are back? Are national missile defense (NMD) systems technically feasible, and, if so,are they important enough to command a major part of a constrained defense budget at the expenseof conventional weapons research and development and procurement? How should the United Statessize its conventional forces in an era where the previous benchmarks of \"2 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd wars,\" \"1 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd wars,\"\"two nearly-simultaneous major theater wars [MTWs],\" and/or \"winning one MTW and holding inanother\" all appear to be sterile remnants of the pre-9/11 era? ", "Finally, the Administration's stated willingness to \"exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively\" against terrorism, and against either transnational terrorists or nation-states that appearto be preparing to attack the United States with WMD, may have military as well as politicalimplications. Are U.S. military forces, which are almost 40% smaller than they were at the heightof the Cold War in the late 1980s, capable of executing a strategy which could demand morelong-range power projection capability, intelligence collection and evaluation assets, and specialoperations forces than the present force structure? In short, the 108th Congress will be confrontingdefense issues in an atmosphere of uncertainty that has not existed since the collapse of the SovietUnion and the Warsaw Pact a dozen years ago."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The War On Terrorism", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Terrorism", "paragraphs": ["Rensselaer Lee, Consultant in International Affairs ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "[author name scrubbed], Specialist in International Relations ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "The events of September 11, 2001, underscored the significance of international terrorism as a first-order threat to U.S. national security and to U.S. interests at home and abroad. SinceSeptember 11, important steps have been taken by Congress and by the Bush Administration toconfront that threat. Inevitably, however, questions of costs and priorities arise in the conduct ofU.S. counterterrorism policy and Congress will be called upon to address these issues both in thebudgetary process and in specific legislation.", "A fundamental and vital issue concerns the allocation of resources between the homeland security and national security aspects of policy: it may be asked, for example, how much emphasisshould be placed on forward defense - striking at Al Qaeda and its affiliates in distant lands, shuttingdown foreign sanctuaries and training camps, cutting terrorists' financial lifelines, and protectinginsecure stockpiles of nuclear materials and weapons - and how much on protecting the U.S. homeland from terrorist attacks. In broad organizational terms, this relates to funding of newDepartment of Homeland Security's activities versus those of the foreign operations of the Defense,State, Energy and Treasury Departments, the FBI, and the CIA. A second major issue concerns thegeneral scope of the Administration's counterterror effort. A question is whether the effort hereshould target terrorist groups widely, including groups with local agendas that do not necessarilysingle out Americans for attack, or whether it should focus on Al Qaeda, which many observers seeas the most immediate foreign threat to U.S. security. A related question concerns the potentialeffects of military intervention in Iraq: would war in Iraq create a backlash in the Islamic world, fuelterrorism or divert significant attention and resources from the international fight against Al Qaeda,as some Administration critics suggest? Or is it a necessary step to prevent Iraq from developingweapons of mass destruction that could fall into the hands of terrorists?", "Congressional oversight can play a significant role in evaluating the effectiveness of different policy tools employed in combating international terrorism, as well as their potential diplomatic orpolitical consequences. For example, in given situations, covert action to infiltrate and disruptterrorist leaderships might produce better results and less collateral damage than military strikesagainst suspected terrorist concentrations; addressing possible changes to constraints or guidelinesthat affect activities such as recruitment of informants thus could become a legislative priority. Ithas been argued that applications of certain measures, such as ones calculated to disrupt terroristfinancing, are perceived as broadly anti-Islamic and project a negative U.S. image abroad; hence,ways of minimizing such external costs may be explored. An increased focus on \"nation-building\"strategies to address the economic and political preconditions of terrorism also might be consideredin crafting an overall counterterrorism policy. Whether the different instruments selected aremutually coherent, and whether in certain situations the risks of using them exceed the expectedrewards are important concerns for Congress and the Administration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Threat from Al Qaeda and Other Terrorist Groups", "paragraphs": ["[author name scrubbed], Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "Congress and the Bush Administration are working to ensure that Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups are not able to conduct terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. interests abroadon the scale of the September 11, 2001 attacks. There is widespread agreement that the U.S.-led warin Afghanistan has significantly weakened Al Qaeda by denying it a central base, but there arediffering opinions within and outside the Administration over whether Al Qaeda could still conductanother catastrophic attack. Two terrorist attacks in October 2002 - one against an oil tanker off thecoast of Yemen and another in Bali, Indonesia, that killed nearly 200, both of which were allegedlyconducted by Al Qaeda supporters or affiliates - have raised U.S. concerns that Al Qaeda could beregrouping and gearing up for new major attacks.

CIADirector George Tenet told Congress on October 17, 2002, that the recent attacks and threats indicatean Al Qaeda \"threat environment\" comparable to that which existed prior to the attacks of September11, 2001. At the same time, the Administration has confirmed some recent major arrests of allegedAl Qaeda operatives, including the capture in November 2002 of Al Qaeda's key organizer for thePersian Gulf region. Additional arrests on this scale, over time, may weaken Al Qaeda to the pointwhere it is no longer a significant threat. ", "U.S. officials say that the effort against Al Qaeda is worldwide and multifaceted, involving diplomatic and financial, as well as military actions. Much of the current U.S. effort is intended tocapture Al Qaeda leadership and operatives worldwide, although U.S. military efforts withinAfghanistan are now focused primarily on shoring up the fledgling government of Afghanistan andpreventing that country's re-emergence as a base for terrorist groups. Further options could includegreater use of armed unmanned U.S. aircraft, such as the Predator that was used to strike a senior AlQaeda operative in Yemen in early November, 2002. Press reports suggest that U.S. intelligence isstepping up activities in the tribal areas of western Pakistan in an effort to find Al Qaeda founderOsama bin Laden and other leaders. Other press reports say the United States might confront SaudiArabia directly in an effort to persuade it to crack down on financial donations by Saudis to Islamiccharities that might, knowingly or unknowingly, be supplying funds to terrorists.

Large-scale military operations have ended in Afghanistan. Small unit operations continue to search for remainingTaliban/Al-Qaeda supporters and their arms caches. The roughly 8,000 U.S. troops and 4,000 troopsof the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) still encounter sporadic firefights and shellingfrom dissident Afghan forces. The major decision confronting Administration officials andcongressional oversight committees is what role the U.S. military should play, and to what extentit should become involved, in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Most observers agree thatinternational troops must remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future, and that the U.S. militaryshould play a leading role. The central government remains weak and warlords of dubiousallegiances dominate the countryside. The Bush Administration had hoped to turn over thereconstructive period to international peacekeepers and civilian agencies; however, the ISAF willnot operate outside of the capital Kabul, and it has been left to U.S. forces to intercede and mediateinternecine Afghan disputes. In a policy shift, Department of Defense (DOD) officials announcedin late 2002 that U.S. Central Command will begin to send teams of combat soldiers, civil affairsspecialists, and Afghan central government troops to regional centers to stabilize out-lying areas andfacilitate reconstruction projects. Details of the size and scope of these operations have not beenreleased.

Though there was noticeable oppositionto the U.S. presence among some of the Filipino population, the United States and the Philippineshave signed a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement, and there is continuing speculation U.S. forceswill return in January 2003. In Gruzia (Georgia), the training program will involve about 150 U.S.instructors to improve the Gruzian military's ability to deal with the rebel forces from Chechnya whoare using the Pankisi Gorge as a refuge. Reported links between the Chechen rebels and Al Qaedahave led U.S. officials to consider this operation part of the war on terrorism. In Yemen, another 150U.S. instructors are working to improve the government's anti-terrorism capabilities, and areassisting in the search for Al-Qaeda operatives in the northern tribal areas of the country.

A possible \"lite\" option would entail extensive useof special operations forces in cooperation with indigenous Iraqi opposition forces, coupled with anair offensive to destroy Hussein's most reliable Republican Guard units, command & control centers,and WMD capabilities.

With both \"heavy\" and \"lite\"options reportedly having been set aside for a variety of reasons, news reports indicate that the planof choice appears to be a blend of the two. Involving perhaps 80,000 U.S. troops, this option appearsto focus not on the size of the U.S. force, but rather upon the diversity of units attacking, and veryclose coordination of air and ground attacks. Indigenous forces would not necessarily play a largerole, though some effort likely would be made through Central Intelligence Agency teams andspecial operations units to gain their cooperation.

In 1985, Congress passed the so-calledKemp-Kasten amendment which has been made part of every Foreign Operations appropriationsince, barring U.S. funds to any organization that supported or participated \"in the management\" ofa program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Clinton Administration restoredfunding to UNFPA citing a different interpretation of Kemp-Kasten.", "For FY2002, Congress appropriated \"not more than\" $34 million for UNFPA, but in January 2002 the White House placed a hold on the money pending a review of whether UNFPA's activitiesin China violated Kemp-Kasten. A State Department team concluded in May that while Chinamaintains coercive elements in its population programs, UNFPA does not knowingly support orparticipate in them. Although the team recommended releasing the $34 million, Secretary of StatePowell determined on July 22 to withhold funds from UNFPA. The State Department's analysis ofthe Secretary's determination found that even though UNFPA did not \"knowingly\" support orparticipate in a coercive practice, that alone would not preclude the application of Kemp-Kasten. Instead, a finding that the recipient of U.S. funds - in this case UNFPA - simply supports orparticipates in such a program, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would trigger the restriction.", "Congressional critics of the determination to suspend UNFPA funds support legislation incorporated into the Senate-reported FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill( S. 2779 ) that would reverse the executive's decision. That measure modified theKemp-Kasten language by requiring a finding by the Secretary of State that an organization \"directlyparticipates in the practice of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilizations\" before declaring thegroup ineligible for U.S. support. Instead of the current, more implicit standard under whichKemp-Kasten has been interpreted, this new language would appear to set a more rigorous andspecific test for determining whether UNFPA or any other organization fell under the Kemp-Kastenconditions. S. 2779 further appropriated $50 million for UNFPA in FY2003. TheHouse-reported companion measure ( H.R. 5410 ) earmarked $25 million for UNFPA,based, however, on the condition that UNFPA not fund the State Planned-Birth Commission or itsregional affiliates in China.", "Because Congress adjourned without enacting the FY2003 Foreign Operations spending measure, the legislation will be re-introduced in the 108th Congress and may be one of the first itemsconsidered in the new session. Whether the Senate Appropriations Committee under a new majoritywill support changes to the Kemp-Kasten language proposed in S. 2779 remainsunclear.

The IDA 13 agreement provides for 18%-to-21% grants, a compromiseroughly half the President's goal. Administration leaders commend it as a major breakthrough.

These include, among other things, increasedemphasis on capacity building to improve governance and combat corruption, more consultationand disclosure, and a tighter link between country strategies, IDA aid and IDA's performance-basedallocation system.

While Congress hasnot rejected these changes, some key congressional committees have been concerned about theeffects of the new procedures in general, and about receiving adequate information to carry out itscongressional oversight responsibilities in particular. DOD is implementing an approach fordeveloping new weapon systems called evolutionary acquisition with spiral development. The coreidea of evolutionary acquisition is to develop incremental or \"block\" versions of a weapon, each witha certain amount of useful military capability, that over time form a series ultimately leading to thedesired final capability. Each block includes a phase for conceiving, developing, producing andsustaining a weapon system. Perhaps the most important phase is the second phase (development)which uses spiral development - an iterative process for developing a weapon system's capabilitieswithin a block by encouraging the developer, tester, and user to interact with one another so as torefine the system's operational requirements. The result is a process which contains moreuncertainty than its predecessor, for example in the initial program description and definedbenchmarks of a proposed weapons system. This uncertainty has been reflected in DOD's lack ofclarity in reporting to Congress on these systems in the congressional oversight and appropriationsprocess, which has not changed.", "Congress included a number of provisions in the FY2003 Defense Authorization Act (PL107-314) which mandate reports documenting DOD's use of evolutionary acquisition and spiraldevelopment for major acquisition programs. Other provisions required that DOD weapons testingremain independent to ensure accountability in weapons development. While Members of Congressgenerally support initiatives to create a more efficient acquisition process, many worry that the newprocedures take too much discipline and structure out of the traditional acquisition process, andcould potentially lead to technical difficulties, and cost overruns. Expensive weapon programs, suchas the ballistic missile defense, DD(X) surface combatant, and unmanned air vehicle (UAV)programs, costing billions of dollars, are affected by these DOD initiatives.

", "The policy of competitive sourcing is a major component of the Bush Administration's Management Agenda, which has identified competitive sourcing as one of five government-wideinitiatives to improve the management and performance of the federal government. The BushAdministration has viewed OMB Circular A-76, and its legislative companion, the Federal Activitiesand Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act ( P.L. 105-270 ), as a management reform tool to meet theAdministration's long-term goal of competing about 425,000 federal jobs, which represents abouthalf of all commercial work performed by the federal government. In March, 2001, OMB directedfederal agencies to compete five percent of all federal jobs considered commercial in nature byOctober, 2002, and ten percent of all federal jobs considered commercial in nature by October, 2003. OMB has not announced a specific competitive sourcing goal for 2004.", "To support the Administration's competitive sourcing goals, OMB recently completed its planned overhaul of the federal government's job competition process and released the revised OMBCircular A-76 (FR Doc. 02-29472; published in Federal Register Vol. 67, No. 223, 69769-69774,November 19, 2002).

What economic or strategiccriteria must be met? Does the strategy complicate or support efforts to negotiate larger regional andglobal agreements?", "Some critics maintain that bilateral FTAs offer limited economic benefits to the United States. Others worry that they could undermine efforts to conclude broader regional and global tradeagreements. While the larger agreements offer greater market opening opportunities for U.S.exporters and service providers, they also would require the United States to cut farm subsidies, andopen up still-protected sectors, such as textiles, faster.

The TNC has met four times: January, April, July, and October 2002. Countries have agreed on a negotiating structure and chairpersons. They face a deadline of May 31,2003 for agreement on formulas and other modalities in the agriculture negotiations and for initialoffers of market access for the services negotiations. They also face a May 2003 deadline for areview of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The trade ministers agreed at Doha that they wouldtake stock and make several interim decisions at the next ministerial meeting, which is scheduledfor September 10-14, 2003 in Cancun, Mexico. They set a deadline of January 1, 2005, for a finalcomprehensive trade agreement.", "The potential benefit of successful multilateral negotiations is projected to be great. A University of Michigan study found that a one-third reduction of current barriers to trade wouldresult in over $600 billion in worldwide economic benefits. While the possible gains in multilateralnegotiations are such a great magnitude, however, reaching agreement among so many countries ishighly difficult. Therefore, policymakers are also seeking more limited economic gains throughbilateral or regional agreements, which are often easier to negotiate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Export Administration Act", "paragraphs": ["[author name scrubbed], Analyst in International Trade and Finance ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "In the 108th Congress, there will be continued efforts to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA). The EAA provides the statutory authority for export controlson sensitive dual-use goods and technologies, items that have both civilian and military applications including those items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemicalweaponry.", "Efforts to renew the Act have been complicated by continued tension between national security and commercial concerns. Some observers contend that current export controls hurt U.S. businessby subjecting technology exports to what they consider a cumbersome and ineffective licensingprocess that costs sales and loses markets to overseas competitors. Others maintain that currentcontrols are not strong enough to prevent the spread of dual-use technologies to adversaries orpotential proliferators, and that EAA legislation, as introduced in the 107th Congress, would furtherweaken this system. Congressional interest in EAA reform has been heightened by questions aboutthe efficacy of export controls in the fight against terrorism and by revelations about theunauthorized transfer of sensitive items to nations restricted by current regulations, including China. ", "The EAA, which originally expired in 1989, periodically has been reauthorized for short periods of time, with the last incremental extension expiring in August 2001. At other times, the exportlicensing system created under the authority of EAA has been continued by the invocation ofauthorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In the 107thCongress, two competing versions of EAA emerged. The Senate version ( S. 149 ) waspassed by the Senate on September 6, 2001. Both the House International Relations Committee andthe House Armed Services Committee substantially amended the House version ( H.R. 2581 ) which, as introduced, was substantially similar to S. 149 . To different degrees,the House versions conferred additional authority on the Department of Defense to block licenseapplications and decontrol decisions, tightened the criteria for decontrol of certain items, andmandated the denial of licenses for certain exports. The Administration supported S. 149 and opposed the competing House versions. Negotiations between the Administration, Senate,and House participants to reconcile differences between the versions of the legislation continued forthe remainder of the session without success. Because the substance of this debate has not beenpredominantly partisan in nature, the change in party composition of the 108th Congress is notexpected to alter the dynamics of the debate. The sponsor of the Senate version of EAA in the 107thCongress, Senator Michael Enzi, has indicated that he will reintroduce a version of EAA in the 108thCongress, and other Members may also offer export control legislation. In addition to thereauthorization legislation, the 108th Congress may tackle such issues as the nature and scope ofexport controls on high performance computers, whether commercial communications satellites willremain under the licensing authority of the Department of State or be transferred to the Departmentof Commerce, and the regulation of \"deemed exports\" - the release of sensitive technology toforeign nationals within the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States and the World Trade Organization (WTO): Compliance Issues", "paragraphs": ["[author name scrubbed], Specialist in International Trade and Finance ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "[author name scrubbed], Legislative Attorney, American Law Division ([phone number scrubbed]) ", "The 108th Congress inherits several disputes where the WTO has ruled that U.S. laws violate world trade obligations.

Pursuant to the case and the inability of the United States to repeal the subsidy or find aWTO compatible substitute, the WTO in August 2002 granted the EU the right to impose 100%tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. exports to Europe. Some fear that a decision by the EU to retaliate onsuch a large volume of trade - the largest sanction in the history of the WTO - could ignite atransatlantic trade war and deal a devastating blow to the ongoing round of global trade negotiations.", "The threat of foreign retaliation against U.S. exports is also a possibility in several other cases in which the United States has been on the losing side of WTO dispute panel rulings.

Bush Administration trade officials have expressed concerns that some panel rulings\"legislate new obligations and go too far in determining how [WTO] members should comply withadverse panel rulings.\" In response, some Members reportedly are considering introducinglegislation to establish a commission of former judges to review WTO decisions with a view todetermining whether the WTO is exceeding its authority. Others may support changes in the disputesettlement process that could be proposed and negotiated in the Doha Development Agenda.", "Supporters of the WTO dispute resolution process argue that the United States was the chief proponent of creating a stronger and more binding dispute settlement process. They also claim thatthe system works in keeping markets open to U.S. exports, and that U.S. complaints only arise whenthe system chips away at some of the vestiges of U.S. protection. Were the United States or otherleading WTO members to ignore WTO findings, they argue that the dispute resolution process couldbe severely weakened. ", "Legislation was introduced in the 107th Congress to settle a number of these disputes, but none of the bills was brought to the floor. On the ETI dispute, House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Bill Thomas introduced legislation ( H.R. 5095 ) that would repeal the ETIand replace it with a series of tax benefits that would primarily help companies with overseasoperations. Many companies that produce and export primarily from the United States are not infavor of this approach. By contrast, Senate Finance Committee leaders are promoting a \"negotiatedsolution\" to the dispute, perhaps within the context of the Doha Round of negotiations. EU tradeofficials have repeatedly stated that they only want the United States to amend or repeal the ETI ina WTO-consistent manner. ", "Three different bills were introduced to repeal the 1916 Antidumping statute, but were not acted on. While two of the bills would have terminated pending litigation, the third would havegrandfathered existing court cases, all of which involve EU or Japanese companies. The UnitedStates was to have originally complied by mid-2001, but received extensions from the EU and Japan,the most recent lasting until the adjournment of the past session of Congress. The EU recentlywarned that it would resume retaliation procedures in the WTO if the U.S. failed to repeal the lawin a way that would end all existing court cases.

While the United States has appealed the panel's findings, a WTO appellate decision upholding thepanel may raise legislative issues for the United States. Were the EU to prevail in the dispute, theUnited States would likely need to indicate its compliance plans to the WTO in the first half of 2003.", "The 108th Congress may reconsider legislation to bring the United States into compliance with recommendations and rulings formulated by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the WTO.
