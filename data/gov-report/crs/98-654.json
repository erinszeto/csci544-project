However, there is no single centralized source for finding information on every opportunity. This report describes prominent and popular internet resources for such opportunities and gives applicants a place to begin their search. The internet resources provided are not exhaustive. ", "Applying for an internship or fellowship is similar to applying for admission to a college or university. The application process takes time and effort, often requiring essays and interviews. In pursuit of success, applicants typically begin their search early and explore what best suits their interests and career goals. Application deadlines and program durations vary from agency to agency. Applicants often apply to more than one program because competition is stiff, with the number of applicants often far exceeding the number of positions available. Opportunities are generally available in the spring, summer, and fall, with summer positions being the most popular and competitive.", "The terms fellowship and internship are sometimes used interchangeably in the names of specific programs. Fellowships are generally intended for persons with advanced degrees or substantial professional experience and are usually salaried positions lasting nine months to a year or more. Internships, which are either salaried or volunteer short-term arrangements, usually require relatively little experience and are often filled by students.", "Although they are sometimes confused with interns, congressional pages are high school students who serve Congress as messengers.

", "The duties, responsibilities, and salaries (if any) of interns and fellows vary from program to program. Most program responsibilities are substantive in nature and often involve challenging projects. They may range from conducting legislative research for a congressional office to biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. Some programs or universities that offer academic credit may require the intern or fellow to produce a report on the work experience and obtain evaluations from program supervisors. In addition, some programs lead to federal job placement. Recruitment programs like Presidential Management Fellows and the Congressional Research Service Graduate Recruit Program may offer permanent employment after the successful completion of program requirements.
