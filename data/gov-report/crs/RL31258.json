The courts have handed down large judgments against the terrorist State defendants, generally in default, and successive Administrations have intervened to block the judicial attachment of frozen assets to satisfy judgments. After a court ruled that Congress never created a cause of action against terrorist States themselves, but only against their officials, employees, and agents, plaintiffs have based claims on state law. The limited availability of defendant States' assets for satisfaction of judgments has made collection difficult. Congress passed a rider to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (H.R. 4986), to provide a federal cause of action against terrorist States and to facilitate enforcement of judgments, authorizing the President to waive the provision with respect to Iraq. Congress subsequently passed S. 3370 to exempt Libya from the FSIA provisions if it agrees to compensate victims with pending lawsuits.", "Section 1083 of P.L. 110-181 is the latest in a series of actions Congress has taken over the last decade to assist plaintiffs in lawsuits against terrorist States. The 107th Congress enacted a measure in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (\"TRIA\") (P.L. 107-297) to allow the attachment of blocked assets of terrorist States to pay compensatory damages to victims. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (\"VTVPA\") (P.L. 106-386) liquidated some frozen assets to pay claims and provided some U.S. funds to compensate those holding judgments against Iran at the time. Section 1083 seeks to make more assets available to execute terrorism judgments. It permits the attachment of assets belonging to separate agencies and instrumentalities of defendant States, permits plaintiffs to file notices of lis pendens with respect to property owned by defendant States or entities they control, and permits some plaintiffs to refile claims.", "The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the FSIA terrorism exception, but in 2006 it remanded a decision based on the lower court's assumption that Iran's Ministry of Defense (MOD) is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Iran rather than part of the government itself, and will decide in its upcoming term whether certain Iranian assets are available under the TRIA to judgment holders. The Court may also be asked to determine the effect of the waiver of \u00a7 1083 on pending cases against Iraq, which the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has permitted to go forward.", "This report provides background on the doctrine of State immunity and the FSIA; details the evolution of the terrorist State exception and some of the resulting judicial decisions; describes legislative efforts to help claimants satisfy their judgments; summarizes the hostages' suit against Iran and Congress's efforts to intervene; summarizes the status of lawsuits against Iraq and Libya; and provides an overview of proposed legislation (S. 3370, H.R. 3346, S. 1944, H.R. 394, H.R. 5167, and H.R. 2764). Appendix A provides a list of cases, including those covered by TRIA \u00a7 2002 and the amount of compensation paid. Appendix B lists the assets of each terrorist State currently blocked by the United States and the total amount owed by each for terrorism judgments.

In 1996, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to allow civil suits by U.S. victims of terrorism against certain States responsible for, or complicit in, such terrorist acts as torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, and hostage taking. The amendment enjoyed broad support in Congress, but was initially resisted by the executive branch. President Clinton signed the amendment into law after the Cuban air force shot down a civilian plane over international waters, an incident that resulted in one of the first lawsuits under the new FSIA exception. After a court found that the waiver of sovereign immunity did not itself create a private right of action, Congress passed the Flatow Amendment to create a cause of action. Numerous court judgments awarding plaintiffs substantial compensatory and punitive damages were to follow, until the D.C. Circuit in 2004 interpreted the provisions in a way that made further awards somewhat more difficult for plaintiffs to win. Plaintiffs thereafter largely relied on domestic state law to provide a cause of action, which resulted in some disparity in the amount and type of relief available to different victims of the same terrorist attacks.", "Although the defendant State sponsors of terrorism have frequently declined to appear in court to defend against the lawsuits, the litigation has nevertheless proven contentious, often leading to the perception on the part of plaintiffs that the U.S. government is their most formidable adversary. Nevertheless, U.S. courts have awarded victims of terrorism more than $19 billion against State sponsors of terrorism and their officials, most of which remains uncollected. The scarcity of assets within U.S. jurisdiction that belong to States subject to economic sanctions has made judgments against terrorist States difficult to enforce. Efforts by plaintiffs to attach frozen assets and diplomatic or consular property, while receiving support from Congress, have met with opposition from the executive branch. The total amount of judgments against terrorist States far exceeds the assets of debtor States known to exist within the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. The use of U.S. funds to pay portions of some judgments has drawn criticism. Calls for a more effective and fair means to compensate victims of terrorism have not yielded an alternative mechanism. The issue has pitted the compensation of victims of terrorism against U.S. foreign policy goals and some business interests.", "Congress passed a rider to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 ( H.R. 1585 ), to provide a cause of action against terrorist States and to facilitate enforcement of judgments, and to permit some plaintiffs to refile claims that were unsuccessful under the previous law. The provision also permits the filing of new cases related to terrorist incidents that have been the subject of previous cases, in order to permit the filing of cases in which the plaintiffs were previously ineligible to file or had missed the filing deadline, or perhaps in order to garner higher damages.", "After the President vetoed the bill based on the possible impact the measure would have on Iraq, Congress passed a new version, H.R. 4986 , this time authorizing the President to waive its provisions with respect to Iraq. The President signed the bill into law, P.L. 110-181 , and promptly issued a waiver with respect to Iraq. The Administration now seeks a waiver for Libya and other States whose designation may be lifted. However, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has ruled that the waiver with respect to Iraq does not affect pending cases, which are permitted to go forward under the FSIA as it was in effect prior to the FY2008 NDAA.", "This report provides background on the international law doctrine of foreign State immunity and the FSIA; summarizes the 1996 amendments creating an exception to state immunity under the FSIA for suits against terrorist States; details the subsequent cases and the legislative initiatives to assist claimants in efforts to collect on their judgments; sets forth the legal and policy arguments that were made for and against those efforts; summarizes the decision in Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran and efforts to help the plaintiffs and override the Algiers Accords; describes the Administration's actions vesting title to Iraq's frozen assets in the United States and making them unavailable to former POWs in Acree v. Republic of Iraq and other plaintiffs who have won judgments against Iraq; discusses an effort by Iran to void a judgment against it ( Ministry of Defense v. Elahi ); notes the laws in certain terrorist States that allow suits against the U.S. for similar acts; and concludes that the issue of providing fair compensation to victims of terrorism is not one that will likely dissipate any time soon.", "The report also contains two appendixes: Appendix A lists the cases covered by \u00a7 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-386 ), the amount of compensation that has been paid in each case, and the source of the compensation. It provides a separate list of judgments handed down later that are not covered by the compensation schemes set forth in earlier legislation, whose creditors will likely compete with each other to satisfy claims out of scarce blocked assets. Appendix B lists the amount of the assets of each terrorist State blocked by the United States as of the end of 2006, as compared to the current sum of judgments that remain to be satisfied. The report will be updated as events warrant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background on State Immunity", "paragraphs": ["Customary international law historically afforded sovereign States complete immunity from being sued in the courts of other States. In the words of Chief Justice Marshall, this immunity was rooted in the \"perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns\" and the need to maintain friendly relations. Although each nation has \"full and absolute\" jurisdiction within its own territory, the Chief Justice stated, that jurisdiction, by common consent, does not extend to other sovereign States:", "One sovereign being in no respect amenable to another; and being bound by obligations of the highest character not to degrade the dignity of his nation, by placing himself or its sovereign rights within the jurisdiction of another, can be supposed to enter a foreign territory only under an express license, or in the confidence that the immunities belonging to this independent sovereign station, though not expressly stipulated, are reserved by implication, and will be extended to him.", "This perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and this common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other, have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.", "During the last century, however, this principle of absolute sovereign immunity gradually came to be limited after a number of States began engaging directly in commercial activities. To allow States to maintain their immunity in the courts of other States even while engaged in ordinary commerce, it was said, \"gave States an unfair advantage in competition with private commercial enterprise\" and denied the private parties in other nations with whom they dealt their normal recourse to the courts to settle disputes. As a consequence, numerous States immediately before and after World War II adopted the \"restrictive principle\" of state immunity, which preserves sovereign immunity for most cases but allows domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over suits against foreign States for claims arising out of their commercial activities.", "The United States adopted the restrictive principle of sovereign immunity by administrative action in 1952, and the State Department began advising courts on a case-by-case basis whether a foreign sovereign should be entitled to immunity from a U.S. court's jurisdiction based on the nature of the claim. In 1978 Congress codified the principle in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), so that the decision no longer depended on a determination by the State Department. The FSIA states the general principle that \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States\" and then sets forth several exceptions. The primary exceptions are for cases in which \"the foreign state has waived its immunity either expressly or by implication,\" cases in which \"the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state,\" and suits against a foreign State for personal injury or death or damage to property occurring in the United States as a result of the tortious act of an official or employee of that State acting within the scope of his office or employment. For most types of claims covered, the FSIA also provides that the commercial property of a foreign State in the United States may be attached in satisfaction of a judgment against it regardless of whether the property was used for the activity on which the claim was based. However, assets belonging to separate instrumentalities of a foreign government are not generally available to satisfy claims against the foreign government itself or against other agencies and instrumentalities in which that government has an interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996: Civil Suits Against Terrorist States by Victims of Terrorism", "paragraphs": ["In 1996 Congress added another exception to the FSIA to allow the U.S. courts, federal and state, to exercise jurisdiction over foreign States and their agencies and instrumentalities in civil suits by U.S. victims of terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) amended the FSIA to provide that a foreign State is not immune from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts in cases in which", "money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources ... for such an act if such act or provision of material support is engaged in by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency....", "As predicates for such suits, the AEDPA amendment required that the foreign State be designated as a State sponsor of terrorism by the State Department at the time the act occurred or later so designated as a consequence of the act in question, that either the claimant or the victim of the act of terrorism be a U.S. national, and that the defendant State be given a prior opportunity to arbitrate the claim if the act on which the claim is based occurred in the territory of the defendant State. The act also provided that the terrorist States and their agencies and instrumentalities would be liable for compensatory damages, and the agencies and instrumentalities for punitive damages as well. The act further allowed the commercial property of a foreign State in the United States to be attached in satisfaction of a judgment against that State under this amendment regardless of whether the property was involved in the act on which the claim was based. After previously opposing similar proposals, the Clinton Administration agreed to these changes in the FSIA.", "After a court found that the terrorism exception to sovereign immunity did not itself create a cause of action, Congress passed the Civil Liability for Acts of State-Sponsored Terrorism (known as the \"Flatow Amendment\") to clarify that a cause of action existed against the officials, employees, and agents of States whose sovereign immunity was abrogated pursuant to the exception. The Flatow Amendment gives parties injured or killed by a terrorist act covered by the FSIA exception, or their legal representatives, a cause of action for suits against \"an official, employee, or agent of a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism\" who commits the terrorist act \"while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency ....\" if a U.S. government official would be liable for similar actions. This measure was adopted as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal 1997 without apparent debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Cases and Efforts to Satisfy Judgments", "paragraphs": ["Several suits were quickly filed against Cuba and Iran pursuant to the new provisions. Neither State recognized the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts in such suits, however; and both refused to appear in court to mount a defense. The FSIA provides that a court may enter a judgment by default in such a situation if \"the claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.\" After making the proper finding, several federal trial courts entered default judgments holding Iran and Cuba to be culpable for particular acts of terrorism and awarding the plaintiffs substantial amounts in compensatory and punitive damages.", "Neither Iran nor Cuba had any inclination to pay the damages that had been assessed in these cases. As a consequence, the plaintiffs and their attorneys sought to attach certain properties and other assets owned by the States in question that were located within the jurisdiction of the United States to satisfy the judgments.", "In the case of Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran , plaintiffs sought to attach the embassy and several diplomatic properties of Iran located in Washington, DC, the proceeds that had accrued from the rental of those properties after diplomatic relations had been broken in 1979, and an award that had been rendered by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in favor of Iran and against the U.S. government but which had not yet been paid. The Clinton Administration opposed these efforts, arguing that the diplomatic properties and the rental proceeds were essentially sovereign non-commercial property that remained immune to attachment pursuant to the FSIA. In addition, the Administration argued that it was obligated to protect Iran's diplomatic and consular properties under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and that using such properties to satisfy court judgments would expose U.S. diplomatic and consular properties around the world to similar treatment by other countries. The Clinton Administration further argued that the funds set aside to pay an award to Iran by the decision of the Claims Tribunal were still U.S. property and, as such, were immune from attachment due to U.S. sovereign immunity. The court agreed and quashed the writs of attachment.", "Efforts were also mounted in both the Flatow case and in Alejandre v. Republic of Cuba (the Brothers to the Rescue case) to attach assets of Iran and Cuba in the United States that had been blocked by the U.S. government pursuant to sanctions regulations. Iran's assets in the United States had been frozen under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) at the time of the hostage crisis in 1979. However, under the Algiers Accords reached to resolve the crisis, most of those assets had either been returned to Iran or placed in an escrow account in England subject to the decisions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, an arbitral body set up by the Algiers Accords to resolve remaining disputes between the two countries or their nationals. Cuba's assets in the United States had been blocked since the early 1960s under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). The Clinton Administration opposed the efforts to allow access to these assets as well. It argued that such assets are useful, and historically have been used, as leverage in working out foreign policy disputes with other countries (as in the Iranian hostage situation) and that they will be useful in negotiating the possible future re-establishment of normal relations with Iran and Cuba. The Administration also contended that numerous other U.S. nationals had legitimate (and prior) claims against these countries that would be frustrated if the assets were used solely to compensate the recent victims of terrorism. The Administration also argued that using frozen assets to compensate victims of State-sponsored terrorism exposes the United States to the risk of reciprocal actions against U.S. assets by other States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "105th Congress: Section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999", "paragraphs": ["In an attempt to override these objections, the 105 th Congress in 1998 further amended the FSIA to provide that any property of a terrorist State frozen pursuant to TWEA or IEEPA and any diplomatic property of such a State could be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution of a judgment against that State under the terrorism State exception to the FSIA. Section 117 of the Treasury Department Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999 also mandated that the State and Treasury Departments \"shall fully, promptly, and effectively assist\" any judgment creditor or court issuing a judgment against a terrorist State \"in identifying, locating, and executing against the property of that foreign state....\" Because of the Administration's continuing objections, however, section 117 also gave the President authority to \"waive the requirements of this section in the interest of national security.\" On October 21, 1998, President Clinton signed the legislation into law and immediately executed the waiver. The President explained his reasons in the signing statement for the bill as follows:", "I am concerned about section 117 of the Treasury/General Government appropriations section of the act, which amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. If this section were to result in attachment and execution against foreign embassy properties, it would encroach on my authority under the Constitution to \"receive Ambassadors and other public ministers.\" Moreover, if applied to foreign diplomatic or consular property, section 117 would place the United States in breach of its international treaty obligations. It would put at risk the protection we enjoy at every embassy and consulate throughout the world by eroding the principle that diplomatic property must be protected regardless of bilateral relations. Absent my authority to waive section 117's attachment provision, it would also effectively eliminate use of blocked assets of terrorist States in the national security interests of the United States, including denying an important source of leverage. In addition, section 117 could seriously impair our ability to enter into global claims settlements that are fair to all U.S. claimants, and could result in U.S. taxpayer liability in the event of a contrary claims tribunal judgment. To the extent possible, I shall construe section 117 in a manner consistent with my constitutional authority and with U.S. international legal obligations, and for the above reasons, I have exercised the waiver authority in the national security interest of the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "106th Congress: Enactment of \u00a7 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA)", "paragraphs": ["President Clinton's exercise of the waiver authority conferred by section 117 of the FY1999 Treasury Department appropriations act blocked those with default judgments against Cuba and Iran from attaching the diplomatic property and frozen assets of those States to satisfy the judgments. In response, various Members during the 106 th Congress pressed for additional amendments to the FSIA that would override the President's waiver of section 117 and allow the judgments against terrorist States to be satisfied out of the States' frozen assets. Congress held hearings to consider the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which was adopted as revised by the House and reported in the Senate. The Clinton Administration opposed the measure, and it was not enacted into law. Instead, negotiations with the Administration led by Senators Lautenberg and Mack resulted in the enactment of section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Against Women Act of 2000, which created an alternative compensation system for some judgment holders. It mandated the payment of a portion of the damages awarded in the Alejandre judgment out of Cuba's frozen assets and a portion of ten designated judgments against Iran out of U.S. appropriated funds \"not otherwise obligated.\" In the meantime, additional and substantial default judgments continued to be handed down in other suits against Iran ; and a number of new suits against terrorist States were filed.", "Like \u00a7 117 of the Fiscal 1999 Appropriations Act for the Treasury Department, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act would have amended the FSIA to allow the attachment of all of the assets of a terrorist State, including its blocked assets, its diplomatic and consular properties, and moneys due from or payable by the United States. To that end it would have repealed the waiver authority granted in \u00a7117 and allowed the President to waive the authorization to attach assets only with respect to the premises of a foreign diplomatic or consular mission.", "In hearings on the measure, the Clinton Administration was repeatedly criticized for its opposition to the efforts of victims of terrorism to collect on the judgments they had obtained. Senator Mack, cosponsor of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act in the Senate, stated:", "... Mr. Chairman, the President made promises to the families, encouraged them to seek justice, calling their efforts brave and courageous. He pledged to fight terrorism and signed several laws supporting the rights of victims to take terrorists to court. But ultimately, he has chosen to protect terrorist assets over the rights of American citizens seeking justice. This is simply not what America stands for. Victims' families must know that the U.S. Government stands with them in actions, as well as words.", "Several of the victims' relatives also made statements criticizing the Administration's actions.", "Treasury Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat, Defense Department Under Secretary for Policy Walter Slocombe, and State Department Under Secretary for Policy Thomas Pickering responded for the Administration in a joint statement. While expressing support for the goal of \"finding fair and just compensation for [the] grievous losses and unimaginable experiences\" of the victims of terrorism, they said that the Victims of Terrorism Act was \"fundamentally flawed\" and had \"five principal negative effects,\" as follows:", "First, blocking of assets of terrorist States is one of the most significant economic sanctions tools available to the President. The proposed legislation would undermine the President's ability to combat international terrorism and other threats to national security by permitting the wholesale attachment of blocked property, thereby depleting the pool of blocked assets and depriving the U.S. of a source of leverage in ongoing and office ( sic ) sanctions programs, such as was used to gain the release of our citizens held hostage in Iran in 1981 or in gaining information about POW's and MIA's as part of the normalization process with Vietnam.", "Second, it would cause the U.S. to violate its international treaty obligations to protect and respect the immunity of diplomatic and consular property of other nations, and would put our own diplomatic and consular property around the world at risk of copycat attachment, with all that such implies for the ability of the United States to conduct diplomatic and consular relations and protect personnel and facilities.", "Third, it would create a race to the courthouse benefiting one small, though deserving, group of Americans over a far larger group of deserving Americans. For example, in the case of Cuba, many Americans have waited decades to be compensated for both the loss of property and the loss of the lives of their loved ones. This would leave no assets for their claims and others that may follow. Even with regard to current judgment holders, it would result in their competing for the same limited pool of assets, which would be exhausted very quickly and might not be sufficient to satisfy all judgments.", "Fourth, it would breach the long-standing principle that the United States Government has sovereign immunity from attachment, thereby preventing the U.S. Government from making good on its debts and international obligations and potentially causing the U.S. taxpayer to incur substantial financial liability, rather than achieving the stated goal of forcing Iran to bear the burden of paying these judgments. The Congressional Budget Office (\"CBO\") has recognized this by scoring the legislation at $420 million, the bulk of which is associated with the Foreign Military Sales (\"FMS\") Trust Fund. Such a waiver of sovereign immunity would expose the Trust Fund to writs of attachment, which would inject an unprecedented and major element of uncertainty and unreliability into the FMS program by creating an exception to the processes and principles under which the program operates.", "Fifth, it would direct courts to ignore the separate legal status of States and their agencies and instrumentalities, overturning Supreme Court precedent and basic principles of corporate law and international practice by making state majority-owned corporations liable for the debts of the state and establishing a dangerous precedent for government owned enterprises like the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (\"OPIC\").", "Notwithstanding these contentions, the Senate and House Judiciary Committees reported, and the House passed, a slightly amended version of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. The bill in the Senate was reported without a committee report. The House Judiciary Committee stated in its report:", "The President's continued use of his waiver power has frustrated the legitimate rights of victims of terrorism, and thus this legislation is required. While still allowing the President to block the attachment of embassies and necessary operating assets, H.R. 3485 would amend the law to specifically deny blockage of attachment of proceeds from any property which has been used for any non-diplomatic purpose or proceeds from any asset which is sold or transferred for value to a third party.", "The House passed the bill by voice vote under a suspension of the rules.", "The Clinton Administration persisted in opposing the bill, however, and that led to extensive negotiations between the Administration and interested Members of Congress. Ultimately, these negotiations led to the addition to an unrelated bill pending in conference of a limited alternative compensation scheme, which was signed into law by President Clinton on October 28, 2000. Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 directed the Secretary of the Treasury to pay portions of any judgments against Cuba and Iran that had been handed down by July 20, 2002, or that would be handed down in any suits that had been filed on one of five named dates on or before July 27, 2000. The judgments that had been handed down by July 20, 2000, were the Alejandre, Flatow, Cicippio, Anderson and Eisenfeld cases. Six suits had been filed against Iran on the five dates specified in the statute\u2014February 17, 1999; June 7, 1999; January 28, 2000; March 15, 2000; and July 27, 2000\u2014and all have subsequently been decided. ( See Appendix A for a full list of the cases.)", "Section 2002 gave the claimants in these eleven suits three options:", "First, they could obtain from the Treasury Department 110 percent of the compensatory damages awarded in their judgments, plus interest, if they agreed to relinquish all rights to collect further compensatory and punitive damages; Second, they could receive 100 percent of the compensatory damages awarded in their judgments, plus interest, if they agreed to relinquish (a) all rights to further compensatory damages awarded by U.S. courts and (b) all rights to attach certain categories of property in satisfaction of their judgments for punitive damages, including Iran's diplomatic and consular property as well as property that is at issue in claims against the United States before an international tribunal. The property in the latter category included Iran's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) trust fund, which remains at issue in a case before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. Third, claimants could decline to obtain any payments from the Treasury Department and continue to pursue satisfaction of their judgments as best they could. To pay a portion of the judgment against Cuba in the Alejandre case, the statute directed that the President vest and liquidate Cuban government properties that have been frozen under TWEA. For the ten designated cases against Iran, \u00a72002 provided for payment out of U.S. funds, as follows: The statute directed the Secretary of the Treasury to use any proceeds that have accrued from the rental of Iranian diplomatic and consular property in the United States plus appropriated funds not otherwise obligated (meaning U.S. funds) up to the amount contained in Iran's Foreign Military Sales account. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Fund had, as of 2000, about $377 million in funds. The account originally contained funds deposited by Iran to pay for military equipment and services during the reign of the Shah. However, Congress also provided funds for the account in order to continue to pay contractors for goods and services after Iran terminated contracts under the FMS program. Disposition of military equipment procured for Iran through the FMS fund and the money remaining in the FMS account is an unresolved issue between the United States and Iran before the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, where Iran has filed claims seeking billions of dollars primarily for alleged overcharges and nondeliveries of military equipment, as well as for allegedly unjustified charges billed to Iran for terminating its FMS program and the associated contracts. The United States has filed counterclaims to recover amounts it claims Iran owes on the contracts. For payments paid out of U.S. funds, \u00a72002 stated that the United States would be subrogated to the rights of the persons paid (meaning that the United States would be entitled to pursue their right to payment of the damage awards from Iran). Section 2002 further provided that the United States \"shall pursue\" these subrogated rights as claims or offsets to any claims or awards that Iran may have against the United States; and it bars the payment or release of any funds to Iran from frozen assets or from the Foreign Military Sales Fund until these subrogated claims have been satisfied.", "Section 2002 further expressed the \"sense of the Congress\" that relations between the United States and Iran should not be normalized until these subrogated claims have been \"dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States.\" It also \"reaffirmed the President's statutory authority to manage and ... vest foreign assets located in the United States for the purpose[] ... of assisting and, where appropriate, making payments to victims of terrorism.\" In addition, \u00a72002 modified one provision of \u00a7117 of the Treasury Department appropriations act for fiscal 1999 by changing the mandate that the State and Treasury Departments \"shall\" assist those who have obtained judgments against terrorist States in locating the assets of those States to the more permissive \"should make every effort\" to assist such judgment creditors.", "Finally, \u00a72002 modified the waiver authority that the President had been given in \u00a7117. It repealed that subsection and instead provided that \"[t]he President may waive any provision of paragraph (1) in the interest of national security.\" (Paragraph (1) was the subsection that allowed the frozen assets of a terrorist State, including its diplomatic property, to be attached in satisfaction of a judgment against that State.)", "Immediately after signing the legislation into law on October 28, 2000, President Clinton exercised the substitute waiver authority granted by \u00a72002 and waived \"subsection (f)(1) of section 1610 of title 28, United States Code, in the interest of national security.\" Thus, except to the extent \u00a72002 allowed the blocked assets of Cuba to be used to satisfy a portion of the Alejandre judgment, it did not eliminate the bar to the attachment of the diplomatic property and the blocked assets of terrorist States to satisfy judgments against those States.", "In November and December 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department of the Treasury issued a notice detailing the procedures governing application for payment by those in the eleven designated cases who might want to obtain the partial payment of their judgments afforded by \u00a72002. All of the claimants in the designated suits chose to obtain such compensation.", "In early 2001 the federal government liquidated $96.7 million of the $193.5 million of Cuban assets that had previously been blocked and paid that amount to the claimants in the Alejandre suit and their attorneys. The claimants in the ten designated cases against Iran variously chose to receive either 100 percent or 110 percent of their compensatory damages awards; and they ultimately received more than $380 million in compensation out of U.S. funds. ( See Appendix A for a listing of the cases, the payments made, and the option chosen.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "107th Congress: Additional Cases Added to \u00a72002 and Attachment of Assets Allowed in Other Cases", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to the enactment of \u00a72002 of the Victims of Trafficking statute in late 2000, the courts handed down additional default judgments in suits against terrorist States under the FSIA exception. As noted above, six of these additional judgments were covered by the compensation scheme set forth in \u00a72002 because the suits had been filed on one of the five dates on or prior to July 27, 2000 specified in the statute.

Iran", "paragraphs": ["After Congress passed the Flatow Amendment in 1996, providing for a cause of action against foreign officials for terrorist conduct, the judge in the Flatow case held Iran itself liable under a theory of respondeat superior , and awarded compensatory as well as punitive damages. Many trial courts followed the Flatow precedent, awarding both compensatory and punitive damages against a foreign State despite the textual limitations in the FSIA exception with respect to punitive damages. However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in 2004 that the amendment does not provide a cause of action against terrorist States themselves, including governmental agencies and separate commercial \"agencies and instrumentalities\" under the FSIA. Moreover, although the Flatow Amendment created a cause of action against an \"official, employee, or agent of a [designated terrorist State] while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency,\" the court held that it did not create a cause of action against foreign officials in their official capacities.", "The Cicippio-Puleo case involved claims for damages brought by the adult children and siblings of Joseph Cicippio, a hostage victim who had previously won a $30 million default judgment against Iran for financing the Hezbollah terrorists who kidnapped him in Beirut and held him hostage there for some five years. The children and siblings had not participated in the original lawsuit, but filed suit in 2001 for intentional infliction of emotional distress and the loss of solatium they suffered as a result of Mr. Cicippio's ordeal. The district court judge dismissed the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that the prevailing common law rule governing third party claims for outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress prevented plaintiffs' recovery. The appellate court requested a briefing from the U.S. government explaining its interpretation of the relevant statutes, and, at the government's urging, held that neither the FSIA exception nor the Flatow Amendment created a cause of action against a foreign State. The court remanded the case to the district court to permit the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to state a valid cause of action. On remand, the judge awarded the plaintiffs $91 million in compensatory damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Pennsylvania law.", "With respect to lawsuits against individual officials and employees of foreign governments, the court agreed with the U.S. government that \"insofar as the Flatow Amendment creates a private right of action against officials, employees, and agents of foreign states, the cause of action is limited to claims against those officials in their individual , as opposed to their official, capacities.\" This interpretation was said to follow from Supreme Court holdings establishing that an official-capacity claim against a government official is in substance a claim against the government itself, inasmuch as the government would be responsible to pay any damages awarded against its officials. Nevertheless, some judges have continued to award punitive damages against foreign officials acting in their official capacity. Some judges have found foreign officials liable in their personal capacities, awarding treble damages against those officials under the Antiterrorism Act (ATA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333 (despite the limitation in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2337 making that cause of action unavailable against U.S. and foreign officials \"acting within his or her official capacity or under color of legal authority\").", "The Cicippio-Puleo ruling complicated plaintiffs' efforts to sue designated State sponsors of terrorism by requiring them to identify a source of law outside the FSIA to provide a substantive cause of action. Some plaintiffs who had already been awarded default judgments were obliged to amend their complaints to identify a basis for liability. Plaintiffs have, with a few exceptions, had little difficulty establishing a cause of action under various U.S. state laws without relying on the Flatow Amendment. However, the application of state tort law has resulted in some disparity in the availability or amount of damages to which plaintiffs may be entitled. For example, in one case, damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress were denied to plaintiffs domiciled in Pennsylvania and Louisiana because those states' tort laws impose a presence requirement for third party plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress. The application of federal statutes outside the FSIA has also resulted in a lower amount of damages than might have been awarded under earlier court interpretations of the Flatow Amendment. Plaintiffs suing for damages related to the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole in 2000 were awarded a cumulative sum less than $8 million for economic damages, and were not entitled to damages for pain and suffering, because the judge found the Death on the High Seas Act to provide the only remedy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iran Hostages Case: Roeder v.

Republic of Iraq began as a lawsuit against Iraq and Saddam Hussein by twelve U.S. citizens who were held in hostage status by Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The former hostages, who were either held captive in or prevented from leaving Iraq or Kuwait from August 2 to mid-December of 1990, and some of their families were awarded a cumulative $9 million in compensatory damages and $300 million in punitive damages in a default judgment. The court subsequently found that an additional 168 plaintiffs had established their right to relief for being held hostage by Iraq; and the court awarded them approximately $85 million in compensatory damages. Judgment holders in this case were able to fully satisfy their compensatory judgments from Iraqi assets vested by the President in 2003.", "Vine v. Republic of Iraq involves 237 plaintiffs who were unsuccessful in joining the Hill case after the judge denied class action status to the lawsuit and imposed a moratorium on the addition of new plaintiffs. The plaintiffs include U.S. nationals who were used as \"human shields\" by the Iraqi government to protect various strategic sites from attack, and any U.S. nationals in hiding in Iraq or Kuwait for fear of capture, as well as some of their spouses. Iraq made an appearance in the case and moved to dismiss the claims on several grounds. The court dismissed causes of action based on the Flatow Amendment and federal common law, but permitted claims based on U.S. state and foreign law. The case remains pending.", "The judge dismissed as untimely several other claims that had been consolidated with the Vine case for determining Iraq's motion to dismiss. Two journalists, Robert Simon, a CBS News reporter, and Roberto Alvarez, a cameraman working for CBS News, alleged that they were illegally seized and subsequently tortured by Iraqi officials in 1991. Nabil Seyam and others filed a separate action based similar allegations. The court reasoned that the cause of action in these cases arose no later than December 1990, and that the 10-year statute of limitations had run prior to the cases' filings in 2003. Despite the statutory provision for \"equitable tolling, including the period during which the foreign state was immune from suit,\" the court determined that the four years between the passage of the terrorist exception to the FSIA and the deadline for filing within the statute of limitations was sufficient to preclude equitable tolling. However, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed that decision, holding that the statute of limitations under the statute did not run until 10 years after the enactment of the terrorism exception to the FSIA.", "Beaty v. Iraq is a suit against Iraq by five children of two men who were held hostage in Iraq during the 1990s. The two hostages and their wives sued Iraq in 1996 in conjunction with several other former hostages and their spouses, Daliberti v. Iraq , and were able to recover the resulting default judgment from the Iraqi frozen funds vested by President Bush in 2003. The Beaty plaintiffs grounded their complaint on claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress under state common law, violations of customary international law incorporated into federal common law, and loss of solatium under federal common law. Iraq entered an appearance and moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, for grounds of nonjusticiability under the political question doctrine, and for lack of jurisdiction due to the presidential order relieving Iraq from the legal consequences of its status as a terrorist State. The court suggested its agreement with the government's position, expressed in several statements of interest filed in the case, that the presidential order validly restored Iraq's sovereign immunity and divested the court of jurisdiction ; however, the court was bound by the appellate court decision in Acree to hold that \u00a7 1503 of EWSAA did not authorize the President's efforts in that regard. The court rejected the plaintiffs' federal common law claims but permitted the suit to continue with respect to the state claims under Florida and Oklahoma law, and accepted that the facts established in the Daliberti case may be deemed established for the purposes of all further proceedings without further proof. Iraq's interlocutory appeal was unsuccessful, but it has filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court regarding the validity of the President's order restoring Iraq's sovereign immunity pursuant to \u00a7 1503 of EWSAA.

After Iraq failed to enter an appearance, the plaintiffs moved for a default judgment. The court initially denied the motion for failure to state a cause of action, but after the plaintiffs amended their complaint, the court entered a default against Iraq. Iraq subsequently entered an appearance and asked the court to set aside the entry of default, which the court granted based on its finding that Iraq had acted as expeditiously as possible, given the circumstances.

In Simon , Iraq argued that the repeal of \u00a7 1605(a)(7) cut off jurisdiction of pending cases, while the presidential waiver prevented their conversion into claims under new \u00a7 1605A.

If that is the case, Iraqi government assets used for commercial purposes in the United States that are not subject to the protection of E.O. 13303 (which covers the Development Fund for Iraq and all interests associated with Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products), would be subject to attachment and execution on valid terrorism judgments against Iraq.

Elahi", "paragraphs": ["Although Iran has not appeared in court to defend itself in any of the terrorism cases brought against it, it did nonetheless challenge a decision that allowed a judgment-holder to collect part of a judgment against Iran out of an award owed to Iran by a third party. The Ministry of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (MOD) asked the Supreme Court to overturn a decision that allowed the respondent, Dariush Elahi to attach a $2.8 million arbitral award issued in Iran's favor by the International Chamber of Commerce for a breach of contract that occurred in 1979. Elahi had been awarded a default judgment of $311.7 million in a lawsuit against Iran and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) based on the 1990 the assassination of his brother, Dr. Cyrus Elahi, a dissident who was shot to death in Paris by agents of the Iranian intelligence service. Dariush Elahi and another judgment-holder, Stephen Flatow, both attempted to intervene in MOD's suit against Cubic Defense Systems, Inc. to attach Iran's award in partial satisfaction of their judgments against Iran. Flatow's petition was denied after the court found that he had waived his right to attach such assets by accepting payment under section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA).", "Elahi's lawsuit was one of those cases added later to section 2002 of the VTVPA, however; and since he was only able to collect a portion of the compensatory damages from U.S. funds, he retained the right to pursue satisfaction of the rest of the compensatory portion of his claim from Iranian blocked assets not at issue before the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal. Iran argued that its judgment retained immunity under the FSIA as military property. The court rejected Iran's contention, noting that MOD did not assert that the judgment would be used for military purposes, but instead stated the money would be deposited in Iran's central bank. The court also rejected Iran's contention that the judgment is protected as \"the property ... of a foreign central bank or monetary authority held for its own account\" within the meaning of section 1611(b)(1), because it found that language to apply only to money held by a foreign bank \"to be used or held in connection with central banking activities.\" MOD also sought to invoke the blocking regulations as a bar to the attachment of the judgment, but the court rejected that argument as well, pointing out that the transaction was permitted under a general license.", "Finally, MOD sought to bring a collateral attack against Elahi's default judgment, contesting the jurisdiction of the court that issued it on the basis of the alleged invalidity of the FSIA terrorism exception under the Cicippio-Puleo decision, supra . The court, construing the jurisdictional question as one of personal jurisdiction rather than subject-matter jurisdiction, found that MOD could have attempted to void the judgment on this basis at the district court level, but had waited too long to raise the issue during collateral proceedings. Because MOD was unable to show that the district court that issued the default judgment in favor of Elahi acted in a manner inconsistent with due process, or that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case, the court affirmed the decision in favor of Elahi.", "MOD petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme Court to review the decision on several bases. MOD challenged the Ninth Circuit's assumption that MOD is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Iran rather than an integral part of the Iranian government without separate juridical status. This distinction has bearing under the FSIA as to how its assets are treated and whether it can be held liable for the debts of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). MOD also challenged the assessment that the judgment due it on a military contract is not military property under the FSIA. As to the collateral attack on Elahi's judgment, Iran argued that in the context of the FSIA, questions of personal jurisdiction and subject-matter jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign are so intimately linked as to be inseparable, which would allow MOD to dispute the validity of Elahi's default judgment by asserting it was founded on an invalid cause of action.", "Based on the recommendation of the Solicitor General, the Supreme Court granted certiorari only with respect to the issue of MOD's status as an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Iran. In a per curiam opinion, the Court vacated the decision below on the grounds that MOD had not had an opportunity to present argument on the issue. The Ninth Circuit had erred, according to the Court, because it had either mistakenly relied on a \"concession\" by the plaintiff that MOD was an \"agency or instrumentality,\" or it had simply assumed that there was no relevant distinction between those entities and a foreign State proper. The FSIA provides an exception to the immunity from execution of the property of a foreign State only if such property is used for commercial purposes. By contrast, the property of an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign State is not immune from execution if the entity is engaged in commercial activity in the United States, regardless of whether the property is used for the commercial activity.", "On remand, the appellate court found that MOD is a foreign State rather than an agency or instrumentality of a foreign State, so that the judgment owed to MOD in the Cubic Defense arbitration would have to qualify as property used for commercial activity in order for the FSIA exception to sovereign immunity to apply. The court did not regard the judgment as commercial property; however, the court found that it was a \"blocked asset\" within the meaning of TRIA \u00a7 201 because it represented an interest in military equipment that Iran had acquired prior to 1981, and permitted the judgment holder to attach the entire sum. One judge dissented, arguing that the judgment should be considered \"at issue\" before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in a case involving Iran's claims against the United States for non-delivery of military equipment. Although the judgment itself is not at issue, Judge Fisher reasoned, it could be used by the United States as an offset in the event Iran is eventually awarded compensation. If the judgment were considered to be at issue before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, the plaintiff would have relinquished his right to attach it in satisfaction of his judgment against Iran by accepting partial payment of compensatory damages from the U.S. Treasury pursuant to TRIA \u00a7 201.", "Iran again petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted, to review whether the arbitral award is a \"blocked asset\" within the meaning of TRIA \u00a7 201 and whether it is \"at issue\" before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal and thus off-limits to Elahi. The Solicitor General had filed a brief supporting certiorari on the first issue but advising against a review of the second on the basis that a determination in Iran's favor would merely mean that the award would be used to satisfy a judgment against Iran where the plaintiff had not relinquished his right to attach such assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "109th Congress: Proposed Legislation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the bills addressing the Acree decision, ( H.R. 1321 and H.Con.Res. 93 , discussed supra ) and one bill to provide compensation in the Roeder case ( H.R. 3358 ), two other bills in the 109 th Congress were introduced in an effort to untangle the state of litigation against terrorist States.

The liens of lis pendens are expressly made enforceable pursuant to chapter 111 of title 28, U.S. Code. That chapter, however, does not establish federal procedures for enforcing lis pendens, although it does provide procedures for the enforcement of other liens in the event a defendant fails to enter an appearance. Federal law provides for the application of state law regarding lis pendens , and these rules vary by state. Ordinarily, the doctrine of lis pendens applies only to specific property at issue in a dispute, which must be described with sufficient specificity and in some cases recorded to enable a prospective purchaser to identify it. Lis pendens applies with respect to only the property described in the notice, and cannot affect other property of a defendant. It is not ordinarily available in suits seeking money judgments over matters unrelated to the property unless and until a valid judgment has been awarded. It does not generally apply to negotiable instruments.", "Ordinarily, the purpose of filing a lien of lis pendens in civil litigation is to put third parties on notice that the property is the subject of litigation, which effectively prevents the alienation of such property, although it is not technically a lien or a prejudgment attachment. It does not prevent or invalidate transactions involving the property, and its intent is not to aid either side in the underlying dispute. Its effect is to bind a person who acquires an interest in property subject to litigation to the result of the litigation as if he or she were a party to it from the outset. Because the resulting cloud on title can have a detrimental effect on the value of property and the right of enjoyment, courts in some jurisdictions have the discretion to require the lis pendens proponent to post a bond when the defendant property owner can show that damages are likely in the event the notice of lis pendens is unjustified. Some states require that the court expunge a lis pendens notice on evidence that the litigation is not the type contemplated by the relevant statute or that the proper procedures were followed. Some state statutes permit the court to cancel a notice of lis pendens if the defendant posts bond or provides some other substitute security, if adequate relief for the claimant may be secured by these means.", "For recording the lis pendens liens in suits filed under section 1605A, the clerk of the district court is required to file the notice of action \"indexed by listing as defendants and all entities listed as controlled by any defendant.\" This appears to be intended to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of identifying specific property in the notices, but it is unclear what further measures might be required to ensure adequate notice is afforded to prospective purchasers or how it is to be determined without further process that the property is in fact subject to attachment, if the statute is interpreted to require such a showing. With respect to real property, federal law ordinarily requires compliance with recordation or indexing procedures applicable in the state where the property is located in order to give constructive notice of an action pending in a United States district court. State procedures typically require that notices of lis pendens affecting real estate are recorded with the local registry of deeds, although in some cases notice is deemed valid as long as the pleadings adequately describe the property at issue. A notice of lis pendens that is not properly recorded may be held ineffective as to the rights of a subsequent purchaser. If the filing requirement in section 1605A(g) is deemed to replace state statutes and to give constructive notice to prospective purchasers, such purchasers who have no actual notice of the lis pendens could raise due process claims.", "The provision appears to have no effect on actions in state courts, which are less frequently the venue for lawsuits under the terrorism exception to the FSIA, although lis pendens will be available under the applicable state law under the ordinary state court procedures for property that qualifies.", "In the case of State sponsors of terror, whose property for the most part is already subject to substantial limitations on transactions, the primary utility may be the establishment of a line of priority among lien-holders, to determine which successful plaintiffs have priority in collecting from the defendant's assets. One function of a lis pendens notice is to preserve for the plaintiff a priority over all subsequent lienors, purchasers, and encumbrancers. Because the notice \"relates back\" to the date of its filing, other plaintiffs who seek to attach property to execute on a judgment may take such property subject to the lis pendens of plaintiffs with pending cases against the same defendant who filed notice previously, even though the complaints may have been filed at a later date and no award has yet been issued.", "On the other hand, the extension of lis pendens over property owned by entities believed by plaintiffs to be \"controlled by\" the defendant State could potentially affect property that is not already subject to sanctions. Depending on how broadly the provision is construed, its exercise could deter transactions. In the case of States that are no longer subject to terrorism sanctions, the lis pendens provision could threaten lawful transactions and impose a new barrier to trade. As long as there are pending claims or outstanding judgments against such a State under the terrorism exception to the FSIA, U.S. companies doing business with it may be subject to litigation by plaintiffs and judgment creditors who believe the U.S. company is in possession of foreign property that is subject to execution on a terrorism judgment. Any real property or tangible property in which the defendant State has an interest may be rendered effectively inalienable by lis pendens notices. If a U.S. company is selling tangible goods to a former State sponsor of terrorism, an automatic lien of lis pendens on goods purchased but not yet delivered would probably not affect the company's ability to make delivery.

It adds a new subsection (g) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71610 to provide that the property of a foreign State against which a judgment has been entered under section 1605A, or of an agency or instrumentality of such a foreign State, \"including property that is a separate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or indirectly in a separate juridical entity,\" is subject to attachment in aid of execution and execution upon that judgment, regardless of how much economic control over that property the foreign government actually exercises and whether the government derives profits or benefits from it. It also allows execution on the property where \"establishing the property as a separate entity would entitle the foreign State to benefits in [U.S.] courts while avoiding its obligation.\" It does not provide the President any waiver authority (except with respect to Iraq). It does not abrogate sovereign immunity of other States that have possession of any assets of a defendant State.", "According to the Committee report accompanying the NDAA, the purpose of the provision is to enable any property in which the foreign state has a beneficial ownership to be subject to execution for terrorism judgments, except for diplomatic and consular property. The proposed language suggests that the \"property\" at issue is or belongs to a commercial entity in which the foreign government has an interest. The language renders subject to execution any property (including interests held directly or indirectly in a separate juridical entity) of the defendant foreign State regardless of five criteria set forth in subsection (g)(1):", "(A) the level of economic control over the property by the government of the foreign state;", "(B) whether the profits of the property go to that government;", "(C) the degree to which officials of that government manage the property or otherwise have a hand in its daily affairs;", "(D) whether that government is the sole beneficiary in interest of the property; or", "(E) whether establishing the property interest as a separate entity would entitle the foreign state to benefits in [U.S.] courts while avoiding its obligations.", "Courts ordinarily consider these criteria in determining whether an entity is an \"alter ego\" of a foreign government for liability purposes or is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of the foreign government for purposes of determining whether it is entitled to immunity. An entity that is not an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government is not entitled to sovereign immunity, but neither are its assets subject to attachment in execution of a judgment awarded against that foreign government. This is not due to sovereign immunity, but because a judgment creditor may not levy against a third party's property in order to satisfy a money judgment against a judgment debtor. The new language could be read as an effort to make any entity in which the judgment debtor foreign State (including its separate agencies and instrumentalities) has any interest liable for the terrorism-related judgments awarded against that State, even if the entity is not itself an agency or instrumentality of the State. The conferee's intent to enable execution on property in which the defendant state has beneficial ownership seems contradicted by the statement that the property is subject to execution regardless of whether the \"profits of the property go to that government\" or \"whether that government is the sole beneficiary in interest of the property.\"", "On the other hand, subparagraph (3) addresses the rights of third parties who also have an interest in the property that may be subject to levy in execution on a judgment. Captioned \"Third-Party Joint Property Holders,\" it states that nothing in the new section 1610(g) is to be construed as superceding the authority of a court to prevent the impairment of an interest held by a person \"who is not liable in the action giving rise to a judgment.\" The conference report states the intent of the conferees was to \"encourage the courts to protect the property interests of such innocent third parties by using their inherent authority, on a case-by-case basis, under the applicable procedures governing execution on judgment and attachment in anticipation of judgment.\" Nonetheless, this savings language is not easily squared with the provision's stated applicability to indirectly held property, without regard to the benefit the debtor government derives from the property. Moreover, agencies or instrumentalities of foreign governments have not generally been considered to be liable for the debts of the foreign government itself or for other agencies or instrumentalities. Subparagraph (3) could be read to permit the court to protect their assets as well, although subparagraph (1) appears intended to make their assets available to satisfy terrorism judgments against the foreign State."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blocked and Regulated Property under Sanctions Regulations", "paragraphs": ["New subsection (g)(2), captioned \"U.S. sovereign immunity inapplicable,\" would make a property described in (g)(1) that is regulated by reason of U.S. sanctions not immune by reason of such regulation from execution to satisfy a judgment.

In this respect, it echoes language in current \u00a71610(f)(1), except that it applies only to regulated property rather than property that is blocked or regulated pursuant to sanctions regimes, and it would not be subject to the presidential waiver in \u00a71620(f)(3).

Even if the provision is read to waive U.S. sovereign immunity, these funds remain the property of the United States and could not be used to satisfy the debt of another party. A contrary interpretation of the provision might implicate other policy concerns.

The subsection also states that the \"defenses of res judicata, collateral estoppel and limitation period are waived\" in any reinstated judgment or refiled action. The language does not indicate how pending cases in state courts are to be handled. The provision does not appear to permit the refiling of actions to override decisions construing the statute of limitations strictly. However, it might be read to permit post-judgment relief to pursue increased awards, possibly including punitive damages, where the application of state law or other law to a claim resulted in a lower award than would have been permitted pursuant to the Flatow Amendment if it had been read to provide a federal cause of action. It could be interpreted to permit the amendment of judgments against officials in their private capacity to make the foreign State responsible for the debt.", "In addition, subparagraph (3) permits the filing of new cases involving incidents that are already the subject of a timely-filed action under any of the terrorism exceptions to the FSIA.

It may allow claimants previously not covered by the exceptions, such as foreign nationals working for the United States government overseas who were injured in a terrorist attack, to bring a lawsuit despite expiration of the statute of limitations. It may also allow plaintiffs with previous judgments to pursue new judgments based on the same terrorist incident but citing the new cause of action. Such actions must be filed within sixty days after enactment or the date of entry of judgment in the original action. Refiled actions and actions related to previous claims are to be permitted to go forth even if the foreign State is no longer designated as a State sponsor of terrorism, as long as the original action was filed when the State was on the list of terrorist States.

Ordinarily, a change in statutory law may be applied to civil cases that arose prior to its enactment, if Congress makes clear its intent in this regard, but only in cases still pending before the courts and those filed after enactment. To the extent that \u00a7 1083 is read to require courts to reopen final judgments and previously dismissed cases, or reinstate vacated judgments, the provision may be vulnerable to invalidation as an improper exercise of judicial powers by Congress.

Judgment holders would likely seek to attach goods purchased by the debtor government as well as financial instruments used to pay for goods or services or to secure contract performance. If judgment holders succeed in seizing property or debts in the possession of a U.S. company, the contracting government could seek to hold the company liable for breach of contract for failing to make payment or delivery, as the case may be. Or the government could seek to justify its own breach or early termination of a contract, which could also result in losses to the U.S. company involved. Although it seems likely that a U.S. court would not find the U.S. company in breach of contract for having submitted to a judicial order, the contract in question may call for disputes to be resolved according to foreign law or in a foreign forum or through international arbitration, in which case the outcome may be less certain. The risk of litigation, which is unlikely to be without cost even if successful, may serve as a deterrent to trade. If a former State sponsor of terrorism chooses not to open accounts or establish standby letters of credit in financial institutions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, trade between U.S. companies and that country could become more difficult and riskier for the U.S. companies involved, and the foreign State may avoid risk by choosing business partners outside the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exemption for Libya (S. 3370)", "paragraphs": ["U.S. businesses seeking to establish a commercial relationship with Libya expressed concern that \u00a7 1083 will harm U.S.-Libya trade. The Bush Administration, which has touted renewed U.S. investment in Libya and growth in bilateral trade as beneficial to the U.S. economy and as important tools for reestablishing relations with a reformed state sponsor of terrorism, appears to share their view. Nearly $1.7 billion has been awarded against Libya, with an additional $5.3 billion awarded against certain named Libyan officials, and with some 20 additional cases pending. The State Department announced that settlement negotiations to resolve outstanding cases against Libya were ongoing, and asked Congress to amend section 1083 to permit waivers in the case of all States that are removed from the list of designated State sponsors of terrorism. Senator Biden introduced a separate bill negotiated by the Administration, S. 3370 , to exempt Libya from terror-related lawsuits if it agrees to compensate certain U.S. victims under a claims settlement agreement with the United States.", "S. 3370 , the \"Libyan Claims Resolution Act,\" was enacted on August 4, 2008. It provides an exception to the FSIA for Libya in the event Libya signs an international agreement (\"claims agreement\") with the United States to settle terrorism-related claims and to provide fair compensation. It contains a sense of the Congress in support of the President's efforts \"to provide fair compensation to all nationals of the United States who have terrorism-related claims against Libya.\" The statute authorizes the Secretary of State to designate one or more \"entities\" within the United States to assist in the provision of compensation. It does not indicate whether the designated entity is to have a role in adjudicating claims, or whether the amount of compensation and identity of claimants eligible for compensation are to be specifically set forth in the claims agreement. It appears that the government is to receive funds pursuant to an agreement with Libya, which it would then turn over to the designated entity for dispersal to claimants, although there is no express requirement to this effect in the statute. All of the entity's property that is related to the claims agreement would then be immune from judicial attachment, and the entity itself would be immune from lawsuits related to actions it takes to implement a claims agreement. A designated entity will not be subject to the Government Corporation Control Act.", "If the Secretary of State certifies to Congress that sufficient funds have been received under the claims agreement, the statute will provide immunity to Libya, including its agencies and instrumentalities as well as its officials, employees, and agents, for all claims brought under the terrorism exception to the FSIA, either under the previous version of the statute or as amended by \u00a7 1083 of the FY08 NDAA, whether the suits are brought in federal or state courts. The statute provides immunity to property belonging to Libya, including its agencies and instrumentalities, and the property of Libyan agents, officials, and employees, from attachment in aid of execution or similar judicial process under the FSIA terrorism exception. In order for the funds received by the government to be sufficient for the purposes of the certification under the bill, they must be sufficient to cover settlements Libya has agreed to pay to victims of the Pan Am 103 airliner bombing and the La Belle Disco bombing, as well as to provide \"fair compensation\" to U.S. nationals who have pending cases against Libya for wrongful death or physical injury arising under section 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A (including previous actions that have been given effect as if they had been filed under \u00a7 1605A).

It is unclear how the entity designated to assist in the dispersal of the funds is to determine how much to provide to each of the claimants. There is no express requirement that the designated entity disperse the funds.", "The provision does not explicitly state that only claims described in the certification requirement would be compensated, but this seems to be a fair inference. Under this interpretation, no compensation is envisioned in the case of claimants who are not beneficiaries of a settlement agreement in the Pan Am 103 and La Belle Disco cases unless they have a pending case under \u00a7 1605A for wrongful death or physical injury. Claims that would otherwise be permitted under \u00a7 1605A, for example, a claim for solatium or intentional infliction of emotional distress related to the hostage-taking of a family member, would not likely be compensated under the bill. It appears that finally adjudicated cases are not covered, in which case unsatisfied judgments against Libya and its officials will likely be unenforceable.

Some claimants were able to collect portions of their judgments under \u00a72002 of the Victims of Trafficking Act, while those not covered have been left largely to compete with each other to lay claim to the blocked assets of terrorist States for satisfaction of the compensatory damages portions of their judgments.

Confusion about the definition of an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign State also brought uncertainty to these lawsuits.

Whether more assets of those States will become available to satisfy those judgments is less certain. Making the assets of separate agencies and instrumentalities available to satisfy judgments may increase the total assets available for levy in the short term, but may also lead such entities to avoid future transactions that would put their assets at risk. An increase in transactions with debtor States is likely to occur only with respect to those States that are no longer subject to anti-terrorism sanctions, in which case the use of any assets that come into the jurisdiction of the United States to satisfy judgments may act as a barrier to trade notwithstanding the lifting of sanctions. On the other hand, if the terrorism exception to the FSIA results in a decrease in terrorist attacks affecting the interests of U.S. persons, such judgments should become less common with the passage of time and the statute of limitations.", "Appendix A.
