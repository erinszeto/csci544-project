Some radios did not work in the high-rise World Trade Center; radio channels were overloaded by the large number of responders trying to communicate; and public safety radio systems operated on various frequencies and were not interoperable. There were also non-technical issues. Officials struggled to coordinate the multi-agency response, and to maintain command and control of the numerous agencies and responders.", "The 9/11 Commission called for the \"expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes.\" Increased spectrum would allow public safety agencies to accommodate an increasing number of users; support interoperability solutions (e.g., shared channels); and leverage new technologies (e.g., live video streams) to enhance response.", "In 2012, Congress acted on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. In Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96), Congress authorized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate additional spectrum for public safety use; established the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) and authorized it to enter into a public-private partnership to build a nationwide public safety broadband network; and, provided $7 billion out of revenues from spectrum auctions to build the network.", "February 22, 2017, marked five years since the act was signed into law. FirstNet has made progress in implementing the provisions in the act. In March 2017, FirstNet awarded a 25-year, $6.5 billion contract to AT&T to build and maintain the nationwide network for public safety. FirstNet provided AT&T with 20 megahertz (MHz) of broadband spectrum, which AT&T can monetize for public safety and non-public safety use. AT&T is providing FirstNet access to its infrastructure, valued at $180 billion, and $40 billion to maintain and improve the network.", "In September 2017, FirstNet/AT&T presented states with plans detailing how the network would be deployed in each state. Governors could opt to have AT&T deploy the network (i.e., opt in), or have the state assume responsibility for the deployment (i.e., opt out). By January 2018, all 50 states and 6 territories opted in. This was viewed as a victory for FirstNet, AT&T, and public safety stakeholders who had long advocated for a nationwide network for public safety.", "However, challenges remain. While governors allowed FirstNet/AT&T to deploy the network in their states, there is no requirement for state and local public safety agencies to use the network. FirstNet/AT&T must attract users to the network to ensure the network is self-sustaining, as required under the act. FirstNet set adoption targets and steep penalties that AT&T must pay if targets are not met. AT&T has offered specialized features and services (e.g., priority access to the network, support during disasters) to attract users to the network. However, Verizon has offered similar services to entice users to its network which may affect FirstNet/AT&T's enrollment efforts. There are other factors affecting enrollment. Some public safety agencies have expressed reluctance to join the FirstNet network, citing uncertainties with the resiliency, reliability, and security of the network, coverage, and cost. Other agencies have expressed an unwillingness to join until FirstNet can provide mission critical voice features\u2014essential features that responders have on their radios and use during emergencies\u2014that will not be available from FirstNet until 2019.

In P.L. 112-96 (the act), Congress created FirstNet as an independent authority, within the National Telecommunications and Information Administrations (NTIA), under the Department of Commerce. FirstNet is governed by a Board comprised of federal, private sector, and public safety representatives, which reviews and approves the major decisions of the agency.

Many in Congress recognized that $7 billion would not be enough to deploy a nationwide network for public safety. As a result, Congress authorized FirstNet to enter into a public-private partnership to leverage commercial infrastructure and services, in exchange for access to FirstNet assets, including $7 billion in funding and 20 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum.", "The act is complex. It requires the establishment of a new federal agency and the appointment of a Board of Directors. It requires the development and deployment of a new nationwide broadband network for public safety users.

The act requires FirstNet to build the network to industry standards, and the development of technical requirements, some of which were still under development by the international standards development organization, 3GPP. Further, the act requires consultation with public safety users; governors; and federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities to coordinate the deployment of the network. Each mandated task took time but was used to inform a request for proposal (RFP) which was released in January 2016, and awarded in March 2017. ", "In March 2017, FirstNet awarded the contract to build the network to AT&T. In May 2017, AT&T offered public safety agencies priority and preemption services on its nationwide network to attract users to the network. In September, FirstNet/AT&T released state plans detailing the initial (five-year) deployment of the network in the state. By January 2018, all states and territories had opted in to the network (i.e., allowed AT&T to deploy the network in their state).

Radios allow responders to transmit messages quickly over the airwaves to coordinate and communicate during response. To transmit messages over the airwaves, public safety agencies must obtain a license from the FCC which regulates the use of the radio spectrum in the United States. ", "The FCC assigns frequencies to non-federal users, including state and local public safety agencies. Pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7151 et. seq.), the FCC designated certain segments of spectrum for specific uses. The FCC set aside a swathe of spectrum for public safety; however, demand soon exceeded the amount of spectrum allocated. As a result, the FCC began assigning various frequencies across the radio spectrum to public safety agencies. While the increased assignment of spectrum gave public safety agencies the spectrum they needed to communicate, public safety agencies were now operating on various frequency bands, scattered across the spectrum, using band-specific equipment that was not interoperable with equipment made to operate in other bands. Public safety advocates called for the allocation of additional spectrum and solutions that would enable agencies to interoperate. In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), Congress allocated 24 MHz to public safety. This required the transition of broadcasters off the spectrum, but provided an indefinite timeline for their transition; as a result, the spectrum was not immediately available to public safety. ", "During the terrorist attacks of 9/11, public safety agencies could not communicate with each other. Radio channels were overloaded, and the multiple public safety agencies that responded to the events were operating on various frequencies and could not interoperate. In reviewing the events, the 9/11 Commission confirmed that New York City police and firefighters, operating on different frequencies, and using different channels, could not communicate, which hindered response. Further, the 9/11 Commission noted that systems and channels were overloaded by the large number of responders trying to communicate that day. The Commission called for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety use.", "In the act, Congress provided a large swathe of spectrum, in a single band to enable agencies to communicate and coordinate during emergencies. In the act, Congress reallocated the 700 MHz D Block spectrum from commercial to public safety use. This 10 MHz block was adjacent to an existing block of public safety spectrum that, when combined, provided 20 MHz of prime broadband spectrum to public safety use. ", "This combined spectrum (now called FirstNet spectrum or Band Class 14 spectrum) is serving as the foundation for the nationwide public safety broadband network created under the act. Figure 1 provides an overview of the FirstNet spectrum.", "This FirstNet (Band Class 14) spectrum is to be used to build out a dedicated public safety broadband network. Broadband is commonly used to mean any high-speed access to the internet. A broadband network for public safety is to provide public safety users with high-speed access to data (e.g., video transfer, internet access) and specialized features and applications (e.g., prioritization of users, location-based services, device management), that are not available on current commercial networks or public safety radios. ", "While many public safety agencies already use commercial broadband services (e.g., cell phones, laptops), they access these services through commercial providers and commercial networks. During times of heavy use or congestion, which often occurs during emergencies, public safety users face the same constraints as commercial customers\u2014loss of service, network unavailable, inability to make a call due to the high volume of traffic. Public safety users require higher levels of security, reliability, and redundancy to effectively perform their emergency response and life-saving functions. LMR systems have been built to serve public safety users; these are public safety-only systems that provide users with immediate access to the agency's communication system and specialized features for public safety users. Most have, over time, been strengthened and reinforced to ensure the communication system is reliable, resilient, secure, and protected from natural and man-made disasters. Commercial networks are built to different standards. ", "Therefore, at any given time, public safety agencies could be using ", "LMR (radio) systems that are owned and operated by individual public safety agencies, serve a specific agency or set of agencies within a certain geographic area, operate on various frequencies across the spectrum, and may or may not be interoperable with other LMR systems in the area. These systems offer reliable voice capabilities, are tried and tested in emergencies, have been hardened (i.e., reinforced) to withstand emergencies, and often include back-up capabilities if the network goes down; Commercial broadband/cellular networks that are owned and operated by commercial providers, offer nationwide coverage, enable voice communications between users, and offer high-speed access to data and applications, but do not always provide the levels of accessibility, reliability, security, and features that public safety users need; and FirstNet is to provide the benefits of commercial broadband networks (e.g., priority access to high-speed data, location-based services, incident management tools), with added reliability, security, and redundancies that public safety needs. At first launch, however, FirstNet will not be able to offer the mission critical voice capabilities that are available through LMR systems; industry standards were approved in May 2016, and device development and testing is underway. Therefore, LMR systems will need to be maintained to ensure public safety has access to mission critical voice capabilities. ", "State and local public safety agencies leverage different systems to communicate during incidents. FirstNet is intended to supplement these systems, to provide public safety users with dedicated spectrum, added broadband capabilities, and advanced technologies to increase situational awareness and enhance response.

The act authorizes FirstNet to enter into a public-private partnership and a covered leasing agreement\u2014an agreement to construct, manage, and operate the network. The act also permitted access to network capacity on a secondary basis (i.e., access to the spectrum when it is not in use by public safety). ", "In its RFP, FirstNet made all 20 MHz of the FirstNet (Band Class 14) spectrum available to the winning bidder. The awardee is permitted to monetize (i.e., earn revenue from) all 20 MHz of the spectrum. As the winning bidder, AT&T can generate revenue from public safety users which must be used to support and improve the network. AT&T can also generate revenue from other users (e.g., secondary users, commercial customers) when the spectrum is not in use by public safety. Some experts estimated that public safety agencies will use approximately 1% of the FirstNet spectrum, allowing AT&T to use a large portion of the spectrum for commercial use.", "In winning the contract, AT&T gained access to 20 MHz of unencumbered nationwide spectrum. Further, the spectrum is not limited to a defined geographical area. Additionally, the spectrum is licensed for public safety use, which permits the use of higher powered devices that can provide wider coverage. And, the spectrum does not count against spectrum holding limits set for wireless carriers by the FCC, allowing AT&T to bid on other spectrum. These features add to the value of the FirstNet spectrum, which some experts have estimated to be $8 billion. ", "AT&T noted that the award of FirstNet aligns with its plan to deploy a commercial 5G network, and that it sees efficiencies that can be achieved from \"climbing the tower once\" to install equipment for FirstNet, and for its own 5G network; further, the award of FirstNet has provided AT&T with a wider fiber footprint (i.e., a nationwide footprint that includes access to fiber that can connect infrastructure, networks, and devices), which AT&T believes will serve as an advantage during 5G network deployment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Network Architecture", "paragraphs": ["The act required FirstNet to ensure the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network (see Figure 2 ), based on a single, nationwide architecture that evolves with technological advancements.

The core is a key component for ensuring that users have a consistent experience nationwide, and that the network is interoperable. Through the core, FirstNet can ensure a centralized approach to managing access, uniform user profiles, applications and services; further, FirstNet can consistently manage information and users and ensure the security of network. The RAN portion of the network (i.e., cell towers, hot spots embedded in vehicles) is to be deployed state-by-state. Traffic is to flow from devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets) through the RAN and is to backhaul to the core network over satellite or other wireless infrastructure. ", "The act requires the network to comply with minimum technical interoperability requirements, set by an Interoperability Board, and based on commercial standards for Long Term Evolution (LTE) service. The act encourages the use of commercial and government-owned infrastructure to speed the deployment of the network, and permits FirstNet to enter into roaming agreements, which would allow users to make and receive calls when traveling outside the geographic coverage area of the FirstNet network.

AT&T has a five-year deployment plan, which includes the development and deployment of the core network, and the deployment of the radio access network (RAN) in each state and territory. During the deployment period, AT&T has offered public safety users access to its commercial network with priority and preemption services. Priority access means that public safety users can access AT&T's commercial network during emergencies, when there is typically heavy use and congestion. ", "In June 2017, FirstNet/AT&T provided states with preliminary state plans, detailing how FirstNet/ AT&T would deploy the Radio Access Network (RAN) portion of the network in each state (e.g., cell towers, mobile hot spots). The deployment plans were based on state and local needs, and other information collected during consultations between FirstNet and states over the past three years.
