Organized crime-related violence in Mexico declined from 2011 to 2014 but rose in 2015 and again in 2016. Analysts estimate that the violence may have claimed more than 109,000 lives since December 2006. High-profile cases\u2014particularly the enforced disappearance and murder of 43 students in Guerrero in September 2014\u2014have drawn attention to the problem of human rights abuses involving security forces. Numerous cases of corruption by former governors, some of whom have fled the country, have increased concerns about impunity.", "Supporting Mexico's criminal justice sector reform efforts is widely regarded as crucial for combating criminality and improving citizen security in the country. U.S. support for those efforts has increased significantly as a result of the development and implementation of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a bilateral partnership launched in 2007 for which Congress has appropriated almost $2.8 billion since FY2008. U.S. assistance to Mexico focuses on (1) disrupting organized criminal groups, (2) institutionalizing the rule of law, (3) creating a 21st-century border, and (4) building strong and resilient communities. Newer areas of focus have involved bolstering security along Mexico's southern border and addressing the production and trafficking of heroin and fentanyl. As of March 2017, more than $1.6 billion of M\u00e9rida assistance had been delivered to Mexico.", "Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has continued U.S.-Mexican security cooperation but struggled to contain rising crime. U.S. intelligence has helped Mexico arrest top crime leaders, including Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, in February 2014. Guzm\u00e1n's July 2015 prison escape was a major setback, but he was recaptured in 2016 and extradited to the United States in early 2017. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government met a 2008 constitutional mandate to transition to an accusatorial justice system by June 2016 but has made minimal progress in preventing torture, enforced disappearances, and other serious human rights abuses. A spate of killings of journalists thus far in 2017 and media reports that the government has spied on journalists and human rights defenders have prompted serious domestic and international concern.", "On May 18, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly met for the second time with their Mexican counterparts and pledged to continue security cooperation with new \"strategies to attack the business model\" of criminal organizations. President Trump's FY2018 budget request includes $85 million for the M\u00e9rida Initiative (a 38.8% decline from the FY2017 estimated appropriation). It is as yet unclear what types of programs would be most affected by potential funding reductions.", "Congress provided $139 million in FY2017 for the M\u00e9rida Initiative in the FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-31), some $10 million above the budget request; it is now considering the FY2018 budget request. The Senate passed a resolution (S.Res. 83) calling for U.S. support for Mexico's efforts to combat illicit fentanyl production and trafficking. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House (H.Res. 268). Bipartisan resolutions that are similar, but not identical, have been introduced in both chambers reiterating the importance of bilateral cooperation (H.Res. 336 and S.Res. 102).

Organized crime-related violence has resulted in more than 109,000 killings since December 2006 and contributed to 30,000 disappearances. For the first quarter of 2017, organized crime-related violence in Mexico reached levels not seen since the end of the Felipe Calder\u00f3n Administration (2006-2012; see Figure 1 , below).

Between FY2008 and FY2017, Congress appropriated more than $2.8 billion for M\u00e9rida Initiative programs (see Table 1 ), more than $1.6 billion of which has been delivered.

Although Mexico's public relations approach to security issues has changed, its operational approach has remained basically the same. That approach, commonly referred to as the kingpin strategy , has focused on taking out the top- and mid-level leadership of Mexico's criminal organizations. Critics maintain that this approach has fueled violence by encouraging succession struggles and turf wars. The government's continued inability to resolve high-profile cases\u2014including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances involving security forces and corruption cases involving former governors\u2014has underscored ongoing problems with impunity.

Congress is now considering President Trump's FY2018 budget request, which would cut funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative by $54 million, or 38.8%, compared to the FY2017 estimated funding level (see Table 1 ). Congress may analyze how progress under the M\u00e9rida Initiative is being measured; how U.S. funds have been used to advance Mexico's police and judicial reform efforts; and the degree to which U.S. programs in Mexico complement other U.S. counterdrug and border security efforts. Congress also may seek to ensure that funds support opium poppy drug eradication and interdiction programs given rising heroin, fentanyl (a synthetic opioid more powerful than heroin), and methamphetamine production in Mexico.

It begins with a brief discussion of security challenges in Mexico and Mexico's security strategy. It then provides information on the evolution of congressional funding and oversight of the M\u00e9rida Initiative before delving into its four pillars.

It remains a major transit country for cocaine sold in the United States and is a transit and probable supplier country of fentanyl (a potent synthetic opioid often mixed with heroin). Marijuana remains the most widely abused drug in the United States, with some of the supply coming from Mexico, although the quality of most Mexican marijuana has been considered inferior to the marijuana produced domestically. In contrast, more Mexico-produced methamphetamine is being used in the United States than U.S.-produced product. Methamphetamine seizures at the southwest border increased 305% from 2010 to 2015. ", "There has also been particular concern about the increasing availability of Mexican-produced heroin in the United States, including in eastern states where Colombian-produced heroin used to predominate. The amount of heroin seized along the U.S.-Mexico border more than doubled from 2010 to 2015. Surging U.S. demand has fueled increasing opium cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, as well as drug trafficking-related violence in areas where groups are vying to control production. In June 2016, the Mexican government estimated the average poppy cultivation in Mexico to be 24,000 hectares for 2014-2015.

", "Mexican TCOs have vied for control of illicit routes into the United States and for control over local drug distribution networks. Mexico's criminal organizations are also continuing to fragment and diversify away from drug trafficking, furthering their expansion into activities such as oil theft, alien smuggling, kidnapping, and human trafficking.

Violence has escalated even further thus far in 2017 (4,370 such killings recorded in the first quarter as compared to 2,538 for that period in 2016). Fragmentation and infighting among criminal groups has intensified since the rise of the Jalisco New Generation or CJNG cartel, a group that shot down a military helicopter in 2015 and a police helicopter in September 2016. The recapture and extradition of \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n has prompted succession battles within Sinaloa and emboldened the CJNG and other TCOs to challenge Sinaloa's dominance.
