This set of changes creates a multi-tiered payment system, one for local plans, anotherfor regional plans and then beginning in 2010 another one for local plans in areas designated as costcontainment areas.", "The immediate changes became effective on March 1, 2004. First, a fourth paymentmechanism was added to the calculation of MA payments, so that in 2004, plans are paid the highestof the floor, minimum percent increase, the blend, or a new amount. (See below for a description ofthe three previous payment amounts.) The new payment amount is 100% of fee-for-service (FFS)payments made for persons enrolled in traditional Medicare. The FFS payment is calculated basedon the adjusted average per capita costs for the year for an MA payment area (a county), for servicescovered under Medicare Parts A and B for beneficiaries entitled to benefits under Part A, enrolledin Part B and not enrolled in an MA plan. Other immediate changes were also made to modify thestatutory formulas used to calculate MA payments. All of these immediate changes, discussed inmore detail below, had the effect of increasing payments to MA plans.", "Additional changes to payments for local MA plans will be made, beginning in 2006. TheSecretary will determine MA payment rates by comparing plan bids (the plan's estimated averagerevenue requirement, (i.e., their estimate of the cost of providing required Medicare Parts A and Bservices) to a benchmark (the maximum amount the federal government is willing to pay a plan forproviding these required benefits). After plans submit their bids, the Secretary will have theauthority to negotiate the bid amount, similar to the authority of the Director of the Office ofPersonnel Management (OPM) with respect to the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. TheSecretary will calculate the benchmark by updating the previous year's payment in a local area bythe statutorily required increase. If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, its payment will equalits bid plus a rebate of 75% of the difference (between the benchmark and the bid). The rebate maybe used to provide additional benefits, reduce cost sharing, or may be applied towards the monthlyPart B premium, prescription drug premium, or supplemental premium (for services beyond requiredMedicare benefits). The remaining 25% of the difference will be retained by the federal government. If a plan's bid is equal to or above the benchmark, its payment will be the benchmark amount andeach enrollee in that plan will pay an additional premium equal to the amount by which the bidexceeds the benchmark.", "Although the program is identified as competitive beginning in 2006, in fact the localbenchmark will not be determined in a competitive manner; that is, a payment to one plan in an areawill not be based on any other plan's bid to provide the standard package of Medicare services. Local plans will still continue to compete with one another in order to attract beneficiaries, butpayments to plans in local areas will continue to be based solely on statutorily defined increases. Beginning in 2006, MA plans that choose to offer prescription drug coverage, will also receive abenchmark payment for Part D prescription drug benefits. The benchmark will be competitivelydetermined, based on an adjusted average of all plan bids for the area. By basing the benchmark forPart D benefits on the bids submitted by other plans, the payment methodology applied to MA plansfor providing prescription drug coverage introduces a new form of competition into the program.", "Also beginning in 2006, the MA program will begin to offer MA regional plans in 26 regionsacross the country. MA regional plans cover both in- and out-of-network required services and haveboth a limit on out-of-pocket expenses and a unified Parts A and B deductible. Each year anorganization will submit a separate monthly bid amount for each plan it intends to offer in a region. The regional benchmark , will include two components; (1) a statutorily determined increase, and (2)a weighted average of plan bids. As with the Part D benchmark for MA plans that offer aprescription drug benefit, the addition of the second component introduces a new form ofcompetition among plans, by basing part of the benchmark on the bids submitted by the plans. Similar to local plans, plans with bids below the benchmark will be given a rebate while plans withbids above the benchmark will require an additional enrollee premium.", "Additional financial incentives will be provided to encourage regional plan participation. First, starting in 2007, the MMA establishes a stabilization fund to provide incentives for regionalplans to enter into and to remain in the MA program. There will be $10 billion initially provided tothe stabilization fund in 2007 and additional amounts will be added to the fund. Second, during2006 and 2007, Medicare will share risk with an MA regional plan if its costs fall above or belowa statutorily-specified risk corridor. Third, there will be $25 million available beginning in 2006(with an increased amount each year) for additional payments to certain hospitals in regional areasthat demonstrate they have high costs, that would otherwise prevent them from joining an MAnetwork.", "The MMA requires the Secretary to establish a program for the application of comparativecost adjustment (CCA) in CCA areas. The six-year CCA program is required to begin January 1,2010, and to end December 31, 2015, in a fixed number of geographic locations. The program isdesigned to examine the efficiency both among local private plans and between the MA program andtraditional Medicare. For that purpose (1) payments to local MA plans will, in part, be based oncompetitive bids (similar to payments for regional MA plans), and (2) Part B premiums forindividuals enrolled in traditional Medicare may be adjusted, either up of down, depending on therelative costs of Medicare FFS and managed care. This program will be phased-in so that paymentsand Part B premium adjustments will be fully phased in by the beginning of the fourth year. Thereis also a 5% annual limit on the Part B premium adjustment, so that the amount of the adjustmentfor a year can not exceed 5% of the amount of the monthly Part B premium, in non-CCA areas.", "In addition to these payment changes, all MA plans will be able to offer Part D Medicareprescription drug coverage beginning in 2006. As part of the annual bidding process, managed careorganizations offering MA plans with prescription drug coverage must include their estimate for thecost of the Part D prescription drug coverage for each MA plan they intend to offer. Plans may alsochoose to offer supplemental benefits, such as vision or dental coverage, which are not included inthe basic Medicare package. Plans will be required to submit a bid for any supplemental benefitsthey intend to offer.", "Each part of the MA local, regional, and CCA payment structure is discussed in more detailbelow, along with an analysis of the effect of the change in the MMA on Medicare managed care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Payments for Local MA Plans", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare statute for the M+C program set the annual managed care per capita rate fora payment area (for a contract in a calendar year) at the highest of one of three amounts calculated for each county :", "a rate calculated as a blend of an area-specific (local) rate and a nationalrate,", "a minimum payment (or floor) rate, or ", "a rate reflecting a minimum increase from the prior year's rate.", "The revised law for the MA program added a fourth payment type so that beginning March2004, MA plans are paid the highest of the floor, minimum percent increase, the blend, or a newamount.

In general, the benchmark amount is the maximum amount that the federalgovernment would be willing to pay to private plans in an area for the provision of requiredMedicare Parts A and B benefits.

Theblended rate in effect for 2004 was based on 50% of the annual area-specific M+C per capita ratefor the year for the payment area and 50% of the input-price adjusted annual national M+C per capitarate for the year.", "The component of the blend determined by the area-specific (local) rate is based on the 1997AAPCC for the payment area with two adjustments. First, the area-specific rate is reduced toremove an amount corresponding to graduate medical education (GME) (5) payments. Second, rates areupdated each year by a national growth percentage (described below). The component of the blenddetermined by the national rate is a weighted average of all local area-specific rates. This componentof the blend is adjusted to reflect differences in certain input prices, such as hospital labor costs, bya formula stated in the law. Each year, the blended rates are raised or lowered to achieve budgetneutrality; however, there was no budget neutrality adjustment for payments effective March 2004(described below).", "Effect of MMA. Although the blend will not be used to update payments after 2004,eliminating it will have almost no material effect on payments to plans. Because of the budgetneutrality requirement, the blend was used only once to update payments between 1998 and 2003. The MMA waives budget neutrality for 2004, only, so that plans in about 3% of counties (coveringabout 8% of enrollees) were paid the blend in 2004. (See budget neutrality, below.) Additionally,for 2004, the MMA required an adjustment to the local component of the blend to include additionalpayments that would have been made to plans if Medicare beneficiaries entitled to benefits fromfacilities of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) had notused those services (VA/DOD adjustment).

Initially, the BBA provided for a floor ratethat would apply to all counties within the United States and for 2000 this minimum rate was $402per month. A separate minimum was also established for areas outside (i.e., territories) the UnitedStates. Beginning March 2001, BIPA established multiple floor rates, based on population andlocation. For 2001, the floor was $525 for aged enrollees within the 50 states and the District ofColumbia residing in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of more than 250,000. For any other areas within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the floor was $475. For anyarea outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the $525 and $475 floor amounts were alsoapplied, except that the 2001 floor could not exceed 120% of the 2000 floor amount. As requiredby law, these payment amounts are increased annually by a measure of growth in program spending(see discussion of national growth percentage, below). In 2002, the floor was $553 for the largerMSAs and $500 for any other areas within the 50 states.

The floor amountwas included in the original M+C payment structure as a means to achieve one of its goals --reducing variation in payments across the country. The BBA established a minimum amount thatcould be paid to a plan; increasing the lowest plan payments in the country. For example, prior toM+C the lowest payment to a plan in 1997 was $221 and with the introduction of the floor, thatpayment was increased to $367 in 1998, a jump of 67%. In 1997, the gap from lowest to highestpayment was $546, declining to $416 with the introduction of the floor. Payments for the floor werereset in 2001, which further decreased variation. In 2004, plans in about 67% of counties (coveringabout 29% of enrollees) were paid based on the floor.

For 2005, the Secretary decided to rebase FFS. Rebasing FFS rates means that the Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) actuaries recalculate the per capita FFS expenditures foreach county (for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiaries FFS expenditures are calculated bystate) so that FFS rates reflect more recent growth in FFS expenditures. In 2005, payments in about21% of counties are based on the updated FFS rates.
