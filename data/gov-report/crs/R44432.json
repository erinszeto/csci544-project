As a result, companies have invested in new pipeline infrastructure to transport these resources from producing regions to domestic and foreign consuming markets. Siting, construction, operation, and maintenance of this infrastructure may raise environmental, health, and safety concerns, particularly when oil or gas moves by pipeline through heavily populated areas. Such concerns may prompt congressional interest in the relationship between federal and state authority over the siting and safety of pipeline infrastructure.", "Under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), siting of interstate natural gas pipelines and related facilities requires specific approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). When the pipeline company receives a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC, state or local laws that conflict with FERC's exercise of its jurisdiction under federal law or would pose an obstacle to construction of the pipeline (e.g., local zoning laws) are preempted unless FERC requires the company to comply with them as a condition of granting the certificate. The NGA specifically preserves state authority over pipeline projects under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), and Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). However, state authority under these laws remains subject to federal administrative and judicial oversight and review. Federal law also provides several avenues for a state to provide input into FERC's siting and environmental reviews of a proposed interstate natural gas pipeline.", "In contrast to siting review of proposed interstate natural gas pipelines, interstate crude oil pipelines undergo a state-by-state siting approval process. No federal law broadly preempts state and local siting requirements for these pipelines. Construction or operation of any oil or gas pipeline, whether interstate or intrastate, may require additional federal or state authorizations or consultations, depending on the proposed route of the pipeline and its potential to discharge pollutants or affect natural, cultural, or historical resources. States retain broad authority to regulate to control pollution, as well as to protect and conserve natural, cultural, and historical resources. States play a significantly reduced role, however, with respect to applications for pipeline rights-of-way over federal lands or permission to cross an international border, which implicate powers of the federal government over federal lands, foreign trade, and/or foreign affairs.", "Although pipelines represent a relatively safe form of transporting oil and gas as compared to other modes of transportation, the presence of new pipelines in populated areas, including gathering lines, has increased interest in federal and state oversight of pipeline safety. The Pipeline Safety and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) has broad authority to promulgate minimum federal safety standards for pipeline facilities and transportation. States may also become authorized to administer and enforce PHMSA's baseline safety standards for intrastate pipeline facilities and transportation; adopt and enforce stricter state standards for intrastate facilities compatible with DOT standards; and inspect interstate facilities for compliance with DOT regulations. Federal pipeline safety provisions specifically preempt state \"safety standards\" for interstate oil or gas pipelines. Generally, federal courts have held that federal pipeline safety laws do not preempt a state or local siting law that only incidentally affects safety.

A 2010 FERC order illustrates how the agency may evaluate whether natural gas pipelines are \"gathering lines\" exempt from its jurisdiction under the NGA. In Laser Marcellus Gathering Co. , FERC determined that it lacked jurisdiction over a pipeline and other facilities that would gather gas from fracked Marcellus Shale wells and transport it to an interstate pipeline for delivery to consumers, despite the possibility that the pipeline would operate at a high pressure and the fact that it would extend across two states.

In addition, Congress has not granted companies seeking to construct interstate oil pipelines a statutory right of eminent domain as it has provided to interstate natural gas pipeline certificate holders in the NGA. Therefore, companies that cannot successfully negotiate a ROW with a landowner must seek condemnation of needed property interests under the law of each state through which the pipeline would travel.

The act directs to DOT to promulgate minimum federal safety standards for transportation of gas and hazardous liquids (e.g., crude oil) by pipeline facilities to fulfill this purpose. The PSA also authorizes DOT to enforce these pipeline safety standards. For example, DOT may order an operator of a pipeline facility determined to be hazardous to life, property, or the environment to take corrective action, including repair of the facility or suspension of its operations. The Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration (PHMSA) of DOT has responsibility for administering and enforcing the PSA.", "Section 60105 of the PSA establishes a state pipeline safety program certification process by which states may become authorized to administer and enforce PHMSA's baseline safety standards for intra state pipeline facilities and pipeline transportation. This provision prohibits, with certain exceptions, PHMSA from prescribing or enforcing safety standards for an intrastate pipeline facility \"to the extent that the safety standards and practices are regulated by a State authority ... that submits to the Secretary annually a certification for the facilities and transportation....\" However, for a state's certification to be valid, the state must certify that it has adopted, by the date of certification, \"each applicable standard prescribed [by PHMSA under the PSA] or, if a standard under [49 U.S.C. Chapter 601] was prescribed not later than 120 days before certification, is taking steps to adopt that standard.\" In addition, even if a certification is in effect for a state, Section 60105(d) provides that such a certification does not apply to PHMSA safety standards promulgated after the date of the certification. Thus, Section 60105 would not prevent PHMSA from promulgating and enforcing new safety standards for an intrastate facility. Each state could then become authorized to administer and enforce the new federal standard by submitting a valid certification for that standard.", "If PHMSA has accepted a certification for a state, the agency may also enter into an agreement allowing the state to become an agent of DOT with respect to inspections of inter state pipelines for compliance with federal standards; however this does not authorize states to adopt or enforce safety standards for these pipelines.

Because Congress has included an express preemption clause in the PSA, it is not necessary to analyze whether type (3) would apply.

However, the court held a requirement pertaining to a security fence to be preempted. The court held that the PSA did not expressly preempt the setback requirement because it was designed to address aesthetic concerns and preserve property values and only incidentally (rather than directly and substantially) affected safety.
