In addition to the GSEs' guarantees, investors widely believe that MBSs are implicitly guaranteed by the federal government. In 2008, the GSEs' financial condition had weakened and there were concerns over their ability to meet their obligations on $1.2 trillion in bonds and $3.7 trillion in MBSs that they had guaranteed. In response to the financial risks, the federal government took control of these GSEs in a process known as conservatorship as a means to stabilize the mortgage credit market.", "Congressional interest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has increased in recent years, primarily because the federal government's continuing conservatorship of these GSEs. Uncertainty in the housing, mortgage, and financial markets has raised doubts about the future of the enterprises and the potential cost to the Treasury of guaranteeing the enterprises' debt. Since more than 60% of households are homeowners, a large number of citizens could be affected by the future of the GSEs. Congress exercises oversight over the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which is both regulator and conservator of the GSEs, and is considering legislation to shape the future of the GSEs.", "Estimates of the eventual total cost to the federal government of supporting the GSEs use different baselines and vary widely. In 2012, FHFA estimated that, by the end of 2015, Treasury is likely to have purchased between $191 billion and $209 billion of senior preferred stock, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the GSEs will pay Treasury dividends amounting to $30 billion between FY2013 and FY2017 and $44 billion between FY2013 and FY2022.", "Under terms of the federal government's support agreement as amended and effective on August 17, 2012, the enterprises will pay the Treasury all of their quarterly profits (if any). Under the previous agreements, the enterprises paid Treasury dividends of nearly $20 billion annually (10% of the support). Paying the federal government all profits earned in a quarter could prevent the GSEs from accumulating funds to redeem the senior preferred stock. However, it would appear that the GSEs could make quarterly redemptions.", "The financial condition of the GSEs continues to improve.

Primary lenders had to balance their lending practices with their deposits received, which led to severe credit shortages during economic downturns, when savings accounts were depleted by withdrawals. This shortage was exacerbated due to the concentration of major money centers in areas like Chicago and New York, far from many who needed home loans. There was no way to move funds from these areas where mortgage money was available to other areas, such as California, where it was in relatively short supply. In effect, this amounted to a geographic barrier that prevented the law of supply and demand from operating on a national level in the home loan market. The secondary mortgage market combined these many regional mortgage markets into a single national market that draws financing from around the world.", "To encourage improvement in housing standards and conditions and to provide a system of mutual mortgage insurance, Congress passed, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law, the National Housing Act in 1934. Title III of the National Housing Act established national mortgage associations, giving rise to the creation of Fannie Mae. In its original form, Fannie Mae was a federal government agency that was chartered to support government-backed mortgages and carry out some government subsidy functions. In 1954, Congress re-chartered Fannie Mae as a mixed government and private-sector entity, with a clearly delineated separation between its market-oriented (i.e., secondary mortgage trading) and governmental (i.e., special assistance and managing and liquidating government-held mortgages) functions. In 1968, Congress split the firm into two distinct organizations, with the secondary market arm retaining the Fannie Mae name and the government functions arm taking the name Ginnie Mae, short for the Government National Mortgage Association. The partitioning legislation re-chartered Fannie Mae as a GSE to become completely privately owned with no federal funding. Fannie Mae completed this transition in 1970.", "In 1970, Congress enacted the Emergency Home Finance Act, which authorized Fannie Mae to buy conventional mortgages. Fannie Mae bought most of the mortgages from mortgage bankers. Savings and loans, the other major source of mortgage money, were restricted to holding mortgages and were generally unable to work with Fannie Mae. To facilitate secondary market trading of conventional mortgages for savings and loan associations, the act created Freddie Mac as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS). In 1989, Congress re-chartered Freddie Mac so that its shares could trade on the New York Stock Exchange, in the same manner as Fannie Mae's. The 1989 act also did away with the separate missions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the result that today the two enterprises have similar characteristics.", "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages that lenders have already made to homeowners. These mortgages must meet Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's standards and not exceed the conforming loan limit. These mortgages are guaranteed by the purchasing GSE, pooled into MBSs, and either sold to investors or kept by the GSE as an investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's Current Status", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is the Current Financial Condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?", "paragraphs": ["In the second quarter of 2013, Fannie Mae reported record profits of $59 billion and Freddie Mac reported near record profits of $5 billion.

Prior to 2006, Fannie Mae had not reported a full-year loss since 1985, and Freddie Mac had never reported a full-year loss since it became stockholder owned.", "Two major sources of losses for mortgage lenders, including the GSEs, have been loans to borrowers with less than prime credit (subprime) and certain types of mortgages to borrowers with credit between prime and subprime (Alt-A). At the end of 2012, Fannie Mae held $15.1 billion in private-label MBSs backed by subprime mortgages and held $17.1 billion in private-label MBSs backed by Alt-A mortgages. Freddie Mac held $44.4 billion in private-label MBSs backed by subprime mortgages and $14.8 billion in private-label MBSs backed by Alt-A mortgages. The GSEs have, in addition, increased loan loss reserves in anticipation of continuing losses. If losses on foreclosed mortgages are less than predicted, the reserves could be reduced, which would improve the GSEs' financial condition. If losses are greater on foreclosed mortgages, the GSEs' financial condition would worsen.", "Starting in 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have tightened their lending standards. For example, the average FICO score of a 2007 mortgage purchased by Freddie Mac was 703, in 2008 it was 722, and in the first quarter of 2013 it was 753. Fannie Mae shows a similar increase in FICO scores. Approximately 76% of Fannie Mae's single-family book of business has been purchased in 2008 or more recently; the number for Freddie Mac is approximately 71%.", "Since the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), as conservator of the GSEs, has asked Treasury for a total of $116.1 billion to increase Fannie Mae's assets to offset its liabilities, and a total of $71.3 billion for Freddie Mac. Since the second quarter of 2012, neither GSE has required Treasury's support.", "Technically, Treasury support for the GSEs comes through purchases of GSE senior preferred stock.

This stock is senior to (has priority over) all other common and preferred stock; it is the only stock currently receiving dividends.", "In addition to Treasury's purchases of senior preferred stock, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has purchased GSE bonds and MBSs. In programs that started in September 2008 and ended in March 2010, the Fed and Treasury together purchased $1,135.9 billion in MBSs.

", "Under conservatorship, the GSEs have become active in loan modifications and the refinancing of existing mortgages that they own. They have raised the credit and documentation standards on the mortgages that they purchase, with stricter underwriting rules and higher fees. These actions are similar to other lenders' behavior during the recent recession and in previous economic slowdowns.", "In most areas of the country, FHA can guarantee mortgages of $271,050 or less as compared with Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's $417,000 loan limit.

The GSEs purchase home mortgages. They package most mortgages into MBSs, selling some and holding others in their investment portfolios. The GSEs finance their portfolios of long-term (typically 30-year) mortgages with short-term borrowing (typically three months to five years). This financing strategy increases the GSEs' profits because short-term borrowing is usually less expensive than longer-term loans. At the same time, it creates interest rate risk , which is the risk that, if short-term interest rates increase, profitability can be reduced or can even turn to losses. For example, if interest rates were to increase to 6%, mortgages at 5% would not be profitable. To try to reduce interest rate risk, the GSEs use a variety of financial derivatives. ", "The Federal Reserve has said that it will hold interest rates low \"at least through mid-2015\" and that it would attempt to \"maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, [and] support mortgage markets ... \" In the short run, this could aid the GSEs: they finance mortgages by borrowing for relatively short periods of time and will be able to borrow at lower interest rates. In the longer run, when interest rates increase, the GSEs' profitability may be challenged as they refinance their short-term borrowing at rates that could be greater than what they receive on their mortgages.", "In a worst-case scenario, the interest rate on short-term loans to the GSEs could increase enough to cause substantial losses, and investors could stop entering into derivative contracts with the GSEs. This would leave the GSEs, which anticipated being able to roll over their short-term debt, unable to refinance.", "The GSEs are also subject to credit risk . The GSEs guarantee timely payment of principal and interest of the mortgages in their MBSs. As mortgage foreclosure rates have climbed since 2006, and as home prices have fallen, the value of the mortgages and MBSs that the two firms hold in their portfolio has also fallen. Uncertainty about the duration and severity of the housing slump means that markets cannot now gauge the riskiness of the GSEs with much confidence or precision. The Treasury's support has reduced this risk, but it is not clear if the GSEs will ever return to stockholder control.", "Like all other businesses, the GSEs have operational risk due to the failure of internal controls. FHFA has directed the GSEs to reduce operational risk by improving their information technology, data quality, and internal controls.", "As financial corporations, the GSEs are also subject to model risk , or the risk that their models (especially credit models) are not accurate.

Providing a deadline could provide the regulated entity with an incentive to take risky gambles in a last attempt to avoid being seized by the government. The FDIC usually seizes a bank by suddenly showing up on a Friday afternoon, closing the bank, and locking the doors. This gives the FDIC time to make necessary changes over the weekend and resume business operations on the next business day.", "According to media reports at the time, some large foreign investors had been reducing their holdings of GSE debt, MBSs, and stock. This would have made it more difficult for the GSEs to borrow money to finance their portfolios going forward. For example, Bank of China Ltd. is reported to have sold or not replaced $4.6 billion of maturing GSE debt, which reduced its GSE debt holdings to $17.3 billion as of June 30, 2008.

In other words, according to OFHEO, the GSEs had sufficient funds to survive their financial difficulties. Because details of the GSEs' portfolios and guarantees include confidential and proprietary information, it is difficult to reconcile the two different assessments of the GSEs' financial position. In broad terms, the GSEs purchased slightly more than $169 billion of private label subprime MBSs in 2006 and 2007; they purchased slightly less than $58 billion of Alt-A MBSs in the same time period, out of combined total mortgage purchases of $1.677 trillion.

This lack of diversification makes them more exposed to housing and mortgage market problems than other financial institutions such as commercial banks, which have other lines of business. The GSEs' charters give them a special relationship with the federal government, sometimes called an implicit guarantee, which has allowed them to borrow at interest rates only slightly above those paid by the federal government. In conservatorship, the GSEs have an even closer connection with the government.", "The two GSEs were and are very highly leveraged versions of banks: they borrow money to purchase mortgages, and they maximize profits by keeping their capital reserves close to the minimum required by their regulators. Like banks, the GSEs are required by law and by their regulators to maintain a certain ratio between their loans and reserves to protect against loan losses. A key component of reserves is shareholders' equity or the current value of the shareholders' investments. Using funds for capital provides safety, but it is less profitable in normal times than purchasing additional mortgages.", "Changes in the perception of the risks that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced\u2014in terms of future profitability and even continued financial viability\u2014reduced the price that investors were willing to pay for a share of the enterprises.

As part of Treasury's financial aid package of September 7, 2008, the GSEs agreed to issue warrants to the Treasury worth 79.9% of their outstanding stock. If Treasury were to exercise the warrants, current stockholders would own 20% of each enterprise instead of 100%.

This means that if either of the two GSEs became unable to raise funds in private markets, the federal government could purchase the debt securities that the firms were unable to sell elsewhere, or could recapitalize either firm by purchasing stock, possibly becoming the majority shareholder.
