In addition, $7 million was rescinded from unobligated\"Coastal Impact Assistance\" funds.

Of that sum, $2.35 billion would befor ORF; $903.4 million would be for PAC; and $93.8 million for NOAA's Other Accounts. Overall funding levelswere slightly greater than those proposed in S. 2778 , because of proposed increases for NOS and NMFS; however, there would be a decrease for NOAA'sOther Accounts.

Further, as in S. 2778 , the Sea Grantprogram was funded within NOAA(OAR) at $63 million, rather than in NSF. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 2 (amended) by unanimous consenton January 13, 2003. Overall spendinglevels for NOAA did not change from Committee-recommended levels, except funding for Other Accountsincreased by $0.7 million.

Additional spending authority of $75 million wouldbe derived from transfers and deobligations. NOS, NWS, and NESDIS received funding levels greater than any approved previously; however, NMFS, OARand Program Support received decreases. Funding for PAC was reduced, but funding for Other Accounts increased, owing to an additional $40 millionauthorized as a final payment for the 1999 PacificCoastal Salmon Treaty.

", "The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget request includes $496.8 million for NIST, 30% less than the FY2003 appropriation. The major portion of thisdecreased funding is due to significant cuts in support for the Advanced Technology Program and the ManufacturingExtension Partnership, two extramuralprograms operated by NIST. The $27 million requested for ATP is to cover on-going commitments; no new projectswould be funded. The $12.6 million forMEP is to finance the operation of centers that have not reached 6 years of federal support.

For FY2004, the Bush Administrationhas proposed that NTIA receive $21.4 million, down from $73.7 million appropriated for FY2003. Much of thischange would come from the BushAdministration's intent to eliminate funding in FY2004 for TOP, and to suspend the PTFPC program by giving it$3 million to finish ongoing projects. Whilecritics of the TOP grants contend that the program has achieved its objectives of funding pilot programs in areasthat do not have easy or direct access to theInternet or high-speed telecommunications, supporters maintain that the program is very important to closing the\"digital divide.\" For PTFPC, the BushAdministration would like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to pick up responsibility of this program, whichin recent years has supported conversion ofpublic broadcast transmission to digital.

The Judiciary explained that under theCriminal Justice Act, as revised in 1986, theJudicial Conference is authorized to make annual adjustments to the panel attorney hourly pay rate. Accordingly,funding to increase the hourly rate to $113, theJudiciary said, would ensure that it would not be \"further eroded by inflation.\" ", "Conferees for the FY2003 omnibus bill explained (in H.Rept. 108-10 , p. 735) that their agreement included an increase, as requested by the Judiciary, of $30.1million to annualize the panel attorney rate increase provided in FY2002.
