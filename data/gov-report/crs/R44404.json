Understanding the risks an individual agency faces, and what strategies they have for confronting those risks given their size, complexity, and mission is vital to determining the appropriate level of future cybersecurity investments for that agency.

The Department of Commerce (DOC), acting through the National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST), develops the standards for federal information technology systems. The Department of Justice (DOJ) investigates and prosecutes crimes involving federal information technology. The Department of Defense (DOD) participates in the requirements for unclassified systems under FISMA, and chairs the Committee on National Security System (CNSS) which performs a similar function as DHS for national security systems.

About 85% of the U.S. population uses the Internet\u2014for communication, commerce, entertainment, financial transactions, and even the monitoring, control, and enabling of industrial activities. ", "When agencies invest federal resources in cybersecurity outside the .gov domain, they are generally fulfilling one of three responsibilities: ", "1. The first responsibility is to broadly improve national cybersecurity (e.g., information sharing programs or law enforcement activities). An example of this is the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) at DHS, or the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) hosted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Both of these organizations share information on cyber threats and how those threats can be mitigated. 2. Another is to encourage improved cybersecurity activities within a specific sector (e.g., sector-specific agency activities for critical infrastructure). An example of this is the grant programs the Department of Energy (DOE) provides to industry to research ways to bolster the cybersecurity of the electric grid. 3. Finally, agencies wield regulatory authority over certain sectors of the economy that encompasses their cybersecurity practices. Examples of this include the Department of the Treasury's establishment of regulations for record-keeping and the retention of records, and the Federal Trade Commission enforcing regulations by fining individual companies for violating consumer protections.

An authoritative top-line number for federal government spending on cybersecurity cannot be calculated, however, without an explicit definition of what such a total encompasses and consistent reporting of data from all federal agencies.

Each year, the budget includes documents outlining government's activities and the administration's policy priorities in the coming fiscal year.", "The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request included a three-page fact sheet on cybersecurity spending. This fact sheet stated that the Administration requested $19 billion \"to support a broad-based cybersecurity strategy.\" It went on to highlight roughly $5.8 billion in funding requested for seven agencies in a brief discussion of priority cybersecurity programs. The FY2016 budget request included a similar four-page fact sheet on cybersecurity spending, which stated that the Administration requested $14 billion \"to support the Administration's cybersecurity strategy.\" It went on to highlight roughly $12.4 billion in priority programs.", "While the methodology used in OMB's analysis in developing these totals is unknown, closer examination of the funding for each of the agencies highlighted showed inconsistencies in methodologies among the agencies' accounting (discussed further below) and significant lack of detail.

Those reviews revealed a lack of consistency in agency reporting on cybersecurity spending across the government in their budget justifications. This inconsistency makes agency-to-agency comparisons in cybersecurity investments difficult. ", "Some agencies, such as DOE, included cybersecurity as a crosscut analysis of their budget. This crosscut accounted for DOE's protection of their own, internal IT systems. They also included spending for their external mission, pointing out proposed spending on their agency mission to enhance electric grid cybersecurity. ", "Others, such as DHS, highlighted some activities within various agency components, but did not present an overall total of those components' investment in cybersecurity, either individually or as a group. DHS did highlight cybersecurity spending as a mission area for the department, but did not provide an associated funding total for the department. ", "How an agency builds its IT systems also affected how cybersecurity spending is accounted for in the agency budget justifications. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employs an enterprise architecture which does not distinguish (at least in publicly available documents) the security between managerial systems (such as financial systems and data) and mission-execution systems (such as those used to deliver benefits and services to veterans). Both types of systems are within their enterprise and are thus protected by the same investments in cybersecurity. ", "Other agencies make distinct investments for managerial systems and mission-execution systems. The Department of the Treasury distinguished, in their budget justification, between department-wide cybersecurity and the cybersecurity of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Under the FISMA guidance, and other industry-respected cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., the Cybersecurity Framework and the CIS Critical Security Controls), cybersecurity decisions must be made from an understanding of risk. However, quantifying the cybersecurity risk to the nation is difficult, partly due to the size of the nation, the complexity of systems, and the speed at which the threat, vulnerability, and consequence landscape evolves. ", "Furthermore, the total amount of federal cybersecurity spending does not properly inform the decisionmaking process. There is no single decision that drives the top-line number. Instead, there are hundreds of cybersecurity-related programs large and small across the government. The Administration requested $6.7 billion in cybersecurity funding for DOD for FY2017\u2014roughly one-third of the $19 billion they attributed to their government cybersecurity strategy. The influence of the DOD investment on the total cybersecurity budget masks the significance of increases or decreases in the civilian cybersecurity budget if they are rolled into the same total, despite the fact that the DOD investment has limited impact on the cybersecurity of the rest of the federal information technology enterprise. Cybersecurity in the federal government enterprise\u2014even when defined in the narrowest of terms\u2014requires such a breadth of individual activities, as noted in the FISMA report, that the top-line number may be more of a curiosity rather than a useful data point in setting policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessing Federal Government Cybersecurity Investments", "paragraphs": ["For Congress to perform oversight of the federal government's investments in cybersecurity efforts as a whole, one could posit that four elements are necessary: an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy, a plan to execute that strategy, metrics that allow Congress to assess progress against the strategy's goals, and consistent reporting across agencies on how that strategy is being carried out.

The CNAP incorporates previous federal-only strategies, such as the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP), and national strategies, such as the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. However, given the breadth and complexity of the federal cybersecurity enterprise, an overarching strategy by necessity lacks a certain level of detail. Nevertheless, an articulate statement of the goals of the enterprise would improve opportunities for coordinated efforts among its parts.", "Plans to meet the goals of the strategy are discussed below, as they should conform to the responsibilities and capabilities of each agency.

Some agencies highlight their cybersecurity investments by presenting a crosscutting budget item that aggregates information from across the agency appropriations. Others may highlight one or two programs that represent priority initiatives for those agencies, note cybersecurity-related increases on top of ongoing programs (which may or may not be wholly dedicated to cybersecurity) or simply not highlight them at all.

Two or more agencies with similar risk profiles may seek common, shared platforms for their computing and security needs. Such joint efforts may achieve cost efficiencies while meeting those security needs.
