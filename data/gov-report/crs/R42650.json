Moreover, more than a few jurisdictions have either yet to express themselves on the issue or have not done so for several decades. A majority of the jurisdictions on record have rejected the proposition that secret recording of a conversation is per se unethical even when not illegal. A number endorse a contrary view, however, and an even greater number have yet to announce their position.

They also censure attorney conduct that involves \"dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" In 1974, the ABA concluded in Formal Opinion 337 that the rule covering dishonesty, fraud, and the like \"clearly encompasses the making of recordings without the consent of all parties.\" Thus, \"no lawyer should record any conversation whether by tapes or other electronic device, without the consent or prior knowledge of all parties to the conversation.\" The Opinion admitted the possibility that law enforcement officials operating within \"strictly statutory limitations\" might qualify for an exception.", "Reaction to the Opinion 337 was mixed. The view expressed by the Texas Professional Ethics Committee was typical of the states that follow the ABA approach:", "In February 1978, this Committee addressed the issue of whether an attorney in the course of his or her practice of law, could electronically record a telephone conversation without first informing all of the parties involved. The Committee concluded that, although the recording of a telephone conversation by a party thereto did not per se violate the law, attorneys were held to a higher standard. The Committee reasoned that the secret recording of conversations offended most persons' concept of honor and fair play. Therefore, attorneys should not electronically record a conversation without first informing that party that the conversation was being recorded.", "The only exceptions considered at that time were \"extraordinary circumstances with which the state attorney general or local government or law enforcement attorneys or officers acting\u00a0under the direction of a state attorney general or such principal prosecuting attorneys might ethically make and use secret recordings if acting within strict statutory limitations conforming to constitutional requirements,\" which exceptions were to be considered on a case by case basis.", "...

This determination is highly fact intensive and numerous factors are involved, including the prior relationship of the parties, statements made during the conversation, whether threatening or harassing prior calls have been made and the intended purpose of the recording. In this latter connection, it should be noted that section 968.31(2)(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes implicitly prohibits secret recordings 'for the purposes of committing any criminal or tortious act ...or for the purpose of committing any other injurious act.' The secret recording of telephone conversations also may violate the Attorney's Oath, which requires lawyers to 'abstain from all offensive personality.' SCR 20:8.4(g) and 40.15; Disc.Proc. Against Beaver, 181 Wis. 2d 12, 510 N.W.2d 129 (1994).", "\"Different standards apply when the other party involved is a client. The fiduciary duties owed by a lawyer to a client and the duty of communication under SCR 20:1.4 dictate that statements made by clients over the telephone not be recorded without advising the client and receiving consent to the recording after consultation. Similarly, the secret recording of telephone conversations with judges and their staffs is generally impermissible. Courts are responsible for determining when and how a record should be made of activities in the court. Moreover, the Attorney's Oath requires lawyers to 'maintain the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers.' SCR 20:8.4(g).", "\"Even in circumstances in which secret recording of telephone calls is permissible, lawyers should be very cautious in deciding whether to do so. In some circumstances, a recording of a telephone conversation may constitute material having potential evidentiary value that the attorney has an obligation to turn over to a prosecutor or opponent in litigation under SCR 20:3.4. In addition, the secret recording of telephone calls is offensive to many persons and may harm the attorney's reputation when such conduct is discovered....", "\"Routinely recording of all calls would almost certainly violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
