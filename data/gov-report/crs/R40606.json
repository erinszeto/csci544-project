Discussions continue, although negotiations at this time seem to be at an impasse.", "One of the negotiating objectives in the DDA called for \"clarifying and improving disciplines\" under the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement or ADA) and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies Agreement or ASCM). The frequent use of trade remedies by the United States and other developed nations\u2014and increasingly, developing countries\u2014has come under criticism by some WTO members as being protectionist. In a March 2010 report, the chairman of the rules negotiations mentioned that consensus had been reached on many technical issues, but that there was no agreement on the larger \"political\" issues.", "Some in Congress cite U.S. use of trade remedies as necessary to protect U.S. firms and workers from unfair competition. Some also credit the existence of trade remedies with helping to increase public support for additional trade liberalization measures. These groups would like increased trade enforcement of trade remedies and intellectual property laws. Others in Congress, especially those who represent U.S. importers, manufacturers, and export-oriented businesses, tend to support liberalizing the ADA and ASCM, in ways that could make use of U.S. trade remedy laws less frequent and relief harder to obtain. For example, there is support in Congress for legislation that would require administering authorities to determine whether or not a trade remedy action is in the overall public interest before such a measure can be imposed.", "DDA negotiations involve Congress because any trade agreement made by the United States must be implemented by legislation, thus Congress also has an important oversight role in trade negotiations. For example, preserving \"the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws\" was included as a principal negotiating objective in legislation granting presidential Trade Promotion Authority\u2014the Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210).", "In the WTO talks, the positions of major players in trade remedy talks are well-documented by position papers written by WTO members that are circulated through the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules. Major themes that have emerged include limiting the use of trade remedy actions in favor of \"price undertakings,\" reducing the level of duties assessed per action by ending mandatory offsets (also known as \"zeroing\"), or limiting the duration of trade remedy measures through mandatory \"sunset\" reviews. Some members also support placing more restrictions on the ability of officials to grant relief to domestic industries through the use of economic interest tests and other administrative procedures and \"special and differential treatment\" for developing countries. Some countries see revision of the ADA and ASCM and other WTO disciplines on trade remedies as a \"make or break\" issue if the Doha Development Agenda is to succeed.", "This report examines trade remedy issues in DDA in three parts. The first part provides background information and contextual analysis. The second section focuses on how these issues fit into the DDA.

One of the negotiating objectives in the DDA called for \"clarifying and improving disciplines\" on trade remedies addressed in the WTO Antidumping Agreement, known formally as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (hereinafter known as the Antidumping Agreement or ADA) and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (hereinafter the Subsidies Agreement or ASCM). ", "DDA talks are being conducted as a \"single undertaking,\" meaning that nothing will be agreed on unless a consensus is reached in all areas of the discussions. As of this writing, talks in agriculture and on non-agricultural market access are at an impasse. Regarding discussions on trade remedies, during the December 2005 WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong, a \"high level of constructive engagement\" in trade remedy negotiations was reported, and negotiators were directed to \"intensify and accelerate\" their work. Since that time, discussions in the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules have continued based on two draft texts of the ADA and ASCM (in November 2007 and December 2008, respectively) prepared by the group's chairman \"with the objective of stimulating serious reflection by Participants on the broad parameters of possible outcomes to the negotiations.\" In March 2010, significant progress was reported in the rules negotiations, but it was also acknowledged that no consensus was likely to be reached on the \"big political issues\" until the overall direction of the DDA became clearer.", "Trade remedies are laws implemented by the United States and many of its trading partners to attempt to mitigate the adverse impact of various trade practices on domestic industries and workers. Antidumping (AD) laws, for example, provide relief to domestic industries that have been shown to have suffered material injury or are threatened with material injury as a result of competing imports being sold at prices shown to be less than their fair market value. Countervailing duty laws provide a similar form of relief to domestic industries that have been (or may be) injured by foreign subsidies on competing exports.", "Historically, multilateral negotiations on trade remedies, particularly on antidumping issues, have been extremely contentious; some analysts claim that a failure to reach consensus on what became the ADA and ASCM was largely responsible for delaying the completion of the Uruguay Round negotiations by as long as two years. In the DDA, a coalition of developed and developing nations known as the \"Friends of Antidumping\" are pushing for reforms in antidumping and other trade remedies that many in Congress oppose and U.S. negotiators are resisting. Many WTO members regard trade remedy reform as a \"make or break\" issue in terms of their acceptance of any final DDA agreement.", "This report analyzes the issue in three parts. First, background information and contextual analysis are presented. This section briefly discusses U.S. trade remedy laws and how they are implemented, and the scope of the trade remedy debate in the United States. This section also provides statistics on U.S. and worldwide use of antidumping and countervailing duty measures. ", "Second, the report focuses on the WTO discussions on trade remedies and their part in the overall negotiations within the DDA. The general mandate to negotiate is described, and negotiating activity to date summarized. Some of the major reforms suggested are described in general terms.", "Third, the report presents a more specific overview of major reform proposals; for example, those that seek to end \"zeroing,\" to mandatorily shorten the length that trade remedy duties can be assessed, or to provide special treatment for developing country WTO members. Some of these proposals, if implemented, could significantly reduce the number of permissible investigations conducted by the United States or lower the amount of duty margins assessed, thus potentially reducing the protective impact of the remedies. Other proposals might benefit U.S. companies because they could provide more transparency in the AD and CVD investigations on U.S. products being conducted by other WTO members. ", "The third section also mentions negotiations in two areas not previously discussed in the context of the WTO. First, limitation on the use of subsidies in the fisheries industry are being discussed in the context of the ASCM; and second, a mechanism for WTO monitoring of regional trade agreements (which technically violate WTO non-discrimination principles but are permitted under certain conditions) is also being negotiated.

The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the dumped imports.", "Countervailing duty (CVD, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671 et seq .) laws are designed to give a similar kind of relief to domestic industries that have been, or are threatened with, the adverse impact of imported goods that have been subsidized by a foreign government or public entity, and can therefore be sold at lower prices than similar goods produced in the United States. The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the subsidized imports.", "Safeguard (also referred to as escape clause) laws, though not being addressed in the DDA negotiations, are other important trade remedy measures that are designed to give domestic industries relief from import surges of goods that are fairly traded. In the WTO, the Agreement on Safeguards (Safeguard Agreement or ASG) provides disciplines for international use of safeguards. In the United States, the most frequently applied safeguard law is Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251-2254). \"Section 201\" safeguards are designed to give domestic industries the opportunity to adjust to the new competition and remain competitive. The relief provided is generally an additional temporary import duty, a temporary import quota, or a combination of both. As with all safeguard laws, \"section 201\" safeguard measures require presidential action in order for relief to be put into effect. ", "Three region-specific U.S. safeguard laws are (1) Section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2436), which provides a remedy against market disruption caused by imports from Communist countries; (2) Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2451) a China-specific safeguard; and (3) Section 302 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act provides safeguard relief due to surges of imports originating in Canada or Mexico (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3352).

", "These petitions are analyzed for accuracy and completeness, and, if initiated by the relevant agencies, trigger an exhaustive and detailed investigative process. These investigations are carried out by two agencies: the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce, which investigates allegations of sales at less than fair value (in antidumping cases) or existence of subsidies (in countervailing duty cases); and the International Trade Commission (ITC), an independent U.S. Government agency, which investigates injury allegations. These agencies conduct both preliminary and final investigations within specified time lines.", "If affirmative final determinations are made by both agencies, an AD (or CV) duty order imposes an additional duty on the targeted merchandise equivalent to the \"dumping margin\" or amount of subsidy. This duty\u2014assessed over and above any applicable tariffs\u2014is intended to offset the effects of dumping or subsidies, in order to create a \"level playing field\" for the domestic producer.", "U.S. law also allows the ITA to suspend an investigation (called a \"suspension agreement\") at any point in favor of an alternative agreement to (1) eliminate completely sales at less than fair value or to cease exports of the subject merchandise; (2) eliminate the injurious effect of the subject merchandise; or (3) limit the volume of imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, provided the foreign exporters agree to certain specific conditions.

During the review process, the ITA recalculates the dumping margin for each exporter, thus the AD duties assessed on the subject merchandise may be raised or lowered depending on the price of sales transactions during the period of review (POR). In a changed circumstances review, the ITA or the ITC \"as the case may be\" conduct a review of the AD or CVD determination or suspension agreement. In a changed circumstances review involving the ITC, the agency reviews whether revoking the order or suspension agreement is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury, and, in the case of a suspension agreement, whether it continues to eliminate completely the injurious effects of the imports of subject merchandise.", "Five-year or \"sunset\" reviews must be conducted on each AD and CVD order no later than once every five years. The ITA determines whether dumping would be likely to continue or resume if an order were to be revoked or a suspension agreement terminated, and the ITC conducts a similar review to determine whether injury to the domestic industry would likely continue or resume.

Thus, the antidumping laws also tend to be the focal point of debates on trade remedies in Congress, the WTO, and the international business community. U.S. stakeholders in favor of preserving and strengthening AD laws include many import-competing industries vulnerable to the effects of increased trade liberalization. The steel and chemical industries are historically the largest U.S. users of trade remedies, but smaller industries (such as honey, candles, shrimp, and crawfish) have also initiated successful petitions. Some in Congress have also expressed a compelling interest in ensuring that the firms and workers they represent are able to compete on a \"level playing field\" in the face of increased global competition from firms that they believe to use unfair trade practices to gain greater U.S. market share. These Members believe that the trade remedy laws\u2014especially AD actions\u2014are essential tools to that end.", "However, many U.S. stakeholders, especially domestic retailers and importers of intermediate goods used in the manufacturing process, favor eliminating or scaling back these actions. Some consuming industry groups have called for equal status as \"interested parties\" with allegedly injured petitioners, and/or for a \"public interest test\" to be added to the AD investigative process to determine whether or not the imposition of an AD duty is in the overall economic interest of the United States. Some U.S. exporters have also expressed support for relaxing trade remedy laws because they face the effects of similar actions in other countries\u2014which they perceive to be in retaliation for U.S. measures. Exporters may also bear the immediate effects of any trade retaliation if any U.S. laws are determined not to conform to WTO disciplines. In an era where the supply chain for goods is increasingly globalized, many manufacturers also favor trade remedy reform because they would have greater freedom to ship products at various stages of development across national boundaries for further transformation.

These determinations were challenged in court and were eventually upheld on appeal.", "In October 2007, the ITA reversed its ruling that subsidies could not be quantified in NME countries\u2014only with respect to China\u2014in the context of a final affirmative determination of subsidies on Chinese coated free sheet paper. Countervailing duties were not ultimately imposed in this specific case because the ITC made a negative final determination of injury. However, in July 2008, CVD duties were imposed on China in a case involving Circular Welded Carbon-Quality Steel Line Pipe from China. These were the first countervailing duties assessed on imports from China for the first time since 1983.

Detailed methodology is set out for initiating anti-dumping cases, conducting investigations, and ensuring that all interested parties are given an opportunity to present evidence. Specific criteria are set for investigations, including a requirement that investigations must be dropped if authorities determine that the volume of the dumped imports is negligible (less than 3% of imports of the product from any one country, or less than 7% for investigations involving several countries). Antidumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless an investigation shows that ending the measure would continue to result in injury.

These subsidies are prohibited because they can be designed to distort international trade, and may hurt the trade of other countries. They may be challenged in WTO dispute settlement proceedings under an accelerated timetable. Countervailing duties may also be imposed in the receiving market (ASCM Part II, Article 3). actionable subsidies : subsidies that could cause adverse effects to the interest of other WTO members. In this category, the complaining country has to show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its interests. Three types of damage are defined: (1) injury to the domestic industry of another Member; (2) nullification or impairment of benefits (e.g., favorable tariff benefits); or (3) serious prejudice to the interests of another WTO member. These subsidies may be challenged in dispute settlement proceedings, but the complaining country must prove that subsidy has an adverse effect. If the Dispute Settlement Body rules in favor of the complaining country, the subsidy must be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Countervailing duties may also be imposed in the receiving market (ASCM Part III, Article 5). non-actionable subsidies : This category was provided for five years (until December 31, 1999) and was not extended. These subsidies related mainly to research and development or providing economic development to disadvantaged regions of an exporting country (ASCM Part IV, Article 8).", "In order to be covered by the SCM Agreement, subsidies need to be specific to an industry, except that prohibited subsidies (i.e., export subsidies and import substitution subsidies) are considered per se specific. The ASCM also provides transitional rules for developed countries and members in transition to a market economy, as well as special and differential treatment rules for developing countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "International Trade Remedy Activity", "paragraphs": ["Many WTO members have long been concerned about an apparent escalation in the use of trade remedies worldwide, especially since the implementation of the ADA and ASCM in 1995. Some have expressed concern especially about the rapid increase of trade remedy actions by \"nontraditional\" users (developing countries who may or may not have experience implementing these measures in a transparent manner) such as India. In addition, some countries who are frequent targets of trade remedy actions (many of whom are \"nontraditional users\") by \"traditional\" users (the United States, the European Union, and Australia, for example) claim that their industries are adversely affected by the use of trade remedy actions against them. These are some of the reasons that led to the pressure for including WTO disciplines in trade remedies in DDA negotiations.", "Supporters of trade remedy action acknowledge that the incidence of AD activity has increased rapidly, but also point to a marked increase in the volume of international trade as a whole, suggesting that, as overall trade increases, the frequency of claims of unfair trading practices, such as dumping, will also have a natural tendency to increase. In addition, many supporters believe that the existence of trade remedy laws helps to build support for increased trade liberalization because industries and workers that could be adversely affected by competing imports know that there is a \"safety valve\" that they can use to protect them from unfair trading practices or import surges.", "WTO statistics on worldwide trade remedy activity may help illustrate the scope and magnitude of the issue. According to antidumping statistics for 1995 through 2008 (see Figure 1 ), the total number of yearly trade remedy measures rose sharply from 1996 to 2000, decreased in 2001, and peaked again in 2002 and 2003. Worldwide trade remedy activity declined in 2004 and 2005, increased slightly in 2006, and declined once more in 2007. In 2008, AD activity, in particular, appeared to be on the rise, with 208 initiations, as opposed to 163 in 2007. A May 2010 World Bank report on trade protectionism indicates that trade remedy initiations decreased by 20% in the first quarter of 2010 relative to the same period in 2009.", "Fluctuations in trade remedy activity in recent years could mean several things. First, some have mentioned that declines in activity during 2004-05 could have been due to active discussions on trade remedies in the Doha Development Agenda. Second, as some observers have mentioned, the process of globalization\u2014especially foreign ownership of factories and industries\u2014is causing industries to become more globally integrated. One notable example of this is the 2005 purchase of Ohio-based International Steel Group (ISG) by the multinational firm Mittal Steel. Moves toward global integration could reduce trade remedy petitions in the future because the domestic producers and the importers could increasingly become one and the same.", "A third factor that may have influenced a decline in trade remedy action is that there seem to be fewer trade remedy measures initiated in times of economic prosperity. This may also explain the increase in antidumping investigations reported by the WTO in 2008, since in the latter part of 2007 the world began to experience an economic downturn.", "Trade remedy usage by \"nontraditional\" users (i.e., developing countries) has escalated at a rapid pace in recent years, as Figure 2 (below) illustrates. Prior to the mid 1990s, the club of \"traditional\" users of these measures was quite small and consisted primarily of developed countries like Australia, South Africa, the United States, Japan, France, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Since the mid-1990s, trade remedy investigations by developing countries, such as India, Argentina, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia, have rapidly escalated. Many of these countries did not have trade remedy laws until the 1990s\u2014or if they did have them on the books, did not exercise them. For example, India's first trade remedy action was not until 1992, against imports of PVC resin from Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and the United States. It was also a group primarily composed of developing country users\u2014known as the \"Friends of Antidumping\"\u2014that forced U.S. negotiators to accept negotiations on trade remedies as one of the primary objectives in the DDA. Some trade analysts assert that developing countries resorted to using AD and CVD measures because they had frequently become the targets of such action by the \"traditional\" users of these actions. ", "The application of AD actions initiated (see Figure 2 ) by developing countries as opposed to developed countries diverged sharply during the global financial crisis. From the beginning of the crisis (about the 1 st quarter of 2008) to the present, developing countries have initiated about 69% of all investigations, while developed country initiations were on a steady decline until the first quarter of 2009. Data collected over the period also indicates an increasing use of trade remedy measures in \"South-South\" (developing country importers initiating actions against developing countries) trade, with exports from China being a major target. In the 4th quarter of 2009, AD initiations by both developed and developing countries decreased, and in the first quarter of 2010, developed country initiations increased slightly, while developing country initiations continued to fall.", " Figure 3 shows worldwide trade remedy initiations from 1995 to 2008. Worldwide real GDP growth (2000 base) is illustrated for the same time period. Trade remedy initiations reached a peak in 1999 (412 initiations), following a 1998 drop in worldwide GDP growth (2.32% in 1998, down from 3.7% in 1997). As GDP growth increased in 2000, trade remedy initiations decreased. In 2001, trade remedy initiations reached another peak, which coincided with a sharp decrease in worldwide GDP growth (1.5%, down from 4.11% in 2000). This figure illustrates that increases in global trade remedy activity seem to roughly coincide with decreases in worldwide GDP growth.", " Figure 4 illustrates the leading initiators (importing countries bringing trade remedy cases) of trade remedy initiations from 1995 to 2008. India leads this group, with 564 AD initiations; followed by the United States (418AD, 94 CVD); the European Community (391 AD, 48 CVD); Argentina (241 AD); South Africa (206 AD, 13 CVD); Australia (170 AD, 9 CVD); Brazil (170 AD, 23 CVD); Canada (145 AD, 23 CVD), China (151 AD); Turkey (137 AD, 1 CVD); South Korea (108 AD); Mexico (94 AD, 2 CVD); Indonesia (73 AD); Egypt (65 AD); and Peru (64 AD, 4 CVD).", " Figure 5 depicts the leading targets (exporting countries) of worldwide antidumping and countervailing actions for the same time period. China is currently at the head of this list, with 677 AD initiations and 24 CVD initiations.

For example, steel pipe and wire are used in the construction industry, and steel sheet is used to manufacture automobiles. Base metals, such as steel and products manufactured from steel (e.g., steel pipe and wire) head the list of targeted products, followed by chemicals and items made of plastics and rubber. ", "Reasons that these products are dumped or subsidized more than others might include possible government support for these industries, or overcapacity in the home countries. In developing economies, for example, domestic steel industries are often supported by governments so that the industry can supply the large quantities of steel required for building infrastructure in the initial stages of development. As the industry expands, it reaches a level of overcapacity, and pushes some of the excess into exports (sometimes also with government support to expand the export market). Industries may also face market contractions, fail to gauge future capacity, have certain fixed costs that require manufacturing to continue, or have difficulty retooling factories to make items that may be in limited supply.
