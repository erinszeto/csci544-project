As originally framed, the1974 act required the adoption of two budget resolutions each year. The first budget resolution, tobe adopted in the spring, set advisory budget levels for the upcoming fiscal year. The second budgetresolution, to be adopted on September 15, just before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1,set binding budget levels for the year.

Action on any required reconciliation legislation was expected to be completed by September 25.", "In the early 1980s, the House and Senate abandoned the practice of adopting a second budgetresolution, choosing instead to adopt a single budget resolution in the spring of each year (althoughthe schedule often slipped, sometimes markedly). This change in practice formally was incorporatedinto the 1974 act by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Title II of P.L. 99-177 ; December 12, 1985; 99 Stat. 1037-1101).", "The growing prominence of the spring budget resolution was indicated by the decision in1980 to use it to initiate reconciliation procedures for FY1981.

These changes occurred for several reasons, including the belief that an advancement in thereconciliation schedule was needed to allow committees more time to develop their reconciliationrecommendations, and to allow the House and Senate more time to consider them on the floor andreconcile their differences in conference, and that an extended time frame would promote moreeffective and lasting changes in budgetary policy while discouraging evasions of enforcement.", "In addition to the changes made with respect to the timing and scheduling of reconciliation,the 1974 act has been amended to bar in the Senate the inclusion of extraneous matter inreconciliation legislation (see later discussion of Section 313 of the act, known as the \"Byrd rule\").

In the latter part of the 1990s, particularly when large surpluses emerged in the federal budget forthe first time in decades, the focus of reconciliation action was shifted to reducing revenues, whichcontinued into the 2000s.

Decisions at these levels remain theprerogative of the committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenue legislation. In a few rareinstances, however, reconciliation directives have been couched in programmatic terms. In theFY1981 budget resolution, for example, the Senate Appropriations Committee was instructed to\"limit appropriations for fiscal year 1981 subsidies to the U.S. Postal Service\" to a particular levelas part of the reconciliation directives. (14) In response to a parliamentary inquiry on May 19, 1982,however, the Senate Presiding Officer advised that reconciliation directives may not specify that theinstructed committee must achieve its changes from certain types of programs or in specificways. (15) ", "Nonetheless, the Budget Committees may indicate particular options or assumptions thatwould allow an instructed committee to meet its spending or revenue reconciliation directives, partlyto garner credibility and support for the budget resolution and partly to influence the subsequentpolicy debates.", "A reconciliation directive to a committee usually consists of several components: (1) anidentification of the House or Senate committee being instructed; (2) the type of budgetary changesthat are intended to be achieved by changes in laws, bills, and resolutions within the instructedcommittee's jurisdiction, together with specified amounts; (3) the fiscal year periods to which thechanges apply; and (4) a deadline by which the instructed committees must submit theirrecommendations to their respective Budget Committee, or, if singly instructed, report them to theirchamber. Each dollar amount of change for a fiscal year time period is regarded as a separatedirective. A committee instructed to achieve savings in direct spending outlays of $100 million forthe first fiscal year and $800 million for a five-fiscal year period, for example, is considered to besubject to two different directives.", "Given that the language authorizing reconciliation directives refers to \"changes,\" suchdirectives may properly recommend both increases and decreases in revenues, spending, and the debtlimit (see further discussion below).", "Types of Directives. Section 310(a) of the 1974act enumerates three different types of budgetary changes that reconciliation directives may require: (1) spending , in the form of new budget authority for the budget year and thereafter, budget authorityinitially provided for prior fiscal years, new entitlement authority, and credit authority; (2) revenues ;(3) and the statutory limit on the public debt . In addition, Section 310(a) provides that reconciliationdirectives may combine any of the three types of changes, including \"a direction to achieve deficitreduction\" (representing a combination of spending reductions and revenue increases).", "The type of budgetary changes included in the reconciliation directives determines the typeof legislation that will result. After the first several years of experience with reconciliation, spendingdirectives have applied almost exclusively to direct spending (also known as mandatory spending),rather than discretionary spending. Direct spending, which is under the jurisdiction of the legislativecommittees of the House and Senate, funds entitlements and other mandatory programs (e.g.,Medicare, unemployment compensation, federal employee retirement), largely on a permanent basis. Discretionary spending, which mainly funds the ongoing operations of federal agencies, falls underthe jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and is provided in annualappropriations acts.", "Under current practice, reconciliation directives for direct spending generally refer to changesin outlay levels. (16) While such directives usually specify the dollar amounts by which outlay levels are to be changed,for a time the House Budget Committee specified the total outlay level that should occur after therequired changes had been made. (Therefore, the amount of changes involved had to be calculatedby comparing baseline levels to the levels expected to occur following reconciliation.) In the courseof complying with a directive to change spending, a committee may recommend changes inoffsetting collections or offsetting receipts within its jurisdiction; offsetting collections, whichinclude many user fees, are treated as negative spending.", "Reconciliation directives have sometimes been used to affect discretionary spending levels,although this is not the usual practice. Initially, reconciliation was used to directly change the levelsof discretionary spending. The House Appropriations Committee (in the FY1981 budget resolution)and the Senate Appropriations Committee (in the FY1981 and FY1982 budget resolutions) wereinstructed to reduce spending for the fiscal year already in progress. In order to comply with theseinstructions, the committees recommended rescissions of annual appropriations that already had beenenacted. (The rescissions were considered separately from the reconciliation legislation for thoseyears.)", "A more expansive, and indirect, attempt to reduce discretionary spending through thereconciliation process occurred in 1981. The FY1982 budget resolution included reconciliationdirectives that, in part, required legislative committees to reduce authorizations of appropriations. The intent behind this approach was to set in place reduced authorization levels over a three-yearperiod that would reduce spending levels in the annual appropriations acts considered in each ofthose years. This approach was widely regarded as having unnecessarily complicated thereconciliation legislation and strained relationships between the authorizing committees and theAppropriations Committees. The House and Senate Budget Committees have not returned to thisapproach, except occasionally on a much more selective basis. In the Senate, such languageprobably would be judged extraneous under the Byrd rule, on the ground that it does not affectoutlays.", "Due to the dispersal of spending jurisdiction to almost every standing committee of theHouse and Senate, nearly every one of them has been involved in reconciliation at least once.", "Directives to change revenue levels have been less complicated generally in that they havenot differentiated between different sources of revenue, such as individual incomes taxes, corporateincome taxes, or excise taxes. On occasion, revenue reconciliation directives have beenaccompanied by directives to change outlays because some tax-related changes, such as increasesin refundable tax credits, are scored as outlays. (Conversely, in some instances changes in spendingprograms may affect revenue levels.)", "As mentioned previously, reconciliation directives may also instruct a committee to achievea level of \"deficit reduction,\" reflecting a combination of spending reductions and revenues increasesat the committee's discretion.", "In the reconciliation process, compliance with reconciliation directives is judged on a netbasis, or on the basis of the \"bottom line.\" Consequently, directives to reduce spending or increaserevenues in order to achieve deficit reduction generally may include \"sweeteners\" that increasespending and reduce revenues, so long as the required amount of deficit reduction is accomplished.", "As practiced by the House and Senate, a reconciliation instruction to reduce spending, orincrease revenues, includes a target that is a minimum amount of spending reduction, or revenueincrease (a floor). Similarly, a reconciliation instruction to increase spending, or reduce revenues,includes a target that is a maximum amount of spending increase, or revenue reduction (a ceiling).", "For years, the public debt limit has been codified in Section 3101(b) of Title 31, UnitedStates Code . Periodic adjustments in the debt limit take the form of amendments to 31 U.S.C.3101(b), usually by striking the current dollar limitation and inserting a new one. While mostadjustments to the debt limit have been increases, in some instances the debt limit has been reducedor extended at its current level for a specified interval. For example, P.L. 455 of the 79th Congress(60 Stat. 316; June 26, 1946) reduced the debt limit from $300 billion to $275 billion as budgetsurpluses reemerged following World War II. While the debt limit has been adjusted inreconciliation legislation, in most instances Congress employs another type of measure for thispurpose. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee exercisejurisdiction over the debt limit. (17) ", "From time to time, budget resolutions have included contingent reconciliation directives. Under a contingent directive, the amount of changes in spending or revenue that a committee isdirected to achieve may be adjusted at a later time upon the happening of a contingency. TheFY1998 budget resolution, for example, provided for an adjustment in the Senate FinanceCommittee's reconciliation directives (as well as the committee's spending allocations and otherbudget levels) to accommodate a five-year children's health initiative of up to $16 billion. Theadjustments were made contingent upon the committee reporting reconciliation legislation with anexcess of outlay savings so that the additional spending on the children's health initiative would bedeficit neutral.

Although this task may be described correctly asbeing ministerial, the Budget Committee still is faced with several issues at thispoint. First, the Budget Committee must endeavor to ensure that all responses frominstructed committees are complete and accurate. As indicated previously, theBudget Committee secures any CBO or JCT estimates that were not prepared in timefor inclusion with the committee submissions, or secures final estimates in place ofpreliminary ones.", "In order to ensure accuracy, the Budget Committee from time to time hasmade technical corrections in the submissions at the request of the instructedcommittees. In the case of reconciliation legislation in 1996 dealing with welfarereform, for example, both of the instructed committees asked the Budget Committeeto make corrections in their previous submissions.

It was the instructed committees, and not the Budget Committee, thathad the authority to make these changes.", "Dealing With Tardy Responses. A second issue faced by the Budget Committee is what to do if one or morecommittees does not submit its recommendations by the deadline. The initialpractice of the Senate was to extend the deadline when the Budget Committee feltthat such action was warranted. This practice was motivated by the view thatincluding tardy committee submissions could \"taint\" the reconciliation measure,thereby causing it to lose its privilege and the protection of expedited procedures. In1985, for example, the Senate extended the September 27 deadline set in the FY1986budget resolution to October 1 by unanimous consent in order to accommodate theBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. (60) In someinstances, the deadline was extended in a series of tightly constrained steps. In 1986,for example, the deadline of July 25 set in the FY1987 budget resolution wasextended to 6:00 p.m. on July 29, to 12:00 noon on July 30, and then to 3:30 p.m. onthat same day, July 30. (61) Finally, the deadline has been extended by largermargins; the July 28 deadline in the FY1988 budget resolution was extended toSeptember 29 and then to October 19. (62) ", "Under more recent practice, the Budget Committee may be afforded somediscretion in awaiting the responses of tardy committees in order to include them inthe omnibus reconciliation measure. While the budget resolution provides a deadlinefor the submissions by the instructed committees, it does not impose a reportingdeadline on the Budget Committee. Under Section 310(b)(2) of the 1974 act, theBudget Committee is obliged to report the omnibus reconciliation measure only\"upon receiving all such recommendations.\" Consequently, the Budget Committee'sobligation to report does not ripen until all recommendations have been received,even tardy ones. (63) ", "Nonetheless, the Budget Committee is expected to report the omnibusreconciliation measure in a reasonably prompt manner. Accordingly, when facedwith lingering delay in the responses by one or more instructed committees, it maychoose to report the omnibus reconciliation measure without the responses and seeka remedy for the omissions during floor consideration.", "Evaluating Compliance. A thirdtask facing the Budget Committee at this stage of the reconciliation process, andperhaps the most important one, is evaluating compliance by the respondingcommittees. Compliance may be judged by several criteria. First and foremost, theBudget Committee assesses whether each instructed committee has met the goals laidout in the reconciliation directives. In the case of each committee, the estimatedlevels of spending changes (and, if appropriate, revenue changes and debt-limitchanges) that would be achieved for each time period are measured against theinstructed levels.", "Although the Budget Committee and each instructed committee receives costestimates from CBO and the JCT, it is the Budget Committee's responsibility andprerogative to assess committee compliance on the basis of spending or revenuelevels. In measuring compliance, the Budget Committee sometimes will makeadjustments to the estimates provided by CBO or the JCT. One such adjustment,which occurred in 1995, involved a change in the enactment date assumed by CBO,which shortened the time available in FY1996 for the sale of the Naval PetroleumReserves. As a consequence of this change, CBO judged that the sale could not becompleted in FY1996 and reduced the savings attributed to the Armed ServicesCommittee accordingly. As explained by the Senate Budget Committee:", "The FY1996 budget resolutionassumed an October 1, 1995 enactment date and the reconciliation instructions tocommittees were based on this enactment date. Due to the delay of some of thecommittee's submissions and other factors, CBO is currently using a November 15,1995 enactment date. As a result, some committees followed the assumptions in thebudget resolution and still failed to meet their fiscal year 1996 reconciliationinstruction because of this change in the assumption on the enactment date.... However, if a committee follows the assumptions in the budget resolution and failsto meet its instructions for fiscal year 1996 solely because of an assumption on theenactment date, the Senate Budget Committee will hold the committee harmless andwill score the committee as achieving its instruction. Therefore, with thisadjustment, the Armed Services Committee has complied with the budget resolution'sreconciliation instructions for FY1996. (64)", "A second criterion for determining compliance involves the \"fungibility rule,\" which is set forth in Section 310(c) of the 1974 act. (65) Thepurpose of the rule is to allow some flexibility in the response of a committeeinstructed to change both spending and revenues. The fungibility rule may not applyif revenue and spending changes are reported in separate reconciliation measurespursuant to separate directives.", "In sum, the fungibility rule: (1) applies to any Senate (or House) committeethat is subject to reconciliation directives in a budget resolution requiring it torecommend reconciliation legislation changing both spending and revenues; (2)deems any such committee to be in compliance with its reconciliation directives ifits recommended legislation does not cause either the spending changes or therevenue changes to exceed or fall below the directives by more than 20% of the sumof the two types of changes, and the total amount of changes recommended is not lessthan the total amount of changes that were directed; and (3) authorizes the chairmanof the Senate Budget Committee to file appropriate adjustments in the levels in thebudget resolution, and committee spending allocations thereunder, upon the exerciseof the rule, and requires any committee receiving revised spending allocations topromptly report Section 302(b) suballocations.", "The operation of this rule in the Senate was described in 1993 in a print of theSenate Budget Committee, as follows:", "For an example of the rule inoperation, take the case of a budget resolution that instructs a committee to achieve$3 million in outlay reductions and $7 million in revenue increases, for a total of $10million in deficit reduction. By virtue of this section, that committee maypermissibly achieve outlay reductions as low as $1 million ($3 million minus 20percent of $10 million, or $2 million), as long as it achieves a total of at least $10million in deficit reduction by also achieving at least $9 million in revenue increases. Alternatively, the committee may achieve revenue increases as low as $5 million ($7million minus 20 percent of $10 million, or $2 million), as long as it achieves a totalof at least $10 million in deficit reduction by also achieving outlay reductions of atleast $5 million. (66)", "In its current form, the fungibility rule authorizes the chairman of the SenateBudget Committee to file changes in budget resolution levels, and committeespending allocations thereunder, whenever the rule is exercised, and to require thatany committee receiving revised spending allocations promptly report Section 302(b)suballocations. (67) ", "As Senate and House rules grant jurisdiction over revenue matters primarilyto the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee,respectively, these are the two main committees to which the fungibility rule applies.", "Finally, a third criterion for assessing committee compliance with thereconciliation directives is the Senate's \"Byrd rule,\" which is discussed in detailbelow. Briefly, the rule bars the inclusion of matter in reconciliation legislation thatis extraneous to the purposes of the reconciliation directives.", "The Parliamentarian also plays a role in assessing compliance withreconciliation directives, determining whether provisions from the instructedcommittees are within their respective jurisdictions. Further, the Parliamentariandetermines, as a threshold matter, whether the assembled submissions from theinstructed committees constitute a reconciliation bill and, thus, whether the bill maybe considered under the expedited procedures of the reconciliation process.", "While the Budget Committee must report the legislative recommendationssubmitted to it, the committee need not necessarily issue a written report. Beginningin the late 1980s, the practice of the Senate Budget Committee has been to reportomnibus reconciliation bills without a written report. The purpose of this practiceis to avoid both a Budget Committee rule providing for time to submit additional andminority views, and the Senate rule requiring legislation accompanied by a writtenreport to lay over for a period of time before floor consideration. The BudgetCommittee usually issues a committee print explaining the legislation in lieu of areport.", "The Budget Committee, because it must report an omnibus reconciliation bill\"without any substantive revision,\" may not resolve any substantive issues onnon-compliance at this point.

In all but three of these years, the Senate considereda single reconciliation measure in response to the reconciliation directives in thebudget resolution. In the three remaining years, the Senate considered two differentreconciliation measures each year, resulting in the enactment of five reconciliationacts -- one act in 1980 (for FY1981) and two acts each in 1982 and 1997 (for FY1983and FY1998).", "As a general matter, the Senate initially considers a single, Senate-numberedreconciliation measure, either an omnibus reconciliation act reported by the BudgetCommittee or a reconciliation act reported by the Finance Committee.

Although not explicitly stated in the 1974 act, reconciliationmeasures are privileged measures. Accordingly, the motion to proceed to theconsideration of a reconciliation measure is not debatable. In practice, mostreconciliation measures are laid before the Senate by unanimous consent.", "A reconciliation measure does not need to lie over on the calendar for onelegislative day, but if such legislation is accompanied by a written report, the reportmust be available for 48 hours before the measure can be considered. As statedpreviously, the usual practice of the Budget Committee since the late 1980s has beento report omnibus reconciliation bills without a written report, issuing a committeeprint in lieu of a report. The Finance Committee has been instructed to reportlegislation directly to the Senate on several occasions in recent years, sometimesissuing a written report and sometimes not doing so.", "Reconciliation legislation is subject to a 20-hour debate limitation. Debateon first degree amendments is limited to two hours, and debate on second degreeamendments and debatable motions or appeals is limited to one hour. In practice,debate time may vary from these limits, pursuant to unanimous consent agreements.", "Control of time under the 20-hour limit is equally divided between, andcontrolled by, the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees.
