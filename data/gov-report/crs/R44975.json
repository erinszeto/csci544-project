The committee's use of the blue slip has been, since at least 1917, a feature of its consideration of U.S. circuit and district court nominations. After a President selects a nominee for a U.S. circuit or district court judgeship, the chairman sends a blue-colored form to the Senators representing the home state of the nominee. The form seeks the home state Senators' assessment of the nominee. If a home state Senator has no objection to a nominee, the blue slip is returned to the chairman with a positive response. If, however, a home state Senator objects to a nominee, the blue slip is either withheld or returned with a negative response.", "Since the use of blue slips is not codified or included in the committee's rules, the chairman of the committee has the discretion to determine the extent to which a home state Senator's negative, or withheld, blue slip stops a President's judicial nomination from receiving a committee hearing and a committee vote and, consequently, whether it reaches the Senate floor. Over the century of the use of the blue slip, different chairmen have used the blue slip in different ways. During some years, a chairman has required a nominee to receive two positive blue slips from his or her home state Senators. This particular blue slip policy, for example, was in place during the eight years of the Obama presidency and much of the George W. Bush presidency\u2014during periods of both unified and divided party control.", "During other years, a chairman's blue slip policy has allowed for a nomination to proceed in committee\u2014and, at times, to the Senate floor\u2014even if the nominee did not have the support of one or both home state Senators. Since at least 1956, however, regardless of the particular blue slip policy used by the committee to process judicial nominations, it has been relatively rare for the Senate to confirm a nominee not supported by his or her home state Senators.", "Historically, a committee's blue slip policy has applied to both U.S. circuit and district court nominations. Senators, however, have traditionally exerted less influence over the selection of circuit court nominees than over district court nominees. The lesser role for Senators, and the more independent role of the President, in the selection of circuit court nominees is well established by custom. While home state Senators have historically exerted less influence over the selection of circuit court nominees, they have nonetheless often retained certain prerogatives under the committee's blue slip policy once a circuit court nominee is selected by a President. For example, during the Obama presidency and much of the George W. Bush presidency, a circuit court nomination did not proceed in committee unless it had received two positive blue slips from a nominee's home state Senators.", "Future changes to the committee's blue slip policy, whether during the current presidency or a future one, might have several consequences\u2014some of which might be viewed as adverse, others which might be viewed as beneficial\u2014to the institutional role of the Senate, as well as to the judicial confirmation process itself."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The blue-slip process for U.S. circuit and district court nominations refers to a practice by the Senate Judiciary Committee (the committee) for use in the confirmation of federal judges and other positions.

A home state Senator, if he or she has no objection to a nominee, returns the blue slip with a positive response. If, however, a Senator has some objection to the nominee and wants to prevent confirmation, he or she might decide not to return the blue slip or return it with a negative response.", "Recently, there have been some years in which a negative (or unreturned) blue slip precluded Judiciary Committee action on a nomination and, consequently, the nomination was not considered by the full Senate. This policy, for example, characterizes how blue slips were used during the entirety of the Obama presidency and much of the George W. Bush presidency\u2014during years of unified party control, as well as during years of divided party control.", "There have also been recent years, however, during which the committee's blue slip policy prevented, at times, a single Senator from having an absolute veto over the fate of judicial nominees from his or her state. These modifications generally prevented a President's nominees from being routinely blocked by Senators not belonging to the President's party. It has nonetheless been relatively rare, at least since 1981, for the full Senate to confirm judicial nominees who did not have the support of both of their home state Senators.", "The blue slip process is not codified in the Judiciary Committee's rules, and is instead a policy set by the chairman of the committee.

", "Additionally, because data regarding whether home state Senators returned negative or positive blue slips (or withheld a blue slip) is not often made public, the information and analysis provided in this report is limited to that information which is publicly available regarding blue slips returned or withheld by Senators. Based on available information, a President's nominees who receive at least one negative blue slip have been a relatively small percentage of those he nominates to the federal bench.", "Recently, during the 115 th Congress, several Senators have commented on whether or how the blue slip policy should be changed from the most recent policy that was in place during the 114 th Congress and other recent congresses. Some of the issues discussed by Senators include whether the Judiciary Committee should move forward on a judicial nomination if it receives at least one negative blue slip from a nominee's home state Senator; what constitutes adequate consultation between the President and home state Senators during the pre-nomination phase of selecting a judicial nominee; and whether U.S. circuit court nominations should be subject to blue slips in the same manner as district court nominations.", "The purpose of this report is to provide historical information and analysis as to how blue slips have been used in the past for judicial nominations, with a focus on the various blue slip policies used during recent presidencies. This report also discusses potential changes that might occur in the Senate and in the confirmation process for judicial nominees if there is a lesser role for home state Senators in approving some, or all, of a President's judicial nominees from their respective states.

", "The first known appearance of the blue slip is from the 65 th Congress (1917-18). At the time, Senator Culberson was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a role he served in from the 63 rd through the 66 th Congress (i.e., from 1913 through 1919). The documentary evidence from this time period suggests that Senator Culberson may have created the blue slip. From the 65 th Congress onward nearly every judicial nominee's file includes a blue slip. Prior to this period, the files of judicial nominees reveal no evidence of blue slips.", "Judiciary Committee materials at the National Archives do not provide a specific explanation for the creation of the blue slip. The historical and political context, however, in which the blue slip was first used might help illuminate the rationale for its early use. For instance, although the White House and Senate were both controlled by the Democrats in 1917, there was nonetheless periodic tension between the two branches. Consequently, inter-branch relations may have been a factor in the blue slip's creation.", "The first known example of a Senator using a blue slip to oppose a judicial nomination was in 1917 during the 65 th Congress. President Woodrow Wilson had nominated U.V. Whipple to a judgeship for the Southern District of Georgia. Senator Thomas W. Hardwick returned a negative blue slip, stating \"I object to this appointment\u2014the same is personally offensive and objectionable to me, and I cannot consent to the confirmation of the nominee.\" At that time, a negative blue slip did not necessarily prevent committee action on a nomination. As such, Whipple's nomination was reported, albeit adversely, to the full Senate. The nomination was rejected by the Senate without a recorded vote on April 23, 1917.", "From 1917 to 1955 the blue slip was used \"to merely request the opinion of senators, regardless of political party, about judicial nominations in their home-states.... no chair of the Judiciary Committee allowed even one negative blue slip to automatically veto a nomination.\" In contrast, from 1956 through 1978\u2014under the chairmanship of Senator James O. Eastland\u2014a nominee was required to receive two positive blue slips from his home state Senators before the nomination was to be considered by the committee. ", "During this period, which encompassed both unified and divided party control of the presidency and the Senate, if a home state Senator had some objection to the nominee and wanted to stop committee action, he or she could decide not to return the blue slip or return it with a negative response. Under such circumstances the withholding of a blue slip or a single negative response would halt all further action on a nomination.

", "Past chairmen of the Judiciary Committee, regardless of political party, have emphasized the need for consultation and inter-branch cooperation between a President and home state Senators in considering potential U.S. circuit and district court nominees. In 1989, Senator Biden stated that \"I have long emphasized the need for consultation, which, in my view, is part of the 'advice' component of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution. I believe that the nomination process will function more effectively if consultation is taken seriously.\" Senator Hatch, in 2001, stated that \"the Senate expects genuine good faith consultation by the administration with home state senators before a judicial nomination is made, and the administration's failure to consult in genuine good faith with both home state senators is grounds for a senator's return of a negative blue slip.\" And, in 2009, Senator Leahy noted that requiring \"the support of home State Senators is a traditional mechanism to encourage the White House to engage in meaningful consultation with the Senate.\" The lack of consultation between a President and home state Senators has, at times, resulted in nominees not being considered by the Judiciary Committee.", "The importance of consultation has also been emphasized by other Senators, more generally.

We respect your responsibility to nominate suitable candidates for the federal bench. And as a former colleague, we know you appreciate the Senate's unique constitutional responsibility to provide or withhold its Advice and Consent on nominations. The principle of senatorial consultation (or senatorial courtesy) is rooted in this special responsibility, and its application dates to the Administration of George Washington. Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged the importance of maintaining this principle, which allows individual senators to provide valuable insights into their constituents' qualifications for federal service.", "Additionally, during the presidency of George W. Bush, the nine Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee submitted a letter to the administration emphasizing the need for consultation between the White House and Senators belonging to the minority. The letter stated that,", "As you know, there has been a long history of consultation between the White House and the Senate on potential nominations. The Senate's recent practice fully recognized that the interests of Senators in judicial nominations are not limited to those in the same political party as the President.

These circumstances were identified in a letter to Charles Ruff, counsel to the President, and included the following: ", "(1) failure to give serious consideration to individuals proposed by home state Senators as possible nominees;", "(2) failure to identify to home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee an individual the President is considering nominating with enough time to allow the Senator to provide meaningful feedback before any formal clearance (i.e., by the [American Bar Association] or [Federal Bureau of Investigation]) on the prospective nominee is initiated;", "(3) after having identified the name of an individual the President is considering nominating, failure to (a) seek a home state Senator's feedback, including any objections the Senator may have to the prospective nominee, at least two weeks before any formal clearances are initiated, and (b) give that feedback serious consideration;", "(4) failure to notify a home state Senator, and the Judiciary Committee, that formal clearance on a prospective nominee is being initiated despite the Senator's objections; and ", "(5) failure to notify home state Senators, and the Judiciary Committee, before a nomination is actually made, that the President will nominate an individual.

Bush presidency, Senator Leahy, then ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Alberto Gonzales, counsel to the President, recommending that \"the Administration undertake to incorporate the following consultative procedures into its selection, vetting and nomination processes.\" These procedures included:", "1. The Administration shall give serious consideration to individuals proposed by home state Senators as possible nominees;", "2. The Administration shall consult with home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee (both majority and minority) regarding individuals the President is considering nominating with enough time to allow Senators to consider the potential nominee and provide a meaningful response to the Administration before any formal clearance (i.e., by the [Federal Bureau of Investigation]) on the prospective nominee is initiated;", "3.

As a result, this could lead to a greater number of judicial nominees receiving life-time appointments without the support of one or both home state Senators. Given that relatively few nominees have been confirmed without the support of one or both of their home state Senators, this would represent a historically notable change in the confirmation process for U.S. circuit and district court nominees.
