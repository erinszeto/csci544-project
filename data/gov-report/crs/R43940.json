How to cover the cost. Most federal freight investments are currently funded through the highway trust fund, whose main source of revenue is taxes on motor fuels. These taxes no longer raise sufficient revenue to fund existing federal surface transportation programs, and proposals to increase federal spending on freight infrastructure are often linked to other fees or taxes that have not gained support in Congress. How to set priorities. Most federal highway funding is distributed by formula to state departments of transportation, which determine spending priorities in cooperation with metropolitan planning organizations. This process forces freight projects to compete with passenger-oriented projects, which may have greater support\u2014especially when a proposed freight project primarily benefits so-called through trucks (rather than trucks making local pick-ups and deliveries). Changes in the law to establish priority for freight infrastructure would run contrary to the trend in recent reauthorization acts to give states greater discretion over their spending of federal highway funds. The role of the federal government in the planning process. The 2012 surface transportation reauthorization, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141), established a performance measurement system for state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations.

Among the most important areas of disagreement are how to raise new funds for investment, the magnitude of the amounts required, how to set priorities, and the role of the federal government in the planning process.

Consequently, the focus of this report is on truck freight and that portion of the rail industry that transports truck trailers and containers (intermodal freight).

It handles domestic shipments of a few miles as well as international shipments of thousands of miles. Rail carries the largest share of domestic freight measured in ton-miles, but only a small proportion by value ( Table 1 ), reflecting the fact that major rail cargos such as coal and grain have low ratios of value to weight. Trucks carry far more freight by value but less by ton-miles, as the average truck shipment travels a much shorter distance than the average rail shipment. Air transportation is a relatively minor mode for domestic shipments because it is expensive to ship goods by air. The proportions for international shipments to and from the United States are quite different than those for domestic shipments, with about three-quarters of goods, measured by weight, arriving or departing by ship. Measured by value, nearly one-fourth of U.S. international freight moves by air.", "Trucks run over a four-million-mile system of highways and streets. Of this, approximately 209,000 miles has been designated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as the \"National Truck Network,\" a network of highways able to accommodate large trucks. This network includes the Interstate Highway System, which extends approximately 47,000 miles, plus principal arterial highways designated by the states. Trucks account for about 9% of vehicle miles traveled on the entire U.S. road system, but 15% of vehicle miles on Interstates and 24% on rural Interstates.", "The railroad sector is dominated by seven large railroads, or Class I carriers, that generally focus on long-distance moves. The Class I railroads are complemented by more than 500 short line and regional railroads (Class II and III) that tend to haul freight shorter distances, provide connections between the Class I networks, or connect the Class I network and ports. For the most part, railroad infrastructure, including track and associated structures and the land they occupy, is owned by the carriers themselves. The U.S. railroad network consists of approximately 140,000 miles of railroad, of which approximately 94,000 miles could be considered transcontinental or mainline railroad and 46,000 miles could be considered regional or local railroad. In some places, freight trains share space with intercity and commuter passenger trains.", "Although trucks and railroads often compete for shippers' business, they also may work together to complete freight movements. This is especially true in the case of long-distance movements. Railroads have established large intermodal yards designed for easy transfer of containers between trucks and trains at locations such as Edgerton, KS (BNSF) and North Baltimore, OH (CSX). In the face of high operating costs and a lack of drivers willing to undertake week-long trips, many truck lines now pick up freight from a shipper's premises, carry it to an intermodal terminal for transfer to a train, and then collect it at another intermodal terminal for delivery to its final destination. International shipments of containerized goods often move by rail between ports and inland terminals, with a truck connection to and from the rail terminal. This is why, as indicated in Table 1 , freight shipments moved by a combination of truck and rail tend to travel greater distances than goods moved by either mode singularly.", "Over the last decade, intermodal traffic has increased by nearly 30% (measured by the number of containers and truck trailers moved by railroads), making it the fastest- growing freight segment. While international trade growth traditionally has been the driver of intermodal growth, in recent years the number of domestic intermodal shipments has risen to nearly match the number of international shipments to and from the United States. ", "Tonnage carried by trucks as a single mode has increased 14% over the last decade while rail tonnage carried as a single mode has increased by 7%. By 2040, U.S. DOT is forecasting that truck tonnage will increase by 43%, rail tonnage by 37%, and multimodal tonnage (of which intermodal is a subset) by 125%. Since 2011, the volume of coal carried by railroads, their most important revenue source, has declined significantly, while crude oil and drilling sand have suddenly become significant commodities for rail.", "The expansion of the Panama Canal, expected to be completed in early 2016, will allow the passage of container ships almost three times the current maximum capacity. The project may draw more Asian cargo through East or Gulf Coast ports at the expense of West Coast ports, but this is uncertain. Similarly, the enlarged canal could lead more grain grown in the Mississippi Valley to be shipped to Gulf Coast ports by barge for export to Asia rather than being shipped to West Coast ports by rail. The development of trade patterns will depend in part on the Canal's tolls and U.S. railroad rates. The arrival of larger container ships at Gulf Coast and East Coast ports could also exacerbate a persistent problem with moving trucks through port terminal gates efficiently.

This congestion is particularly pronounced in major urban areas that contain important freight hubs such as ports, airports, border crossings, and rail yards. As identified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the 25 most congested segments for trucks are generally urban Interstate highway interchanges (see Appendix ). Six of the 25 most congested segments are in Houston and three are in Chicago. A trucking industry study estimates that 89% of the total costs of congestion for trucks are concentrated on 12% of Interstate highway mileage. Figure 1 depicts congestion on the highway system in the Southeast in 2011 during peak periods and how performance may deteriorate by 2040 without new capacity or operational improvements.", "Freight rail congestion has been episodic over the last couple of decades and has been caused by poor weather, demand surges, and railroad mergers. Currently, a boom in movements of crude oil from North Dakota, combined with a bumper harvest in 2014 and a residual backlog of shipments stemming from the severe winter of 2013-2014, is causing delays in rail service in the Upper Midwest. The railroad loading most of North Dakota's rail freight said it would spend $265 million in the state in 2014 to add parallel track segments. Both Class I railroads serving the state have blamed railroad congestion in Chicago, the crossroads of the North American rail system, as an underlying cause of current service issues (see text box). Local bottlenecks can take months if not years to resolve and may have effects across the entire rail network. Significant increases in train traffic on some lines have prompted upgrades to warning devices at grade crossings or interest in grade separation projects. Railroads seek changes to the environmental permitting process to expedite expansion projects. ", "At land border crossings and seaports, congestion is less a matter of infrastructure constraints than staffing flexibility at customs booths and terminal gates. Truckers would like to see Customs and Border Protection better adjust staffing to accommodate daily peak crossing times at land border points of entry. Port terminal operators seek flexibility from longshoremen to extend truck gate hours to nights and weekends without charging premium rates. Long lines of trucks at some port terminals are also due to the bunching of port calls by steamship operators and their deployment of larger container ships. The prevalence of independent truckers, typically paid by the trip to the port, frustrates coordinated information processing and the truckers' ability to influence the situation. \"U.S. port efficiency is among the lowest of world trading partners,\" according to one U.S. railroad. ", "West Coast port inefficiencies are of particular concern for two of the nation's most valuable commodities exported in containers to Asia\u2014chilled beef and pork. If more Asia-bound ships call at alternative ports in Canada, Mexico, or on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and reduce calls at U.S. Pacific Coast ports, chilled meat exports cannot easily be diverted to these ports because of their time sensitivity.

The fifth core program, the Transportation Alternatives Program ($0.8 billion), is primarily aimed at supporting nonmotorized transportation. Because highway and bridge improvements benefit both freight and passenger mobility, it is impossible to say how much funding primarily benefits freight movement.", "Although there is no discrete freight transportation program, there are certain programs and provisions within programs that specifically pertain to freight projects. For example, under current law, if a project can be demonstrated to make an improvement to the efficient movement of freight, then DOT is authorized to allow a higher federal share of funding. For such projects on the Interstate Highway System the maximum federal share is 95%, more than the typical 90%, and for non-Interstate projects the maximum share is 90%, more than the typical 80%. Moreover, many types of freight infrastructure improvements are eligible uses of federal highway funds. For example, truck parking and certain surface transportation improvements in and around ports are eligible for Surface Transportation Program funding, and CMAQ funds may be used for advanced truck stop electrification systems if they contribute to attainment of an air quality standard. ", "In addition to the core programs, MAP-21 also authorized two other small programs that have the potential to benefit freight movement. These are the Railway-Highway Crossings program and the Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) program. The Railway-Highway Crossings Program, authorized at $220 million in both FY2013 and FY2014, provides funding to reduce hazards at public railway-highway crossings, potentially improving the movement of freight by rail and road. The PNRS program was originally authorized (with all funding earmarked) in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU; P.L. 109-59 , Section 1301). It is intended to provide funding for high-cost projects with large nonlocal benefits, including highways, public transportation, rail facilities providing benefits to highway users, and intermodal facilities. ", "The PNRS program was authorized in MAP-21 for a general fund appropriation of $500 million in FY2013 only. The appropriations committees, however, did not appropriate these funds. Instead, appropriators have continued to fund the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program, which provides grants on a competitive basis for a wide range of transportation projects that \"will have a significant impact on the nation, a metropolitan area, or a region,\" as PNRS also was intended to do. Eligible projects include highways, public transportation, passenger and freight rail transportation projects, and port infrastructure investments. In FY2014, a single grant could be no more than $200 million, but had to be at least $10 million (or at least $1 million for projects in a rural area). ", "Unlike most of the surface transportation program, funding for the TIGER program comes from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, not the highway trust fund. Moreover, the program was not enacted as part of surface transportation authorization legislation. Instead, the TIGER program was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) and has been funded in six subsequent appropriations bills. Funding was $1.5 billion in FY2009, $600 million in FY2010, $527 million in FY2011, $500 million in FY2012, $474 million in FY2013 (after an across-the-board rescission and sequestration), $600 million in FY2014, and $500 million in FY2015.", "Arguably, the most nationally significant freight project funded by PNRS and TIGER is the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE, see box).

As of February 23, 2015, according to DOT, TIFIA financing for all types of freight and non-freight projects amounted to $21.2 billion, with assistance provided to 50 projects costing a total of $77.1 billion. One of these projects, receiving a $341 million TIFIA loan, is the Port of Miami Tunnel, which opened August 3, 2014, to improve truck access to and from the port.", "MAP-21 greatly enlarged TIFIA by increasing its funding from $122 million annually to $750 million in FY2013 and $1 billion in FY2014. Funding was continued at the level of $1 billion annualized in the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Because the government expects most of the loans to be repaid, the program's funding need only cover the subsidy cost of credit assistance and administrative costs. According to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, Title V of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ), the subsidy cost is \"the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or a loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs\" (Section 502(5)(A)). Consequently, the loan capacity of the TIFIA program is much larger than the budget authority available. A typical rule of thumb is that the average subsidy cost of a loan is 10%, meaning that $1 million of budget authority can provide $10 million of loan capacity. DOT estimated that after administrative costs and application of the obligation limitation it would have about $1.6 billion in total for credit subsidy support in FY2013 and FY2014.

According to a survey, by 2012, 32 states had established a federally authorized SIB. Although the authority to create a SIB in cooperation with the federal government still exists, MAP-21 failed to extend the authority to capitalize a SIB by using some of a state's apportioned and allocated federal highway and transit funds.", "In general, state infrastructure banks have not been very significant participants in financing surface transportation projects. Survey results indicate that between 1995 and 2012 federal and nonfederal SIBs entered into about 1,100 agreements worth a total of $9 billion, an average of about $8 million per agreement. About 71% of the projects helped by SIBs were highway projects, which accounted for 88% of the value of all projects supported by SIBs. Water, port, rail, and pipeline projects accounted for about 8% of the loans and 4% of the value of loan agreements.

A special type of state and local government bond backed by future federal-aid highway grant funding is known as a Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle or GARVEE.", "In some cases in which there are significant private project benefits, a tax-exempt Private Activity Bond can be issued. The Secretary of Transportation must approve the use of Private Activity Bonds for qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities and the aggregate amount allocated must not exceed $15 billion. As of January 14, 2015, $11.9 billion of the $15 billion had been allocated. Along with TIFIA, Private Activity Bonds have been important for the creation of public private partnerships in infrastructure investment, some of which have sponsored freight-related projects.

These bonds offered a tax credit equal to 35% of the amount of interest paid by the state or local government issuer or a direct payment to the issuer in an amount equal to 35% of the interest payable to investors.

Moreover, about 85% of the volume of containerized imports and exports is handled by 10 ports. In some cases, local planners may not fully appreciate that the competitiveness of local producers or manufacturers is most negatively affected by an infrastructure constraint outside their jurisdiction.", "A competitive discretionary program theoretically could fund the most valuable projects. One model of such a program is the federal New Starts program, which funds public transportation construction projects through a competitive process intended to direct significant funding to the best projects. However, this is done at considerable time and cost in developing and evaluating projects. Another discretionary program, the TIGER program, evaluates and funds projects much more quickly, but it has been criticized for accepting applications after the deadline, advancing low-scoring projects, and changing the evaluation of lower rated projects to \"highly recommended\" after they were chosen for funding. A 2014 GAO study noted that \"an absence of documentation of such decisions can give rise to challenges to the integrity of the evaluation process and the rationale for the decisions made.\" ", "An alternative way of setting priorities would be for Congress to create a program that distributes funds for freight projects by formula. The formula could give weight to whichever factors Congress considers most important. Spending eligibilities could be written to narrowly circumscribe project selection by state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). Historically, however, funding formulas for federal surface transportation projects have distributed funding widely and allowed these funds to be used on a broad array of projects at the discretion of states and localities. Consequently, formula programs have not been well suited to funding large projects that might have the biggest national and regional benefits.", "The important role of multi-modal transportation in freight movement creates a particular challenge in setting spending priorities. Federal programs are typically focused on a single mode, making it difficult to support multi-modal projects, which are common in freight infrastructure. Eligibility rules also have tended to exclude local roads (known as intermodal connectors) that provide access between freight facilities, such as ports, airports, and rail terminals, and the main highway system. A further barrier to a multi-modal freight program could be the source of funds. If funding is provided only from taxes paid by highway users, there may be objection to expenditures that benefit entities such as railroads and water carriers that have not paid the taxes.

Greater federal funding for freight transportation infrastructure would require either reducing funding for other programs or generating new revenues. The main options in reauthorization to generate more funding for freight infrastructure would be to raise the federal fuels tax, to institute other freight-specific user fees, or to develop alternative financing mechanisms such as a National Infrastructure Bank and public-private partnerships (P3s). Another option might be to regularly fund highway programs with general funds.", "Advantages of raising the federal fuels tax in the short-to-medium term include the relatively large sums of money it generates, its low costs to change and administer, and its positive effects on economic efficiency. A one-cent-per-gallon increase in the fuels tax generates about $1.5 billion per year for the highway trust fund. A number of interest groups, including the American Trucking Associations and the Truckload Carriers Association, have expressed a willingness to support an increase in the federal fuels tax to fund surface transportation infrastructure investment. A study conducted by FHWA in 2000 concluded that federal motor fuel tax rates provided heavier freight trucks a cross-subsidy from lighter freight trucks and automobiles. But opposition to raising the fuels tax is widespread, and the Obama Administration has stated it does not support raising the fuels tax.", "Greater use of tolling could fund investment to relieve freight bottlenecks, such as road widening, bridge replacements, truck-only lanes, and new highways. Although the decisions to implement facility-specific charges and the institutional arrangements needed to support them are taken at the state and local level, there are some ways Congress might encourage such projects. For example, federal restrictions on highway tolls could be lessened or eliminated.", "Trucking groups have been particularly wary of proposals to fund highway construction through tolls, as they worry that toll rates could shift some costs from passenger vehicles to trucks. There is also concern that toll revenue may be diverted to uses other than the toll facility. Tolls could divert some trucks to toll-free highways that are less safe for large trucks. Some toll roads have mitigated the effects of tolls on road usage by allowing trucks to haul larger loads than on non-tolled facilities. ", "New sources of revenue to provide money for freight infrastructure might include shipping container fees, customs revenue, a bill of lading fee, and a weight/distance tax. Some of these fees, though, would be expensive to collect, and others would generate relatively modest sums. For example, it would take a $1,650 annual truck registration fee to generate the same amount as a 10-cent increase in the fuels tax, roughly $15 billion annually.", "Proposals for new funding sometimes include the creation of a new trust fund or a new account in the highway trust fund. A freight transportation trust fund or freight transportation account could ensure that the revenues generated from freight-related uses are dedicated to freight-related improvement projects. Alternative approaches have involved creating a national infrastructure bank to provide low-cost, long-term loans on flexible terms for use on various types of projects, including freight projects, and providing greater subsidies to borrowers under the existing Railroad Rehabilitation and Infrastructure Finance program to encourage greater borrowing by freight railroads.", "Prior to January 1, 2015, Class II and Class III (or \"short line\") railroads were able to receive a tax credit, known as the \"45G tax credit, for track maintenance\" (26 U.S.C. \u00a745G). H.R. 721 , introduced in the 114 th Congress, would extend this tax credit to the end of 2016. Tax credits for Class I freight railroads have also been proposed in the past ( H.R. 1806 , 111 th Congress). The credits are intended to support private investment in freight railroads without involving the government in deciding when and where that investment should take place. Since the heaviest trucks and railroads, particularly shortline railroads, often compete for the same freight, Congress may consider whether raising truck-related taxes that fund the Highway Trust Fund could be an appropriate method for encouraging rail investment.

Funding for the NFP was set at $6 billion over the six years of the bill, starting with $400 million in FY2015 and increasing to $2 billion in FY2020. The bill also required the designation of a national highway freight network (NHFN) and, as a part of this, a primary highway freight network (PHFN). NFP funding was to be used only for projects on the NHFN, with a minimum percentage designated to projects on the PHFN.
