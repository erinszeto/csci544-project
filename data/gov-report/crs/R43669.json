The effect of shifting these costs into agency budgets is noted for many agencies later in this report.

It requires food processing, manufacturing, shipping, and other facilities to conduct a food safety plan of the most likely safety hazards, and design and implement risk-based controls.

It may earn a small amount of money from activities such as buying and selling commodities and receiving interest payments on loans. But because the CCC never earns more than it spends, its borrowing authority must be replenished periodically through a congressional appropriation so that it does not reach its $30 billion debt limit.

The congressional appropriation may not always restore the line of credit to the previous year's level, or may repay more than was spent. For these reasons, the appropriation to the CCC may not reflect outlays.

", "As stated before, total discretionary Agriculture appropriations grew at +2.2% per year over the past 10 years (+0.3% annually on an inflation-adjusted basis). Over a shorter period, the annual change is -2.2% per year over the past five years, or -3.8% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis. The domestic nutrition portion of this discretionary subtotal (primarily WIC, commodity assistance programs, and nutrition programs administration) shows a +2.5% annual increase over 10 years (+0.6% per year if adjusted for inflation). Over a five-year period, the annual change is -1.5% per year (-3.1% per year if adjusted for inflation). The discretionary portion for rest of the bill has risen at +2.0% per year for 10 years (+0.1% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis). Over the five-year period, the annual change is -2.6% per year (-4.2% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis).", "Comparisons to the Federal Budget, GDP, and Population", "Relative to the entire federal budget, the Agriculture bill's share has declined from over 4% of the total federal budget in FY1995 and FY2000, to 2.7% in FY2009, before rising again to 4% in recent years ( Figure A-4 , Table A-4 ). Within that total, the share for nutrition programs had declined from 2.6% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008, but the recent recession has caused that share to rise to about 3%. The share for the rest of the bill has declined from 2.2% in FY2000 to about 1.0% recently.", "Those shares of the federal budget also can be subdivided into mandatory and discretionary spending ( Figure A-5 ). The mandatory share for nutrition is presently about 2.7% (generally rising, but recently ameliorating), while the discretionary share for nutrition is fairly steady 0.2%. The mandatory share for the rest of the bill (primarily crop insurance, commodity program subsidies, and conservation) is about 0.6%, while the discretionary share for the rest of the bill is about 0.4% (generally declining).", "The 0.6% share of the federal budget above for mandatory spending on crop insurance, farm commodity subsidies, and conservation is a good proxy for farm bill spending on agricultural (non-nutrition) programs ( Figure A-5 ). It has been variable and generally declining since 2000 (consistent with farm commodity spending), though since 2009 steadier to slightly rising (consistent with steady to declining farm commodity spending but increasing crop insurance and mandatory conservation spending).", "As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), Agriculture appropriations had been fairly steady at under 0.75% of GDP from FY1997-FY2009, but have risen to about 0.8% of GDP since FY2010 due to increases in nutrition program demand ( Figure A-6 , Table A-4 ). Nutrition programs have been rising as a percentage of GDP since FY2000 (0.32% in FY2001 to 0.61% in FY2015), while non-nutrition agricultural programs have declined (0.40% in FY2000 to 0.21% in FY2015). ", "On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly over the past 10 to 15 years from about $250 per capita in 1998 (FY2015 dollars) to about $460 per capita in FY2015 ( Figure A-7 ). Nutrition programs have risen more steadily on a per capita basis from about $157 per capita in FY2001 to nearly $343 per capita in FY2015. Non-nutrition \"other\" agricultural programs have been more steady or declining, falling from $195 per capita in FY2000 to about $116 per capita in FY2015.", "Budget Sequestration", "Sequestration is a process of automatic, largely across-the-board reductions that permanently cancel mandatory and/or discretionary budget authority when spending would exceed statutory budget goals. The current requirement for sequestration is in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). Table B-1 shows the rates of sequestration and the amounts of budget authority cancelled from accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill.", "Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ) raised spending limits in the BCA to avoid sequestration of discretionary accounts in FY2014 and FY2015, it did not prevent or reduce sequestration on mandatory accounts. In fact, to pay for avoiding sequestration in the near term, it extended by two years (until FY2023) the duration for sequestration on mandatory programs.", "Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration. The nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program are exempt, and some prior legal obligations in crop insurance and the farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by OMB. ", "Since enactment of the BCA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has ordered budget sequestration in FY2013 on non-exempt, non-defense discretionary accounts ( Table B-2 ) and on mandatory accounts in FY2013-FY2015 ( Table B-3 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
