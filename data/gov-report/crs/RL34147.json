Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) in televisions and computer monitors have presented a particular concern to states, primarily due to the potentially significant amounts of lead they contain and the large numbers in which they are generated.", "State concerns specific to the landfill disposal or incineration of e-waste are largely due to its increasing volume and often bulky nature; hazardous constituents, such as lead and mercury, it may contain; its high cost of recycling; and the inability of interested stakeholders, such as electronics retailers and manufacturers, to reach consensus on how to voluntarily implement a national e-waste management system. States have responded to this concern by enacting their own e-waste management laws. Requirements of those laws range from a ban only on the landfill disposal or incineration of designated e-wastes to the implementation of a full e-waste collection, transportation, and recycling system.", "To date, 14 states have enacted some form of e-waste management law (as many as 20 states proposed e-waste laws in 2006 and 2007).

Recycling may include any of a number of services or processes, such as: sorting to find reusable devices (which may in turn be sold or donated to an entity such as a school or charitable organization); demanufacturing into component parts that can be resold; or further processing components to extract materials such as metals, glass, or plastic. For example, leaded glass in a cathode ray tube (CRT) may be recovered and reprocessed to produce new CRTs. Recycling can be a costly process (see \"The Cost of Recycling Electronics,\" below). A challenge to many states is how to finance an e-waste collection and recycling program.", "To date, 14 states have enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect e-waste recycling and disposal practices. As more states propose such legislation, potentially regulated stakeholders (particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the United States.", "In 2005, two congressional hearings were held to explore issues associated with e-waste, and the Congressional E-Waste Working Group was formed. One goal common to both the hearings and the establishment of the working group was to explore potential national solutions to the e-waste management issue.

Until recently, data regarding electronic products sold, stored, recycled, disposed of, and exported in the United States were limited. In 2007, EPA completed a study that attempted to gather more data. According to that study, as of 2005, of electronic products sold in the United States between 1980 and 2004,", "almost half (976 million units) were still in use or reuse, almost 42% (842 million units) were recycled or disposed of, and almost 9% (180 million units) were in storage.", "Further, in 2005 alone, EPA estimated that between 1.9 to 2.2 million tons of electronics became obsolete. Of that amount, between 1.5 to 1.9 million tons were discarded, primarily in landfills. Although EPA estimates that e-waste comprises about 2% of the municipal solid waste stream, it is anticipated that this percentage will grow as consumers continue to replace old and outdated electronic equipment and discard equipment in storage. This will be the case particularly after the transition from analog to digital television broadcasts and with the increased use of flat-screen televisions and computer monitors.", "In addition to the bulky nature of electronic devices such as televisions and computers, the increasing volume of e-waste concerns some states, particularly state and municipal waste management agencies. Because these items have the potential to be reused or recycled, some states have become increasingly interested in diverting such waste from municipal landfills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hazardous Components in E-Waste", "paragraphs": ["The potential presence of various toxic or hazardous components is another reason that e-waste is a concern. For example, cathode ray tubes (CRTs), computer central processing units (CPUs), and other electronic devices generally contain significant quantities of lead. CRTs contain an average of four pounds of lead but may contain more, depending on the size, age, and make of the device. Electronic devices are also likely to contain a number of other heavy metals, such as mercury, beryllium, barium, chromium, nickel, or zinc. Also, brominated flame retardants are commonly added to the plastic housing of televisions, computers, and other electronic devices. When disposed of in landfills or incinerated, hazardous components of e-wastes may be released into the groundwater or air.", "In some instances, hazardous materials are used in electronics to make those devices safe for consumer use or because less toxic alternatives are not readily available. For example, CRT glass is infused with lead to protect users from radiation emitted from the tube; flame retardants are added to plastics to prevent the heated electronic devices from catching fire. Although flat panel monitors are replacing CRTs, those monitors often need mercury to operate efficiently. The continued use of certain hazardous substances makes the need for recycling options greater, if the goal is to minimize the disposal of those substances in a landfill or incinerator."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Cost of Recycling Electronics", "paragraphs": ["There are various elements that contribute to the cost of a state recycling program. The recycling infrastructure itself includes the cost of collecting, transporting, and sorting the devices. There is also a cost associated with recycling the devices themselves. Recyclers and refurbishers often charge a fee for their services because their costs outweigh the revenue received from recycled commodities (e.g., glass, metals, or reusable components) or from the sale of refurbished units. Although they will recover a certain amount of usable scrap from e-waste, they will also likely incur expenses when they have to handle and dispose of any hazardous components. Also, unlike household consumers, recyclers will be regulated under RCRA and are subject to the more stringent requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage, transportation, and disposal.", "Some stakeholders argue that one method of lowering the cost of processing electronics is to improve economies of scale through increased volume. Until recently, the primary sources of electronic devices for recycling have been manufacturers and large businesses. Redirecting household-generated e-waste, that has typically been disposed of in a landfill or left unused in storage, could provide recyclers with a larger and steadier supply of products to recycle.", "According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), cost and inconvenience inhibit consumers from recycling used electronics. Although some computer manufacturers now accept their own products for recycling free of charge, consumers generally have to pay the manufacturer a fee to recycle their e-waste (by packing and shipping them to the manufacturer themselves) or they must drop off their used electronics at often inconvenient locations (also, often for a fee). If the consumer does not pay for recycling, any recycling fees would likely be absorbed by the state or local agency collecting the device.", "Most stakeholders agree that if e-waste is to be recycled, it must be as easy for consumers to recycle electronics as it is to buy them. Many local and state agencies, retailers, and electronics manufacturers have worked with EPA to sponsor pilot programs providing convenient, free recycling services to consumers. The success of those programs demonstrated how successful e-waste recycling programs can be if they are convenient and inexpensive. However, most states do not want to bear the full financial burden of establishing an e-waste management program. One factor driving states to develop e-waste laws is to implement a system that will provide financing for an e-waste collection, transportation, and recycling system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Inability of Stakeholders to Agree on a National System", "paragraphs": ["For several years, interested stakeholders have debated how to best address the e-waste management issue. Those stakeholders include electronics manufacturers and retailers, local and state governments (particularly waste management and water treatment agencies), recyclers, environmental organizations, and charitable organizations that accept donation of used electronics. In general, these groups have agreed that the growth of e-waste has outpaced the development of infrastructure to appropriately reuse or recycle it. However, those stakeholders have disagreed about the best way to implement a program to manage such waste.", "In 2001, a group of stakeholders formed the National Electronics Product Stewardship Initiative (NEPSI). The group's mission was the \"development of a system, which includes a viable financing mechanism, to maximize the collection, reuse, and recycling of used electronics, while considering appropriate incentives to design products that facilitate source reduction, reuse and recycling; reduce toxicity; and increase recycled content.\" Relatively early in the process, NEPSI determined that federal legislation would be required to implement any plan agreed to by the group.", "By 2004, the group had reached an impasse on how to finance a nationwide recycling system. That impasse divided the group into two camps\u2014those who believed that a collection and recycling program should be financed through a consumer-paid advance recycling fee (ARF) assessed at the point-of-sale of designated electronic devices, and those who advocated a \"producer pays\" model wherein electronics manufacturers either took back their own e-waste and recycled it or paid for a system that would. (For more information about these two financing systems, see the section \" A Mechanism to Fund the Program \" below.)", "In the absence of federal e-waste legislation or stakeholder consensus regarding an appropriate national e-waste collection and recycling program, states have begun to implement their own programs.

Most current state programs fall into two broad categories: a consumer-paid system or a producer- or manufacturer-paid system.", "Under any financing scheme, it must be determined who will pay to manage orphan waste. \"Orphan waste\" is e-waste for which no manufacturer can be identified or for which the manufacturer is no longer in business. Given the high rate of turnover in the electronics business, the large numbers of foreign manufacturers that may be difficult to track down, and the large numbers of \"white box\" products (electronic products put together by component assemblers without a brand name affixed to the device), the proportion of orphan waste is potentially substantial.

Proceeds from the ARF would be used to implement the state's e-waste collection infrastructure and recycling programs. The collected funds may be managed by a state commission or a private third-party organization (TPO). Suggested ARFs are generally between $6 and $10, depending on the size of the device. This amount is less than the cost of recycling individual CEDs. However, because more products are sold than enter the waste stream, the cost of establishing a recycling infrastructure may be paid for at less than the per-unit recycling price. A portion of the funds may pay for local collection so that the government does not assume the cost of developing and running the recycling infrastructure. Also, retailers collecting the fee may keep a certain percentage of the fee to cover their administrative costs.", "The ARF approach has been adopted in California and is favored by certain electronics manufacturers. Supporters of this system argue, in part, that it would", "immediately and reliably create a sustainable source of funding for a recycling infrastructure; pay for recycling all returned products, including orphan waste; be simple and could be implemented efficiently; and include a fee that is transparent to consumers and may contribute to consumer awareness of the need to recycle.", "Stakeholders opposed to this approach argue, in part, that", "it would not be easily applied to Internet sales, presenting a competitive disadvantage to retailers assessing the fee; it would not provide manufacturers with an incentive to produce more environmentally benign products or to design products that may be more easily recycled; and if the collected funds exceeded recycling costs, those funds could be taken by the state and used for other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Producer Pays Model", "paragraphs": ["This approach requires manufacturers to implement or finance a collection and recycling program that takes responsibility for their share of returned e-waste and a share of orphan waste (generally assessed based on the company's total market share in the state).

Some models allow the producer to address its share of waste by establishing its own recycling program (or one in cooperation with other manufacturers) or paying the state for the collection, consolidation, and recycling costs of its share. To date, all state e-waste programs, except California's, implement some version of the producer-pays model.", "Stakeholders in favor of this approach include environmental organizations, retailers, and certain manufacturers that have already established recycling programs for their products. Some of their arguments to support this approach include", "the system places limited responsibilities on retailers and consumers and avoids the creation of new taxes on consumers, manufacturers implementing their own recycling programs have the flexibility to design their recycling program as they see fit, and making manufacturers responsible for recycling their own products may make them more likely to design products that are easier to recycle or that would have fewer toxic components.", "Stakeholders opposed to this approach argue, in part, that", "the allocation of disposal/recycling costs to a given manufacturer would likely require costly sorting to identify the appropriate manufacturer, existing manufacturers would be responsible for the cost of recycling orphan waste, and the internalization of recycling costs may ultimately cost consumers more than an ARF once the recycling costs are subject to mark-up as the product moves through the distribution process.", "Another variation on the producer-pays model involves manufacturers paying a flat fee to sell their products in that state.
