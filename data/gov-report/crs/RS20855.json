In the FY2002 budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 83 ), the House approved the full $23.9 billion for international affairs. The Senate added $200million for HIV/AIDS and $50 million for global climate change programs beyond what President Bush requested. Callsfor higher international affairs spending have been fueled in recent years not only by appeals from theAdministration, butalso by the recommendations of numerous \"expert\" commissions that have cited inadequate resources anddysfunctionalorganizational structures as major impediments to the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.

Most otherdevelopment aidprogram sectors will remain at approximate current levels. Population aid will receive the same $425 millionallocation asin FY2001, but remains a highly controversial issue due to President Bush's decision to re-impose restrictions oninternational family planning.

Nevertheless, Israel andEgyptwill remain the largest recipients of American aid, with amounts totaling about $2.76 billion and $1.96 billion,respectively. Due to the net aid cuts for Israel and Egypt, plus a small increase overall for security assistance, ESF and militaryaid wouldgain about $230 million in FY2002 that could be allocated for new members of NATO and selected recipients inLatinAmerica and Asia.

TheAdministrationis proposing a multi-year program (for which the FY2002 budget request would provide an initial tranche) to fillthe currentgap in personnel, enhance retention and training, and provide for a float allowing personnel to take leaves of absencefortraining, without leaving a position empty. Initially, the State Department seeks to hire 360 personnel (both inForeign andCivil Service), 186 security professionals, and some FSN replacements. This hiring, according to State Departmentbudgetofficials, would be separate from filling positions due to attrition.", "Information technology. In recent years, State Department technology acquisition has not kept pacewith its needs and with technology advancements. This condition was exacerbated by the October 1999 merger ofthe U.S.Information Agency (USIA)-an agency whose mission includes providing information and outreach to foreignpublics-intothe Department of State where classified communication and information is required. The Capital Investment Fund(CIF),established by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of FY1994/95 ( P.L. 103-236 ), provides funding for theDepartment's information technology and capital equipment. As recently as FY1997 the CIF appropriation was$24.6million but grew by FY2000 to $96 million.
