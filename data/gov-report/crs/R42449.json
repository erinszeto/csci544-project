The \"Chilean model\" has been widely studied as one possible model for public pension restructuring.", "Chile's public pension system consists of three tiers: a poverty prevention tier, an individual account tier, and a voluntary savings tier. The poverty prevention tier provides a minimum benefit to aged persons who did not participate in the public pension system and to retired workers whose monthly pensions financed by individual account assets (the second tier) do not reach certain thresholds. Workers contribute 10% of wage or salary income to an individual account in the second tier and choose a private-sector Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) with which to invest their pension contributions. Employers are not required to contribute to employees' AFPs, although since 2008 employers have been required to pay the premiums for workers' survivor and disability insurance, which are provided by private insurance companies. Upon retirement, the worker may withdraw assets that have accumulated in the individual account as an immediate or deferred annuity or through programmed withdrawals. The third tier allows workers to supplement retirement income with voluntary, tax-favored savings.", "In 2008, Chile approved major reforms intended, among other goals, to increase participation in the public pension system, improve competition among the private-sector individual account managers, and bolster the poverty prevention tier. There has been concern that, as a result of low participation rates and underreporting, many workers could reach retirement with individual account balances that are too small to provide an adequate pension annuity. The 2008 reforms helped address these concerns by expanding the poverty prevention tier, phasing in coverage for most self-employed workers, and providing incentives for additional voluntary saving through the system's third tier.

The preceding pay-as-you-go system had been foundering financially and was unable to pay full scheduled benefits. In addition, the previous system had been extremely complex, with more than 100 different combinations of contribution rates, retirement ages, and benefit amounts for different groups of employees.", "Chile's system of private pension accounts has been widely studied as one model for public pension restructuring.

The poverty prevention tier provides a basic benefit to aged persons who did not participate in the public pension system and to retired workers whose monthly pensions financed by individual account assets (the second tier) do not reach certain thresholds. Under the second tier, workers contribute 10% of wage or salary income to an individual account and choose a private-sector Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) to manage the account. Upon retirement, the worker may withdraw the individual account's accumulated assets as an immediate or deferred annuity or through programmed withdrawals.

In the case of retirees who have annuitized their individual account balances, the Pension Solidarity Complement is paid as the difference between the minimum benefit amount and the annuity financed by the individual account. In the case of pensions paid through programmed withdrawals from the individual account, the Pension Solidarity Component is paid once the member has used the balance in his or her individual account.

Prior to 2008, the law allowed self-employed workers to participate on a voluntary basis and only a small percentage of the self-employed chose to contribute. Other non-participants were temporarily out of the workforce due to caregiving or unemployment. Among those who did participate, many underreported their income to lower their contributions.

The 2008 package also included provisions intended to increase competition among the AFPs and reduce industry concentration. Insurance companies were allowed to create AFP subsidiaries. In addition, AFPs were allowed to contract out more services, such as record keeping and customer service, in order to lower barriers to entry for new AFPs. The 2008 reforms also created a competitive bidding process under which all new participants for two years are automatically enrolled in the AFP that offers the lowest management charges in the most recent round of bidding; it is hoped that this new bidding process, by guaranteeing a steady flow of participants for two years without having to incur marketing costs, will attract potential new AFPs.", "It may be too early to tell if these reforms will increase competition.

In addition, to encourage participation in the third tier of voluntary savings, the 2008 reforms created bonuses for low-income workers and tax incentives for contributing employees and for employers who establish voluntary savings accounts and match employees' contributions to these accounts. Also in 2008, a subsidy was approved to encourage employers to hire workers between the ages of 18 and 35, on the principle that early contributions can have a significant impact on final pension amounts.", "The 2008 reforms also contained several measures intended to improve the adequacy of women's benefits from their individual accounts, given that women often earn lower wages than men and many leave the workforce temporarily or permanently for caregiving. The Chilean government deposits a bonus in a woman's private account at age 65 for every live birth or adopted child. For women who have not contributed to the pension system, the Chilean government makes a corresponding increase in the amount of the Solidarity minimum benefit. The bonus is equivalent to 10% (i.e., the contribution rate) of the monthly minimum wage at the time of the child's birth, times 18 months, plus the average net rate of return on individual account pension plans in the C Fund from the child's birth until the pension is claimed. Women's contributions are boosted somewhat above the statutory 10% rate by a 2008 provision that charges both sexes the same premium for survivor and disability insurance, but deposits the difference between the higher premium that would have been charged to men into women's individual accounts.

For example, Chile's experience with high administrative costs may or may not be relevant to a second country, depending on whether the second country's public or private sector would manage account investments and the extent of financial-sector competition in the second country. Another difference between Chile and other countries may be the degree of public acceptance for the first, welfare tier of the system, which creates fiscal pressures similar to those of a pay-as-you-go system. Another political consideration is that Chile in the early 1980s, under General Pinochet, had considerable latitude to impose top-down reform of the pension system. Transition costs are another issue facing a country considering a move to a Chilean-type model. When Chile transitioned to a private account system in 1981, the earlier pay-as-you-go system was chaotic, insolvent, and unfair. At the same time, Chile's non-pension budget in the early 1980s was in surplus and available for financing transition costs, and high growth rates of economic growth in Chile during the 1980s reduced the burden of transition on the economy.", "The 2008 reforms to the poverty prevention tier (the Solidarity tier) are generally acknowledged as the most important component of the 2008 reform package. Chile's public pension system continues to face challenges after the 2008 reforms, however. Although the 2008 reforms will bring many self-employed workers into the public pension system, much of the informal sector remains outside the pension system. It remains to be seen whether reforms to AFPs will increase competition and lower costs."], "subsections": []}]}}
