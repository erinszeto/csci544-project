The expected costs of the accident were the actual losses to the accident victim multiplied by the probability of the accident occurring. This calculus, which came to be referred to as the Hand Formula after the decision of Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Carroll Towing Co. , effectively meant that employers did not have an absolute duty to prevent accidents but rather had such a duty only to the extent that the costs of prevention did not exceed the expected costs of the accident.

In addition, at the beginning of the 20 th century, states began limiting the common-law defenses available to employers. In 1900, seven states had such laws. By 1911, a year after the enactment of the first state workers' compensation law, 23 states had laws limiting employer defenses in work-accident cases. Through the purchase of workers' compensation insurance, employers could predict each year's costs associated with work injuries and these costs were not subject to the unpredictable nature of accidents themselves or the decisions of judges and juries.

Prior to workers' compensation, some employers offered workers ex post contracts in which the worker voluntarily accepted benefits from a relief fund jointly financed by the employer and the workers in exchange for forfeiting all future claims against the employer for a work injury. The decision to enter into an ex post contract was made by the worker after the accident occurred. Although such contracts were upheld by the courts, they were not an effective substitute for the tort system because workers retained the right to refuse relief fund payments and thus retain their rights to bring civil litigation against their employers, thus maintaining the uncertainty inherent in the tort system. ", "Although ex post contracts were legal but ineffective, employers also offered ex ante contracts in which workers agreed to waive their right to file suit against their employers in exchange for work-injury benefits, before any accident, injury, illness, or death occurred. The courts generally held such contracts to be unenforceable under common law because they violated public policy. In addition, by 1909, 28 states had enacted laws prohibiting ex ante contracts and such contracts were prohibited by the Wyoming constitution. Although states could have adopted laws allowing ex ante contracts, workers and unions lobbied against such efforts and in favor of workers' compensation under the belief that workers would have more leverage to negotiate benefits in the state legislature than with individual employers.

First, because workers' compensation benefits are seen as a replacement for untaxed tort awards that would otherwise be received by the worker, benefits are not considered income for the purposes of the federal income tax and are often exempt from state and local taxes. Second, the partial nature of these benefits serves a deductible function by reducing the economic incentive of workers to replace work with the receipt of benefits. There is generally a waiting period of several days before cash benefits begin, which serves as both a deductible provision and to keep the most minor injuries out of the workers' compensation system.

For example, under FECA, benefits for the loss of an arm are paid, by statute, for 312 weeks whereas benefits for the loss of a breast are paid, by regulation, for 52 weeks. Scheduled benefits for permanent partial disabilities are generally paid even if the beneficiary is able to work at full capacity.", "In its 2015 report on workers' compensation, ProPublica calculated the maximum benefits under scheduled awards in each state and the FECA program and found considerable differences in how much a worker can receive for permanent partial disabilities based on where he or she lives or works. These differences are due to different schedules of benefit durations and different maximum levels of compensation among the states. For example, for the loss of an arm, the national average maximum benefit was $169,878 in 2015. Maximum scheduled benefits for the loss of an arm ranged from $48,840 in Alabama to $859,634 in Nevada. These differences in maximum available benefits and permanent-partial award schedules should not be surprising given the decentralized nature of workers' compensation systems run by states without any federal mandates or standards as well as differences in average wages in the states, which are the basis for maximum and minimum benefits.", "As part of their budget requests for DOL, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama proposed changing the way permanent-partial benefits are paid under the FECA program. These proposals would have changed the current schedule of benefit durations to a system of lump-sum payments for permanent partial disabilities with all workers' receiving the same amounts regardless of pre-disability wages. ", "Coordination with Social Security", "A worker may receive disability benefits under both workers' compensation and the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. However, the combined amount of these benefits cannot exceed 80% of the worker's pre-disability wage in any month, with either the workers' compensation or SSDI benefits offset, depending on the state, to get the worker below the 80% threshold. Prior to 1981, states could elect whether to offset workers' compensation (\"reverse offset\") or SSDI benefits to get below the 80% threshold. However, pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, only those states with approved reverse offset plans in place as of February 18, 1981, may offset workers' compensation benefits to reach the 80% threshold. In all other states and the federal programs, SSDI benefits are offset when total benefits exceed 80% of the worker's pre-disability wage in month. ", "Because the workers' compensation-SSDI offset is based on total monthly benefits, any reduction in monthly workers' compensation benefits could result in an increase in SSDI benefits paid in states that offset SSDI. Thus, a reduction in workers' compensation benefits would shift some of the costs of providing income replacement for the injury or illness from the workers' compensation system to the Social Security system. In addition, policy changes that make it more difficult to receive workers' compensation benefits, such as changing the way disabilities are evaluated, or that make workers' compensation less attractive for injured workers, such as reducing workers' choice of treating physicians would likely shift workers away the workers' compensation system, leaving other social programs, such as Unemployment Insurance (UI), SSDI, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare, or Medicaid to make up for the income lost to disability. ", "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) claims that state workers' compensation policy changes have shifted the costs of workplace injuries away from workers' compensation. OSHA, citing a study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine , reports that workers' compensation only pays 21% of the cost of workplace injuries, with federal programs, such as SSDI, paying 11% of the costs. The study, however, only looked at cases over one year (2007) and thus cannot be used to measure the cost-shifting to federal programs that occurs as a result of changes in workers' compensation benefits and policies. In addition, when estimating costs associated with work injuries, the study cited by OSHA included indirect costs associated with work injuries, such as additional costs associated with home production activities, such as cooking and home modifications. However, workers' compensation has always been limited to providing partial-wage replacement and medical benefits, and has never paid, nor been intended to pay the indirect costs associated with workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths.", "Benefit Duration", "Workers' compensation systems vary in the maximum duration of permanent disability benefits. In the federal programs, and in 36 state programs, disability benefits can be paid for the duration of disability up to the life of the worker. In the remaining state systems, benefits are capped either by age, duration of receipt, or total amount of benefits received. Proponents of limiting the duration of benefits argue that the workers' compensation system is intended to replace lost wages and once a person reaches a certain age, it is unlikely that he or she would be working, even if not injured. Thus, there are no wages to be replaced. Others argue that workers sacrifice potentially larger tort awards that they could win in civil court and thus should not have their workers' compensation benefits arbitrarily limited. In addition, workers injured at young ages may not have sufficient pensions or savings to rely on when they get older and all workers may continue to bear costs associated with their disabilities even after state-mandated duration limits have been reached. ", "As part of their packages of FECA reforms, Presidents Bush and Obama proposed reducing FECA benefits at retirement age to encourage older beneficiaries to opt to receive their federal pension benefits rather than FECA. ", "Compromise and Release Settlements", "Compromise and release settlements are a key feature of state workers' compensation systems, but are not permitted under FECA. In a compromise and release settlement, the insurer agrees to provide the beneficiary with a lump-sum payment or structured series of payments in exchange for the worker forfeiting any future claims for medical or cash benefits against the insurer. In some cases, settlements may be limited to cover only future cash benefits or to allow for some future claims, and in others, settlements may be permitted to be reopened if there are material changes in the beneficiary's condition. However, in most cases, once the settlement has been reached and approved, the worker is no longer entitled to any benefits, regardless of what happens to his or her employment or health condition in the future. ", "Compromise and release settlements can serve as a mechanism to remove disputed claims from the state's adjudication process or the courts in much the same way that civil tort cases may be settled out of court. In addition, the insurer gets to clear the case off of its books and remove the uncertainty associated with possible future benefits. The beneficiary receives either a lump-sum payment or structure of payments, which can be used for injury-related expenses not covered or for unrelated expenses and removes the uncertainty associated with claims being disputed by the insurer. Because insurers will likely have more information on the claim's expected value, the insurer may be in an advantaged position over the worker when negotiating the settlement, which may result in the worker being worse off than had he or she continued with the claim through the normal adjudication process. ", "Administrative difficulties can arise in compromise and release settlements when administering SSDI offsets and Medicare set-asides. The SSDI offset is based on a comparison of monthly workers' compensation and SSDI benefits with the worker's monthly pre-disability wage. Because a lump-sum settlement replaces monthly benefits, the SSA must prorate the amount of the settlement attributable to cash benefits using an established proration rate as well as specific rules for each individual state, and it can be affected by how the projected life expectancy of the worker is treated in the settlement. ", "Medicare is the secondary payer to workers' compensation for work-related medical expenses, and workers. Because a compromise and release settlement generally releases the workers' compensation system from paying for any future medical expenses, a worker may improperly use Medicare to pay for these expenses. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recommends, but does not require, that workers' establish a Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-aside Arrangement (WCMSA) to dedicate a portion of the settlement to future medical costs so that Medicare is not improperly billed for these expenses. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survivors Benefits", "paragraphs": ["If a worker dies in the course of employment or as a result of an employment-related injury or illness, his or her survivors are entitled to workers' compensation benefits. These monthly benefits are generally equivalent to the monthly disability benefit the worker would have received. Because survivors benefits are intended to replace the worker's lost income used to support his or her dependents, generally, only the spouse and dependent children or other dependent family members, such as a dependent parent, are eligible for these benefits. Benefits generally stop when the spouse remarries or the dependent children reach adulthood. If there is no surviving spouse or dependents, survivors benefits are generally not paid to the estate or any other person. ", "In general, workers' compensation systems also provide a separate burial benefit or allowance in the case of covered deaths. This benefit is usually a lump-sum payment designed to partially offset the costs of the funeral or other final expenses related to the worker's death. Unlike survivors benefits, this benefit is generally paid even if the worker leaves behind no spouse or dependents.

To assist beneficiaries' return to work and departure from the workers' compensation rolls, vocational rehabilitation services are provided. Participation in vocational rehabilitation is generally voluntary.", "Although participation in vocational rehabilitation is voluntary, returning to work, even at a reduced capacity, is generally required if it is determined that the worker's condition permits at least a partial return to work. If a worker can only partially return to work, partial disability benefits are provided in addition to the pay the worker receives from employment. Employers are not required to hold a job open while a worker is receiving workers' compensation.
