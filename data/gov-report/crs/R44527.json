State unemployment taxes are deposited into the UTF and credited to the corresponding state account. State unemployment tax revenue is limited to paying each state's regular UC benefits and the state's half of EB costs.

As an incentive to comply with the framework, FUTA lowers the net federal unemployment tax to 0.6% if the state UC program follows the federal requirements. States must follow FUTA guidelines on what types of employment must be covered by UC; and state unemployment taxes on employers must meet FUTA's parameters. All states comply with these guidelines.
