The Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative, and the broader POWER Plus Plan of which it was a part, represent the U.S. government's efforts to ease the economic effects of energy transition in coal industry-dependent communities in the United States, and especially in Appalachia. Launched in 2015 by the Obama Administration as a multi-agency effort utilizing various existing programs, the POWER Plus plan received partial backing through appropriations for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016) to the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, and for abandoned mine land reclamation.", "While certain proposed provisions of POWER Plus were never enacted or funded, other elements of the POWER Initiative continue under the Trump Administration. Continuing programs include the Assistance to Coal Communities program within the Economic Development Administration, the POWER Initiative under the Appalachian Regional Commission (the only program to retain the original branding), and a funding program for abandoned mine land reclamation. Of these efforts, the Appalachian Regional Commission's POWER Initiative is the largest of the initiative's economic development programs, having funded nearly $150 million in projects (out of over $600 million in proposed projects) since it was first launched in FY2016. The Appalachian Regional Commission's POWER Initiative is regionally targeted to declining coal communities in Appalachia, unlike the Economic Development Administration's Assistance to Coal Communities program, which has a national scope. To date, the initiative has reportedly leveraged approximately $772 million of private investment into the Appalachian regional economy.

", "In response, the Obama Administration launched the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Plus Plan, which addressed the coal sector's decline through funding for (1) economic stabilization, (2) social welfare efforts, and (3) environmental efforts. The economic elements were organized within the POWER Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative to provide economic development funding and technical assistance to address economic distress caused by the effects of energy transition principally in coal communities.

In particular, the EIA forecasts coal to account for 24% of U.S. electric energy generation in 2019 and 2020, down from 28% in 2018. By 2050, coal is projected to decline to 17% of U.S. electricity generation, nuclear is projected to account for 12%, renewables 31%, and natural gas 39%, according to EIA projections. ", "Coal's decline is a function of market forces, particularly its higher cost relative to natural gas and renewable energy options. In the future, under current policies, coal's cost disadvantage is expected to continue, and could be accelerated if policies are adopted to reduce GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. Even with federal incentives to invest in carbon capture, utilization, and storage as a means to mitigate fossil fuel-related emissions, coal may still not be competitive in many situations. As a result of falling demand, noncompetitive coal producers and their communities are expected to face continued economic dislocation. ", "Should it wish to broaden or intensify federal efforts to address energy transition in local communities, Congress may have several options. In the past, Congress has demonstrated bipartisan interest in the federal government providing assistance to populations adversely affected by the ongoing energy transitions. It has done so through its appropriations for the ARC's POWER Initiative, the EDA's ACC program, and the AML investments. In combination with evidence of unmet demand for federal assistance, as measured by unfunded requests to the ARC ( Table 5 ), Congress may consider reviewing the balance among needs, appropriations, and effectiveness of past efforts. ", "Congress could conduct a review of the POWER Initiative and the efficacy of its performance and resources. This potential review suggests some particular considerations:", "Geography : While the ACC is available for the nation as a whole, the ARC's POWER Initiative is restricted to the ARC's service area in the Appalachian region. Congress may consider expanding the POWER Initiative to be available more broadly across the nation, or in a more targeted fashion as demonstrated by the ARC's program. Alternatively, funding could be made available nationwide to any eligible coal community, such as through other federal regional commissions and authorities and/or EDA regions. Funding : Projections of U.S. coal production (cited earlier) suggest that the ongoing transition in U.S. energy systems may lead to further localized economic distress without the development of new regional opportunities. Congress may consider the level of funding for POWER Initiative programs in the context of those economic needs. Funding levels could be tied to the overall scale of the challenge, allocated to areas with the greatest need, and made in consideration of data-driven evaluations of the program effectiveness. In assessing scale, Congress may consider macroeconomic factors as well as social and environmental policy objectives. Energy Type : Congress may also consider expanding the POWER Initiative program beyond the coal industry to other energy industries or regions perceived to be in decline. For example, economic strain and job losses following the closure of other electrical generating units, such as aging nuclear power plants, may signal additional types of displacement. EIA forecasts anticipate a modest decline in nuclear power generation by 2050 as older, less efficient reactors are retired. Nuclear-industry communities may face similar issues of economic distress and labor dislocation. Congress may also consider other public policy goals, such as reducing GHGs, to assist in promoting renewable energy types and carbon capture technologies. ", "Should Congress consider such efforts, the ARC's POWER Initiative program could serve as a potential model to be scaled or replicated as needed. In addition, other models have also been proposed in bills introduced in the 116 th Congress that would assist coal communities in transition.

The persistence of such programs suggests support among many policymakers for federal efforts to rectify, or at least attenuate, economic distress as a consequence of energy transition. In addition, were Congress to pursue policy efforts reflective of broadening concern for climate issues, a POWER Initiative-type program could be developed to also facilitate energy transition from fossil fuel-based energy sources to a mix of renewables and other alternatives.

More broadly, these mechanisms could also be purposed to facilitate federal resources for other related issues, such as related to ecological/environmental resilience and adaptation. ", "The POWER Initiative, as originally conceived or in its current form as a program of the ARC, has not been subjected to a formal evaluation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other research organization of its effectiveness as either a mechanism for alleviating community economic distress caused by the declining coal industry, or economic development more broadly. One recent GAO report mentioned the Assistance to Coal Communities program, but did not seek to analyze its activities or efficacy. Similarly, older GAO reports exist that feature the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program (prior to its current configuration), and the Appalachian Regional Commission, but may be of limited relevance when evaluating current programming, including more recent activities such as the POWER Initiative. Meanwhile, a number of anecdotal and media reports appear to tout the POWER Initiative's success and viability. The ARC, for its part, reports that the POWER Initiative has \"invested over $190 million in 239 projects touching 326 counties across Appalachia.\" According to the ARC, those investments are \"projected to create or retain more than 23,000 jobs, and leverage more than $811 million in additional private investment.\" ", "In the ARC's 2018 Performance and Accountability Report, the ARC reported that the annual outcome target for \"Students, Workers, and Leaders with Improvements\" in FY2018 was exceeded by 55% \"likely due to\" investments from the POWER Initiative; similarly, the ARC reported the outcome target for \"Communities with Enhanced Capacity\" in FY2018 was exceeded by 125%, \"due in part to priorities established for the POWER Initiative.\" The same report also noted that the ARC launched a new monitoring and evaluation effort on the POWER Initiative in September 2018 encompassing \"approximately 135 POWER grants\" in FY2015-FY2017.
