Voters were asked to answer two questions: (1) whether they wished to maintain Puerto Rico's current political status; and (2) regardless of the choice in the first question, whether they preferred statehood, independence, or to be a \"sovereign free associated state.\" According to results certified by the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission, approximately 54.0% of those who cast ballots answered \"no\" to the first question. In the second question, approximately 61.2% of voters chose statehood. The island's new governor and territorial legislature contend that the results were \"inconclusive.\"", "The plebiscite results are potentially significant if they are interpreted to mark the electorate's desire to change the island's present political status. The significance of the plebiscite remains to be seen, however, particularly because in the same election in which voters arguably endorsed a change in the status quo and favored statehood, they also voted out the pro-statehood incumbent governor and former Resident Commissioner, Luis Fortu\u00f1o, as well as majorities in the territorial legislature believed to be generally supportive of statehood. No change in Puerto Rico's political status could occur without congressional action.", "Events in 2013 suggest that Congress and policymakers in San Juan are considering how to assess the plebiscite and considering next steps. In Washington, on May 15, 2013, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi introduced H.R. 2000, a bill that proposes a second plebiscite in which voters could answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to a single question asking whether they desire statehood for Puerto Rico. The President's FY2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies budget request includes $2.5 million for voter education for such a \"federally sanctioned\" plebiscite. In San Juan, the new governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, and a May 14, 2013, concurrent resolution approved by the territorial legislature, contend that the November 2012 plebiscite results were \"inconclusive\" because a large number of voters chose not to answer the second status question. The governor and the concurrent resolution appear to suggest that if Puerto Rico's political status is to be reconsidered, various options should be available for discussion, including what some contend is an option called \"enhanced commonwealth,\" a position previously rejected by federal task forces spanning different presidential administrations.", "This report will be updated periodically as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress has considered Puerto Rico's \"political status\"\u2014a term of art referring to the relationship between the federal government and a territorial government\u2014for more than a century. As Figure 1 shows, Puerto Rico lies approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami and 1,500 miles from Washington, DC. Despite being far outside the continental United States, the island has played a unique role in American politics and policy since the United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898. It is the largest of the five major U.S. territories, hosts the biggest population, features heavy traffic and commerce with the mainland, and has long-standing ties with the U.S. military (both as a strategic location and home to service members).", "Beginning in 1900, Congress delegated authority over most local matters to a civilian territorial government. Over the next 50 years, Congress recognized a delegate to the U.S. House (the Resident Commissioner); granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship; and established a federal-style civilian government, including a popularly elected governor and Legislative Assembly. Whether the island should remain a territory, become a state, or become independent remains unsettled. Status is arguably the dominant issue in Puerto Rican politics, along which parties align and politics is organized. ", "For the first time since 1998, the people of Puerto Rico went to the polls in November 2012 to vote on whether to change their status and, if so, how. Although the 2012 plebiscite was a territorial initiative rather than a federal one, there could be notable implications for Congress. Most importantly, whether initiated by the Puerto Rican people or Congress, any change in the island's political status would require congressional action. Beyond the plebiscite, Congress has broad jurisdiction over territories and routinely monitors status developments. Some Members of Congress\u2014especially those with large Puerto Rican constituencies or personal connections to Puerto Rico\u2014also closely follow the issue. ", "This report provides a foundation for understanding Puerto Rico's status, why those on the island and in Washington continue to be interested in the issue, and how the 2012 plebiscite and its aftermath provides an opportunity to revisit status.

As discussed below, three major Puerto Rican parties dominate instead. At the federal level, positions on status do not necessarily follow clear partisan patterns. Co-sponsorship of status legislation, for example, may unite liberal Democrats with conservative Republicans on one bill, while creating different alliances on another. For those Members who have firm positions on status, personal preference or constituent issues appear to be key motivations. Particularly in recent years, members of both parties in Congress have generally argued that if the island is to choose a different status, clear consensus is necessary among the Puerto Rican people, regardless of the chosen option. ", "In Puerto Rico, politics tends to revolve around three status perspectives represented by the three most established political parties: ", "The status quo or \"pro-commonwealth\" position is generally associated with the Popular Democratic Party (PDP/PPD). The pro-statehood position is generally associated with the New Progressive Party (NPP/PNP). The independence position is generally associated with the Independence Party (PIP or Independistas ).Other options that call for modified versions of the current commonwealth status or independence may appeal to members of one or more parties. ", "Typically, the two major perspectives other than the status quo, statehood, or independence are (1) \"enhanced commonwealth\" and (2) \"free association.\" As discussed below, the former arguably signals a semi-autonomous status whereas the latter suggests independence with closer ties to the United States than a more traditional independence option. As noted elsewhere in this report, the viability of the \"enhanced commonwealth\" position is not universally accepted. ", "Views within the three major parties, as well as among other parties and interest groups, are not necessarily uniform. These differences regularly produce active factional groups or officially recognized minor parties. The PDP, NPP, and PIP nonetheless remain the most consistent partisan forces in Puerto Rican politics.

Congress recognized island authority over matters of internal governance in 1950 through the Federal Relations Act (FRA) and when it approved the island's Constitution in 1952. Some contend that these laws and other federal action afford Puerto Rico a unique status embodied in the \"commonwealth\" concept. This perspective remains a topic of debate. Nonetheless, federal law would have to be changed to alter Puerto Rico's status, which would require congressional and presidential approval through the normal legislative process. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico's political relationship with the United States is shaped by constitutional and statutory authority. The Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress \"Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" Congress has enacted various statutes to address specific matters concerning the island's political status. Puerto Rico's current political status, as determined by federal statute (or otherwise, as noted), is summarized briefly below.", "Spain ceded Puerto Rico (along with Guam and the Philippines) to the United States in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. The U.S. military initially administered the island thereafter. Congress established a civilian government in 1900. Among other points, the Foraker Act established an \"executive council\" consisting of a presidentially appointed civilian governor and various department heads. The new government also included a popularly elected House of Delegates (which shared decision-making power with the executive council) and a U.S.-style judiciary system. The Foraker Act also established the Resident Commissioner position to represent island interests in Washington. These duties came to include nonvoting service in the U.S. House of Representatives (the primary role of the Resident Commissioner today). Through the Jones Act (1917), Congress authorized appropriations for legislative staff and franking privileges for the Resident Commissioner. Devoted primarily to strengthening Puerto Rico's civil government, the Jones Act also extended U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans and established a bill of rights for the island. Congress recognized island authority over matters of internal governance in 1950 through the Federal Relations Act (FRA) and when it approved the island's Constitution in 1952. No major status changes have occurred since.", "After enactment of the FRA and approval of the Constitution, Puerto Rico became known formally as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Use of the word \"commonwealth\" and whether the term carries particular legal or political significance is a topic of substantial historical and scholarly debate\u2014most of which is beyond the scope of this report. A brief summary of the competing major perspectives, however, provides important context for understanding the ongoing status debate. ", "On one hand, some contend that Puerto Rico's commonwealth status signifies a unique recognition somewhere between territory and state. This perspective is often called \"enhanced commonwealth\" or \"new commonwealth.\" As prominent territories scholar Arnold H. Leibowitz has summarized, those holding this view have", "argued that more than local self-government was achieved by the 1950-1952 legislation. It contends that a new legal entity was created with a unique status in American law: the Commonwealth, a status which is an internationally recognized non-colonial status.... Most important, in this view, Commonwealth is not a \"territory\" covered by the 'Territory Clause' of the Constitution, nor quite obviously is it a state; rather, Commonwealth is sui generis and its judicial bounds are determined by a \"compact\" which cannot be changed without the consent of both Puerto Rico and the United States.", "Others, however, contend that, at least in the Puerto Rican context, the term \"commonwealth\" does not hold particular legal or political significance. From this viewpoint, \"commonwealth\" is a stylistic or historical term of art, as used in the formal names of states such as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Some also suggest that commonwealth refers to a form of government, but does not designate a unique non-territorial status. As Leibowitz has observed,", "From the outset the non-Commonwealth parties in Puerto Rico, seeking either Statehood or independence ... questioned the concept of the Commonwealth. They have argued that although Congress may delegate powers to a territorial government, the broad powers granted to Congress under the Territorial Clause of the Constitution and the implied powers of the national government remain and may be exercised should the need arise. Further they cite the legislative history of Public Law 600 [the FRA] to challenge the compact and Commonwealth concept.", "Debate over significance of the \"commonwealth\" term notwithstanding, action by Congress would be necessary to alter Puerto Rico's political status. Doing so, of course, would require passage of legislation by Congress and approval by the President.", "Finally, those rejecting the status quo also generally suggest that Puerto Rico's current status was not intended to be\u2014or perhaps should not be\u2014permanent, and that statehood or independence are natural next steps.

Those calling for congressional action had suggested that federal \"buy-in\" would increase a plebiscite's legitimacy and the chances for a resolution to the status issue. Efforts to call a plebiscite shifted back to Puerto Rico after H.R. 2499 stalled in Congress. In addition, former Resident Commissioner Luis Fortu\u00f1o (NPP) had returned to San Juan to assume the governorship in 2009. Governor Fortu\u00f1o urged the Legislative Assembly to authorize a plebiscite, essentially renewing the debate (but not necessarily the form) surrounding H.R. 2499 and building on similar efforts Mr. Fortu\u00f1o had undertaken while in Congress.

The bill would have authorized a two-step plebiscite somewhat similar to the one the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly authorized for 2012. Similar to question 1 in the 2012 plebiscite, the first plebiscite proposed in H.R. 2499 would have asked voters to choose between a status change and the status quo. If a majority of voters chose change in the first plebiscite, a second plebiscite would have presented a choice between independence, \"sovereignty in association with the United States,\" or statehood. The version passed by the House, as amended, would have added a fourth question to the second plebiscite, permitting voters to indicate a preference for maintaining commonwealth status. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on the measure, but it was not the subject of additional action in the chamber. The plebiscite approach proposed in H.R. 2499 during the 111 th Congress was substantially similar to H.R. 900 (Serrano), proposed in the 110 th Congress. Also during the 110 th Congress, Senator Salazar introduced S. 1936 , which proposed an alternative plebiscite mechanism. As an alternative to the plebiscite model, some legislation introduced in recent Congresses has proposed conventions in which Puerto Ricans could develop status proposals rather than choose among predetermined alternatives.
