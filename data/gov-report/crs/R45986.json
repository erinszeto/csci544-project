Chemical manufacturers have produced various types of PFAS for a range of commercial, industrial, and U.S. military applications since the 1940s. EPA identifies over 1,200 PFAS manufactured in the United States over time. The specific types and quantities of PFAS produced and used have varied over time and continue to change. ", "PFAS are not a single chemical or a single compound, but refer to a group of compounds that share similar chemical structures. Any compound that has the chemical structure of at least one carbon atom attached to two or more fluorine atoms, or a chain of at least two carbon atoms attached to two or more fluorine atoms, may be considered a PFAS. Individual PFAS vary in terms of the numbers of fluorinated carbon atoms. The extent to which a chain of carbon atoms is fluorinated would determine whether a chemical may be considered a perfluoroalkyl substance or a polyfluoroalkyl substance. Given the possible variations in the length of the carbon chain, number of fluorinated carbon atoms, and other atoms attached to the chain, PFAS potentially could include thousands of chemical compounds if every possible combination were created. ", "Industry and government sources indicate that manufacturers have focused on producing PFAS with longer fluorinated carbon chains, primarily because they reduce the surface tension of liquids and resist heat. Some longer chain PFAS have been used in chemical manufacturing processes to produce fluoropolymers designed for multiple consumer uses, including", "non-stick and heat-resistant coatings for cookware and food packaging, and treatment of clothing, leather, and other materials for soil, stain, and water resistance.", "In some cases, PFAS may be used only as a processing aid to create a fluoropolymer-based product, and in other cases, PFAS may be a constituent in the resulting product. Fluoropolymer-based products may therefore contain varying amounts of PFAS depending on the manufacturing process. Fluoropolymers containing specific types of PFAS may also break down into other PFAS depending on the conditions. ", "Some PFAS have also been used as an ingredient in a variety of products, including ", "fire suppressants in Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) used by U.S. military installations, other federal agencies, civilian airports, and local fire departments as Class B agents to extinguish petroleum-based liquid fuel fires; and suppressants of oxidizing mist in industrial metal plating operations.", "Such products generally contain relatively small concentrations of PFAS that require further dilution of the product for its intended use. For example, AFFF products that contain PFAS are designed to be diluted with water in their application to form an aqueous film that restricts oxygen to extinguish petroleum-based liquid fuel fires.", "Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and certain other related perfluoroalkyl substances accounted for most of the historical production of PFAS prior to their phase-out, discussed below in \"Regulation of PFAS in Commerce under TSCA.\" Manufacturers have transitioned away from these longer chain PFAS because of their potential toxicity and environmental persistence. Policymakers and stakeholders have continued to raise questions about the relative toxicity and persistence of shorter chain or less fluorinated PFAS in comparison to longer chain PFAS. Some policymakers and stakeholders have also expressed concern about the continued use and disposal of existing stocks of longer chain PFAS and products containing these chemicals, including the disposal of AFFF stocks by the federal government, civilian airport operators, and local fire departments, as they move to alternative firefighting foams."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Assessing Potential Risks", "paragraphs": ["Similar to other commercial chemicals, releases of PFAS may occur in multiple ways that could result in exposures. PFAS may be released from ", "chemical manufacturing or processing operations; intended uses (such as the application of AFFF as a fire extinguishing agent); disposal of products or wastes containing these chemicals; or accidental spills or other unexpected incidents.", "Occupational exposures may occur among workers in facilities that manufacture or process PFAS, among workers that use products containing these chemicals (such as firefighters that use AFFF), or among workers involved in disposal. ", "Exposures among the general public would depend on whether a release may move through the environment in a manner that an individual could come into contact with these chemicals. Exposures may also occur among individuals who use a product containing these chemicals. As with any chemical, potential risks to human health and the environment would depend on the properties of the specific PFAS, the conditions under which exposure may occur, and the characteristics of the exposed individual.", "How PFAS interact in the environment and in humans or animals would vary depending on the structure, toxicity, persistence, and other properties of the individual chemical. The breakdown rate of a particular chemical once released would determine how long it persists before reacting with other chemicals in the environment or in a human or animal that would produce new chemicals with different properties. Although some have characterized PFAS as \"forever chemicals,\" persistence varies among longer chain versus shorter chain PFAS, and among more fluorinated versus less fluorinated PFAS. Toxicity and potential health effects may also vary. Whereas persistence would affect how long the properties of the chemical remain intact, the potential risks associated with exposure would depend on the toxicity of the specific chemical, the exposure pathway and other exposure factors. Given this variability, evaluating the potential risks of all PFAS as a singular category presents scientific (and regulatory) challenges. ", "Similarly, regulating all PFAS as a singular category would present challenges in developing a singular risk-based standard (i.e., a singular concentration level). Because of the diversity of the potential universe of these chemicals, designating all PFAS as a singular category for regulatory or reporting purposes would also present challenges in implementation to identify which chemicals would be subject to applicable requirements.", "Studies of the potential human health and environmental effects of PFAS have focused on PFOA, PFOS, and certain other longer chain perfluoroalkyls because of their more predominant manufacture and use. Fewer studies have examined shorter chain perfluoroalkyls or polyfluoroalkyls. Although scientific understanding of the potential risks of these chemicals has been evolving, uncertainties remain about health effects that may be associated with exposures to various PFAS. Much of the attention among policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public has focused on drinking water sources. Studies of these chemicals have mostly focused on drinking water or contaminated food sources. Less is known about risks that may be associated with other exposure pathways, such as dermal contact or inhalation. ", "The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and EPA have developed guidelines for assessing chemical exposure risks under various agency programs.

Each of these guidelines outlines factors to evaluate potential risks that may be associated with exposure to a specific chemical, including ", "toxicity and other properties of the chemical; frequency, concentration, and duration of exposure (i.e., the dose); pathway of exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact); interaction with other chemicals that may be present in the environment; and age, overall health, and genetic and behavioral characteristics of the exposed individual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Actions to Address Potential Risks of PFAS", "paragraphs": ["Federal actions to address potential risks from PFAS have primarily been taken under the authorities of TSCA, SDWA, and CERCLA.

TSCA also requires manufacturers to notify EPA of the intent to produce any new PFAS. When information on potential risks is insufficient, EPA has issued orders that restrict the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, disposal or any combination of these activities pending the development of new information on risks. EPA has used information on PFAS gathered under TSCA to inform its actions under SDWA and CERCLA. ", "For over a decade, EPA has been evaluating PFOA and PFOS under SDWA to determine whether an enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water provided by public water systems may be warranted. EPA has also included four other PFAS among emerging contaminants being evaluated for potential regulation under SDWA. In 2009, EPA issued provisional health advisories for short-term exposures to PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. In 2016, EPA issued additional health advisories for exposures to these chemicals in drinking water over an individual's lifetime. These health advisories are not enforceable standards for public water systems.

The House Committee on Armed Services directed DOD to provide a status update, in its report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ). DOD identified 401 U.S. military installations with known or suspected releases of PFOA or PFOS from the use of AFFF. DOD detected PFOA or PFOS in groundwater wells above the EPA Lifetime Health Advisory of 70 ppt at 90 of these installations. DOD identified planned actions at these installations under the CERCLA site response process, subject to annual appropriations and prioritization of funding among eligible sites.

As with many other types of wastes, incineration and landfilling have been the two principal methods of disposal available for wastes containing PFAS. Incineration offers the potential to reduce the toxicity and volume of wastes, but generates air emissions and combustion residuals that necessitate disposal. Determining what temperatures are necessary to break down PFAS and ensuring that potential combustion byproducts are acceptable also have been issues for incineration. Wastewater discharges or sludge from industrial facilities and sewage treatment plants may contain PFAS depending on the constituency of the waste source. As industry transitions to shorter chain PFAS, some policymakers and stakeholders have also expressed concern about the disposal of existing stocks of longer chain PFAS and products containing these chemicals. For example, DOD, other federal agencies, civilian airport operators, and local fire departments face disposal needs for existing stocks of AFFF as they transition to alternatives. Waste streams generated from the treatment of PFAS in drinking water, or the remediation of PFAS contamination, also necessitate disposal.", "The disposal of PFAS wastes is regulated under multiple federal and state laws. EPA has not promulgated contaminant-specific standards for the disposal of PFAS to date. The disposal of PFAS wastes has been regulated similarly to other types of wastes for which contaminant-specific standards are not established. Although not presently listed as hazardous wastes, the disposal of PFAS wastes in landfills would generally be subject to RCRA Subtitle D solid waste criteria considering the breadth of the definition of \"solid waste\" in applying to garbage, refuse, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, and other discarded material. Incineration facilities are also subject to RCRA for the disposal of combustion residuals, and to hazardous air pollutants standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Whereas these CAA standards are not specific to PFAS, some of them apply to related chemicals that may be created during combustion, such as hydrogen fluoride. Although EPA has not established effluent limitations or pretreatment standards for PFAS in wastewater, the Clean Water Act generally requires permits for the discharge of any pollutant into U.S. waters.", "Section 330D of House-passed H.R. 2500 would require DOD to ensure that PFAS is eliminated and not emitted into the air when using incineration to dispose of AFFF or other materials containing these chemicals. This House provision would also require DOD to ensure that applicable CAA requirements are met, the selected incineration facility has not violated the CAA within the past 12 months, and AFFF or other PFAS materials designated for disposal are stored in accordance with RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste requirements. As a practical matter, DOD would be required to select incinerators designed for hazardous wastes that operate at temperatures sufficient to destroy carbon and fluorine bonds in PFAS. However, Section 330D would not designate PFAS as hazardous waste.", "The PFAS Waste Incineration Ban Act of 2019 ( H.R. 2591 ) would require EPA to promulgate regulations no later than six months after enactment that would prohibit the use of incineration to dispose of AFFF containing PFAS. H.R. 2591 would also require EPA to promulgate regulations no later than one year after enactment to identify other categories of PFAS wastes for which incineration would be prohibited if necessary to protect human health and the environment, and to review and revise these waste categories at least every four years. If incineration were prohibited, landfilling could increase if other disposal methods do not become more widely available.", "For wastewater discharges, Section 330A of House-passed H.R. 2500 would require EPA to list PFAS as toxic pollutants under the Clean Water Act within 30 days of enactment, and to establish effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for PFAS no later than January 1, 2022."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition to Fluorine-Free Class B Firefighting Foams", "paragraphs": ["DOD has revised its Military Specification for AFFF as a step in its transition away from the use of Class B firefighting foams containing PFOA and PFOS.

DOD subsequently revised MIL-F-24385 for various purposes in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and on September 7, 2017, under MIL-PRF-24385F to address the amount of PFOA and PFOS and other criteria. DOD guidelines generally require reviews of Military Specifications at least once every five years. The next scheduled review of MIL-PRF-24385F is September 6, 2022. DOD issued a similar version of this Military Specification for the Naval Sea Systems Command on May 7, 2019. Both versions specify AFFF containing fluorocarbon surfactants for use as Class B fire extinguishing agents, but restrict the content of PFOA or PFOS to 800 parts per billion (ppb) or micrograms per liter. Neither version limits the content of other PFAS. Previous versions stated that AFFF must contain \"fluorocarbon surfactants\" but did not restrict the concentration of any PFAS.", "Section 6.6 of both the September 2017 version and the May 2019 version include the following DOD policy statement on the long-term objective to transition to the use of fluorine-free AFFF:", "The DoD's goal is to acquire and use a non-fluorinated AFFF formulation or equivalent firefighting agent to meet the performance requirements for DoD critical firefighting needs. The DoD is funding research to this end, but a viable solution may not be found for several years. In the short term, the DoD intends to acquire and use AFFF with the lowest demonstrable concentrations of two particular PFAS; specifically PFOS and PFOA. The DoD intends to be open and transparent with Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state regulators, and the public at large regarding DoD efforts to address these matters. AFFF manufacturers and vendors are encouraged to determine the levels of PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS in their products and work to drive these levels toward zero while still meeting all other military specification requirements.", "DOD has funded the research and development of fluorine-free AFFF under its Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP). In June 2018, DOD issued a report examining the status of alternatives to AFFF that contain PFOA and PFOS, and the plans of DOD for the phase-out and disposal of its existing stocks of AFFF that contain these chemicals. The report also discussed projects funded under SERDP and ESTCP. Section 1059 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ) required DOD to issue this report to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services. House-passed H.R. 2500 includes multiple provisions related to phasing out the use of AFFF for land-based application at U.S. military installations and replacement with fluorine-free foams. Senate-passed S. 1790 also includes a phase-out provision for land-based application at U.S. military installations.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been using the DOD Military Specification for AFFF as criteria for civilian airport operators to demonstrate compliance with certification requirements for Class B fire extinguishing agents.

Federal safety standards for milk have generally been established in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.", "The FDA has examined multiple ways in which PFAS may become present in foods:", "PFAS may be present in dairy milk and dairy products from livestock that consume contaminated water. PFAS similarly may be present in meat from livestock that consume contaminated water. PFAS may be present in food crops if grown in contaminated soils or irrigated with contaminated water sources. PFAS may be present in fish and shellfish from contaminated water bodies. Food contact applications (e.g., cookware, food packaging, and processing) that contain PFAS are another potential source of contamination in foods.", "These situations are not unique to PFAS. They may present potential pathways of human exposure to any contaminant present in the environment that may interact with foods or that may be present in food contact applications. The uptake of PFAS or other chemicals in food would depend on the properties of the specific chemical, the conditions in which interaction with food occurs, and potentially other factors. As with drinking water, potential risks from PFAS or other contaminants in food would depend on the toxicity of the specific chemical, the conditions of exposure, and the characteristics of the exposed individual.", "The FDA has been assessing PFAS in foods from specific sites where PFAS contamination has been detected, certain foods with an increased likelihood of PFAS contamination not associated with specific sites, and foods more generally. The FDA has also regulated the uses of PFAS in food contact applications, and has been reviewing these regulations as more information becomes available. The FDA has generally found no or relatively low concentrations of PFAS in the foods that it has sampled. The FDA concluded that the sampled foods with detectable concentrations of PFAS were low enough not to present a human health concern. Of dairy milk sampled, FDA found elevated levels of certain PFAS in milk produced from livestock that consumed water from a contaminated well at a dairy farm in New Mexico. The FDA reports that the contaminated milk was discarded and did not enter the food supply.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided financial assistance to this affected New Mexico dairy farm through the Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) for removing the contaminated milk from the commercial market. The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has also been examining blood and tissue samples from the contaminated livestock.

The EPA lifetime health advisories of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water are derived from this RfD, but are not intended for addressing other exposure scenarios. EPA did not recommend 70 ppt as an acceptable concentration of PFOA or PFOS individually or combined in milk or other foods.", "EPA stated in November 2016 that these health advisories \"only apply to exposure scenarios involving drinking water\" and \"are not appropriate for use in identifying risk levels for ingestion of food sources, including: fish, meat produced from livestock that consumes contaminated water, or crops irrigated with contaminated water.\" In a November 2016 agency memorandum, EPA also clarified these health advisories in relation to food:", "In the development of the health advisories, EPA took into consideration sources of exposure to PFOA and PFOS other than drinking water, including: air, food, dust, and consumer products. Thus, to be protective of exposure, the calculation of the health advisory accounts for the relative exposure to PFOA and PFOS from a variety of sources, including food. Calculation of specific risk levels for foods would require development of entirely different exposure assumptions and is not a part of the HA [health advisory] derivation methodology.", "Multiple bills in the 116 th Congress would address agricultural uses of water contaminated with PFAS, including provisions in the FY2020 NDAA bills.
