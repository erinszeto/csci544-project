Its purposes include addressing specific concerns such as national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the research funded by the federal government is in support of specific activities of the federal government as reflected in the unique missions of the funding agencies. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease.", "In February 2008, President Bush requested $147.0 billion for R&D in FY2009, a 2.7% increase over FY2008 R&D funding which was estimated to be $143.1 billion.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) classified $2.175 billion of the DHS advance appropriation as R&D facilities construction in FY2009. Some have questioned the appropriateness of classifying these funds as R&D facilities and equipment since the funds appear to be intended for product acquisition rather than research, development, or facilities construction. This advance appropriation accounted for more than half of the net increase in R&D funding in President Bush's FY2009 budget request.", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, including the Bush Administration's omission of Congressionally directed spending from the FY2009 budget request, inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of R&D, and the apparent mis-categorization of some funding in President Bush's request. As a result of these and other factors, the R&D agency figures reported by OMB (and shown in Table 1 ) may differ somewhat from those agency budget analyses that appear later in this report.", "Another complicating factor for FY2009 is the inclusion of funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment, and related activities in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) in addition to funding provided to agencies in P.L. 110-329 and P.L. 111-8 .

The Defense Health Program supports the delivery of health care to DOD personnel and their families. Program funds are requested through the Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The program's RDT&E funds support Congressionally directed research in such areas as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program are requested through the Army Procurement appropriation. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund also contains additional RDT&E monies. However, the fund does not contain an RDT&E line item as do the two programs mentioned above. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office, which now administers the fund, tracks (but does not report) the amount of funding allocated to RDT&E. Typically, Congress has funded each of these programs in Title VI (Other Department of Defense Programs) of the defense appropriations bill.", "RDT&E funds have also been requested and appropriated as part of DOD's separate funding to support what the Bush Administration termed the Global War on Terror (GWOT). Congress has appropriated these funds in response to emergency supplemental requests and under a separate GWOT request. GWOT-related requests/appropriations often include funds for a number of transfer funds. These include the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund (MRAPVF). Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds, and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other baseline accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion. GWOT-related RDT&E funding is shown in Table 7 . Note that while these GWOT-related appropriations may be distributed to baseline program elements, they are accounted for separately.", "For FY2009, the Bush Administration requested $79.6 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E, roughly $2.5 billion more than Congress appropriated for Title IV in FY2008. The FY2009 requests for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program were $194 million and $269 million, respectively. The Bush Administration also submitted an FY2008 Global War on Terror Pending request (i.e., a supplemental request), which included $2.9 billion for RDT&E. During the FY2008 appropriations deliberations, Congress only approved a portion of the Bush Administration's FY2008 GWOT request. The Bush Administration requested the FY2008 GWOT Pending supplemental in hopes of receiving the balance of that earlier request. The Bush Administration also made a FY2009 GWOT \"Bridge\" request in March. This additional request included $379 million in classified RDT&E. By requesting bridge funding, the administration hoped to have ready GWOT-related emergency funds at the beginning of the fiscal year (in October) should the passage of the baseline defense appropriations be delayed.", "Since FY2001, funding for RDT&E in Title IV has increased from $42 billion to $80 billion in FY2009. In constant FY2009 dollars, the increase is roughly 60%. Historically, RDT&E funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars, dating back to 1948. Congress has appropriated more for RDT&E than has been requested, every year, since FY1996.", "RDT&E funding can be broken out in a couple of ways. Each of the military departments request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported).Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced development) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represents the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities.", "Congress is particularly interested in S&T funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Assuring adequate support for S&T activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. This was of particular concern at a time when defense budgets and RDT&E funding were falling at the end of the Cold War. As part of its 2001 Quadrennial Review, DOD established a goal of stabilizing its baseline S&T funding (i.e., Title IV) at 3% of DOD's overall funding. Congress has embraced this goal. The FY2009 S&T funding request in Title IV was $11.5 billion, about $1.3 billion less than what Congress appropriated for S&T in Title IV in FY2008 (not counting S&T funding requested as part of the GWOT request or S&T's share of the general reduction made to Title IV in the FY2008 appropriations bill). Furthermore, the S&T request for Title IV was approximately 2.2% of the overall baseline DOD budget request (not counting funds for the Global War on Terror), short of the 3% goal. The ability of DOD to meet its 3% goal has been strained in recent years as the overall Defense budget continues to rise.", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research, when compared to the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and material science). The FY2009 request for basic research ($1.7 billion) was roughly $65 million more than what Congress appropriated for Title IV basic research in FY2008.", "Congress passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-252 ) on June 30, 2008. Title IX of the act provided supplemental funding for the Department of Defense and the Global War on Terror. See Table 7 . Chapter 1 of Title IX addressed the GWOT Pending request and Chapter 2 of Title IX addressed the FY2009 GWOT Bridge request. Congress did not provide all the RDT&E funding requested in the FY2008 GWOT Pending request for the departments and defense agencies, but added RDT&E funds for the Defense Health Program. In addition, Congress directed a general reduction of the RDT&E funds provided. Congress provided the requested level of RDT&E in the Bridge request, plus $9 million more for the Air Force. The act also provided a $2.5 billion for the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, $2 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, and $1.7 billion for the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund, from which the Secretary may transfer funds into RDT&E.", "Congress passed a FY2009 defense appropriations as part of the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 101-329 , Division C). The bill provided $80.5 billion for Title IV RDT&E. This included $13.5 billion for S&T, of which $1.8 billion was for basic research (i.e. approximately $100 million more for basic research than was requested). Section 8101 reduced Title IV funding by $218 million to account for revised economic assumptions. In addition, Congress provided $903 million for RDT&E within the Defense Health Program (including $150 million and $80 million for peer-reviewed breast and prostate cancer research, respectively) and $289 million for RDT&E within the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. ", "On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 , see Table 8). The House version of H.R. 1 provided DOD $350 million to support RDT&E directed at improving energy generation, transmission, regulation, use and storage, for military installations, military vehicles, and other military equipment. The House bill did not specify which programs should be funded. The Senate version of H.R. 1 , per S.Amdt. 570 , provided $200 million within the Defensewide RDT&E account. S.Rept. 111-3 , the report accompanying the earlier Senate version ( S. 336 ), stipulated that the $200 million go to the Manufacturing Technology Program to help transition and demonstrate energy efficient technologies including fuel cells and solar cells. The Senate bill appeared directed at the program element 0603680D8Z, which in FY2009 received $18 million. The Senate bill would have appropriated an order of magnitude more for this program than what it already received in FY2009, raising the issue of whether such an increase could have been accommodated efficiently. The final version of the bill P.L. 111-5 followed the House version, but reduced the funding to $300 million. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to report on how the funds were used and the progress made in achieving the goals of the funding.", "Part of the debate over the stimulus bill was whether the funds provided should focus on near-term job retention or formation or whether they can also be used as a down payment in a longer term transition toward a more energy independent, efficient, and green economy. It would appear that the appropriations provided here are in keeping with the latter.", "On April 9, 2009, the Obama Administration sent to Congress a supplemental request for additional FY2009 funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the Obama Administration is inclined not to use the term Global War on Terror, the supplemental is shown in Table 7 since it is directed specifically at the two wars. The House passed its version of the bill ( H.R. 2346 ) on May 14, 2009. The Senate passed its version, S. 1054 , on May 21 ( S.Rept. 111-20 ).The Administration requested $810 million in Title IV RDT&E funds, the House provided $722 million, and the Senate recommended $886 million. The funds would be used to accelerate the development, testing, and demonstration of technologies and equipment needed in both wars. In addition, the Administration requested $34 million in RDT&E funding within the Defense Health Program for research in information technologies in support of Wounded, Ill, and Injured program. The House provided $201 million, $168 million of which is directed toward additional research in traumatic brain injuries, psychological health, and orthopedics. The Senate recommended the requested level of $34 million. As the total figures indicate, there are some substantial differences between the House and Senate version. For example, the House sought to zero the Manned Reconnaissance Systems request of the Navy, the Senate sought to increase the request by $26 million.

The regular appropriations for the agency are part of Division F of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( H.R. 1105 , P.L. 111-8 , March 11, 2009). Funding in the omnibus act for NIH totals $30.253 billion at the program level, which is $933 million (3.2%) above the comparable level for FY2008 (see Table 10 ). The increase is the largest NIH has received in the last six years. Emergency supplemental appropriations were provided in Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), also called the economic stimulus bill ( H.R. 1 , P.L. 111-5 , February 17, 2009). ARRA provided an additional $10.0 billion directly to NIH plus $400 million more through a transfer (see Table 11 and further discussion of the stimulus funding later in this section). The total funding from both laws for FY2009 amounts to $40.653 billion, an increase of $11.333 billion (38.7%) over FY2008. Unlike regular annual appropriations, ARRA funds are available for two years, through the end of FY2010.", "Regular appropriations are discussed first. President George W. Bush's FY2009 request for $29.165 billion for NIH was about level with the original FY2008 amount. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 , December 26, 2007) had provided a total of $29.171 billion. Later, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-252 , enacted June 30, 2008) gave NIH an additional $150 million, bringing the FY2008 program level total to $29.321 billion, 1.0% above FY2007. The FY2009 request was $155 million below the FY2008 enacted program level (-0.5%). In Table 10 , FY2008 amounts are shown with the supplemental appropriations. In the discussion below, however, most references are to FY2008 funding levels prior to the supplemental appropriations, since the FY2009 request and committee actions by the 110 th Congress were based on the original FY2008 amounts.", "NIH's funding comes primarily from the annual appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS), with an additional amount for Superfund-related activities from the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Interior/Environment). Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. In addition, NIH receives $150 million annually from separate legislation funding diabetes research, and $8.2 million from a transfer within the Public Health Service (PHS). NIH loses part of its appropriation to a transfer to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The transfer was about $100 million for several years, then increased to about $300 million in FY2008 and FY2009. In Table 10 , the total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of add-ons and transfers, is called the program level.", "In congressional action by the 110 th Congress on the FY2009 request, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3230 ( S.Rept. 110-410 ) on July 8, 2008, recommending a program level total of $30.113 billion for NIH within the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. Although the committee did not take action on the FY2009 Interior/ Environment bill, funding of approximately $78 million for the NIH Superfund account might have been projected based on previous years. The NIH program level total recommended by the Senate committee would then have been about $30.191 billion, some $1.02 billion (3.5%) over the original FY2008 amount and $870 million (3.0%) over the revised FY2008 level.", "During the 110 th Congress, the full House Appropriations Committee did not take final action on either its FY2009 Labor/HHS bill or its FY2009 Interior/Environment bill. On June 19, 2008, the House Labor/HHS subcommittee reported a draft bill to the full committee that recommended program level funding of $30.238 billion for NIH, $125 million more than the Senate committee amount. The total NIH program level, again assuming $78 million for the Superfund account, might have been projected at approximately $30.316 billion, some $1.145 billion (3.9%) over the original FY2008 total amount and $995 million (3.4%) over the revised FY2008 level.", "In this decade, the peak of NIH's purchasing power was in FY2003, when Congress completed a five-year doubling of the NIH budget. Congress provided NIH with annual increases in the range of 14%-15% each year from FY1999 through FY2003. From FY2004 to FY2008, increases were between 1%-3% each year, except that the FY2006 total was a 0.3% decrease. In February 2008, President Bush requested no increase for NIH for FY2009, while the advocates in the research community recommended a 6.5% increase. The projected inflation rate for medical research prices was 3.5% for both FY2008 and FY2009 at that time. In inflation-adjusted terms (converting all amounts to constant 2008 dollars), the FY2008 funding level represented an estimated 10.7% decrease in purchasing power from the FY2003 peak, and the FY2009 request level was 14.1% below FY2003. Applying the same calculations to final FY2009 funding levels, the regular NIH appropriations provided in the omnibus act were 10.9% below the FY2003 level, and the total FY2009 funding level from the omnibus plus the stimulus represented a 19.7% increase over the FY2003 level.", "The agency's organization consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The institutes and centers (collectively called ICs) focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support. Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. As shown in Table 10 , Congress provides a separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to a buildings and facilities account. (The other three centers, not included in the table, are funded through the NIH Management Fund, financed by taps on other NIH appropriations.)", "President Bush's FY2009 budget proposal gave most of the institutes and centers approximately level funding from their original FY2008 amounts, requesting increases of 0.1% or 0.2%. President Bush requested increases greater than 0.5% only for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR, 1.0%) and the National Library of Medicine (NLM, 0.8%). The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House Labor/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee recommended increases of about 3% and 3.5%, respectively, for most of the ICs compared to the original FY2008 levels. Funding in the omnibus act provided increases of nearly 3% for most of the ICs, with some exceptions. NCRR received a $72 million (6.3%) increase, mostly for clinical research training. NLM was increased 2.4%, the environmental health institute increased 1.7%, and the genome research institute decreased by 0.6%.", "The two biggest changes proposed in the request were a 5.6% increase in the Buildings and Facilities (B&F) account, and a 4.7% drop in funding for the Office of the Director. Many of the laboratories, animal facilities, and office buildings on the NIH campus are aging, and are in need of upgrading to stay compliant with health and safety guidelines and to provide the proper infrastructure for the Intramural Research program. The budget requested $126 million for Buildings and Facilities, an increase of $7 million. The House subcommittee agreed with that amount, while the Senate committee recommended $147 million, an increase of $28 million (23%). Final funding in the omnibus was at the requested level of $126 million, a 5.6% increase over FY2008. As discussed later, however, the stimulus bill provided supplemental funding of $500 million for NIH B&F activities.", "In the request, the net $52 million drop in the OD account, from $1,109 million in FY2008 to $1,057 million, represented the proposed cancellation of a study combined with increases for several other OD activities. The National Children's Study was funded at $111 million in FY2008. It is a long-term (25+ year), multi-agency environmental health study that was mandated by the Children's Health Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-310 ). The overall projected cost for the whole study is about $2.7 billion. Starting with the FY2007 request, when the study moved from the planning phase to the more costly implementation phase, the Bush Administration proposed each year to end its funding. Congress has continued to support the study. Both committees and the final language in the omnibus appropriations act included FY2009 funding of up to $192 million for the study, an increase of $81 million (73%).", "President Bush proposed increases within the OD account totaling $59 million, including a $38 million increase (7.7%) for the NIH Roadmap initiatives funded through the Common Fund. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research is a set of trans-NIH research activities designed to support high-risk/high-impact research in emerging areas of science or public health priorities. For FY2009, President Bush requested $534 million for the Roadmap/Common Fund, up from $496 million in FY2008. In S. 3230 , the Senate committee recommended $568 million for the Common Fund (a $73 million increase), and boosted overall funding for the OD account to $1,275 million, an increase of $166 million (15%). In its draft bill, the House subcommittee recommended $544 million for the Common Fund (a $49 million increase) within overall funding of $1,255 million for the OD account, an increase of $146 million (13%). The final amounts in the omnibus were higher than the request but lower than either committee allowance: $1,247 million for OD overall, an increase of $135 million (12.2%), and $541 million for the Common Fund, an increase of $46 million (9.2%).", "The other major increase in the request for OD was an additional $19 million (19.9%) for research on medical countermeasures against nuclear, radiological, and chemical threats, increasing that program to $113 million from $94 million in FY2008. That was the only significant increase for NIH's biodefense portfolio, which totaled $1,748 million in the FY2009 request (up 1.2%). The House subcommittee included $100 million for countermeasures research, the Senate committee did not discuss it, and the explanatory statement accompanying the omnibus bill indicated the research was funded at $97 million.", "NIH has two major concerns in the face of the tight budgets it has experienced for several years: maintaining support of investigator-initiated research through research project grants, and expanding the supply of new investigators. Total funding for research project grants (RPGs), at $15.5 billion in the FY2009 request, represents about 53% of NIH's budget. The FY2009 request proposed to support an estimated 38,257 awards, about the same number as projected in FY2008 before the supplemental. Within that total, 9,757 awards would have been competing RPGs, 14 fewer than in FY2008. (\"Competing\" awards means new grants plus competing renewals of existing grants.) The Senate committee estimated that its funding level would have supported 10,471 competing RPGs, while the House subcommittee level would have supported 10,812. The explanatory statement on the omnibus offered no comparable estimates. The request proposed that no inflationary increases be paid for noncompeting (continuation) RPGs, and that the average annual cost of competing RPGs remain at the FY2008 level, about $361,000. The House subcommittee and the omnibus explanatory statement included an average 2% increase for both new and continuing grants; the Senate report did not specify average costs. Under the request, the expected \"success rate\" of applications receiving funding would have declined to about 18% from the estimated rate of 19% for FY2008 (pre-supplemental). Estimated success rates for the various ICs would have ranged from 8% to 26%. The appropriators did not comment on expectations for success rates. Funding from the stimulus should allow an improvement in the rates, but much of that funding will be concentrated on short-term projects.", "Several NIH efforts are focused on supporting new investigators to encourage young scientists to undertake careers in research and to help them speed their transition from training to independent research. The request proposed that the Pathway to Independence program support approximately 500 awardees, including 170 new awards, for a total of $71 million. The request proposed an increase of $5 million (0.6%) to $786 million for regular training mechanisms such as the National Research Service Awards, including stipend increases of 1% for both pre- and post-doctoral fellows. Clinical research training, including the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), would have been funded at a total of $475 million. The request proposed to support about 25 New Innovator Awards for a total of $56 million in the Common Fund. The NIH Director's Bridge Award is a program that can give short-term funding to established, meritorious investigators who have just missed the funding cutoff for a renewal application and who have little other support, giving them time to resubmit without disrupting the operation of their laboratory. The request included $91 million for 244 awards, an increase of $1.6 million. In 110 th Congress action, both the Senate committee and the House subcommittee specifically mentioned support for most of these initiatives, as well as others; both included funding increases beyond the request for the New Innovator Awards. The explanatory statement on the omnibus appropriations mentioned the following specific amounts: $35 million for Transformative Research Project Grants, $80 million through the Common Fund for New Innovators Awards, $41 million through the Common Fund for the Director's Pioneer Awards, and $24 million for the rare and neglected diseases initiative. The CTSA program received $475 million, $53 million from the Common Fund, and $422 million from NCRR.", "Changes proposed in the request for other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget included increased support for research centers, up $20 million to $2,963 million; a $33 million increase to $3,275 million for R&D contracts, including $5 million additional for the Global HIV/AIDS Fund; $50 million more for the NIH intramural research program, for a total of $3,119 million; an increase of $20 million to a total of $1,361 million for research management and support; and a decrease of $23 million for other research grants totaling $1,786 million.", "NIH and three of the other Public Health Service agencies within HHS are subject to a budget \"tap\" called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 238j) authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to assess the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify ways to improve them. The tap has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds among PHS and other HHS agencies. The FY2009 appropriation kept the tap at 2.4%, the same as in FY2008. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, and is a relatively minor recipient. By convention, budget tables such as Table 10 do not subtract the amount of the evaluation tap, or of other taps within HHS, from the agencies' appropriations.

The appropriations will be available for spending over two years and thus will supplement NIH's regular appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010. NIH says that it expects to spend as much as possible in FY2009. Table 11 compares the NIH-related funding provided in the ARRA conference report ( H.Rept. 111-16 ) with the recommendations in the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1 .", "ARRA added significant funding to several NIH accounts for biomedical research and research facilities, providing a total of $10 billion. In addition, the law appropriated funds to the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) for comparative effectiveness research, of which $400 million was designated for transfer to NIH. Of the $10 billion, the law provided $8.2 billion to the Office of the Director for support of NIH extramural and intramural research. Most of that funding, $7.4 billion, is for transfer to the ICs and the Common Fund in proportion to their regular appropriations. The remaining $800 million is available for use at the Director's discretion, with an emphasis on short-term (two-year) projects, including $400 million that may be used under the Director's flexible research authority to implement Roadmap projects. Also included in the $10 billion total was $1 billion to the National Centers for Research Resources for grants to construct and renovate university research facilities, as well as $300 million to NCRR for grants for shared instrumentation and other capital research equipment at extramural research facilities. Finally, ARRA added $500 million to the B&F account to construct, repair, and improve NIH intramural facilities.", "NIH's plans for the ARRA funding are being tracked on the NIH Recovery website. On a page about current grant funding opportunities, NIH says: \"While NIH Institutes and Centers have broad flexibility to invest in many types of grant programs, they will follow the spirit of the ARRA by funding projects that will stimulate the economy, create or retain jobs, and have the potential for making scientific progress in 2 years.\" They expect to focus activities on funding new and recently peer reviewed, highly meritorious research grant applications that can be accomplished in two years or less; giving targeted supplemental awards to current grants to push research forward; and supporting a new initiative called the NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research (at least $200 million to fund 200 or more grants) for research on specific topics that would benefit from significant two-year jumpstart funds. Announcements soliciting applications for the NCRR construction/renovation grants and the instrumentation grants have also been posted.", "At the end of the 109 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed on the first NIH reauthorization statute enacted since 1993, the NIH Reform Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-482 ). The law made managerial and organizational changes in NIH, focusing on enhancing the authority and tools for the NIH Director to do strategic planning, especially to facilitate and fund cross-institute research initiatives. The measure authorized, for the first time, overall funding levels for NIH, although not for the individual ICs, and established a \"common fund\" for trans-NIH research.

See Table 12 for details. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 (Division A of P.L. 110-329 ) provided funding for continuing DOE activities at the FY2008 rate through March 6, 2009; this was extended to March 11, 2009, by P.L. 111-6 . The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included at least an additional $6.4 billion for R&D and related programs as passed by the House, at least an additional $7.578 billion as passed by the Senate, and at least an additional $7.9 billion as enacted.

This unusually large increase reflected the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), which President Bush announced in the 2006 state of the union address. Over 10 years, the ACI would double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies. Congress set even faster growth targets in the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ), establishing authorization levels that would double R&D funding for these agencies in seven years. The percentage increase in the Bush Administration's FY2009 request for the Office of Science was higher than what would be required on an annual basis to reach the ACI doubling target. This was also the case in FY2007 and FY2008, but although the House and Senate bills for those years would have provided increases even relative to the request, the final appropriations were lower than the ACI amount. For FY2009, the House committee recommended $140 million more than the request, while the Senate committee recommended $82 million less than the request. The final appropriation was $4.758 billion, plus $15 million for the organizationally separate Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E).", "Within the Office of Science, the request for basic energy sciences included increases of $153 million for a new program of Energy Frontier Research Centers, $66 million for construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II, and $73 million to increase operating time at existing facilities. The Senate committee recommended reducing basic energy sciences by $153 million below the request; $59 million of that amount represented solar energy R&D activities transferred to another account; the remainder of the reduction was not specified. The requested 17% increase for high energy physics was mostly for programs cut in the final FY2008 appropriation that were funded in the House and Senate bills for that year. The requested 72% increase for fusion energy sciences was to fund the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which was eliminated in the final FY2008 appropriation, again despite support in the House and Senate bills for that year. The estimated cost of ITER is between $1.45 and $2.2 billion with a completion date between FY2014 and FY2017. The House and Senate committees recommended the requested amount for ITER. The final appropriation for fusion energy sciences included $90 million less than the request for ITER and no funding for National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) project, which is currently under construction at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The final appropriation for biological and environmental research included increases of $23 million for climate change research and $10 million for nuclear medicine.", "The requested funding for DOE national security R&D was $3.132 billion, a 2% decrease. Proposed increases included $53 million for the naval reactors program, mostly to support processing and storage of spent nuclear fuel, and $10 million for the reliable replacement warhead program, which Congress zeroed in the FY2008 appropriation. The major proposed decrease was $79 million for proliferation detection R&D, a program that Congress increased in FY2008. The House committee recommended a total of $3.052 billion, while the Senate committee recommended $3.252 billion. Neither committee recommended any funding for the reliable replacement warhead program, and the Senate committee recommended restoring $75 million of the requested decrease for nonproliferation and verification R&D. In the Weapons Activities account, the House committee recommended an increase of $87 million for inertial confinement fusion and a decrease of $66 million for advanced simulation and computing.

Within this total, R&D on nuclear energy and coal was to increase, while hydrogen R&D was to decrease and gas and oil technology programs were to be terminated (as also proposed, unsuccessfully, in other recent years). Most of the requested 17% decrease for energy efficiency and renewable energy resulted from the omission of $186 million in FY2008 congressionally directed projects. The requested 44% increase for nuclear energy R&D was mostly for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI). The House and Senate committees and the final bill all recommended substantial increases in energy R&D, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy, but decreases in nuclear energy. They all recommended funding the gas and oil technology programs at approximately the FY2008 level and provided less than the request for the AFCI.", "The House-passed version of H.R. 1 included at least an additional $6.4 billion for DOE R&D and related programs: $2 billion for Science, of which not less than $100 million was for advanced scientific computing research and not less than $400 million was for ARPA-E; $2 billion for R&D on energy efficiency and renewable energy, of which not less than $800 million was for biomass energy and not less than $400 million was for geothermal energy; and $2.4 billion for fossil energy projects demonstrating carbon capture and sequestration. The Senate-passed version included at least an additional $7.578 billion: $330 million for the Office of Science; $2.648 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D; and $4.6 billion for fossil energy R&D. The enacted version included $400 million for ARPA-E; $1.6 billion for the Office of Science programs; $2.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy, of which $800 million was for biomass energy and $400 million was for geothermal energy; and $3.4 billion for fossil energy R&D. Funding provided for weapons activities, defense environmental cleanup, and electricity delivery and energy reliability may also include an unspecified amount of R&D.

President Bush proposed doubling the NSF budget over 10 years, from FY2007 to FY2016, as part of his American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI). The FY2009 request represented another installment toward that doubling effort. In August 2008, Congress passed the America COMPETES Act which authorizes funding for NSF for FY2008 through FY2010 at a pace that would more than double the agency's funding in seven years. NSF identified several strategies in the FY2009 budget request: to maintain a portfolio with \"powerful momentum\" across all disciplines; to build a world-class science and engineering workforce; to perform effectively with the highest standards of accountability; and to support potentially transformative research. The NSF Director describes transformative research as \"a range of endeavors, which promise extraordinary outcomes; such as, revolutionizing entire disciplines, creating entirely new fields, or disrupting accepted theories and perspective.\" Several reports have recommended that funds be allocated specifically for this type of research. NSF contends that in the global environment of science and engineering, support for transformative, high-risk, high-reward research is critical to U.S. competitiveness. These strategies paralleled some of the goals contained in President Bush's ACI, and are designed to promote research that will drive innovation and support the design and development of world-class facilities, instrumentation, and infrastructure.", "Included in the FY2009 request was $5.594 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 16.0% increase ($772.5 million) above the FY2008 estimate of $4.822 billion. R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities. The scientific and academic communities have voiced concerns about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences. Research is multidisciplinary and transformational in nature, and very often, discoveries in the physical sciences lead to advances in other disciplines. The America COMPETES ACT authorizes increased federal research support in the physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The FY2009 request provided a 20.2% increase for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) directorate. The MPS portfolio supports investments in fundamental research, facilities, and instruments, and provides approximately 44.0% of the federal funding for basic research in mathematics and physical sciences conducted at colleges and universities. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA), a cross-disciplinary research and education program, and is a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at institutions. The FY2009 request provided $276.0 million for IA. The IA also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. In FY2008, support for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) was transferred from the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) to IA. NSF's FY2009 request for EPSCoR was $113.5 million, which is a part of the total IA funding request. The FY2009 request would support a portfolio of three complementary strategies\u2014research infrastructure, co-funding, and outreach\u2014for the 27 EPSCoR jurisdictions. Approximately 67.0% of the funding for EPSCoR would be used for a combination of new awards and research infrastructure improvement grants. The balance of funding would support co-funding (31.7%) and outreach activities (1.7%).", "The NSF asserts that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. The Administration had requested $47.4 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). The OISE manages NSF's offices in Beijing, Paris, and Tokyo that report on and analyze in-country and regional science and technology policies and developments. The OISE serves as a liaison with research institutes and foreign agencies, and facilitates coordination and implementation of NSF research and education efforts.", "The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. The FY2009 request for addressing the challenges in polar research was $491.0 million. NSF continues in its leadership role in planning U.S. participation in observance of the International Polar Year, 2007-2009. The NSF also serves in a leadership capacity for several international research partnerships in the Arctic and Antarctic. Increases in OPP in FY2009 are directed at research programs for arctic and antarctic sciences\u2014glacial and sea ice, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the ocean and the atmosphere, and biology of life in the cold and dark. In FY2006, responsibility for funding the operational costs of three icebreakers that support scientific research in the polar regions was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the NSF. NSF is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and staffing of the vessels. Beginning in FY2009, one of the icebreakers was to be in drydock. To meet the need for back-up icebreaking services, the FY2009 request included an additional $9.0 million for contracting of other vessels.", "NSF supported several interagency R&D priorities in the FY2009 request. It is a lead agency in the U.S. nanotechnology research effort, accounting for $396.8 million of the National Nanotechnology Initiative's $1.53 billion FY2009 request. Funding would support research in emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology such as new drug delivery systems, advanced materials, more powerful computer chips. Support would be directed also at research and education in the environmental, health, and safety impacts of nanotechnology. NSF's other interagency priorities included funding for the Climate Change Science Program ($220.6 million), Homeland Security ($379.2 million), Networking and Information Technology R&D ($1,090.3 million), and Climate Change Technology Program ($23.5 million).", "The NSF supports a variety of individual centers and center programs. The FY2009 request provided $76.0 million for Science and Technology Centers, $53.6 million for Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, $53.6 million for Engineering Research Centers, $44.6 million for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, $15.0 million for Science of Learning Centers, $20.0 million for Centers for Chemical Innovation, and $18.4 million for Centers for Analysis and Synthesis.", "The FY2009 request for the EHR Directorate was $790.4 million, $64.8 million (8.9%) above the FY2008 estimate. The EHR portfolio is focused on, among other things, increasing the technological literacy of all citizens; preparing the next generation of science, engineering, and mathematics professionals; and closing the achievement gap of underrepresented groups in all scientific fields. Support at the various educational levels in the FY2009 request was as follows: research on learning in formal and informal settings (including precollege), $226.5 million; undergraduate, $219.8 million; and graduate, $190.7 million. Priorities at the precollege level included research and evaluation on education in science and engineering ($42.0 million), informal science education ($66.0 million), and Discovery Research K-12 ($108.5 million). Discovery Research is structured to combine the strengths of three existing programs and encourage innovative thinking in K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education.", "According to NSF, programs at the undergraduate level are designed to \"create leverage for institutional change.\" Priorities at the undergraduate level included the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program ($11.6 million); Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement ($39.2 million); STEM Talent Expansion Program ($29.7 million); Advanced Technological Education ($51.6 million); and Scholarship for Service ($15.0 million). The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP), an interagency program, was proposed at $51.0 million in the FY2009 request. The MSP in NSF coordinates activities with the Department of Education and its state-funded MSP sites. At the graduate level, NSF's priorities were Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship ($25.0 million), Graduate Research Fellowships ($116.7 million), and the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education ($49.0 million).", "Additional priorities in the EHR would support a portfolio of programs directed at strengthening and expanding the participation of underrepresented groups and diverse institutions in the scientific and engineering enterprise. Among these targeted programs in the FY2009 request are the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program ($31.0 million), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program ($13.4 million), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation ($42.5 million), and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology ($30.5 million).", "Improving the success rate of grant applicants has been a long-term priority for NSF. The funding rate (the number of grants awarded as a share of total grant applications) declined from 30% in FY2000 to an estimated 21% in FY2008. NSF anticipated increasing the funding rate to 23.0% in FY2009 by supporting an additional 1,370 research grants.", "The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account was funded at $147.5 million in the FY2009 request, a decrease of 33.2% from the FY2008 estimate. The MREFC supports the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. According to NSF, it is the primary federal agency providing support for \"forefront instrumentation and facilities for the academic research and education communities.\" NSF's first priority for funding is for ongoing projects. Second priority is given to projects that have been approved by the National Science Board for new starts. To qualify for support, NSF required MREFC projects to have \"the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding and/or infrastructure technology.\" The FY2009 request was indicative of NSF's tighter standards and requirements for receiving funding in this account. Three projects that appeared in the FY2008 request (Alaskan Regional Research Vessel, Ocean Observatories Initiative, and the National Ecological Observatory Network) have to undergo a final design review and a risk management plan to meet NSF's policy of not allowing cost overruns on major facilities projects. These projects are still supported by NSF, and will be considered for inclusion in the next budget cycle following submission of their revised baseline budgets and contingencies. The FY2009 request supported three ongoing projects: Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ($51.4 million), Atacama Large Millimeter Array ($82.3 million), and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory ($11.3 million). The request also provided $2.5 million to support design activities for a new start, the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope.", "During the 110 th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee approved a Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies draft bill that would have provided $6.854 billion for the NSF in FY2009, $789.1 million above the FY2008 enacted and the same as President Bush's request.
