Inventors must prepare and submit applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) if they wish to obtain patent protection. USPTO officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of a patent. ", "In deciding whether to approve a patent application, a USPTO examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention. In addition, the application must disclose the \"best mode,\" or preferred way, that the applicant knows to practice the invention. The examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute. To be patentable, an invention must consist of a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter that is useful, novel, and nonobvious. The requirement of usefulness, or utility, is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit. To be judged novel, the invention must not be fully anticipated by a prior patent, publication, or other state-of-the-art knowledge that is collectively termed the \"prior art.\" A nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan at the time the invention was made.", "If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States the patented invention.

Adjudicated infringers may be enjoined from further infringing acts.

The first, the Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property, has been joined by 175 countries including the United States. The Paris Convention states that its member states \"have the right to take legislative measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses to prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights conferred by the patent, for example, failure to work.\" Paris Convention member states have agreed that a compulsory license \"may not be applied for on the ground of failure to work or insufficient working before the expiration of a period of four years from the date of filing of the patent application or three years from the date of the grant of the patent, whichever period expires last; it shall be refused if the patentee justifies his inaction by legitimate reasons.\"", "The other significant multilateral agreement that speaks to compulsory patent licensing, a component of the international agreements forming the World Trade Organization (WTO), is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The so-called \"TRIPS Agreement\" places further limitations upon the ability of WTO member states to award compulsory licenses for the use of another's patented invention. Among the most detailed provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, Article 31 imposes in part the following restrictions upon the issuance of compulsory licenses:", "Each application for a compulsory license must be considered on its individual merits.

The Doha Declaration stated that the TRIPS Agreement \"can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.\" The Doha Declaration granted broad discretion with regard to compulsory licensing, asserting that WTO signatories have \"the right to grant compulsory licences [sic] and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences [sic] can be granted.\" In addition, WTO signatories proposed an amendment to the TRIPS Agreement in the form of Article 31bis. That provision allows WTO member states with limited or no manufacturing capacity to declare a compulsory license to import generic drugs from other countries.

Nor is there any precise definition of what level of \"adequate remuneration\" to the patent holder suffices. The application of these limitations may not be further understood until a competent tribunal is called upon to interpret them, an event that has yet to occur.", "In addition to the TRIPS Agreement and Paris Convention, the United States has entered into a number of free trade agreements that also address compulsory patent licenses.

Under the eBay ruling, courts must weigh equitable factors traditionally used to determine if an injunction should issue, including whether the patent proprietor suffered an irreparable injury; the award of damages would be inadequate to compensate for that injury; that considering the balance of hardships between the patent owner and infringer, an injunction is warranted; and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.", "Following the eBay decision, courts most often award an injunction to the prevailing patentee.
