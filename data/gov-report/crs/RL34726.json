Instead, victims have sued numerous individuals and entities with only indirect ties to the attacks, including defendants who allegedly provided monetary support to Al Qaeda prior to September 11, 2001. Within the consolidated case In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, one such group of defendants was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, several Saudi princes, a Saudi banker, and a Saudi charity. Plaintiffs argued that these Saudi defendants funded groups that, in turn, assisted the attackers.", "A threshold question in In re Terrorist Attacks was whether U.S. courts have the power to try these Saudi defendants. In August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of all claims against the Saudi defendants, holding that U.S. courts lack jurisdiction over the claims. Specifically, the court of appeals held that in this case, U.S. courts lack (1) subject matter jurisdiction over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, because the Kingdom is entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (the FSIA) and no statutory exception to immunity applies; (2) subject matter jurisdiction over the Saudi charity and Saudi princes acting in their official capacities, because they are \"agents or instrumentalities\" of the Kingdom and thus, under the FSIA, are entitled to immunity to the same extent as the Kingdom itself; and (3) personal jurisdiction over Saudi princes sued in their personal capacities, because the princes had insufficient interactions with the forum to satisfy the \"minimum contacts\" standard for personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment due process clause.", "In 2011, the Second Circuit reversed itself with respect to the immunity of non-terrorist states, finding that the tort exception under the FSIA does not exclude terrorist acts that take place within the United States. In 2013, the court ordered these claims against Saudi Arabia and its agencies or instrumentalities be reinstated in the interest of justice to determine whether the tort exception applies. The district court again dismissed the claims in 2015 on the basis that the \"entire tort\" defendants were alleged to have committed did not occur within the United States. This decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.", "In a separate decision, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of claims against private Saudi banks on the basis that the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) does not permit secondary liability under an aiding-and-abetting theory. It also affirmed the dismissal of claims against these defendants brought under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victims Protection Act, as well as claims brought as common law torts.", "To address some issues related to the interpretation of the FSIA, among other related matters, Congress is considering the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA; S. 2040, H.R. 3815).This report summarizes the FSIA and jurisdiction in cases against foreign defendants, analyzes the court decisions, and reviews legislative efforts to revise the FSIA and the ATA."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["N umerous legal and practical obstacles, such as the infeasibility of locating Al Qaeda operatives, stand in the way of victims seeking to establish liability in U.S. courts against, and recover damages from, the terrorists who planned and carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Congress passed the FSIA to codify these long-standing principles and to clarify limitations on the scope of immunity that had emerged in international practice.", "The FSIA contains both a general, presumptive rule against litigation in U.S. courts and a number of exceptions permitting suits. As a general rule, foreign states, together with their agencies and instrumentalities, are \"immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and from the states.\" However, the FSIA authorizes jurisdiction over foreign nations in several exceptions. Namely, a foreign state is not immune from U.S. courts' jurisdiction where (1) the foreign state has waived its immunity; (2) the claim is a specific type of admiralty claim; (3)\u00a0the claim involves commercial activities; (4) the claim implicates property rights connected with the United States; (5) the claim arises from tortious conduct that occurred in the United States; (6) the claim is made pursuant to an arbitration agreement; or (7) the claim seeks money damages against a designated state sponsor of terrorism for injuries arising from a terrorist act.", "The exception for designated state sponsors of terrorism provides jurisdiction over cases involving designated \"state sponsor[s] of terrorism\" in suits involving \"personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act if such act or provision of material support or resources is engaged in by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency.\" However, the exception seems to apply only to countries designated by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism.

", "In contrast, for claims against foreign states and their instrumentalities, the FSIA is a jurisdictional gatekeeper. The FSIA denies subject matter jurisdiction over claims against foreign defendants entitled to immunity. Conversely, the FSIA authorizes subject matter jurisdiction over claims in which a foreign state would be entitled to immunity under the FSIA but for the application of an exception. Individual foreign officials are not covered by the FSIA if they are sued in their capacity as individuals, but may be immune from suit under the common law of foreign sovereign immunity. One such defendant, the former president of two of the Saudi-run charities sued for alleged involvement in funding the 9/11 terrorist attacks, prevailed in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit against him on the basis of common-law foreign sovereign immunity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Personal Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["Personal jurisdiction is the second threshold hurdle for assertion of judicial authority in cases involving foreign defendants. Whereas subject matter jurisdiction governs courts' power over particular claims, personal jurisdiction governs courts' power over particular defendants. Thus, even if a court establishes jurisdiction over the subject matter of a claim, it cannot exercise its authority over a defendant for whom it lacks personal jurisdiction.", "Personal jurisdiction requires both statutory authority and satisfaction of Fifth Amendment due process standards. As with subject matter jurisdiction, statutory authority for personal jurisdiction over foreign defendants follows one of two distinct routes according to the FSIA's application. If the defendant is a foreign state or its agency or instrumentality, personal jurisdiction is statutorily authorized under the FSIA if subject matter jurisdiction is established. Alternatively, for a defendant who is not a foreign state or its agency or instrumentality, the ordinary procedure for obtaining statutory authority for personal jurisdiction applies; typically, a federal court must find statutory authority for personal jurisdiction in the laws of the state in which it sits.", "However, constitutional limits apply regardless of a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction. Under the due process clause, personal jurisdiction is constitutional if (1) defendants have had \"certain minimum contacts with\" the judicial forum attempting to assert jurisdiction, and (2) asserting such jurisdiction \"does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" The type and quantity of contacts necessary to constitute \"minimum contacts\" differ according to the type of personal jurisdiction\u2014general or specific\u2014that applies. General jurisdiction, which allows a court to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign defendant for any claim, does not require contacts related to the specific claim in the case but instead requires \"continuous and systematic\" contacts with a forum.

Underlying all of the claims was the allegation that defendants had \"played a critical role in the September 11 attacks by funding Muslim charities that, in turn, funded al Qaeda.\"", "The appeals court in 2008 affirmed dismissals of the first three sets of claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.

Raising a number of textual arguments and referencing the FSIA's legislative history, the court held that individuals acting within their official capacities were indeed \"agencies\" of their states and were therefore entitled to immunity under the FSIA to the same extent as their states. The court noted that at the time the FSIA was enacted, Congress expressed a desire to codify common law principles, one of which was that immunity extends to a state's officials. The court also emphasized the potential erosion of immunity for foreign states if immunity extended only to government actions distinct from the actions of officials as individuals, noting that \"the state cannot act except through individuals.\"", "The Second Circuit's holding was consistent with the conclusions of five of the six other federal courts of appeals that had considered whether an individual may be protected as an agent or instrumentality. Only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Seventh Circuit) had reached the opposite conclusion. In Terrorist Attacks III , the Second Circuit characterized the Seventh Circuit as an \"outlier\" on this issue. However, after the Fourth Circuit also adopted the minority position, the Supreme Court granted review and established the minority position as the correct one. Consequently, jurisdiction over remaining Saudi officials is subject to the same inquiry that applies to other individuals and possibly a determination as to whether common law immunity applies. Because the officials dismissed from this case were not part of the motion to vacate, plaintiffs did not have an opportunity to pursue their lawsuit against them on remand.

It emphasized that if the exception were expanded to include all conduct conceivably characterized as tortious, the tort exception would \"vitiate\" the terrorist state exception's limitation to designated terrorist states. In a separate case, a later panel of the appellate court disagreed with this aspect of the decision, however, effectively overturning it for the Second Circuit. In December 2013, the appellate court granted the plaintiffs relief from judgment in the interests of justice, sending the case back to the district court to determine whether the tort exception applies or whether the defendants were entitled to immunity based on the discretionary nature of their actions.

Plaintiffs argued that the minimum contacts test was satisfied because the defendants had purposefully directed activity at the judicial forum by supporting the attacks. The court rejected this argument, acknowledging that it had been a successful argument in cases where defendants were \"primary participants\" in the terrorist acts but holding that the banker and princes' activities were too attenuated from the actual attacks to satisfy due process requirements. Similarly, the court rejected the plaintiff's argument that potential foreseeability of the terrorist attacks was a sufficient basis for establishing minimum contacts.

The Supreme Court has described the tort exception as \"cover[ing] only torts occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" Consequently, it is insufficient to overcome immunity to allege that an injury or damage occurred within the United States; it must also be demonstrated that the defendant's tortious conduct occurred within the United States. In affirming the dismissal with respect to the Saudi Joint Relief Committee (SJRC) and the Saudi Red Crescent Society (SRC), the appellate court did not appear to foreclose a finding of jurisdiction unless all conduct associated with the injury occurs wholly within the United States, but rather only that some tortious act must be committed by the defendant in the United States. In the case of the Saudi charities, the appellate court stated that all of the defendants' conduct had occurred abroad, and noted in a footnote that", "Although the September 11, 2001 attacks constitute a \"tort,\" the SJRC and the SRC are not alleged to have participated in that \"tort.\" Instead, the \"torts\" allegedly committed by the SJRC and the SRC only involve giving money and aid to purported charities that supported al Qaeda. \u2026 The September 11, 2001 attacks thus are distinct and separate from the \"torts\" allegedly committed by the SJRC and the SRC.", "Consequently, it is possible that the indirect nature of the defendants' alleged support for the terrorist attacks has some bearing on the application of the \"entire tort\" rule, so that a more direct role in orchestrating from abroad a terrorist attack that takes place in the United States would nevertheless qualify for jurisdiction under the tort exception.", "The district court found that the same considerations that applied to the charities also commanded immunity for the Kingdom and the SHC. The plaintiffs, recognizing that their allegations about indirect funding for the attacks would not satisfy the tort exception, sought to allege that the activities of certain \"operational level agents and alter-egos\" of Saudi Arabia within the United States in connection with the attacks are attributable to Saudi Arabia.

Accordingly, some courts have found the discretionary act exclusion inapplicable to tortious acts in the United States that amounted to illegal conduct. A district court in the D.C. Circuit found in Letelier v. Republic of Chile that an assassination occurring on U.S. soil under the direction of a foreign government was not a discretionary act within the meaning of the FSIA tort exception, stating the following:", "While it seems apparent that a decision calculated to result in injury or death to a particular individual or individuals, made for whatever reason, would be one most assuredly involving policy judgment and decision and thus exempt as a discretionary act under section 1605(a)(5)(A), that exception is not applicable to bar this suit. As it has been recognized, there is no discretion to commit, or to have one's officers or agents commit, an illegal act.... Whatever policy options may exist for a foreign country, it has no \"discretion\" to perpetrate conduct designed to result in the assassination of an individual or individuals, action that is clearly contrary to the precepts of humanity as recognized in both national and international law. Accordingly there would be no \"discretion\" within the meaning of section 1605(a)(5)(A) to order or to aid in an assassination and were it to be demonstrated that a foreign state has undertaken any such act in this country, that foreign state could not be accorded sovereign immunity \u2026 for any tort claims resulting from its conduct. ", "Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has held that the discretionary act exclusion does not apply in the case of a foreign official who, while acting in his home country, orders a killing in the United States that would be a violation of the domestic law of that country. Both of these cases applied the tort exception to injuries in the United States orchestrated from abroad, suggesting that the \"entire tort\" rule either is not in use in these appellate circuits or that it is not to be taken literally. That is, courts may tend to view direct involvement on the part of a foreign official overseas in tortious activity that takes place on U.S. territory as included in the same tort, while indirect contribution by means of lawful conduct could be viewed as at most a separate tort or as a discretionary act.", "If the appellate court reverses the district court's dismissal of the suit on \"entire tort\" grounds, the case will likely return to the district court for a determination of whether the suit is precluded on grounds that the alleged tortious acts retain immunity as discretionary functions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Court of Appeals' Dismissal of Claims Against Private Banks", "paragraphs": ["In a separate decision in In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims against five defendants whose cases had been dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.

The tort exception would also have been amended to clarify that there is no rule holding that the \"entire tort\" must occur within the United States, but rather that such claims are covered \"regardless of where the underlying tortious act or omission occurs.\" ", "Additionally, the bills would have expanded liability for foreign government officials in civil actions for terrorist acts no matter where they occur by amending 18 U.S.C. Section 2337, which currently exempts all government officials. The amended version of Section 2337 would have exempted only U.S. officials. H.R. 3143 would have included the provision of material support for terrorism in the jurisdiction provision, although its revision of the ATA cause of action did not expressly include liability for material support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "114th Congress, Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act", "paragraphs": ["The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) has returned to the 114 th Congress as S. 2040 , which the Senate passed by voice vote on May 17, 2016, after accepting an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Senator Cornyn, and H.R. 3815 , which was introduced late in 2015 and referred to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution and Civil Justice.

It would also eliminate the \"entire tort\" rule by providing that the non-commercial tort exception covers physical injuries, deaths, and property damage or loss occurring in the United States \"regardless of where the underlying tortious act or omission occurs.\" ", "The discretionary function exclusion would remain unchanged; however, the bill would include among congressional findings that \"no country has the discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\"", "S. 2040 (as passed by the Senate) would create a new exception to the FSIA for acts of international terrorism that occur on U.S. territory, to be codified as 28 U.S.C. \u00a71605B. \"International terrorism\" is defined with reference to the ATA, including the exclusion for \"acts of war.\" The amendment would dispense with the \"entire tort\" rule and the statutory discretionary act exclusion for such cases only, leaving current law intact with respect to the FSIA non-commercial tort exception in other cases. Under the bill, a plaintiff could seek money damages from a foreign state for physical injury to person or property or death caused by both (1) an act of international terrorism in the United States, and (2) a tortious act or acts on the part of the foreign state or official, employee, or agent of that foreign state acting within the scope of his or her employment, regardless of where the tortious conduct took place. The bill would also clarify that a tortious act or omission would not give rise to jurisdiction where it constitutes \"mere negligence.\" Finally, it would clarify the relationship between the FSIA exception and the ATA's civil liability exception precluding suits against foreign officials. If the new FSIA exception applies, a U.S. national could pursue an ATA lawsuit against the foreign state. ", "S. 2040 would provide for exclusive federal court jurisdiction over foreign states under the new FSIA provision, and would authorize the Attorney General to intervene in such cases to seek a stay of the civil action if the Secretary of State certifies that the United States is engaged in good faith discussions with the defendant state to resolve the claims. The court would be authorized to issue a stay for 180 days, which could be renewed for additional 180-day periods if the Secretary of State certifies that such negotiations remain ongoing.

S. 2040 (as passed by the Senate) and H.R. 3815 would amend the ATA to provide for secondary liability in the case of an act of international terrorism planned, committed, or authorized by an entity designated as a foreign terrorist organization at the time of the planning, commission, or authorization of the attack. The House bill would also apply liability in the case of an entity designated as a foreign terrorist organization as a result of the attack that gives rise to the lawsuit. Secondary liability would attach under the Senate bill to any person who \"aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires\" with the perpetrator; it also expressly adopts the definition for \"person\" from Section 1 of Title 1 to define who may be held secondarily liable. The House bill would authorize secondary liability against anyone who aided, abetted, or conspired with the perpetrator, without clarifying what type of intent or knowledge would be necessary to establish liability. Neither bill would explicitly elucidate whether criminal liability under the material support provisions of the ATA would also establish civil liability, as some courts have found, but language in the findings section suggest the intent that the knowing or reckless provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, whether directly or indirectly, should give rise to liability.", "H.R. 3815 would amend the ATA to remove the immunity of foreign officials from lawsuits as currently provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a72337(2). It would also add a provision to the ATA to address issues plaintiffs have confronted in establishing personal jurisdiction over foreign nationals. H.R. 3815 would declare that", "The district courts shall have personal jurisdiction, to the maximum extent permissible under the 5 th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, over any person who commits or aids and abets an act of international terrorism or otherwise sponsors such act or the person who committed such act, for acts of international terrorism in which any national of the United States suffers injury in his or her person, property, or business by reason of such an act in violation of section 2333.", "S. 2040 (as passed by the Senate) would leave the foreign official exclusion under the ATA intact, but, as noted above, would permit lawsuits by U.S. nationals against the foreign state itself if the new FSIA exception is triggered.
