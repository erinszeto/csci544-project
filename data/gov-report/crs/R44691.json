Enacting these new mandatory spending proposals would have required legislative action that generally would have been expected to occur outside the annual appropriations process and, as a result, these new mandatory funds are not within the scope of this report.

ACF and NIH accounted for the next-largest shares of total HHS appropriations, receiving about 4% apiece.
