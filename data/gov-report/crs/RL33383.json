Most major U.S. ports are publicly owned by a \"port authority,\" which is a public organization associated with a city, county, regional, or state government. A port typically contains many terminals that are each designed to handle different types of cargo. Some port authorities operate all or some of their marine terminals, but most ports lease their facilities to several different terminal operating companies. All of the cargo handling that takes place on a marine terminal is performed by members of a longshoremen's union.", "The Coast Guard is in charge of the security of port facilities and vessels, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is in charge of the security of cargo. Coast Guard regulations and CBP security guidelines require terminal operators to provide basic security infrastructure, such as fences, gates, and surveillance cameras, and follow certain security practices when handling cargo. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is developing a credentialing process for screening port workers. However, port security involves much more than the measures put in place within the immediate vicinity of a U.S. port complex. Not finding a terrorist-placed weapon until after it reaches a U.S. port could be too late to prevent a potentially catastrophic event. Thus, securing the cargo and ships in transit to U.S. ports is critical and consequently the bulk of federal security activity takes place before cargo is unloaded at U.S. ports. Key layers of security are CBP's scrutiny of U.S.-bound cargo at the overseas port of loading and the Coast Guard's scrutiny of ships before they enter U.S. harbors.", "The necessity of pushing the border out to counter the terrorist threat requires the cooperation of shippers, carriers, ports, and border agencies in the country of origin to take security precautions with U.S.-bound cargo. Global terminal operators like DP World may handle U.S. cargo at the overseas loading port, even if they do not handle it at a U.S. port. Thus, a key issue for policymakers is deciding under what conditions the United States should trust foreign cargo-handling entities and whether they should be treated as partners in securing U.S. supply lines. The DP World controversy refueled debate about whether the nation is doing enough, with sufficient urgency, to secure U.S. ports. In its oversight role, Congress is assessing the effectiveness of Coast Guard and CBP maritime security initiatives and faces pressing questions about the overall security of ports and maritime commerce."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The failed attempt by Dubai Ports World (DP World) to operate marine terminals at some U.S. ports raises the issue of whether foreign marine terminal operators pose a threat to U.S. homeland security. DP World is a terminal operating company that operates as a commercial entity, but is owned by the Government of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In March 2006, DP World purchased a competitor, the British-owned Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O). P&O leased marine terminals around the world, including at five U.S. ports \u2013 New York and New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Miami, and New Orleans, and was involved in other cargo handling operations at other East and Gulf Coast ports, as well as a cruise terminal in New York City. As part of DP World's purchase of P&O, DP World acquired P&O's terminal leases or concessions at these U.S. ports. However, as a result of Congressional opposition, DP World announced on March 9, 2006 that it would sell its stake in the U.S. portion of P&O's operations to a U.S. entity and on March 16, 2007, DP World sold its stake to AIG Global Investment Group.", "Notwithstanding the sale of U.S. terminal operations by DP World to a U.S. entity, the underlying issues remain: Is the ownership of a terminal operating company relevant to the security of a U.S. port? Does foreign takeover of terminal operating leases potentially pose a threat to U.S. security? Should companies owned by foreign governments be precluded from operating U.S. port terminals? These policy questions remain an issue because (1) many U.S. marine terminals are operated by foreign-based companies, and (2) given the global nature of the shipping business, similar transactions may occur in the future.", "The purpose of this report is to provide information relevant in answering these questions. It begins by explaining how ports work and what marine terminal operators do. It then reviews the extent of foreign involvement that already exists in U.S. ports. The next section describes the responsibility of terminal operators in providing security at U.S. ports and how their role fits in with the larger task of securing the entire maritime supply chain. The report concludes by examining port security issues for Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Port Administration and Operation", "paragraphs": ["The debate over the DP World transaction often confused the terms \"port,\" \"port authority,\" and \"terminal.\" Most major U.S. ports are publicly owned by a \"port authority,\" which is a public or quasi-public organization associated with a city, county, regional, or state government. A port authority is responsible for the overall administration of the property, terminals, and other facilities on the port complex. A marine terminal is an assigned area with equipment for loading and unloading ships, and space for staging cargo until it is loaded on the ship or transferred to overland modes of transport. Some port authorities operate all or some of their marine terminals themselves, but most ports are \"landlord\" ports because they lease their facilities to terminal operating companies (the tenants). These leases are typically long-term \u2013 in the range of 10 to 30 years. Either the port authority or the terminal operator will supply the cranes and other cargo handling equipment. It depends on the lease agreement between the port authority and each terminal operator.", "As one port authority suggests, one can think of a public port like a shopping mall. The port authority owns the entire mall property while the stores are leased to individual retail companies. A large port could contain 15 to 20 marine terminals of various types. Some of the terminals could handle containers (which are truck-trailers without the wheels), others may handle dry bulk cargo (such as coal, grain, or sugar), liquid bulk cargo (such as petroleum or chemicals), breakbulk cargo (such as steel coils, pipes, or large machinery), or automobiles and trucks. A typical container terminal may be 100 to 300 acres in size, while the entire port complex of a major port may be 2,000 to over 3,000 acres in size.", "While the above model applies to the marine terminals involved in the DP World transaction, it does not apply to all marine terminals. Public port authorities only own approximately one-third of the deep-draft marine terminal facilities in the United States. Many of the privately owned marine terminals are associated with the oil, gas, and chemical industries. In these cases, the waterside terminal may be a component of a larger industrial complex on land. For instance, at the Port of Houston, the Port of Houston Authority only owns or leases 12 marine terminals while there are 138 private terminals that are owned by either U.S.-based, foreign-based, or multi-national corporations that handle approximately 85% of the cargo that moves through the Port of Houston.", "Terminal operators (a.k.a. stevedores) contract with longshoremen unions to provide cargo handling services on the docks. Longshoremen are hired by and report directly to a union hiring hall. Terminal operators also employ a management team who are hired by and report directly to the terminal operating company. Longshoremen, called \"dockworkers,\" operate cranes that physically move the cargo from ship to dock and vice versa. Longshoremen, called \"checkers,\" perform clerk functions in an office in or near the port. At a container terminal, the checkers are responsible for directing the container traffic within the terminal area \u2013 they tell the dockworkers where containers need to be moved. The ocean carrier provides a stowage plan which tells the terminal operator where the containers need to be loaded on the ship. In the case of inbound shipments, the terminal operator separates those containers to be picked up by truck from those that will move by rail (if there is an \"on-dock\" railroad at the terminal). Longshoremen also staff the gates where trucks enter to pick-up and drop-off containers.", "Longshoremen do not know the contents of containers except for containers carrying hazardous material, which require special handling and storage requirements. The terminal operator is not concerned with the origin and final destination of the shipment. The only cargo information relevant to the terminal operator in performing its function is the weight of the container (for ship loading purposes), whether or not it has been released by Customs (for imported cargo), the bill of lading number (or booking number for export cargo), seal number, and container number."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "An Industry Driven by Globalization", "paragraphs": ["While DP World would have been the first Middle Eastern based company to operate container terminals in U.S. ports, most container terminals are operated by other foreign-based companies. A survey by the U.S. Maritime Administration found that at the seventeen largest U.S. container ports, 45 terminals (66%) were operated by a foreign based company, 5 terminals (7%) were operated by a joint venture between a domestic and foreign based company, and 18 terminals (26%) were operated by a purely domestic terminal operating company. The survey found that several of the ports have no U.S.-based container terminal operators: Baltimore, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tacoma. At the combined Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the largest container port complex in the United States, only three of the fifteen container terminals are operated by U.S.-based companies. At the Port of New York and New Jersey, the second largest container port, only two of the six container terminals are operated by U.S.-based companies. At the Port of Norfolk and the Port of Savannah, the port authority operates the terminals rather than leasing them to private terminal operators. The Port of Portland (Oregon) leases its container terminal to a U.S. based operator. Most of the foreign terminal operators are based in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China, the United Kingdom, and Denmark. A handful of terminal operators are partially owned by the governments of Singapore, Taiwan, and China.", "Most U.S. container terminals are managed by foreign companies because almost all of the container shipping lines are owned by foreign companies. Typically, a foreign container shipping line creates a U.S. subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate to operate the terminals at its busiest U.S. ports to better ensure service quality and control costs. Two large U.S.-based container lines and their terminal operations were sold to foreign interests in the late 1990s. In 1997, American President Lines was sold to Neptune Orient Lines, which is partially owned by the government of Singapore. In 1999, Sea-Land Service, the U.S. company that pioneered container shipping in the late 1950s, was sold to Maersk Lines, a Danish carrier. The president of the World Shipping Council (WSC) who is also a former executive of Sea-Land believes that U.S. investors have avoided the container shipping industry because of its high capital investment requirements, \"boom and bust\" cycles, intense competition, and because foreign tax laws are more favorable to shipping.", "While many terminal operators are affiliated with a steamship line, independent terminal operating companies also exist. DP World and P&O are two of several global terminal operating companies. Other global stevedores are Hutchison Port Holdings, based in Hong Kong; PSA, based in Singapore; and SSA Marine, based in Seattle. One estimate is that the four largest global terminal operators handle about 80% of the containers being shipped worldwide. Some U.S. independent terminal operators only operate in the United States, such as Maher Terminals and American Stevedores in New York, and Transbay and Marine Terminals Corporation in Oakland.", "Foreign involvement in U.S. port terminal operations is an extension of an industry driven by globalization. The largest container shipping lines have extended their services around the globe because their biggest customers, such as big box retailers and auto, electronics, and clothing manufactures, have extended their supply lines and distribution networks around the globe. In turn, global independent terminal operators, such as DP World or P&O, seek to follow their customers, the shipping lines. The shipping business is capable of scanning the globe for low-cost inputs. For instance, it is not improbable that a ship calling at a U.S. port could have been built in South Korea, registered in Panama, owned by a Greek company, operated by a Japanese ocean carrier, captained by a German, and crewed by Filipinos."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Security Requirements of Terminal Operators", "paragraphs": ["Terminal operators are responsible for maintaining security on the property they rent from the port authority.

The security plan provides some leeway for the terminal operators to tailor their security measures to their particular type of cargo terminal.", "In the facility security plan, the terminal owner or operator must specify how it will address the security vulnerabilities identified in its security assessment. For instance, it must restrict access to its facility with fences and a system to identify unauthorized personnel. The operator must specify how it will monitor activity at the facility through the use of some combination of security guards, water-borne patrols, alarm systems, surveillance equipment, and lighting. In the case of container facilities, the operator must specify how it will check container seals and verify that arriving trucks have legitimate business at the facility. The facility operator must conduct periodic security drills and exercises. It is required to designate a Facility Security Officer (FSO) who is responsible for ensuring that the facility is in compliance with Coast Guard regulations and serves as the point of contact for notifying security threat level changes. The FSO is also required to keep records for two years and make them available to the Coast Guard regarding security training sessions, drills and exercises, security incidents and breaches, changes in security threat levels, maintenance of security equipment, and other records regarding security procedures at the terminal.", "The Coast Guard inspects terminals for compliance with security requirements. July 1, 2004 was the deadline for port facilities to begin operating under their security plans. Between then and January 1, 2005, the Coast Guard conducted initial on-site inspections at approximately 3,150 port facilities in more than 300 U.S. ports to check on compliance with the security plans. The Coast Guard plans to conduct annual compliance inspections at port facilities but the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, which is the lead federal official in charge of a port area, can also verify continued compliance at the facilities in his or her area at any time. To ensure that inspections reflect the normal course of business at a terminal, the Coast Guard has indicated that it is using unscheduled or unannounced spot checks to check on compliance. The Coast Guard reports that since July 2004, it has required corrective action on more than 700 violations of the MTSA security regulations and that of those 700 plus violations, 44 resulted in major control actions, such as closure of the terminal until corrective action was taken.", "Similar to terminal operators, vessel owners must also submit for Coast Guard approval a security assessment and security plan for their ships. Because of the close interface between vessels and facilities (when the vessel is in port), vessel and facility owners are required to coordinate their security measures and procedures and submit evidence of this coordination in a document called a \"Declaration of Security.\" Facility and vessel owners are required to update and resubmit their security plans to the Coast Guard every five years or whenever a substantial change is made to their facility or vessel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP's Requirements", "paragraphs": ["CBP is in charge of cargo security.

Like the Coast Guard, CBP faces the difficult challenge of achieving a sufficient level of security while not jeopardizing the efficient flow of commercial goods at the nation's ports of entry (POE). Generally, every shipment, whether it arrives via maritime, truck, rail, or air cargo container, must be released by CBP before it may enter the commerce of the United States.

The security guidelines that MPTO must commit to implementing and maintaining throughout their supply chains in order to become a member of C-TPAT include the following categories: conveyance security (to prevent unauthorized access or tampering); business partner requirements and security procedures (to ensure that partners commit to C-TPAT guidelines); container security (procedures for ensuring proper sealing and container integrity, along with procedures to report any problems to CBP); physical access controls (identification badges, visitor and vendor controls, mail screening etc.); procedural security; personnel security (background checks and investigations, etc.); physical security (fences, gates, cameras, alarms systems, etc.); and information technology security.

The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor performs background checks on all longshoremen at the port, who must be registered and licensed. The Commission was created in 1953 to fight corruption at the port. The Port of Miami introduced an ID system a few years ago.

One could view foreign companies like DP World as mostly the financiers behind the terminal operation with little or no involvement in the day-to-day running of the terminals.", "Defining the potential threat posed by foreign terminal operators is important because there are also drawbacks to banning them from U.S. ports. Cargo security policy is about striking an appropriate balance between security and commerce. It also involves balancing security and capital investment. Port facilities depend on large capital investments. The piers, wharfs, cranes, and elevators needed to load and unload ships; the storage yards, warehouses, or tank farms needed to store cargo; the dredging of shipping channels and berths; and landside connections to interstate highways and transcontinental railroads are all expensive infrastructure. Thus, the issue of foreign terminal operators involves guaranteeing security while remaining attractive to sources of capital."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Border-centric or Systems Approach to Security", "paragraphs": ["Because it could be too late if a terrorist weapon is discovered after it arrives at a U.S. port, the security of U.S. ports necessarily relies on the cooperation of shippers, carriers, ports, terminal operators, and border agencies in the country of origin to begin the screening process. Key policy questions are: Should the United States trust these foreign entities? Should they be treated as partners and allies in securing maritime commerce? Because there are two ends to America's supply line, the answer to both may be a qualified \"yes.\" For instance, although DP World will not be handling any U.S. cargo in U.S. ports, it will be handling U.S. cargo at ports of origin in China, Hong Kong, Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere.", "In evaluating the DP World transaction or others like it, it is appropriate to consider the extent to which the United States depends on foreign entities to secure its supply chain. CSI depends on the cooperation of the host government of the overseas port of loading to inspect U.S. bound cargo. C-TPAT depends on the cooperation of overseas manufacturers and overland carriers to protect U.S. bound shipments from terrorist infiltration. ISPS relies on the cooperation of foreign governments and foreign-flag carriers to enforce port and vessel security codes. As one maritime industry spokesperson stated:", "This is an international business with an international problem. The only way it's going to be addressed effectively is through international efforts, which means the U.S. isn't going to do it all, nor can it do it all."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing DHS Maritime Security Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["While the DP World issue spotlighted the role of terminal operators in port security, the initial debate about who should be operating U.S. ports quickly broadened into a debate about whether U.S. ports are secure. The DP World controversy refueled debate about whether the nation is doing enough, doing it with enough urgency, and spending enough on U.S. port and maritime security. Members of Congress have referred to ports as the \"soft underbelly\" in U.S. homeland security, to the shipping container as a modern day \"Trojan horse,\" and have argued that there are still \"massive blind spots\" in the maritime security regime. While no one asserts that enough has already been done to strengthen security, post-9/11 initiatives like CSI, ATS, C-TPAT, MTSA, and ISPS have, most acknowledge, created a framework for building a maritime security regime.", "An issue of likely interest to Congress is the effectiveness of these maritime security initiatives. GAO has issued a number of reports addressing post-9/11 security initiatives. GAO has reported several factors limiting CSI, including staffing imbalances and lack of technical requirements for NII equipment used at foreign ports. A number of concerns have also been raised by GAO regarding the C-TPAT program including the scope of effort and level of rigor applied to the validation process; how many and the types of validations that are necessary to manage security risk; and various staffing issues. The ATS system and CBP's targeting strategy more generally have been scrutinized by GAO in reports that criticize the strategy for not incorporating all the key elements of a risk management framework, and not being entirely consistent with recognized modeling practices. Also, the DHS Inspector General published the results of an audit of CBP's targeting procedures, and concluded that improvements were needed regarding the data used by ATS, examination results should be used to refine ATS targeting rules, and physical controls over containers could be improved. The DHS Inspector General has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of port security grants. The GAO has also identified difficulties in deploying radiation scanners at U.S. ports and it has reviewed the Coast Guard's ability to use risk management to guide its port security mission. The CBP and Coast Guard have begun implementing many of the GAO's and OIG's recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prioritizing Maritime Security Risks", "paragraphs": ["A major concern for policymakers is assessing what is most at risk in the maritime domain and allocating the nation's resources accordingly. Three significant security issues in the container supply chain have been identified: (1) the integrity of the container packing process at the overseas factory or warehouse, (2) the integrity of the subsequent truck movement from the factory or warehouse to the overseas port of loading, and (3) the integrity of the manifest information that CBP uses, in part, to target high risk shipments for inspection. Because there is no fool-proof way to address these vulnerabilities, some security experts call for greatly increasing the percentage of containers that are physically inspected. Others question whether a determined terrorist would not be able to find an inexpensive solution to circumvent screening technology.", "While the threat of a shipping container being used as a \"Trojan horse\" by terrorists has received much attention, debate persists about the likelihood that terrorists would use them for such purpose. The GAO reports that while shipping containers are vulnerable, an extensive body of work by the FBI, academic, think tank, and business organizations concluded that the likelihood of such use to smuggle a weapon is considered low. Some contend that a more likely tactic is that terrorists would attempt to smuggle a weapon using private watercraft and land at a public marina because they could remain in control of the weapon and avoid the scrutiny that occurs at official ports of entry. Terrorists could also smuggle a weapon in other types of cargo, such as motor vehicles or breakbulk cargo. They could repeat the attack method used against the USS Cole or the Limberg in which terrorists rammed a small boat packed with explosives into the hulls of these ships. They could employ this tactic against a cruise ship, a ferry, or a ship carrying hazardous cargo.", "The issue for Congress is how to protect U.S. ports and the supply chains on which the U.S. economy depends. Congress faces pressing questions about the overall security of ports and maritime commerce; the amount of funding that will be required to secure the maritime transportation system; and the amount of federal presence in ports that is necessary to prevent or deter terrorist use of ports as a destination or transit point for attacks on the United States."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
