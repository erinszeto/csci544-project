DOE expects that the project would accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, leading to about 1,000 megawatts (mw) of new capacity. This is the first time since the early 1980s that DOE has proposed a major CSP demonstration project. Assessments show a huge CSP resource potential. At the Bureau of Land Management, firms are competing intensely for CSP development permits. Water issues pose a potentially serious barrier to CSP development.

The Initiative aims to accelerate PV technology cost reduction and commercialization. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, but otherwise recommends $30.0 million less than the request.", "The Wind Program would have received a net increase of $42.5 million, or about 53%. A new activity geared to help commercialize offshore wind development would get $49.0 million. Most of that amount would support a competitive solicitation for an offshore wind demonstration project. Financial, regulatory, technical, environmental, and social barriers would be addressed. DOE anticipates that the demonstration would accelerate market deployment of more than three gigawatts (billions of watts, gw) of currently planned offshore projects. This is the first time since the early 1980s that DOE has proposed a major wind demonstration project. The Cape Wind project has been delayed for several years. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would have provided a nearly identical amount as the request, recommending that DOE undertake at least two offshore wind demonstration projects off the Atlantic Coast.", "The Geothermal Program would have been increased by $11.0 million, or about 25%. Virtually all of that increase would support two activities. One is a collaborative R&D activity with DOE's Office of Science on geophysical R&D and modeling efforts which address induced seismicity, water availability, and other potential lifecycle risks associated with enhanced geothermal systems. The second activity would be an increased effort on low temperature geothermal including fluids co-production from oil and gas operations and fluids from geo-pressured resources. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same amount as the request and directed DOE to apply at least $5.0 million to low-temperature systems.", "The Vehicle Technologies Program would have received a net increase of about $13.9 million, which encompasses an increase of about $17.7 million for the Battery/Energy Storage subprogram.

DOE estimates an average weatherization cost of $6,500 per household. Thus, $85.8 million would support weatherization of an additional 13,200 households. A modest portion of the overall increase, $4.2 million, would support the completion of the multi-year evaluation of the Weatherization Program. The State Energy Program would have increased by $25.0 million, to expand current activities.

These programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009. An LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile is ongoing; the life-extended warhead is termed the W76-1. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. It required NNSA to submit reports when NNSA completes a study of the LEP for the B61 bomb, stated that one type of B61 LEP would \"extend the life of the weapon for both strategic and tactical missions for 30 years,\" and referred to the \"upcoming\" LEP for the W78 warhead.

The FY2010 appropriation was $357.8 million. The FY2011 request was $649.4 million; the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The largest increase is for the B61 bomb ($92.0 million to $317.1 million); other substantial increases are for the W78 warhead ($48.3 million to $85.9 million) and the W87 warhead ($48.1 million to $62.6 million).

The former activity conducts maintenance, inspections, assessments, and the like. According to the budget request, funding for the latter would \"[support] a life extension study of the nuclear and non-nuclear components scope, including implementation of enhanced surety, extended service life and modification consolidation.\u2026 The study will evaluate options for improving safety and use control features and ensures compatibility and integration with modern aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, of which \"at least $165,000,000 shall be used for surveillance activities,\" i.e., those that monitor the status of nuclear weapons. It stated, \"A robust surveillance program is required to maintain confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons in the absence of underground nuclear testing.\" It expressed concerns that shortfalls in surveillance could jeopardize the annual process for assessing the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons. The B61 bomb has several variants. A study on a new variant, the B61-12, which would modify most variants of B61's into a single common version, was controversial in the FY2010 appropriations cycle. The House bill recommended no funds for it. The House Appropriations Committee \"will not support a major warhead redesign in the absence of clearly defined nuclear weapons strategy, stockpile, and complex plans.\" The Senate bill included the amount requested. The conference bill included $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, of which $32.5 million was for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12, a version of the B61 that would modify various types of B61s into a single common version. The bill provides that \"upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review and confirmation of the requirement for the B61-12, the NNSA is authorized to reallocate an additional $15,000,000 within the Stockpile Systems activities to support the continuation of the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study\" and that \"no funds may be obligated or expended for B61-12 nuclear components without prior approval by the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate.\" The conference agreement called for two reports on the B61-12.

It also directed NNSA to submit a revised analysis of B61 LEP alternatives on costs and benefits of combining nuclear and nonnuclear refurbishment of the B61. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD). The President and Congress have agreed on the desirability of reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, and numbers of warheads have fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War. Because of the large number of warheads being retired, there is a need to dismantle some warheads and to further break down some components to \"prevent storage problems across the [nuclear weapons] enterprise.\" WDD involves interim storage of warheads to be dismantled; dismantlement; and disposition (i.e., storing or eliminating warhead components and materials). The FY2010 current appropriation is $96.1 million, and the FY2011 request is $58.0 million. According to the budget request, the decrease reflects a reduction in dismantlements and component dispositions, and \"a return to baseline funding after a one-time Congressional increase in FY 2010.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, an increase of $6.4 million above the request, of which $27.5 million shall be used to help \"restore\" weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex.", "Several components of WDD have been moved to different organizations within DOE or to different budget categories within Weapons Activities in the last several years. Within WDD, the major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The \"pit\" is the fissile component (usually plutonium) of a nuclear warhead that initiates a thermonuclear explosion. As warheads are dismantled, pits may be stored, but for permanent disposition PDCF would convert the plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), where it would become fuel for commercial light-water nuclear reactors. In FY2008, MFFF was transferred from NNSA to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. WDD includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. For FY2010, the WSB account has been moved to the Fissile Materials Disposition Program within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation.", "Stockpile Services.

The element showing the largest increase in this campaign is Advanced Certification, which would go from $19.4 million to $77.0 million. This program will \"improve the weapons certification process; refine computational tools and methods; advance the physical understanding of surety mechanisms; understand failure modes; assess new manufacturing processes; and study system requirements.\" The increase would fund certain experiments at the Nevada Test Site and at the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory \"to examine options for modernized surety.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $10.9 million. Of the recommended amount, $53.3 million is provided to the Z facility at Sandia, and another $10.0 million to help that facility conduct experiments on plutonium. The Z facility, in Albuquerque, NM, releases an enormous amount of energy in a brief pulse, and is used, among other things, to study how materials react under high temperature and pressure. The committee describes the facility's activities as \"critical to sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile.\" Engineering Campaign. This campaign seeks to \"develop capabilities to assess and improve the safety, reliability, and performance of the nuclear explosive package and non-nuclear engineering components throughout a nuclear weapon's lifetime without further underground testing. Additionally, the purpose is to increase our ability to predict the response and have confidence in the design of all components and subsystems to external stimuli \u2026; the effects of aging; and to develop essential engineering capabilities and infrastructure.\" The FY2010 appropriation was $150.0 million; the FY2011 request was $141.9 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing that amount by $8.0 million. Noting that nuclear weapons may have to function in a nuclear environment, the committee provided funds to support capabilities to create or simulate that environment. Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign. This campaign is developing the tools to create extremely high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory\u2014approaching those of a nuclear explosion\u2014to support weapons-related research and to attract scientific talent to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. NNSA states, \"Virtually all of the energy from a nuclear weapon is generated while in the high energy density (HED) state. High energy density physics (HEDP) experiments on ICF facilities are required to validate the advanced theoretical models that are used to assess and certify the stockpile without nuclear testing. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) will extend HEDP experiments to include access to thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory, a unique and unprecedented scientific achievement.\" The centerpiece of this campaign is NIF, the world's largest laser. While NIF was controversial in Congress for many years and had significant cost growth and technical problems, controversy waned as the program progressed. The facility was dedicated in May 2009. According to a press report of January 2010, scientists working at NIF \"successfully fired an array of 192 laser beams [the total number of beams at NIF] at a helium-filled target no larger than a BB shot and instantly heated it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. The gas vanished in a tiny explosion. The scientists said that result marked the most important advance yet in more than 10 years of work at the $3.5 billion facility.\" The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million; the FY2011 request was $481.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The committee supported creating an independent advisory board to evaluate experiments planned at NIF. Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign. This campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons that integrate data from other campaigns, past test data, laboratory experiments, and elsewhere to create what NNSA calls \"the computational surrogate for nuclear testing,\" thereby enabling \"comprehensive understanding of the entire weapons lifecycle from design to safe processes for dismantlement.\" Some analysts doubt that simulation can be relied upon to provide the confidence needed to certify the safety, security, and reliability of warheads, and advocate a return to testing. The campaign includes funds for hardware and operations as well as for software. The FY2010 appropriation was $567.6 million; the FY2011 request was $615.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. Readiness Campaign. This campaign develops technologies and techniques to improve the safety and efficiency of manufacturing and reduce its costs. The FY2010 current appropriation is $100.0 million; the FY2011 request is $112.1 million. Within the Readiness Campaign, the largest dollar increase ($5.7 million for FY2010, $18.9 million requested for FY2011) is for Stockpile Readiness, a subprogram that \"ensures the availability of future manufacturing capabilities for the production of weapon components containing special materials.\" The increase provides for advances in manufacturing lithium parts at the Y-12 National Security Complex and for ensuring capability remains at the Savannah River Site to produce and test other components (gas transfer system reservoirs). The largest dollar decrease ($68.2 million for FY2010, $50.2 million requested for FY2011) is for Tritium Readiness. NNSA explains that the decrease \"is due to the cyclical nature of the fixed-price contracting approach taken by the program for the manufacture and irradiation of tritium producing burnable absorber rods and other materials.

Others are Program Readiness, which supports activities at multiple sites or in multiple programs (FY2010 appropriation, $73.0 million; FY2011 request, $69.3 million); Material Recycle and Recovery, which recovers plutonium, enriched uranium, and tritium from weapons production and disassembly (FY2010 appropriation, $69.5 million; FY2011 request, $70.4 million); and Construction (FY2010 appropriation, $303.9 million; FY2011 request, $399.0 million). Within Operations of Facilities, Institutional Site Support dropped from $120.1 million (FY2010) to $41.0 million (requested, FY2011). NNSA explains the reduction as due mainly to \"the nonrecurring request in FY2010 for direct support of management and operating contractor pension costs.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing RTBF funds by $71.0 million above the request. It expressed concern that the request for Pantex and Y-12 did not contain sufficient funds, and stated, \"The increase in funding will fill significant gaps at these facilities that would avoid layoffs and disruption to dismantlement and life extension schedules.\" Among other things, the committee restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant.", "The most costly item in Construction, and among the most controversial in the Weapons Activities account, is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (FY2010 appropriation, $97.0 million; FY2011 request, $225.0 million). It would replace the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, which is over 50 years old. Among other things, CMR houses research into plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. In considering the FY2008 budget, the House Appropriations Committee stated, \"Proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed will strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan.

However, deep spending cuts ... will likely result in delays that will require the laboratory to continue operations in the existing CMR facility.\"", "In its FY2009 report, the House Appropriations Committee stated, regarding CMRR and another facility at Los Alamos (the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility), \"In the absence of critical decisions on the nature and size of the stockpile, which in turn generate requirements for the nature and capacity of the nuclear weapons complex, it is impossible to determine the capacity required of either of these facilities. It would be imprudent to design and construct on the basis of a guess at their required capacity.\" It recommended no funds for either project. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million, an increase of $24.8 million, for CMRR \"to make up for [previous] funding shortfalls.\"", "As justification for the increase requested for CMRR for FY2011, NNSA states that capabilities at the CMR \"are currently substantially restricted,\" precluding the level of operations NNSA requires.
