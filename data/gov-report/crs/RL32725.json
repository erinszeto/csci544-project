Hemp can be grown as a fiber, seed, or other dual-purpose crop. However, hemp is also from the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa, as marijuana. As a result, production in the United States is restricted due to hemp's association with marijuana, and the U.S. market is largely dependent on imports, both as finished hemp-containing products and as ingredients for use in further processing (mostly from Canada and China). Current industry estimates report U.S. hemp sales at nearly $700 million annually.", "In the early 1990s there was a sustained resurgence of interest to allow for commercial hemp cultivation in the United States. Several states conducted economic or market studies and initiated or enacted legislation to expand state-level resources and production.

Industry groups maintain that (1) naturally occurring THC in the leaves and flowers of cannabis varieties grown for fiber and food is already at below-psychoactive levels (compared with drug varieties); (2) the parts used for food purposes (seeds and oil) contain even less; and (3) after processing, the THC content is at or close to zero. U.S. and Canadian hemp seed and food manufacturers have in place a voluntary program for certifying low, industry-determined standards in hemp-containing foods.

Then, in February, 2017, HIA again petitioned the court alleging that DEA violated the court's 2004 order when it indicated that a North Dakota hemp company would need a DEA registration and would be subject to other requirements before it could ship processed hemp products outside the state, even though these products were in accordance with state law and the 2014 farm bill.

While some in Congress and the U.S. hemp industry are encouraged by parts of the joint statement, they have also expressed concerns about other aspects of the joint statement. A summary of these issues is as follows.", "Clarification regarding who can grow/cultivate hemp . The joint statement acknowledges that the 2014 farm bill authorized \"State departments of agriculture, and persons licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized by them\" and \"institutions of higher education or persons employed by or under a production contract or lease with them\" to grow or cultivate industrial hemp as part of an agricultural pilot program in accordance with the 2014 farm bill.

Clarification regarding USDA research support for hemp .

Confusion regarding the definition of industrial hemp . Some in the hemp industry worry that the joint statement reinterprets the statutory definition of industrial hemp to cover fiber and seed only, excluding flowering tops, which they believe is covered by the farm bill definition. The flowering heads of the plant have the greatest cannabinoid content. They also worry that the joint statement expands upon inherent restrictions to the statutory definition in that it broadly highlights the term THC, which is defined to include \"all isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers of tetrahydrocannabinols,\" whereas the statutory definition in the 2014 farm bill specifies delta-9 THC, the dominant psychoactive cannabinoid of cannabis. Some in Congress claim that the executive branch is defining industrial hemp more narrowly than that defined in statute in that it \"drops the 'delta-9' when describing tetrahydrocannabinol\" and \"adds isomers, acids, and salts of isomers of THC to count against the 0.3% THC threshold.\" These Members of Congress have asked that the definition be removed from the guidance. Confusion regarding possible restrictions on commerce . Some in Congress note that the 2014 farm bill defined ''agricultural pilot program'' to mean \"a pilot program to study the growth, cultivation, or marketing of industrial hemp\" (italics added). These Members of Congress have asked for confirmation that \"general commercial activity\" does not prevent any types of sale from occurring from the framework of an approved pilot program. Likewise, the hemp industry remains concerned about the inclusion of language in the joint statement indicating that \"industrial hemp products ... may not be sold in States where such sale is prohibited.\" Broadly speaking \"industrial hemp products\" are already widely marketed, sold, and distributed. Some claim that this restriction on sales is contrary to provisions in both the CSA and the 2014 farm bill. Confusion regarding the transportation and sales of hemp . The joint statement also emphasizes that \"industrial hemp plants and seeds may not be transported across State lines,\" and restates DEA's position that the importation of viable cannabis seeds be carried out by DEA-registered persons, in accordance with CSIEA, seemingly to limit the sale of hemp products only in states with industrial hemp pilot programs. This remains a contentious issue following DEA's blocking of viable hemp seed in 2014. Some in Congress maintain that federal agencies do not have the authority to limit hemp sales or prohibit the transport of plants or seed under the 2014 farm bill.

Such a change could remove low-THC hemp from being covered by the CSA as a controlled substance subject to DEA regulation, thus allowing for industrial hemp to be grown and processed under some state laws. The bill could grant authority to any state permitting industrial hemp production and processing to determine whether any such cannabis plants met the limit on THC concentration as set forth in the CSA.

The new program expands upon the existing statutory definition to include any part of the Cannabis plant, including \"the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing, or not.\" It would clarify that allowable cultivation includes, in addition to states, tribal governments, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. Eligibility of \"state department of agriculture\" would be amended to mean the \"agency, commission, or department of a state government responsible for agriculture in the state.\" State or Indian tribes wanting primary regulatory authority over hemp production would be required to implement a \"plan\" under which the state or Indian tribe monitor and regulate hemp production. State and tribal plans would require grower information collection and procedures for testing, disposal (of hemp grown in violation and the law), and compliance. H.R. 5485 and S. 2667 authorize appropriations (\"such sums as are necessary\") for USDA to support and enforce state and tribal plans and further specifies requirements regarding the plan approval process, USDA technical assistance to develop plans, and necessary corrective action for plan violations.

Finally, the bills require that USDA conduct a study of USDA agricultural pilot programs, including the hemp pilot program, which would be repealed one year after enactment. USDA would also be required to conduct a study of USDA agricultural pilot programs, including the hemp pilot program in the 2014 farm bill.", "Earlier in the 115 th Congress, Representative Comer introduced a different version of the bill as part of the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017 (H.R.3530). In addition to exempting industrial hemp from definitions of marijuana in CSA, this version of the bill proposed to further expand the statutory definition of hemp to include viable seeds and to clarify that allowable cultivation includes Native American tribes in addition to states. It also includes a new definition for research hemp to include any part or derivative of the C annabis plant (including viable seeds) that has a delta-9 THC concentration of more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis but less than 0.6% on a dry weight basis and that is used in scientific, medical, or industrial research conducted by an institution of higher education or a state department of agriculture. H.R. 3530 would also require that states and tribes, upon the request of the U.S. Attorney General, submit information regarding hemp production, storage, distribution, or use.

Most CBD extracts currently being marketed for certain therapeutic purposes are generally formulated from strains of medical cannabis with THC levels higher than 0.3% but generally less than 1% THC. Some hemp-based CBD products\u2014mostly dietary supplements\u2014have been marketed as being rich in CBD and as having comparable therapeutic uses to CBD extracts.

Similar versions of these bills were introduced in the 114 th Congress and 113 th Congress. The House and Senate bills are related but are not identical. In addition to removing cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants, as defined, from regulation under CSA, the House bill would further exclude these from being applicable to requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which broadly regulates the quality and safety of foods and dietary supplements. This provision is not part of the Senate bill.", "There is also growing concern that hemp-based CBD products, derived from industrial hemp, are being marketed as being rich in CBD and as having comparable therapeutic uses to CBD extracts. Medicine-grade CBD is not produced or pressed from hemp seeds. Hemp seed oil, marketed as \"hemp oil,\" is made by pressing hemp seeds that contain low levels of CBD (typically less than 25 parts per million). Most of the CBD extracts currently being marketed for certain therapeutic purposes are generally formulated from strains of cannabis with THC levels higher than 0.3% but generally less than 1% THC. Some claim that scientific research shows that meaningful levels of CBD cannot be extracted from hemp. Also, FDA has continued to issue a number of notices and warning letters regarding its concerns about CBD, which is being marketed across a range of therapeutic/medicinal products. For more information, see CRS In Focus IF10391, Potential Use of Industrial Hemp in Cannabidiol Products .

According to FDA, these products are not \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" and the companies marketing these products are engaging in illegal interstate commerce. FDA has further determined that products containing CBD cannot be sold as dietary supplements and are excluded from the dietary supplement definition in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As such, FDA may consult with its federal and state partners about whether to initiate a federal enforcement action against the manufacturers of CBD products that are marketed as dietary supplements.

This action was in response to questions by a number of state and private research institutions on the extent to which industrial hemp initiatives were eligible for U.S. federal grant awards (both USDA and non-USDA program funds). These questions arose, in part, given mixed messages received by some land grant universities about whether they would qualify for USDA competitive grants to do industrial hemp research and initial indications that they would be denied such support. Some groups feared they could jeopardize eligibility for other grants if they pursued research into industrial hemp. ", "In late 2015, CRS staff attempted to get further clarification on USDA's policy regarding industrial hemp and federal grants and loans to support research of industrial hemp with limited success. Information provided from USDA was not always consistent and often conflicting. According to USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the agency had not awarded any competitive research grants for industrial hemp (as of September 2015). However, subsequent searches of USDA's Current Research Information System (CRIS) database indicate that NIFA formula-funded grants were used at Colorado State University for 2015 under available Hatch Act funding to study hemp cultivation as part of bigger grants about profitability of alternative agriculture in southern Colorado. Other available information, including correspondence between USDA and various congressional staff, suggests that USDA has no record of any application for industrial hemp research being denied. No additional information is available on whether any such applications had been proposed or would or could be approved.", "A USDA memo dating back to December 2014 states that \"NIFA supports\" grants for industrial hemp research so long as that research meets existing state requirements consistent with the requirements in the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 , \u00a77606; 7 U.S.C. 5940). However, USDA staff indicated that the December 2014 memo pertains only to what the statutory provision authorizes and does not say anything explicitly about federal funding of industrial hemp research. Although this response did not address the underlying issue regarding federal funding, it likely indicates that researchers working on industrial hemp may carry on with this work at least on their own (according to requirements specified in the 2014 farm bill) without threatening their status and working relationship with USDA.", "Other communication with USDA's Rural Development Agency indicated that the agency's Rural Business-Cooperative Service has initiated conversation with USDA's Office of the General Counsel to review whether its programs could potentially support the industrial hemp industry. There does not appear to be any legal reason why USDA would not be able to provide grant funding for research activities on industrial hemp within the language of the 2014 farm bill provision, and the question remains about whether USDA will fund such applications in the future. Specifically, clarification is needed regarding whether industrial hemp research projects are eligible for USDA competitive grants (e.g., under USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative program) and/or for Hatch Act formula funds, as well as clarification about whether hemp producers are eligible for other types of agricultural support from other USDA agencies (such as loans and grants administered by USDA's Rural Development Agency). ", "Some have suggested that perhaps industrial hemp might qualify under certain other USDA grant programs, such as NIFA's Specialty Crop Research Initiative or USDA's Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. However, industrial hemp is not included among the crops that are considered \"specialty crops\" and technically would not qualify for any grant specifically designated for specialty crop producers.

For example ", "In 2018, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Representative James Comer in support of the Hemp Farming Act of 2018 ( S. 2667 / H.R. 5485 ). NASDA claims that the bill addresses \"numerous issues hindering the success of industrial hemp pilot programs allowed under the 2014 farm bill.\" In 2017, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation (WFBF) sent a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue recommending that the Trump Administration consider hemp to be an agricultural crop. A reported 27 other Farm Bureau presidents supported the initiative. The bipartisan Congressional Cannabis Caucus\u2014launched in February 2017 by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, Don Young, Earl Blumenauer, and Jared Polis\u2014is focused on policy reforms regarding federal drugs laws and issues regarding legalization in some states. The National Farmers Union (NFU) updated its 2013 farm policy regarding hemp to urge the President, Attorney General, and Congress to direct DEA to \"reclassify industrial hemp as a non-controlled substance and adopt policy to allow American farmers to grow industrial hemp under state law without affecting eligibility for USDA benefits.\" Previously NFU's policy advocated that DEA \"differentiate between industrial hemp and marijuana and adopt policy to allow American farmers to grow industrial hemp under state law without requiring DEA licenses.\" In 2010, NASDA stated it \"supports revisions to the federal rules and regulations authorizing commercial production of industrial hemp\" and has urged USDA, DEA, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to \"collaboratively develop and adopt an official definition of industrial hemp that comports with definitions currently used by countries producing hemp.\" NASDA also \"urges Congress to statutorily distinguish between industrial hemp and marijuana and to direct DEA to revise its policies to allow USDA to establish a regulatory program that allows the development of domestic industrial hemp production by American farmers and manufacturers.\" NASDA first adopted a policy on industrial hemp in 2002. In 2014, the American Farm Bureau Federation, from efforts led by the Indiana Farm Bureau, endorsed a policy to support the \"production, processing, commercialization, and utilization of industrial hemp\" and reportedly also passed a policy resolution to oppose the \"classification of industrial hemp as a controlled substance.\" Previously, in 1995, the Farm Bureau had passed a resolution supporting \"research into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp production in the United States ... [and] further recommend that such research includes planting test plots in the United States using modern agricultural techniques.\" Regional farmers' organizations also have policies regarding hemp. For example, the North Dakota Farmers Union, as part of its federal agricultural policy recommendations, has urged \"Congress to legalize the production of industrial hemp.\" The Rocky Mountain Farmers Union has urged \"Congress and the USDA to re-commit and fully fund research into alternative crops and uses for crops\" including industrial hemp. Also, they \"support the decoupling of industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana\" under the CSA and \"demand the President and the Attorney General direct the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to differentiate between industrial hemp and marijuana and adopt a policy to allow American farmers to grow industrial hemp under state law without requiring DEA licenses\" to \"legalize the production of industrial hemp as an alternative crop for agricultural producers.\" The National Grange voted in 2009 to support \"research, production, processing and marketing of industrial hemp as a viable agricultural activity.\" In California, ongoing efforts to revise the definition of marijuana to exclude \"industrial hemp\" (SB 566) are supported by the state's sheriffs' association. The county farm bureau and two sheriffs' offices supported previous efforts in 2011 to establish a pilot program to grow industrial hemp in selected counties (although the state's governor later vetoed the bill, SB 676). North American Industrial Hemp Council\u2014a coalition of farmers, state legislators, former officials, scientists, merchants, entrepreneurs, and environmentalists\u2014filed a petition in June 2016 asking DEA to \"remove industrial hemp from the federal drug schedules.\" ", "Despite support by some, other groups continue to oppose policy changes regarding cannabis. For example, the National Alliance for Health and Safety, as part of Drug Watch International, claims that proposals to reintroduce hemp as an agricultural crop are merely a strategy by \"the international pro-drug lobby to legalize cannabis and other illicit substances.\" The California Narcotic Officers' Association claims that allowing for industrial hemp production would undermine state and federal enforcement efforts to regulate marijuana production, since, they claim, the two crops are not distinguishable through ground or aerial surveillance but would require costly and time-consuming lab work to be conducted. This group also claims that these similarities would create an incentive to use hemp crops to mask illicit marijuana production, since marijuana is such a lucrative cash crop. Concerns about the potential linkages to the growing and use of illegal drugs are also expressed by some parent and community organizations, such as the Drug Free America Foundation and PRIDE. ", "Given DEA's current policy positions and perceived DEA opposition to changing its current policies because of concerns over how to allow for hemp production without undermining the agency's drug enforcement efforts and regulation of the production and distribution of marijuana, hemp proponents say that further policy changes regarding industrial hemp are likely not forthcoming absent congressional legislative action.
