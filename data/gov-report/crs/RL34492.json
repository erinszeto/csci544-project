In doing so, it also represents a continuation of efforts to realize greater efficiencies and reduce redundancies through improved intergovernmental coordination, and by aligning IT investments. The law contains a variety of provisions related to federal government IT management, information security, and the provision of services and information electronically. One of the most recognized provisions involves the creation of an Office of Electronic Government (OEG) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OEG is headed by an Administrator, who is responsible for carrying out a variety of information resources management (IRM) functions, as well as administering the interagency E-Government Fund authorized by the law.", "The E-Government Act also served an important role in providing the first, and current, official federal definition of e-government. As a somewhat amorphous concept, the term electronic government, or e-government, conjures different images for different people. For some, it is submitting a form online. For others, it might be sending an e-mail message to their Member of Congress. A 2000 Gartner Group report described e-government as \"the continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet, and new media.\" A year later, Mark Forman, the first Associate Director for Information Technology and E-Government at (OMB), defined e-government as \"the use of Internet technology and protocols to transform agency effectiveness, efficiency, and service quality.\" Section 2 of the E-Government Act defines e-government as:", "the use by the Government of web-based Internet applications and other information technologies, combined with processes that implement these technologies, to (A) enhance the access to and delivery of Government information and services to the public, other agencies, and other Government entities; or (B) bring about improvements in Government operations that may include effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation.", "In addition, Section 207 of the E-Government Act broke new ground by establishing requirements for the accessibility, usability, and preservation of electronic government information. However, while the reporting requirements of this section appear to have been fulfilled, ongoing concerns about issues such as the archiving of official electronic records and the accessibility of current electronic information for citizens have prompted the introduction of new legislation in the 110 th Congress. For example, the revelation of deficiencies regarding the retention and preservation of official electronic communications (i.e., e-mail messages) by the White House have contributed to calls for more stringent rules and oversight related to the archiving of such materials. Similarly, S. 2321 , the E-Government Reauthorization Act of 2007, includes a provision (discussed later in this report) requiring the Director of OMB to promulgate new guidelines to make federal websites more searchable by online search engines such as Google or Yahoo! Search.", "While many of the Bush Administration's e-government initiatives are separate from, and pre-date, the E-Government Act, some of the goals of these initiatives are statutorily affirmed by the act's provisions. For example, Section 216 addresses the development of common protocols for geographic information systems, which is also one of the objectives of the Geospatial One-Stop project. Section 206 directs agencies to use electronic dockets in their rulemaking process, which represents a more distributed alternative to the centralized docket being implemented under the Regulations.gov initiative. Section 203 directs agencies to adopt electronic signature methods. Likewise, the E-Authentication initiative strives to develop a government-wide approach to electronic identity systems. In addition, some of the act's broader provisions, such as those related to the development of privacy guidelines, information security standards, and the identification of means to bridge disparities in Internet access among citizens, contribute to the technological and regulatory infrastructure needed to support e-government generally.", "Funding for e-government activities was to be primarily provided through a combination of a dedicated fund in the form of the E-Government Fund, as well as other appropriations specifically authorized in the E-Government Act. As discussed later in this report, the E-Government Fund was established by Title I of the E-Government Act to serve as a dedicated funding source for interagency IT projects. However, although the E-Government Act authorized a cumulative minimum of $345 million from FY2003-FY2007, concerns regarding oversight have prompted Congress to appropriate no more than $5 million in any given fiscal year since the passage of the act. Congress has also repeatedly declined to approve the Bush Administration's alternative proposals to allow OMB to tap the $40 million surplus fund of GSA's General Supply Fund. Partly as a consequence of the relatively small amounts appropriated for the E-Government Fund, OMB has attempted to finance various e-government projects through an interagency \"pass-the-hat\" approach. Using this model, departments and agencies have been expected to contribute a portion of their budget to the managing partner department or agency responsible for developing the shared e-government application or service.", "Shortly before the fifth anniversary of the passage of the E-Government Act, authorization of appropriations for several key provisions expired on September 30, 2007.

Although the authorizations of appropriations for these provisions have expired, the activities have continued to be funded through the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ) for FY2008. Congress does, at times, approve spending for unauthorized appropriations to maintain the continuity of programs and services.", "However, the occasion to consider reauthorization of the E-Government Act provides Congress the opportunity to assess the results of federal e-government initiatives since 2002, consider how they have affected the administration of government, and decide what changes, if any, are necessary. In considering whether to reauthorize any, some, or all of these provisions, Congress could choose to amend the E-Government Act to establish a permanent authorization for the functions and structures that have become integral to the operation of government. Congress could also choose to add new provisions to reflect the maturing of both the initiatives and technology now in place. Likewise, Congress could choose to eliminate provisions that have not met expectations or that have been subsumed by changes in events and/or technology.

At the hearing, Senator Lieberman described the bill as \"a work in progress\" and said that he expected the bill to change as further comments and feedback were received. This initial bill was itself partly the product of comments received through a website launched by Senator Lieberman and Senator Fred Thompson on May 18, 2000. The website, called the E-Government Project, solicited comments from the public, as well as government agencies, on 44 topics in what was referred to as an \"experiment in interactive legislation.\" Operated as a mediated forum to emphasize \"appropriateness and relevance,\" \"nearly 1,000 comments were submitted, approximately one-half of which were posted on the website after being reviewed by Committee staff.\" Also, on July 11, 2001, Representative Jim Turner introduced H.R. 2458 , identical to the original version of S. 803 , which was referred to the Committee on Government Reform.", "On March 21, 2002, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs approved an amendment in the nature of a substitute for S. 803 . Some of the differences between the original bill and the amendment included the replacement of a provision that would have established a federal chief information officer with a provision to establish an Office of E-Government within OMB to be headed by a Senate-confirmed Administrator; the replacement of a plan for an online telephone directory with a provision for a full federal Internet portal; and a consolidation of a variety of reporting requirements into a single annual e-government report to be submitted to Congress by OMB.

The subcommittee subsequently marked up and forwarded an amended version of H.R. 2458 to the full committee by voice vote on October 1, 2002. During the markup session, the Subcommittee approved a number of amendments, including some that drew from other legislation before the Subcommittee. The amendments included making the E-Government Administrator position an appointed position not requiring Senate confirmation; adding the Information Technology Exchange Program (based on a proposal in H.R. 3295 , the Digital Tech Corps Act of 2002); authorization of Share-in-Savings contracts (based on a proposal in H.R. 3832 , the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA)); and adding a program to encourage and solicit innovative solutions to facilitate the development of electronic government services and processes (based on H.R. 4629 ).", "On October 9, 2002, the House Committee on Government Reform held a markup session in which an amendment to require Senate confirmation for the Administrator of the Office of E-Government was rejected by voice vote.

It also requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to consult with the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government on any efforts by GSA to promote e-government.", "Title I also amends Title 44 of the United States Code by adding a chapter on \"Management and Promotion of Electronic Government Services,\" which focuses on issues related to the functions of the Administrator of the OEG, the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council, and the E-Government Fund (discussed below). The chapter makes the Administrator of OEG responsible for carrying out a variety of IRM functions. Some of these responsibilities include advising the OMB Director on IRM resources and strategies; providing \"overall leadership and direction on electronic government\"; promoting the effective and innovative use of IT by agencies, especially through multi-agency collaborative projects; administering and distributing funds from the E-Government Fund; consulting with GSA \"to promote electronic government and the efficient use of information technologies by agencies\"; leading activities on behalf of the OMB Deputy Director for Management, who serves as the chair of the CIO Council; assisting the OMB Director \"in establishing policies which shall set the framework for information technology standards\" to be developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology; sponsoring an ongoing dialogue with federal, state, local, and tribal leaders to encourage collaboration and enhance consultation on IT best practices and innovation; promoting electronic procurement initiatives; and implementing accessibility standards.", "In addition, Title I establishes the CIO Council by law, with the OMB Deputy Director for Management as the chair, and details its organizational structure and mandate. Furthermore, Title I establishes an E-Government Fund for interagency information technology projects. The fund is to be administered by the GSA Administrator, with the assistance of the Administrator of OEG. The provision authorizes appropriations for the E-Government Fund in the following amounts: $45 million for FY2003, $50 million for FY2004, $100 million for FY2005, $150 million for FY2006, and \"such sums as necessary for fiscal year 2007.\" The provision also allows funds to be made available until expended, and requires the OMB Director to submit annual reports to the President and Congress regarding the operation of the fund.", "Title II focuses on enhancing a variety of e-government services, establishing performance measures, and clarifying OMB's role as the leader and coordinator of federal e-government services.

It also requires agencies to conduct annual independent evaluations of their information security programs and practices. Agencies operating or controlling national security systems are also responsible for maintaining the appropriate level of information security protections for these systems. In addition, FISMA amends the Clinger-Cohen Act by requiring the Secretary of Commerce, on the basis of proposals developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to promulgate information security standards for federal information systems. It also amends Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act by affirming the role of NIST to develop standards, guidelines, and minimum requirements for information systems used by federal agencies, or by contractors on behalf of an agency. It also directs NIST to carry out these activities in consultation and coordination with the relevant agencies and offices, including, but not limited to, the OMB Director, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and the Secretary of Homeland Security.

Another example is Grants.gov, which provides a single site to search and apply for grants awarded by 26 federal grant-making agencies.", "However, while these initiatives have improved citizens' access to government information, concerns were raised that significant amounts of online government information are \"invisible\" or are not accessible to commercial search engines. This problem can affect government search engines as well, as many utilize the same technology used by commercial search engines. Ari Schwartz, citing a Pew Internet Project report, stated that while \"commercial search engines are the most popular means to find government information,\" many publicly available federal websites, either purposely or unintentionally, do not enable content to be indexed by these search engines. Some sites purposely include code to limit the ability of search engines to index content, while other sites simply do not include commonly used protocols created to facilitate a search engine's ability to index the content of a site. One protocol singled out during the hearing was the Sitemap Protocol. This technical standard was originally developed by Google and is compatible with several of the most widely used search engines. According to John Lewis Needham, the Sitemap Protocol \"provides a mechanism for a website owner to product a list -or a map -of all web pages on a site and systematically communicate this information or 'Sitemap' to search engines.\" While an increasing number of federal websites appear to be using this protocol, some do not. As discussed earlier in this report, Section 4 of the E-Government Reauthorization Act would direct OMB to promulgate guidance and best practices to make online federal information more accessible to commercial and government search engines.", "Other matters discussed during the hearing included outcomes since the passage of the E-Government Act; the effectiveness of current privacy protections for citizens; and the potential for Web 2.0 collaborative technologies to improve interaction between government agencies and citizens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["In considering whether to reauthorize the E-Government Act, Congress may also wish to consider a number of other issues related to the implementation and oversight of the E-Government Act, and e-government initiatives generally.

In contrast, the federal government spent $65.5 billion on information technology investments in FY2007. Although the cost savings from e-government appears to be relatively small, Congress may wish to consider whether these e-government initiatives have delivered other, non-financial benefits to government and citizens.
