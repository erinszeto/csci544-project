The issue remains of interest toward the end of the 114th Congress for a number of reasons, including ongoing concerns about the status of disease and risks of future outbreaks, and interest in the disposition of funds appropriated by Congress in response to Ebola, especially in view of the more recent health challenge posed by the Zika virus. This report discusses ongoing efforts to control Ebola in West Africa, analyzes persistent challenges in fighting the spread of the disease, and tracks Ebola emergency funds.", "Key milestones in the Ebola outbreak include the following:", "In March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a \"rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola)\" had begun in Guinea, West Africa. Retroactive studies indicated that the virus had likely begun to spread in late December 2013, but that weak disease detection and surveillance systems had failed to identify the outbreak. From Guinea, the disease spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone and continued to infect thousands in the three countries until mid-2015, when a coordinated, high-level response by the international community began to slow the rate of new infections. In August 2014, WHO declared Ebola a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and one month later, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon established the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) to coordinate the U.N. response to the outbreak. WHO came under some broad criticism for what was viewed as a late designation for the emergency. Following the PHEIC declaration, the United States and other actors exerted a concerted effort to contain the disease, and cases began to decline rapidly. By the end of December 2015, the fight against the West Africa Ebola outbreak reached a pivotal point. On December 29, WHO declared that human-to-human Ebola transmission had ended in Guinea, marking the first time all three countries had stopped the original chains of transmission at the same time. By this time, WHO had reported over 28,000 confirmed, probable, and suspected Ebola cases worldwide, including more than 11,000 deaths. On March 29, 2016, WHO declared that the West Africa Ebola outbreak was no longer a PHEIC, although the disease was still in a phase that could experience infrequent flare-ups. In addition, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone continue to face considerable infrastructural constraints.", "Congress appropriated $5.4 billion in FY2015 emergency supplemental appropriations for domestic and international responses to the Ebola outbreak (in Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, P.L. 113-235, December 2014). Of the funds appropriated for international responses (in Title IX, Division J), roughly half were for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These funds, which totaled more than $2.5 billion, were limited for Ebola responses, although the law permitted funds from some accounts to be used for preparedness efforts in countries \"at risk of being affected by\" the outbreak.", "With some Ebola supplemental funds still unobligated, some in the 114th Congress have looked to these funds as a potential source for responses to the emergent Zika virus. The Obama Administration has requested new funds to support a Zika response and has also reprogrammed some Ebola funds for Zika. The House and Senate have considered legislation in response to the request (S. 2843 and H.R. 5044, respectively. For more information, see CRS Report R44460, Zika Response Funding: Request and Congressional Action). Some Members of the House Appropriations Committee have called on the Administration to expend unobligated Ebola funds before considering the Zika request. Other Members oppose this idea and maintain that remaining Ebola funds should be preserved and used to strengthen the still weak health systems in West Africa that initially failed to detect and contain the outbreak."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that health officials in Guinea had identified a \"rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola).\" Retroactive studies indicated that the virus had likely begun to spread in late December 2013, but that weak disease detection and surveillance systems had failed to identify the outbreak.

Some groups, including Doctors Without Borders, criticized WHO for the delayed designation. Following the PHEIC declaration, the United States and other actors exerted a concerted effort to contain the disease, and cases began to decline rapidly.

Other department and agencies also provided support for specific purposes. The DOD, for example, deployed nearly 3,000 troops to the region who constructed ETUs. Other U.S. officials posted temporarily to the region included more than 1,000 CDC personnel and 465 USAID staff. U.S. agencies have collaborated in West Africa to ", "procure rapid Ebola diagnostic tests; support contact tracing; construct ETUs to facilitate the isolation of Ebola patients and fund community care centers; train thousands of health care workers on how to screen individuals for potential Ebola signs and symptoms and how to implement contact tracing programs; provide mobile laboratories and open new laboratory testing facilities in the region to increase; diagnostic capacity; promote coordination, operations, and communication efforts surrounding the response; and support the operation of emergency operations centers, safe burial teams, and health care systems in West Africa.

During Phase 2, responders emphasized disease surveillance, contact tracing, and community engagement. The marked decline in cases that occurred during the second phase signaled a transition to the third phase.

At the meeting, health officials from the three countries \"expressed confidence in the capacity\u2026to effectively manage residual risks of new Ebola infections\u2014pointing to the rapid government-led containment of recent flare-ups of the disease.\" Since the primary Ebola outbreak ended in December 2015, the three countries have successfully led collaborative efforts to contain small outbreaks. Representatives from the three countries also highlighted increased efforts to utilize cross-country cooperative approaches for Ebola control. In March 2016, for example, Guinean, Liberian and WHO officials along with other partners identified and contained a small outbreak, which caused 13 suspected cases in Guinea and Liberia (the outbreak originated in Guinea and was imported into Liberia). ", "In response to the March 2016 outbreak, local Guinean health authorities reactivated the emergency coordination mechanism that was instituted at the height of the Ebola epidemic to manage an inter-agency response, which included the deployment of 75 WHO epidemiologists, surveillance experts, contact tracers, vaccinators, social mobilizers, health promoters, and infection prevention and control experts. The interagency team also included non-governmental organizations, which provided food packages, hygiene kits, and cash stipends to the more than 1,000 contacts who had been identified and placed under medical observation. More than 1,500 people have been vaccinated with the experimental Ebola vaccine VSV-EBOV to contain the March 2016 flare-up. The vaccine was developed by NewLink Genetics and Merck Vaccines USA in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada. A large clinical trial conducted in 2015 by the Guinean Ministry of Health, WHO and implementing partners, including NIH, demonstrated that it was highly effective at preventing Ebola infection. The \"ring vaccination\" strategy, which involves vaccinating anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola-infected person, as well as their own contacts, has become part of standard operating procedures when responding to Ebola flare-ups.

USAID supported the development of infection prevention and control (IPC) training curriculum, conducted IPC training, and supervised health practitioners to ensure adherence to IPC protocols, while CDC aided in the development of a national IPC policy and strategy and supported IPC action plans in recently affected prefectures.

The three countries, nonetheless, continue to face challenges both in sustaining Ebola control efforts and in addressing broader health issues within their borders. At the March meeting convened by WHO, representatives from the three countries expressed concerns about the long-term capacity to sustain the significant human resources that are required to respond to Ebola flare-ups, address the long-term health needs of Ebola survivors, and prevent further transmission. Country leaders also were skeptical that they had the capacity to maintain lab capacity, establish and train rapid response teams, sustain infectious diseases surveillance and response systems, and ensure that Ebola survivors have access to specialized services for health complications like eye and neurology care, as well as to semen- and breast-milk-testing programs.

Health practitioners may contract Ebola from infected pregnant women through contact with infectious intrauterine contents (amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetus) during delivery and/or management of obstetric complications.

Scientists are uncertain about the precise duration and infectivity of Ebola virus in breastmilk. Ebola virus has been detected in the breastmilk of female Ebola survivors up to 16 months after onset of symptoms. As a result, WHO encourages Ebola survivors who are lactating to have their breastmilk tested for Ebola virus. If Ebola virus is detected, WHO recommends that women suspend breastfeeding, use premixed infant formula (as opposed to powdered formula that requires added water\u2014access to clean water is limited in the three countries and diarrhea, primarily caused by ingestion of tainted water, is a leading cause of childhood death in the three countries), and have their breastmilk retested every 48 hours until two consecutive \"undetected\" results are obtained.

According to a program director with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), \"The fear is that now that Ebola's over, all of that will just go out the window.\" Observers are particularly apprehensive about whether supplies, IPC practices, and supplemental payment of health personnel will continue as international assistance decreases. Media reports following Liberia's November 2015 Ebola outbreak, for example, noted lapses in IPC protocol. One expert concluded that the \"very gaps in basic infection control that facilitated the epidemic's growth in the first place have still not been addressed.\" Media reports also indicate that some health clinics continue to experience interruptions in running water, for instance, inhibiting the capacity to adhere to IPC protocol.

All three countries continue to face considerable infrastructural constraints. At the end of December 2015, for example, USAID was still helping Guinean health officials to resolve supply chain management issues that impeded reliable distribution of personal protective equipment to health facilities. ", "Analysts are also concerned about how the numerous Ebola deaths of health workers, lingering mistrust of government health facilities, and long-term health issues facing the more than 11,000 Ebola survivors may affect the ability of the countries to restore and improve their health systems. Even before the outbreak began, people in these countries had limited access to health services and had the highest infant, child and maternal rates in the world ( Figure A-2 ). For example, 10% of all Guinean children younger than five, 7% of Liberian children in the same age group, and 16% of Sierra Leonean children under five years died before age five in 2013, mostly from preventable causes. On average, 4.5% of all children worldwide died before age five in 2013, while in sub-Saharan Africa 9% of all children died, on average, before their fifth birthday. At the height of the outbreak, delivery of services was severely disrupted. In Liberia, the epidemic contributed to a 61% decline in outpatient visits. Malaria care for children declined by 39% in Sierra Leone and immunizations fell by 21%. Similarly, at the height of the epidemic in Guinea, primary medical consultations dropped by 58%, hospitalizations by 54%, and vaccinations by 30% compared to 2013. In addition, the high number of Ebola deaths among health workers has further limited the supply of health personnel and has led to additional restrictions on delivery of health services. More than 500 health workers have been killed by Ebola in the three countries.", "Although comprehensive data is not yet available, health experts expect that non-Ebola related illnesses and deaths have increased due to interruptions in basic health care delivery, including safe labor and delivery services, vaccination campaigns, and care, prevention and treatment services for infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. A recent analysis concluded that during the Ebola outbreak, approximately 600 more Liberians than normal died from TB, and 1,000 more from malaria and HIV due to inadequate capacity in the health care system. Observers are also concerned about the long-term impact of Ebola-related health worker deaths on the ability to provide basic health care, including ensuring Ebola survivors have adequate access to commodities and services that can prevent Ebola transmission.", "The outbreak also severely damaged the Guinean, Liberian, and Sierra Leonean economies. The Sierra Leonean economy, for example, is estimated to have contracted by 21.5% in 2015, and around 7,500 jobs were lost in the country, following the closure of two mines. Although employment levels have reportedly rebounded to pre-Ebola levels, surveyed employees were working fewer hours and earning lower wages. Roughly 12% of Liberian businesses surveyed during the peak of the outbreak have since closed and economic growth in Guinea fell from 2.3% in 2013 to 0.6% in 2014. Guinean financial experts expect, however, that the country's economy will expand by 4.3% in 2016, and observers project that Sierra Leone's economy may grow by 20% in 2017. ", "Although the economies of the three countries are reportedly recovering, the economic deficits incurred during the outbreak may slow the pace at which the countries can rebuild and bolster their health systems. As one recent study concluded, the repercussions of inadequate health infrastructure \"will continue long after our study period,\" and play a factor in \"perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty and disease that leaves children unable to receive education and adults incapable of achieving their potential productivity and fully contributing to the development of their communities.\" In its plan for health system development, Liberia's Ministry of Health describes its own health facilities as \"ill-designed and poorly equipped to provide the necessary occupational and patient safety needed for the delivery of safe and effective health service,\" conditions that a virus such as Ebola can easily exploit. Liberia's Ministry of Health has estimated the cost of building a resilient health system that restores capacity lost due to the Ebola outbreak, and is capable of addressing future epidemics and other health threats at $489 million through FY2016 and FY2017, with an additional $1.21 billion through FY2022.

As of March 1, 2016, almost 70% of USAID obligations were associated with activities to control the Ebola outbreak (Phase 1), while addressing second order impacts (like food insecurity) and strengthening global health security (Phase 3) both amounted to 16% of USAID obligations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination of International and U.S. Response to Ebola and Future Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["Some health observers recommend that the U.S. government should take a more active role to ensure that the WHO is better suited to address future outbreaks, provide incentives to ensure that vulnerable countries increase their health security, and provide consistent, permanent funding for disease outbreak preparedness and response. Specifically, they propose that the USAID or the CDC develop incentives for countries to adopt best practices in disease response and preparedness. By incentivizing progress toward strengthening disease surveillance and preparedness systems, they argue that the United States could more effectively leverage limited resources and ensure a better response to future outbreaks.", "Other proposals include revising existing approaches that seem to depend on ad hoc interagency task forces and emergency budget requests. Some global health analysts propose that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examine possible budget instruments for ensuring permanent preparedness and protection. Other recommendations include contributing to the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility or developing a U.S. global health emergency fund that would allow for faster release of financing for foreign countries and provide coordinated funding mechanism at each stage of pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integrated and Consistent Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Some observers propose that Congress require U.S. agencies to report data on Ebola spending and progress in a more integrated, consistent, and publicly available manner. Quarterly progress reports from USAID on ongoing Ebola efforts provide an overview of the activities supported but do not provide adequate information on outputs and outcomes. Similarly, Congress lacks sufficient information on the outcomes of activities supported by HHS and other implementing agencies that lack reporting requirements. Because public health crises such as the Ebola outbreak involve multiple agencies and budgets, some argue that appropriate mechanisms should exist to record how monies are being spent and to specifically link performance indicators and targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investing in Research", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, three disease outbreaks (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika) have spread from Latin America and the Caribbean into the United States. These and other diseases that have been mostly neglected by the global pharmaceutical industry lack vaccines to prevent transmission or treatment regimens. Several groups call for increasing investments in research and development for \"neglected diseases.\" A consortium of health experts estimates that the international community would need to double current investments in health research and development from $3 billion in 2014 to $6 billion by 2020 to meet global health goals. ", "According to a report written by the Global Health Technologies Coalition, the United States accounts for roughly 70% of public investment and 45% of global investment in global health research and development. The report also indicated that the United States provides the highest amounts of funding for research and development for 26 of the 30 most neglected diseases, and as of 2012, supported more than half of the global health products in the development pipeline. Since peaking in 2009, however, U.S. funding for global health research and development has fluctuated ( Figure 2 ). ", "Some global health experts have proposed that Congress increase funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program to encourage additional investments in research on neglected diseases. The PRV allows companies to fast-track a product through the FDA regulatory process. Others propose adding a \"novelty\" requirement to the program to ensure that the PRV program encourages new investments rather than improvements on existing medication that is highly profitable. Another recommendation is that Congress revise authorizing language to ensure that products granted a FDA priority voucher are affordable. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Supplemental Information", "paragraphs": ["Examples of U.S. Support for the West Africa Ebola Outbreak", "USAID and implementing HHS agencies have carried out to support restoration of basic health services and advance long-term EBOLA control. The examples below were summarized from the February 2016 report jointly published by the Inspectors General of USAID and HHS.", "USAID. Across the three countries, USAID has supported the construction of temporary isolation units at health care facilities to integrate EBOLA care into existing health infrastructure, building and strengthening rapid response capacity, and institutionalizing infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols and EBOLA screening at government hospitals. In Sierra Leone, USAID supported the construction of 90 semipermanent isolation units to address EBOLA cases and treat other communicable diseases. Across the three countries, USAID funded efforts to strengthen the government supply chain system. In Liberia, for example, USAID provided technical assistance to quantify IPC commodities and improve warehouse management, while in Sierra Leone, USAID provided technical assistance to monitor and track supplies and essential medicines.", "USAID also led interagency transition planning in each country to determine how U.S. government-supported activities would be transferred to host governments or other implementing partners. In Liberia, USAID provided technical assistance to reopen primary health care facilities that provide routine maternal and child health services, completed baseline facility assessments at 61 health facilities, provided essential medicines to community clinics, and supported immunization campaigns. The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), which coordinated all U.S. Ebola responses in West Africa, disbanded on January 4, 2016. Since then, country program offices in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have led EBOLA responses in the respective countries. ", "CDC . In Liberia, CDC has supported the development of a national training curriculum that promotes health care worker safety and quality of health care services that reached more than 1,000 health care workers, and provided technical assistance to the Liberian Ministry of Health for the development of a new IPC quality management unit. In Sierra Leone, CDC funded training on the country's national IPC guidelines for 50 hospital and district workers in October 2015. CDC also led U.S. efforts to enhance EBOLA surveillance by facilitating the procurement and appropriate use of alternative EBOLA diagnostic tools and providing mobile laboratories. ", "In Sierra Leone, CDC sponsored the STRIVE trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV candidate. The trial, conducted in December 2015 and jointly conducted by the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS), University of Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), and CDC enrolled and vaccinated more than 8,000 participants. In Liberia, CDC supported health officials to conduct voluntary semen screening and counselling programs for male survivors to educate male survivors about transmission risks and provide them with the necessary tools to reduce the risk of transmission. According to WHO, 405 male survivors had their semen screened as of January 3, 2016. CDC also supported semen testing programs in Sierra Leone, which reportedly enrolled more than 650 male EBOLA survivors as of December 14, 2015. The program, entitled Project SHIELD, was led by Britain and implemented in partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone and also trained health care workers and peer networks to provide sexual risk reduction counseling.", "Other HHS Agencies. Several U.S. agencies collaborated to support clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of several EBOLA vaccine and therapeutic candidates in the United States and West Africa. In Liberia, for example, NIH and CDC partnered with Liberian government officials to conduct the PREVAIL I study, which enrolled, 1,500 volunteers to test the safety of and immune system response to two Ebola vaccine candidates (cAd3-EBOZ vaccine, co-developed by NIH and GlaxoSmithKline, and the rVSV-ZEBOV, developed by scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.). When new EBOLA cases emerged in Liberia in November 2015, the FDA facilitated export of and access to the rVSV-ZEBOV candidate to that country. In that vaccination campaign, the Government of Liberia and NIH vaccinated approximately 170 individuals. ", "In June 2015, NIH, CDC, and the Government of Liberia launched the PREVAIL III study to help understand the long-term consequences of EBOLA, characterize associated health problems, determine whether \"survivors develop immunity that will protect them from future Ebola infection, and assess whether [survivors] can transmit Ebola infection to close contacts and sexual partners.\" As of January 4, 2016, more than 1,788 individuals had been enrolled in the study.
