However, industry stakeholders point to analyses indicating that GHG emissions from oil sands crude oil are comparable to other heavy crudes, some of which are produced and/or consumed currently in the United States.", "Due to oil sands' increased emissions intensity, many stakeholders have voiced concern about potential climate change consequences associated with oil sands development. In June 2013, President Obama stated that an evaluation of the \"net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate\" would factor into the Department of State's (DOS's) national interest determination in order to determine if the project would \"significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.\" Thus, DOS's 2014 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) has received considerable attention. Among other conclusions, the FEIS estimated that the incremental (i.e., net) life-cycle GHG emissions associated with the pipeline would be 1.3 million to 27.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (0.02%-0.4% of U.S. annual GHG emissions). In addition, the FEIS stated that the \"approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.\"", "Some stakeholders have questioned these conclusions, arguing (1) that the project may have greater climate change impacts than projected by DOS, and (2) that there is nothing presumed or inevitable about the rate of expansion for the Canadian oil sands. Other stakeholders support the FEIS analysis, arguing that as long as there is strong global demand for petroleum products, resources such as the Canadian oil sands will be produced and shipped to markets using whatever route necessary.", "Oil Spills and Other Local Impacts", "Some groups have argued that both the pipeline's operating parameters and the material being transported through it impose an increased spill risk. The National Academy of Sciences National Research Council examined this issue in a 2013 report, stating that it did not \"find any causes of pipeline failure unique to the transportation of diluted bitumen [oil sands crude].\" However, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), spills of oil sands crude may result in different impacts than spills of other crude oils.", "Other environmental concerns pertain to the region in which the oil sands resources are extracted. Potential impacts include, among others, wildlife and ecosystem disturbance and water resource issues.

Some raise concerns about potential local impacts, such as oil spills. Some highlight the oil extraction impacts in Canada. Some argue the pipeline would have national energy and climate change policy implications.

DilBit may be blended as 25% to 30% condensate and 70% to 75% bitumen. Synthetic bitumen (Synbit). Synbit is typically a combination of bitumen and SCO.

Although the definition of \"heavy\" crude oil may vary, it is generally defined by refiners as being at or below 22\" API gravity. Sulfur Content. Sulfur content in crude oil is an indication of potential corrosiveness due to the presence of acidic sulfur compounds. Sulfur content is measured as an overall percentage of free sulfur and sulfur compounds in a crude oil by weight. Total sulfur content in crude oils generally ranges from below 0.05% to 5.0%. Crudes with more than 1.0% free sulfur or other sulfur-containing compounds are typically referred to as \"sour,\" below 0.5% sulfur as \"sweet.\" Total Acid Number. Total Acid Number (TAN) measures the composition of acids in a crude which can gauge its potential for corrosion, particularly in a refinery. TAN value is measured as the number of milligrams (mg) of potassium hydroxide (KOH) needed to neutralize the acids in one gram of oil. As a rule-of-thumb, crude oils with a TAN greater than 0.5 are considered to be potentially corrosive due to the presence of naphthenic acids.", " Table 1 compares Alberta's different oil sands crudes with other crude oils extracted in the United States and around the world.

The 2014 FEIS finds the following:", "the GHG emissions released during the construction period for the project would be approximately 0.24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCO 2 e) due to land use changes, electricity use, and fuels for construction vehicles (equivalent to 0.004% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); the GHG emissions released during normal operations would be approximately 1.44 MMTCO 2 e/year due to electricity use for pumping stations, fuels for maintenance and inspection vehicles, and fugitive emissions (equivalent to 0.02% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); the total, or gross, life-cycle GHG emissions (i.e., the aggregate GHG emissions released by all activities from the extraction of the resource to the refining, transportation, and end-use combustion of refined fuels) attributable to the oil sands crude transported through the proposed pipeline would be approximately 147 to 168 MMTCO 2 e per year (equivalent to 2.2%-2.6% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); the incremental, or net, life-cycle GHG emissions (i.e., GHG emissions over-and-above those from the crude oils expected to be displaced in U.S. refineries) is estimated to be 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO 2 e per year (equivalent to 0.02%-0.4% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); but according to the State Department's market analysis, \"approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.\"", "The 2014 FEIS presents the crude oil market analysis separately from the GHG emissions assessment. By determining that the most likely scenario is one in which oil sands production would be unaffected by expected market conditions, the Final EIS implies that the \"incremental\" life-cycle GHG emissions attributable to the oil sands crudes transported through the proposed pipeline are negligible. With this determination, the only difference in estimates between competing scenarios would be attributable to the operational GHG emissions of the alternative modes of transportation (e.g., GHG emissions from rail cars, trucks, or tankers versus the pipeline). The FEIS reports that the annual operational emissions attributed to the \"no action\" alternatives range from 4.0 to 4.4 MMTCO 2 e per year (an increase of 29%-42% over the 3.1 MMTCO 2 e per year in operational emissions for the proposed project inclusive of the existing southern leg).", "Some stakeholders have questioned many of the conclusions in the 2014 FEIS and argue that the project may have greater climate change impacts than the DOS projects.

Current oil sands projects face a challenging financial environment, and up-front production costs and price differentials are comparatively higher for oil sands crudes, making new investment sensitive to changes in supply costs and global prices. Commentators have highlighted the many reported instances where current price discounts for oil sands crudes have dampened investment and project development, including questions about whether rail transport will be used if the pipeline is not built. They stress that oil market projections and transportation options are rife with uncertainty, and that the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline could have a much more significant impact on expansion if a number of key variables differ from the DOS assumptions. These variables include lower global oil prices than projected; higher rail costs than projected; higher new project costs than expected; greater competition from shale oil and tight oil plays; and future carbon pricing or procurement policies in the United States or Canada. Any decrease or delay in oil sands development could have significant impacts on the rate of growth in global GHG emissions both directly (by curtailing production) and indirectly (by allowing more time for the development of energy-efficiency strategies, the promulgation of climate policies, and the deployment of lower-carbon energy technologies).", "On the other hand, other stakeholders agree with a market analysis similar to the one outlined in the 2014 FEIS.

They see future investment affected only in scenarios where the global price of oil falls below supply costs for an extended period of time. They see current production affected only in scenarios that assume all pipeline transport capacity is frozen and no other transport capacity (such as rail or tanker) is available. They contend that incentives are too great for oil sands producers and the Canadian and Albertan governments to leave the oil in the ground; and that once the oil is extracted, the market would likely respond by adding adequate transport capacity over time. They contend that scaling up transport is logistically and economically feasible, based on past and present evidence in the Powder River Basin and the Bakken, as well as the oil sands region itself. Furthermore, they estimate that GHG emissions intensities for the Canadian oil sands are currently within the range of many other heavy crude oils, and that in the future Canadian oil sands emissions intensities will only decrease (due to efficiency improvement and technological advances), while those of other crudes around the world will likely increase (due to a heavier resource base). They note also that the government of Alberta has implemented policies to help mitigate and reduce the GHG emissions associated with oil sands production.

Some consider that such a temperature target would avoid the worst effects of greenhouse-gas induced climate change, and it has been agreed as a political consideration in international negotiations to address climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. If this estimation is correct, all countries' emissions (net of any sequestration or \"sinks\") would have to stay within a given carbon budget to avoid exceeding the 2 o C temperature cap.

These include studies of specific chemical components that may be present in DilBit (e.g., benzene). Based on extensive experience with other crudes and DilBit constituents, analysts may claim considerable confidence in models of DilBit behavior around groundwater. For example, the Canadian Energy Resources Conservation Board has stated that \"DilBit should behave in much the same manner as other crude oils of similar characteristics.\"", "All spilled oil begins to \"weather\" or separate into different components over time. For a land spill, the heavier and more viscous components (i.e., the asphaltenes) would likely remain trapped in soil pores above the water table. It is also likely that the lighter constituents would partly evaporate and not be transported down through the soil with the heavier components. ", "However, if an oil spill reached the water table, some of the more soluble portions would likely dissolve into the groundwater and be transported in the direction of regional groundwater flow. The ultimate extent, shape, and composition of a groundwater contaminant plume resulting from a DilBit spill would depend on the specific characteristics of the soil, aquifer, and the amount and duration of the accidental release.

In an oil spill model prepared for EPA, the model estimates that spills of heavy oil will cost nearly twice as much to clean up as comparable spills of conventional crude oil. ", "Recent pipeline oil spills have generated interest among policy makers and stakeholders. For example, a 2010 Enbridge pipeline spill released approximately 850,000 gallons of oil sands crude oil into Talmadge Creek, a waterway that flows into the Kalamazoo River (Michigan). The spill demonstrates particular challenges associated with heavier crude oil spills, like oil sands crude oils. As of the date of this report, response activities continue, because, according to EPA, the oils sands crude \"will not appreciably biodegrade.\" The oil sands crude oil is submerged at the river bottom, mixed with sediment, and EPA has ordered Enbridge to dredge the river to remove the oiled sediment. As a result of this order, Enbridge estimated in December 2013 its response costs would be approximately $1.122 billion.

DOS stated that \"based on the combination of toxicity, solubility, and bioavailability, benzene was determined to dominate toxicity associated with potential crude oil spills.\" Benzene and other BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene) are generally in greater proportions in the lighter crude oils and particularly in refined products like gasoline. In its 2011 FEIS, DOS compared the BTEX content of crude oil derived from oil sands (DilBit and DilSynBit) with conventional crude oils from Canada. The BTEX content of oil sands crudes ranged from 5,800 parts per million (ppm) to 9,100 ppm. The BTEX contents of conventional crude oils ranged from 5,800 ppm to 29,100 ppm.", "Other toxic compounds of concern in crude oils are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Generally, PAHs are more toxic than BTEX and evaporate at a slower rate, but they are less soluble in water. The National Research Council's Oil in the Sea report stated that with weathering/evaporation and the resulting loss of BTEX, PAHs become more important contributors to the remaining oil's toxicity.", "Unlike BTEX, the 2011 and 2014 FEIS documents do not include a comparison of PAH concentrations across different crude oils. DOS states that PAH concentrations of crude oils that would be transported in the Keystone XL pipeline are unknown, because this information is proprietary. Some commenters, including EPA, took issue with this during the 2011 EIS review process.", "Heavy metals may also be a concern. A 2011 NRDC report states that DilBit contains quantities of heavy metals, particularly vanadium and nickel, that are \"significantly larger\" than conventional crude oil. Assuming conventional oil means lighter crudes, this statement is largely correct. However, the heavy metal concentrations in DilBit are similar to some other heavy crude oils, such as Mexican and Venezuela crudes that are processed in Gulf Coast refineries.

As Figure 13 illustrates, the volume of crude oil carried by rail increased by 423% between 2011 and 2012; the volume moving by barge, on inland waterways as well as along intracoastal routes, increased by 53%; and the volume of crude oil shipped by truck rose 38% between 2011 and 2012. Some portion of these recent increases is likely related to the status of proposed Keystone XL pipeline.", "Each mode of oil transportation involves some risk, and each has historically resulted in oil spills. Figure 14 illustrates the relative risk of oil spills by mode of transportation, comparing spill volume to the volume/distance transported. Over the period 1996-2007, railroads consistently spilled less crude oil per ton-mile than trucks or pipelines; barges and domestic tanker ships have much lower spillage rates than trains. However, the data in the figure precede the recent dramatic increase in oil by rail transportation.", "In addition, in its 2014 FEIS the State Department used PHMSA and Coast Guard data to compare oil spill frequency and volume by mode of transportation.

For example, land disturbances from mining operations include ", "clearance and excavation of a relatively large surface area, storage of removed overburden (e.g., vegetation soil), and construction of tailings ponds to contain extraction process wastestreams.", "In contrast, many stakeholders associate in situ operations with \"minimal land disturbances.\" For example, the 2014 FEIS states that \"in situ recovery is less disturbing to the land surface than surface mining and does not require tailings ponds.\" However, some research suggests the comparison between the two processes is more complicated. A 2009 study described the different impacts from the two processes in the following manner:", "Surface mining and in situ recovery affect the landscape in different ways. Land use of surface mining is comprised largely of polygonal features (mine sites, overburden storage, tailing ponds and end pit lakes); whereas in situ development is mostly defined by linear features that extend across the lease area (networks of seismic lines, access roads, pipelines and well sites). ", "Although the actual extraction site at in situ operations impacts substantially less land than at mining sites, some contend that in situ processes may ultimately create a larger disturbance, because the dispersed nature of in situ operations increases landscape fragmentation. In addition, one study finds that in situ operations disturb more land (per unit of oil) than mining, when natural gas requirements are considered. As noted above, in situ operations require energy (i.e., natural gas) to generate the steam needed to extract the underlying resource. According to the study, the land disturbances from the natural gas development contribute a major portion of in situ's total land disturbance. ", "How does land disturbance from oil sands operations compare to conventional oil development? Almost all forms of energy production disturb the land to some degree. A 2010 study compared land disturbances from Alberta oil sands operations with conventional oil development in Alberta and California. Figure 15 illustrates the results. The figure indicates that in situ oil sands operations have a substantially higher energy yield\u2014energy produced per disturbed land (measured in petajoules per hectare)\u2014than other sources. However, when natural gas use is included in the estimate, in situ operations' energy yield decreases substantially, making its energy yield equivalent to conventional oil development from California, but still greater than oil sands mining operations in Canada. The Alberta Chamber of Resources estimates that in situ production requires approximately four times the quantity of natural gas used for surface mining on a production volume basis. Therefore, the factor of natural gas plays an important role in energy yield estimates.", "Another factor in land disturbance assessments is the type of land disturbed. The Alberta oil sands are located within Canada's boreal forest, a large ecosystem that supports a wide range of biodiversity and provides key ecological services. For example, the boreal forest has been described as the \"world's largest and most important carbon storehouse.\" The 2010 study that provided data for Figure 15 also estimated the carbon storage in the lands overlying the various resources (e.g., California oil, Alberta oil sands). The study estimated that the soil carbon ratio (tons of carbon per hectare) and biomass carbon ratio was approximately five and four times greater, respectively, in oil sands areas than in California oil sites.", "A further consideration is the fate of the land after the resources are extracted. In Alberta, an environmental law requires an oil sands development company to demonstrate that it has reclaimed the land to an \"equivalent capability.\" Subsequent regulations have expanded on the meaning of this phrase: \"The ability of the land to support various land uses after conservation and reclamation is similar to the ability that existed prior to an activity being conducted on the land, but that the individual land uses will not necessarily be identical.\"", "The Alberta reclamation requirement is not unique. The United States has similar requirements that may apply in certain instances. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has reclamation regulations that apply to oil and gas operations on federal lands. BLM guidance states: ", "The long-term objective of final reclamation is to set the course for eventual ecosystem restoration, including the restoration of the natural vegetation community, hydrology, and wildlife habitats. In most cases, this means returning the land to a condition approximating or equal to that which existed prior to the disturbance. The operator is generally not responsible for achieving full ecological restoration of the site.", "A comparison between the U.S. and Canadian reclamation requirements and their applications is beyond the scope of this report. However, data from Alberta indicate that reclamation has not kept pace with land disturbance. Data from 2012 indicate that approximately 7% of the total disturbed area has been permanently reclaimed. Of the permanently reclaimed land, 2% has been certified per Alberta requirements (equating with 0.14% of the total disturbed area). The 2010 Royal Society of Canada report stated, \"Because of the very small amount of land certified to date relative to the large area that has been disturbed in the oil sands region, there is major skepticism as to whether reclamation to an equivalent land capability can be achieved in a reasonable time frame.\"", "Subsequent to that report, a 2012 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences assessed pre- and post-reclamation data at several oil sands mining sites. The study found that lost wetlands were not being replaced, resulting in a \"dramatic loss of carbon storage and sequestration potential.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Resources and Quality Issues", "paragraphs": ["While the water resource impacts from oil sands development are generally considered a Canadian domestic issue, other stakeholders view the environmental consequences of oil sands development as part of the global discussion about the long-term implications of unconventional oil and gas. At issue is whether oil sands development may harm the water resources and aquatic ecosystems and species of the northern Alberta and the northern territories. ", "Both oil sands in situ and surface mining techniques have water resource impacts. In situ processes use groundwater that is brought to the surface and heated, then reinjected for the underground steam-based separation of the oil from the sand. Freshwater use in in situ extraction has declined due to increased recycling and use of treated brackish water. Surface mining operations withdraw water from the north-flowing Athabasca River. This water is heated for use in a complex process that separates the oil from the sands. Process waste streams are collected in tailings ponds or lakes, which can cover a substantial area. Following extraction through in situ or surface mining, the bitumen recovered must be treated, typically upgraded to synthetic crude oil. This treatment requires both cooling water and process water.", "Mining also results in significant land disturbance. As discussed earlier, remediation of the disturbed land is addressed in Alberta statute and regulations. The extent and effectiveness of remediation in terms of long-term restoration and protection of water resources is a subject of on-going debate. Additionally, ongoing mine site maintenance during extraction operations requires capturing and disposing of surface water and groundwater entering the site. The potential wetlands and associated migratory bird impacts from changes in surface water and groundwater regimes that result both from direct water use in-situ and mining operations and indirectly through long-term changes to the landscape also are concerns. ", "On a direct water use per unit of energy basis, the oil sands production and upgrading processes appear to be more water intense than most conventional oil production and oil and gas from shale and tight formations, below the water intensity of U.S. oil shale, and considerably below the (rainfall or irrigation) water intensity of biofuels from corn, sugarcane, soybean, and switchgrass feedstocks. The freshwater intensity of in situ oil sands production is generally lower than oil sands mining; however, while more water efficient, in situ production leaves in place (i.e., unrecovered) a considerable portion of the petroleum resources. The current direct water efficiency of oil sands production may improve as new technologies are employed. ", "Much of the concern with oil sands development (and other types of unconventional oil and gas development) is the concentration of water use and impacts within a limited geographic area. One concern is that water use for oil sands mining reduces river flows, particularly during low flow periods. To manage these concerns, oil sands operators are required to obtain water withdrawal licenses, and a water management framework was developed to protect in-stream flows in the Athabasca River. The framework identifies how water withdrawals are to be reduced during low flow periods. A report by an expert panel of the Royal Society of Canada concluded that \"water use at current levels does not threaten viability of the Athabasca River system if the Water Management Framework \u2026 is fully implemented and enforced.\" Another concern is groundwater depletion. The expert panel report found that \"there needs to be greater attention directed to regional groundwater resources\" which currently are not well characterized, and that there was no evidence of a framework to limit groundwater extraction. ", "In addition, the issue of water quality has generated considerable debate. Results from the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program (RAMP) are often highlighted as evidence of the minimal impacts to water resources due to oil sands development. RAMP describes itself as \"an industry-funded, multi-stakeholder environmental monitoring program\" that began in 1997. A 2011 RAMP Technical Report stated that \"differences in water quality measured in fall 2011 between all test and one of the upper baseline stations in the Athabasca River were classified as Negligible-Low compared to the regional baseline conditions.\"", "However, results from several peer-reviewed studies contradict the RAMP conclusions. For example, a 2012 study found that the oil sands operations \"substantially increase[] the loadings of toxic PPE [priority pollutant elements] to the Athabasca River and its tributaries.\" Moreover, seven PPE\u2014cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc\u2014exceeded Canada or Alberta guidelines for aquatic life protection. In addition, another 2012 study concluded that the \"lake sediments in the Athabasca oil sands region register a clear PAH legacy with the pace and scale of industrial development of the region's tremendous bitumen [oil sands] deposits.\"", "Some of these contradictory findings may be addressed by the Joint Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring, established by the Canadian and Albertan governments in October 2012. According to the plan, it \"builds on a foundation of monitoring that is already in place, and is intended to enhance existing monitoring activities.\" Among other objectives, the plan seeks to \"improve analysis of existing monitoring data to develop a better understanding of historical baselines and changes.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
