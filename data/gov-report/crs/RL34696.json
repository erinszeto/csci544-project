It contains 15 titles covering support for commodity crops, horticulture and livestock production, conservation, nutrition, trade and food aid, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, energy, forestry, and other related programs. It also includes provisions that make certain changes to tax laws, in order to offset some new spending initiatives in the final bill. The enacted bill succeeds the most recent 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) and is to guide most federal farm and food policies through 2012. Many provisions of the 2002 farm bill expired in September 2007, but were extended under a series of temporary extensions prior to final enactment of the 2008 bill.", "The enacted 2008 farm bill continues and/or modifies most existing farm and commodity programs, and also creates new programs and provisions. For farm commodities, the bill generally continues the framework of the 2002 farm bill, revises payment limitations (tightening certain limits and relaxing others), adjusts support prices for some commodities, and creates a new revenue support program, in addition to the traditional direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for major supported crops. The bill also adds new stand-alone titles containing provisions to address horticulture and livestock issues, including new mandatory funding for specialty crop block grants and to support organic production; and provisions to address meat and poultry inspection, country-of-origin labeling, and livestock competition. Other provisions include changes to the current crop insurance program, a new provision for ongoing disaster assistance, and expanded borrowing opportunities for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers.", "The bill's nutrition title increases food stamp benefits and sets new standards that will make more households eligible, and also raises funding for fresh fruits and vegetables in most domestic food programs.

About $42 billion (15%) in projected spending will support commodity crops, $189 billion (67%) will support the cost of domestic nutrition programs, $24 billion (9%) will support conservation programs, and $22 billion (8%) will support crop insurance. Another $14 billion is expected to be spent on supplemental disaster assistance, trade, horticulture and livestock production, rural development, research, forestry and energy, and other programs. Offsets from tax provisions and proceeds from the credit, crop insurance, and commodity program titles are estimated at $10 billion (FY2008-FY2012)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Roughly every five years, Congress debates legislation governing federal farm and food policy.

In 2007, both the House and Senate completed committee and floor action on their respective versions of the new farm bill. However, conference negotiations were initially delayed because of differences between committee leadership and the Administration's position, largely over tax-related provisions needed to offset new spending in the bill.

Second, the 2008 farm bill debate was set against a backdrop of an ongoing multilateral negotiation, which targeted farm subsidies and challenged U.S. support and legal programs under existing trade rules. Third, the Bush Administration submitted its own detailed proposal for the new farm bill, whereas for other recent farm bills the Administration had not issued specific recommendations.

Recent federal deficits raised concerns with respect to reauthorization or expansion of current farm programs. Prior to congressional consideration of a new farm bill, budget projections showed a lower baseline budget for agriculture programs, mainly because high commodity prices had caused projections of future farm program spending to fall sharply below previous projections. The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) March 2007 baseline budget served as the official benchmark for the FY2008 budget resolution and for scoring the budgetary impacts of the new farm bill. The CBO baseline assumed continuation of current farm bill policies under expected economic conditions. The budget resolution set the actual spending constraints for the agriculture committees as they drafted a new farm bill.", "In May 2007, Congress approved the FY2008 budget resolution, which adopted the baseline budget as the fiscal parameter for the next farm bill. It also included a $20 billion reserve fund (above baseline) for new farm bill spending over five years. However, any new spending was required to be deficit-neutral, meaning that it would have to be offset with equivalent reductions in other federal spending for existing mandatory programs, or by raising revenues. Large increases in the market prices of corn and other commodities since the summer of 2006 contributed to a lower March 2007 baseline for farm program spending. For example, the March 2007 baseline projected spending for commodity support payments under current law to be $42.4 billion for the FY2008-FY2013 period, about $30 billion lower than actual spending in the previous six years ( Table 1 ).

Some policymakers wanted a Doha Round agreement so that the next farm bill could be made consistent with new farm trade rules; others argued that the United States should not unilaterally change its own subsidy programs ahead of any multilateral trade agreement.

The Administration's stated approach for designing its 2007 farm bill recommendations was to take a \"reform-minded and fiscally responsible approach to making farm policy more equitable, predictable and protected from challenge.\" In part, this referred to the perceived need to more evenly distribute federal program spending and benefits across a larger share of the U.S. farm community, as well as the perceived need to modify current farm programs to better comply with WTO obligations and limit future legal challenges from other countries. Some of these same concerns were voiced in recommendations and proposals by other organizations and interest groups.", "The Administration's proposed changes would have also faced potential funding obstacles, given budget constraints for the 2008 farm bill. Nevertheless, President Bush repeatedly threatened to veto any legislation that included certain revenue and tax-related provisions being considered by Congress, as well as legislation that failed to implement certain policy changes, including cuts in farm income subsidies, among other policy issues and concerns.

A second bill containing all 15 original farm bill titles, H.R. 6124 , was again vetoed on June 18. Among the reasons cited by the Administration for the veto were Congress' inclusion of certain revenue and tax-related provisions in both bills. The Administration was also concerned that the legislation did not include certain policy reforms in farm income subsidies, and was concerned about possible incompatibility with U.S. obligations under the WTO, among other policy issues.

These included state organizations, national farm groups, commodity associations, conservation and rural development organizations, nutrition program advocates, and several non-traditional interest groups. These policy recommendations represented diverse interests seeking objectives ranging from maintaining current programs to substantially altering or eliminating them.

It revises payment limitations by tightening some limits and relaxing others, and adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities. It continues the direct payment, counter-cyclical payment, and marketing loan programs for the 2008 through 2012 crop years. The enacted bill also creates a pilot revenue-based counter-cyclical program beginning with the 2009 crop year. It also has a pilot program for planting flexibility, restrictions on base acres developed for residential use, and a new provision that eliminates benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres.", "For direct payments, the payment rates per commodity remain the same as under the 2002 farm bill, but the overall formula contains a 2% reduction in direct payments for crop years 2009-2011. This is accomplished by changing the ratio of base acres on which direct payments are made from 85% to 83.3% of base acres. The 85% ratio is restored for the 2012 crop year to maintain baseline for the next farm bill at a higher level. The reduction to 83.3% does not affect the counter-cyclical payment formula. The final bill also adopts House and Senate provisions that eliminate making advance direct payments in the 2012 crop year and thereafter. This provision delays payment of 22% of the direct payment amount from December to the following October, thus into a new fiscal year and allowing the farm bill to score budget savings of about $1.1 billion in FY2012. Farmers will have to wait longer, but will receive their full payment.", "Support levels for counter-cyclical payments and marketing loans are adjusted with many crops receiving notable increases, and support for cotton being reduced slightly. Several commodity groups felt that their support levels were not high enough relative to other commodities in the 2002 farm bill, and did not receive counter cyclical support ever or as often (e.g., wheat, soybeans). For counter-cyclical payments, six out of 10 commodities have an increase in their target price (wheat, sorghum, barley, oats, soybeans and minor oilseeds), one has a small decrease (cotton), and four are new in 2009 (dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas). For marketing loans, eight out of 20 commodities have an increase in their loan rate (wheat, barley, oats, minor oilseeds, graded wool, honey, cane sugar, beet sugar), two have a decrease (dry peas, lentils), and one is new in 2009 (large chickpeas).", "The 2008 farm bill does not change the \"beneficial interest\" rules, and thus continues to allow farmers to lock in their loan deficiency payments (LDP) when market prices are low, continue to own the commodity, and sell it at a future and possibly higher market price. Policy makers want farmers to continue to have the flexibility to market their commodities in response to market signals and benefit from the program, but advocates for change point out that if farmers can sell their crop for more than the support price, then government support should be unnecessary. The Bush Administration had identified this as one of its priorities for commodity title reform.", "For the new revenue counter-cyclical option\u2014the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program\u2014the final bill adopted the Senate approach, but with significant modifications. Compared to the Senate-passed bill, the ACRE program starts a year earlier in 2009 with less change to its interaction with direct payments and marketing loans. The House-passed farm bill offered a pilot revenue counter-cyclical program based on national-level revenues, while the Senate-passed bill offered a state-level revenue counter-cyclical pilot program beginning in 2010 that replaced direct payments with a \"fixed payment\" and offered only recourse loans.", "Farmers will choose either the traditional price-triggered counter-cyclical program or the new revenue-based ACRE option. Participants in the ACRE program will continue to receive direct payments, but at a 20% reduced rate. Participants will also continue to be eligible for nonrecourse marketing loans, but with a 30% lower loan rate. To receive an ACRE payment, two triggers need to be met. First, the actual state revenue for a supported crop during the crop year must be less than the state-level revenue guarantee amount. Second, an individual farm's actual revenue for a supported crop during the crop year must be less than the farm's benchmark revenue. Benchmark yields at the state and farm levels are Olympic averages (dropping the highest and lowest price) of the most recent five years. Price guarantees are averages of the marketing year price (or the marketing loan rate reduced by 30%, if greater) for the most recent two years. If both triggers are met, an individual farm will receive an ACRE payment that is based on the state-level difference between actual revenue and the ACRE guarantee per acre multiplied by a percentage (83.3% or 85% depending on the crop year) of the farm's planted acreage, but pro-rated based on the individual farm's yield history compared to the state's yield history.", "The White House has criticized the ACRE program because its two-year price guarantee feature will incorporate the historically high recent market prices into the guarantee, and consequently possibly require large payments to farmers if market prices decline from their currently record high levels in 2007 and 2008. The White House has argued that the CBO score does not reflect the magnitude of this possibility because market prices in the baseline are assumed to remain high.", "The 2008 farm bill also includes a pilot planting flexibility program for fruits and vegetables for processing, while continuing the overall restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on base acreage. The pilot program begins in 2009, and allows farmers in seven midwestern states to plant base acres to cucumbers, green peas, lima beans, pumpkins, snap beans, sweet corn, and tomatoes grown for processing. Their base acres are temporarily reduced for the year (resulting in lower direct and counter-cyclical payments), but restored for the next crop year. The states include Minnesota (34,000 acres), Wisconsin (9,000 acres), Michigan (9,000 acres), Illinois (9,000 acres), Indiana (9,000 acres), Ohio (4,000 acres), and Iowa (1,000 acres).", "The farm bill includes a Senate provision that eliminates base acres on land that had been subdivided into multiple residential units or other non-farming uses. Prior rules have eliminated base only for land developed for nonagricultural commercial or industrial use.", "The farm bill also eliminates payments to farms with fewer than 10 base acres of all crops, except for farms owned by socially disadvantaged or limited-resource farmers and ranchers. The acreage approach is different than a House provision which set a minimum threshold of $25 per type of payment. The Senate had no similar provision.", "The bill requires USDA to reconcile social security numbers of program recipients with a Social Security database twice a year to assure program beneficiaries are alive, and to issue regulations describing how long a deceased person's estate may continue to qualify for program benefits. This is less specific than the Senate provision, which specified a two-year period.

The counter-cyclical limit will apply to both traditional and revenue counter-cyclical payments. The final bill does not place any limit on marketing loan benefits, and thus they are now unlimited. In the 2002 farm bill, marketing loan benefits were limited to $75,000 per farm per year, but use of commodity certificates and forfeiture were unlimited, thus creating equity issues.", "The 2008 farm bill still allows doubling of those limits by having a spouse, but eliminates the \"three-entity rule\" that formerly allowed an alternative means of doubling by having multiple farms with different ownership arrangements.

If a program payment cannot be traced to a living person within four levels of ownership, the payment to the original entity owning the farm is reduced proportionately.", "Under the 2002 farm bill, the limit on payments was commonly regarded as $360,000 per farm per year. Given the elimination of limits on the marketing loan program, an equivalent comparison to the 2008 farm bill is difficult. The limit on direct and counter-cyclical payments continues to be $210,000 per farmer couple per year.", "Regarding the adjusted gross income (AGI) limit, the 2008 farm bill adopts a slightly different approach than the 2002 farm bill or the House or Senate bills. Formerly, the AGI limit had an exception if a certain proportion of AGI (e.g., 75%) was earned from farming sources. The 2008 farm bill eliminates the exception and creates two new measures of AGI: adjusted gross nonfarm income, and adjusted gross farm income.", "First, if a three-year average of nonfarm AGI exceeds $500,000, then no program benefits are allowed (direct, counter-cyclical and marketing loan). Second, if a three-year average of farm AGI exceeds $750,000, then no direct payments are allowed (but counter-cyclical and marketing loan benefits are allowed for these higher-income farmers). Program participants can have income from both sources, but the caps for each type are \"hard\" caps (that is, there are no exceptions to the cap as with \"soft\" caps, except that the cap on farm AGI applies only to direct payments). For example, if a full-time farmer has nonfarm AGI over $500,000, their program payments are eliminated regardless of their farm income. A taxpayer's AGI may also be between $750,000 and $1.25 million and still receive program benefits if the income is split in such a way to remain below the caps on farm and nonfarm income. Moreover, the 2008 farm bill adopts a Senate provision that allows AGI of a married couple to be divided as if separate tax returns were filed. While in principle this provision could allow doubling of the AGI limits, the income needs to be legitimately allocated between the spouses, likely by Social Security numbers or equivalent identifiers.", "For more information on the commodity programs above and payment limits, see CRS Report RL34594, Farm Commodity Programs in the 2008 Farm Bill , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Dairy", "paragraphs": ["Two federal programs that support milk prices and dairy farm income were among the farm bill programs set to expire in 2007\u2014the dairy price support program (DPSP) and the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program.

(100 pounds), which it has done by purchasing surplus butter, nonfat dry milk, and cheese at specified minimum prices. The 2008 farm bill continues the DPSP through December 2012, but modifies the program by specifying, in the law itself, the minimum purchase prices for these manufactured dairy products. If net removals (essentially, USDA's surplus purchases) for 12 consecutive months exceed statutory limits, USDA may reduce product purchase prices, under the final law.", "Under expiring law, the MILC program had paid participating farmers 34% of the difference between a target price of $16.94 per cwt. and the monthly market price for farm fluid milk in New England, when the market price is below the target. Per farm payments had been limited to the first 2.4 million lbs. of annual milk production. The enacted 2008 farm bill extends the program, but generally increases the payment factor to 45% of the price differential for the period from October 1, 2008, through August 31, 2012, as proposed by the Senate. Conferees also increased the production limit for payments to 2.985 million pounds, compared with a Senate proposal that would have raised the limit to 4.15 million pounds.

Federal orders are permanently authorized, but a number of issues were brought to the attention of Congress for the farm bill debate. Dairy processors had been seeking a change in statute to exempt them from paying the federal milk marketing order minimum price whenever they forward contract prices with dairy farmers. The 2008 farm bill authorizes farmers to voluntarily enter into forward price contracts until September 30, 2012, with none to extend beyond September 30, 2015. The legislation contains safeguards designed to ensure that dairy farmers are not compelled by processors to participate in the program.

This way, the incentive exists for sugar cane processors and beet refiners to repay nonrecourse price support loans extended by USDA rather than hand over processed sugar as payment (commonly referred to as loan forfeitures).", "To address the potential for a U.S. sugar surplus caused by unrestricted imports from Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and from other countries under other free trade agreements, and the resulting loan forfeitures, the 2008 farm bill mandates a sugar-for-ethanol program. USDA is now required to purchase U.S.-produced sugar roughly equal to excess imports, if necessary to maintain market prices above support levels. The sugar purchased must then be sold to bioenergy producers for processing into ethanol. USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation will provide open-ended funding for this program. Other provisions increase the raw sugar and refined beet loan rates by 4%-5% by FY2012, mandate an 85% domestic market share for the U.S. sugar producing sector, and remove some of the discretionary authority that USDA exercises to administer import quotas.

Although the scope of the crop insurance program has widened significantly over the past 25 years, the anticipated goal that it would replace ad hoc disaster payments has not been achieved.", "The crop insurance program is permanently authorized and hence does not require consideration in the farm bill. Some policymakers expressed interest in expanding the crop insurance program in the context of the farm bill and/or complementing it with a permanent disaster payment program. However, many viewed the crop insurance program as a potential target for program cost reductions, where savings could be used to fund new initiatives in various titles of the farm bill. The Administration and others contend that the private companies should be required to absorb more of the program losses, and that the reimbursement rate for their operating expenses needs to be reduced as a means of reducing federal costs. The insurance companies and many farm groups are concerned that significant reductions in federal support will negatively impact the financial health of the crop insurance industry and possibly jeopardize the delivery of crop insurance, particularly in high-risk areas.", "Like the House- and Senate passed farm bills, the enacted 2008 farm bill contains several revisions to the crop insurance program, many of which are designed to reduce program costs. For the enacted crop insurance title, CBO has estimated net savings of $3.9 billion over five years (FY2008-2012), compared with estimated savings of $4.0 billion in the House bill and $3.7 billion in the Senate bill. Approximately $2.8 billion of the estimated savings in the enacted bill (as in the House and Senate bills) is achieved through changes in the timing of premium receipts from farmers, and payments to the companies, which has no effect on overall subsidies to participating farmers or insurance companies. A portion of the five-year savings is realized by requiring insurance companies and farmers to share more in program costs. The enacted bill increases the administrative fees paid by farmers for catastrophic crop insurance coverage (and for participation in the separate noninsured assistance program) to new levels that are higher than both the House and Senate bills. The bill also reduces reimbursement rates to private companies for their administrative and operating expenses by 2.3 percentage points. Conferees did not include a House provision that would have required the insurance companies to share more of their underwriting gains with the federal government.", "Among its other provisions, the crop insurance title of the 2008 farm bill also (1) requires USDA to ensure that premiums are established at a level so that total premiums equal total indemnity payments over time; (2) allows USDA to periodically renegotiate its standard reinsurance agreement, which contains the obligations and financial terms of the relationship between the government and the participating private crop insurance companies; (3) reduces available mandatory funding for reimbursing private initiatives for the research and development of new crop insurance products, and revises the manner in which reimbursements are provided; and (4) provides $36 million in mandatory funding over 10 years for USDA to enhance its activities to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse within the crop insurance program.", "For more background information on crop insurance, see CRS Report RL34207, Crop Insurance and Disaster Assistance in the 2008 Farm Bill , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Disaster Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Title XII includes other disaster assistance provisions, including the addition of the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 (Subtitle B).

SBA has responsibility for making disaster loans to individuals and non-agricultural businesses (15 U.S.C. 636(b)). Hurricane Katrina, and the SBA response, which was widely viewed as slow and flawed, prompted may suggestions from Members and others on how to improve the disaster loan system. In general, this act requires SBA to implement new planning, management oversight, and reporting procedures and authorizes private lending to supplement the disaster loans that SBA makes directly.", "SBA will continue to make six types of disaster loans for damages that were not covered by insurance:", "Personal property disaster loans (maximum $40,000) are made to individuals to replace or repair personal property such as cars and furniture. Home owners and renters may apply. Real property disaster loans (maximum $200,000) are made to home owners to repair or replace primary residences. Physical disaster loans (maximum $1.5 million) are made to businesses and nonprofits, regardless of size, to repair or replace real property, inventory, machinery, equipment, fixtures, etc. not covered by insurance. Economic injury disaster loans (maximum $1.5 million) are made to businesses to provide operating funds following a disaster. The act makes nonprofits eligible for these economic injury disaster loans and adds ice storms and blizzards to the list of disasters that can trigger these loans. Military reservist economic injury disaster loans (maximum $1.5 million) are made to businesses to help them overcome problems caused by a key employee being called to active military duty.

Lenders in the SBA's Preferred Lender Program would be eligible to participate. The SBA would guarantee 85% of loans, subject to a maximum loan size of $2 million. Following a major disaster, the SBA can also hire private contractors to assist in processing disaster loan applications.", "In the event of a major disaster with extraordinary levels of damage or disruption (such as Hurricane Katrina), SBA may make economic injury disaster loans to small businesses affected by the disaster regardless of location, but priority may be given to small businesses within the disaster area. Usually, only businesses within a disaster area are eligible.", "The enacted farm bill also requires SBA to create an Immediate Disaster Assistance Program, providing loans to small businesses affected by a disaster with a maximum amount of $25,000 and an 85% SBA guarantee. SBA may defer payments on existing disaster loans for up to four years for those taking out new disaster loans. SBA is also required to assign at least 800 employees to the Office of Disaster Assistance and 1,000 employees to the Disaster Cadre.

Under current law, such markets (or electronic trading facilities) are required to notify the CFTC of their operations, but are generally exempt from substantive regulation provided that small public investors are not permitted to trade there.", "Under the enacted bill, if the CFTC determined (according to criteria set forth in the bill) that such an electronic market played a significant role in the price-setting process (that is, if market participants looked to prices generated there as a guide to their own transactions in the underlying commodities), the market would become subject to a set of regulatory \"core principles.\" These principles amount to a regulatory regime roughly comparable to (but somewhat less extensive than) CFTC regulation of futures exchanges. Markets where \"significant price discovery\" contracts are traded will be required to prevent price manipulation, monitor trading, report daily figures on price and trade volume, guard against conflicts of interest, and disclose large positions held by individual traders.

The program is designed to compensate eligible producers for a portion of crop losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under the crop insurance program (i.e., the portion of losses that is part of the deductible on the policy). An eligible producer can receive a payment equal to 60% of the difference between a target level of revenue and the actual total farm revenue for the entire farm. The target level of revenue will be based on the level of crop insurance coverage selected by the farmer, thus increasing if a farmer opts for higher levels of coverage. To be eligible for a payment, a producer must be in or contiguous to a county that has been declared a disaster area by either the President or the Secretary of Agriculture. Payments are limited so that the disaster program guarantee level cannot exceed 90% of what income likely would have been in the absence of a natural disaster.", "The producer also must have at least the minimum level of crop insurance (CAT) coverage for insurable crops and participate in the NAP program for non-insurable crops. The statute makes an exception for the 2008 crop year by allowing producers who did not purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage in advance to be eligible for the program, as long as they pay the equivalent administrative fee for coverage within 90 days of enactment (September 16, 2008). Final payments for 2008 crop losses cannot be determined until late 2009, since a portion of the disaster payment formula is based on the national average market price of the commodity, which is determined at the end of the marketing year. For example, the 2008 marketing year for corn and soybeans ends September 30, 2009.", "In addition to the supplemental crop revenue assistance payment program described above, the 2008 farm bill also authorizes and funds four smaller disaster programs also through FY2011: (1) Livestock Indemnity Payments, which compensate ranchers at a rate of 75% of market value for livestock mortality caused by a disaster; (2) Livestock Forage Disaster Program, to assist ranchers who graze livestock on drought-affected pastureland or grazing land; (3) Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bess and Farm Raised Fish, which will provide up to $50 million to compensate these producers for disaster losses not covered under other disaster programs; and (4) the Tree Assistance Program, for orchardists and nursery growers who can receive a payment to cover 70% of the cost of replanting trees or nursery stock following a disaster (up to $100,000 per year per producer).", "For more information on crop insurance and disaster assistance, see CRS Report RL34207, Crop Insurance and Disaster Assistance in the 2008 Farm Bill , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RS21212, Agricultural Disaster Assistance , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The tax portions (Title XV) of the 2008 farm bill differ markedly from those in either the House- or the Senate-passed versions of the bill.
