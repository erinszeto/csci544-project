Issues such as intercarrier compensation and set-top boxes are identified by the NBP as having potential significant impact on broadband availability and adoption. Broadband will likely play a role in addressing critical national challenges in areas such as health care, education, energy, environment, and public safety; the issue is how, for each national purpose, the existing legislative and regulatory framework and trends in the field might best benefit from better broadband access and services. Finally, one potential issue the FCC may face in its attempts to achieve NBP goals is the scope of the agency's authority to regulate broadband Internet access and management.", "A major issue for Congress will be how to shape the Plan's various initiatives when and if they go forward, either through oversight, through consideration of specific legislation, or in the context of comprehensive telecommunications reform.

The impetus behind mandating a national broadband plan was derived from the widely accepted view in Congress of broadband as a critical public infrastructure, increasingly important to the nation's economic development. Broadband was also viewed as playing an increasingly critical role in addressing specific challenges facing the nation in areas such as health care, energy, education, public safety, and others. ", "In the United States, broadband infrastructure is constructed, operated, and maintained primarily by the private sector, including telephone, cable, satellite, wireless, and other information technology companies. Although broadband is primarily deployed by private sector providers, federal and state regulation of the telecommunications industry, as well as government financial assistance programs, can have a significant impact on private sector decisions to invest in and deploy broadband infrastructure, particularly in underserved and unserved areas of the nation. When considering broadband policy, the ongoing challenge for Congressional policymakers is how to strike a balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service, while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment.

Table 1 , at the end of this report, is an outline of the National Broadband Plan. Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan begins with an introduction, a statement of goals, and a discussion of the current state of the broadband \"ecosystem.\" This is followed by three parts containing the bulk of the plan's recommendations: Part I, \"Innovation and Investment,\" Part II, \"Inclusion,\" and Part III, \"National Purposes.\" The NBP concludes with a chapter on implementation and benchmarks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Goals to Create a \"High-Performance America\"", "paragraphs": ["The NBP seeks to \"create a high-performance America\" which the FCC defines as \"a more productive, creative, efficient America in which affordable broadband is available everywhere and everyone has the means and skills to use valuable broadband applications.\" In order to achieve this mission, the NBP recommends that the country set six goals for 2020:", "Goal No. 1: At least 100 million U.S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second. Speeds of 100 Mbps in 100 million homes (popularly referred to as \"100 squared\") would constitute next-generation broadband in most U.S. households. As a milestone, the FCC has set an interim goal of 100 million homes with actual download speeds of 50 Mbps and actual upload speeds of 20 Mbps by 2015. The FCC notes that existing providers are in the process of upgrading their networks, and it is likely that 90% of the country will have access to advertised peak download speeds of more than 50 Mbps by 2013. Goal No. 2: The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation. According to November 2009 data from American Roamer, 3G wireless service covers roughly 60% of U.S. land mass. Approximately 77% of the U.S. population live in an area served by three or more 3G service providers, 12% live in an area served by two, 9% live in an area served by one, and about 2% live in an area with no provider. The FCC currently has 50 MHz of spectrum that it can assign for broadband use. The NBP recommends making 500 MHz of spectrum available for broadband by 2020, with an interim benchmark of 300 MHz by 2015. Goal No. 3: Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose. There are two aspects to the goal of universal broadband: availability and adoption. Regarding broadband availability , 290 million Americans\u201495% of the U.S. population\u2014currently live in housing units with access to terrestrial, fixed broadband infrastructure capable of supporting actual download speeds of at least 4 Mbps. This leaves a \"gap\" of 14 million people in the United States living in 7 million housing units that do not have access to terrestrial broadband infrastructure capable of this speed. The FCC has estimated that $24 billion in additional funding would be necessary to fill what it refers to as the \"broadband availability gap.\" Regarding broadband adoption , the NBP sets an adoption goal of \"higher than 90%\" by 2020. Currently, broadband adoption stands at 67%, about two-thirds of the adult population. Certain demographic groups exhibit significantly lower rates of broadband adoption, for example: 40% of adults making less than $20,000 per year have adopted terrestrial broadband at home, 50% of adults in rural areas, 24% of those with less than a high school degree, 35% of those older than 65, 59% of African Americans, 49% of Hispanics, 42% of people with disabilities, and fewer than 10% of residents on Tribal lands. Goal No. 4: Every American community should have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals and government buildings. The NBP notes that while 99% of all health care locations with physicians have access to an actual download speed of at least 4 Mbps, and while 97% of schools are connected to the Internet (many supported by the federal E-rate program), more than 50% of teachers say slow or unreliable Internet access presents obstacles to their use of technology in classrooms, and only 71% of rural health clinics have access to mass-market broadband solutions. Further, many business locations, schools and hospitals often have connectivity requirements that cannot be met by mass-market DSL, cable modems, satellite or wireless providers, and must buy dedicated high-capacity circuits such as T-1 or Gigabit Ethernet service. The availability and price of such circuits vary greatly across different geographies. Goal No. 5: To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network. Nearly nine years after 9/11, first responders from different jurisdictions and agencies still often cannot communicate with each other during emergencies and continue to operate outdated communications systems, most of which do not have broadband capability. Goal No. 6: To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption. According to the FCC, \"broadband and advanced communications infrastructure will play an important role in achieving national goals of energy independence and efficiency.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Chapters 4 through 17 constitute the heart of the National Broadband Plan and contain 208 specific recommendations intended to help achieve the Plan's goals.

First, because many of the recommendations are directed towards the Executive Branch, the NBP recommends the creation of an interagency Broadband Strategy Council to coordinate implementation of the NBP. Second, given that approximately half the recommendations are directed to the FCC, the NBP calls on the FCC to quickly publish a timetable or proceedings to implement those NBP recommendations that fall under FCC authority. On April 8, 2010, the FCC released a Broadband Action Agenda explaining the purpose and timing of more than 60 rulemakings and other notice-and-comment proceedings.", "Additionally, Congress is seen as playing a major role in implementing the National Broadband Plan, both by considering legislation to implement NBP recommendations, and by overseeing (and possibly funding) broadband activities conducted by the FCC and Executive Branch agencies.", "As telecommunications technologies increasingly converge onto a broadband platform, many of the issues traditionally regarded as part of \"telecommunications policy\" are becoming viewed as part of \"broadband policy.\" Accordingly, the NBP addresses many of the ongoing major telecommunications policy issues, such as the reform and reorientation of the Universal Service Fund, reform of intercarrier compensation, the possible mandating of \"gateway\" set-top boxes, spectrum and wireless policy, and the appropriate regulatory framework for an evolving information infrastructure. Some of these issues will likely be addressed in subsequent FCC proceedings, and all may be debated and considered by Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Broadband Adoption and Availability and the Federal Universal Service Fund19", "paragraphs": ["The NBP states that \"Everyone in the United States today should have access to broadband services supporting a basic set of applications that include sending and receiving e-mail, downloading web pages, photos and video, and using simple video conferencing.\" A universalization target of 4 Mbps of actual download speed and 1 Mbps of actual upload speed has been set as the initial target rate for public investment to ensure that these expectations will be met. The NBP calls upon the Federal Universal Service Fund (USF) to undertake a major role to ensure that this goal is achieved. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Evolution of the Universal Service Concept", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation in 1934 the Federal Communications Commission has been tasked with \"... mak[ing] available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States,... a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges....\" This mandate led to the development of what has become known as the universal service concept. The universal service concept, as originally designed, called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, by ensuring that rates remain affordable. ", "The term universal service, when applied to telecommunications, refers to the ability to make available a basket of telecommunications services to the public, across the nation, at a reasonable price. Over time, access to the public switched network through a single wireline connection, enabling voice service, became the standard of communications. Currently the basic universal service package, which was established in 1997, is comprised of:", "voice grade access to and some usage of the public switched network; single line service; dual tone signaling; access to directory assistance; emergency service such as 911; operator services; access and interexchange (long distance) service.", "Since the U.S. household telephone connection rate is 95.6% of homes, an all-time high, some might say that the program has been a success and nothing more needs to be done. The universal service concept, however, is an evolving one, and consequently so are universal service policies and goals. The initial focus of universal service support targeted eligible telecommunications carriers usually serving rural, insular, or other high cost areas by providing funds to help offset higher than average costs of providing telephone service (e.g., the High-Cost Program). Changes in expectations by policymakers and consumers have led to an expansion of universal service programs as well as to the establishment of a Federal USF to administer them. For example, the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ) codified the universal service concept and expanded the concept to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates as well as access to advanced telecommunications and information services. This led to the establishment by the FCC of the Schools and Libraries and the Rural Health Care Programs. Earlier policy decisions by the FCC led to the development, in the mid-1980s, of a needs based Low-Income Program to assist economically needy individuals to join and remain on the telecommunications network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Universal Service and Broadband", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade the telecommunications sector has undergone a vast transformation fueled in particular by the deployment of and access to broadband infrastructure and applications. One of the challenges facing this transition is the desire to ensure that all consumers have access to an affordable and advanced broadband infrastructure so that all members of society may derive its social and economic benefits. Broadband adoption rates are estimated at 67%, representing about two-thirds of the adult population, but these rates are uneven and significant gaps exist. For example, those who: live in rural areas, have low education and income levels, have disabilities, are elderly, are African Americans, are Hispanics, and are living on Tribal lands all have significantly lower broadband adoption rates than the national average. Furthermore, approximately 5% of the U.S. population, equivalent to 14 million people living in 7 million housing units, do not have access to terrestrial broadband infrastructure capable of supporting the NBP's recommended 4 Mbps actual download speed.", "One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service policy is whether the universal service concept should embrace access to broadband as one of its policy objectives. The 1934 Communications Act, as amended, does take into consideration the changing nature of the telecommunications sector and allows for the mix of services eligible for universal service support to be modified. In particular, provisions in the universal service section state that \"universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services\" and the FCC is tasked with \"periodically\" reevaluating this definition \"taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.\" ", "There is a growing consensus among policymakers that the FCC should change the mix of services eligible for universal service support to include the universal availability of broadband services and use federal universal service funds to help eliminate broadband adoption and availability gaps.

The NBP adopts a new expanded USF definition embracing affordable broadband with at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps of actual upload speed. Examples of the applications that could be supported by such a download speed include: advanced Web-browsing; e-mail; Voice over the Internet Protocol (VOIP); multimedia; streamed audio; streamed video lectures; and lower definition telemedicine.

Intercarrier compensation (ICC) is the system of rates that service providers are charged for the use of these networks to provide service to their subscribers.", "There is a monopoly element to terminating a communication. Once the receiving party has chosen her local carrier (say Verizon or Comcast or, in a rural area, the local rural telephone company), the originating party's carrier has no choice but to pay the rate charged by the terminating carrier to complete the communication. Therefore these rates are subject to price regulation\u2014the FCC regulates interstate rates and state public utility commissions regulate intrastate rates.", "Intercarrier compensation rates have developed over time in an ad hoc fashion, and often were set to help foster a particular policy objective. For example, both the FCC and state regulatory commissions purposely set the rates for terminating long distance calls to subscribers of rural telephone companies significantly above cost in order to provide those rural carriers with a large revenue source that would allow them to keep local rates low. As a result, the revenues generated from intercarrier compensation charges imposed on long distance carriers represent approximately 25% of total rural telephone carrier revenues, but only approximately 10% of the revenues of other local telephone companies. As another example of regulators setting intercarrier compensation rates to help meet a public policy objective, the FCC purposely has treated Internet Service Provider (ISP)-bound traffic differently from other traffic, not imposing termination charges on ISP-bound traffic or setting lower rates for terminating ISP-bound traffic than other traffic, in order to foster the development of Internet services.", "Although the use of a terminating network's facilities is similar for each type of communication, the rate charged for terminating a communication ranges from zero to 35.9 cents a minute depending on the jurisdiction of the communication, the type of traffic carried, and the regulatory status of the terminating carrier.", "These regulatory-mandated distinctions create inefficient market signals that, in addition to imposing artificial advantages or disadvantages on certain categories of services or providers, are skewing investment decisions, in some cases perhaps retarding the migration from legacy circuit-switched voice networks to Internet protocol (IP) broadband networks.", "At the same time, these artificially high termination charges generate revenues that may be needed for rural companies to be able to offer basic telephone service at affordable rates comparable to those for urban subscribers. These high charges represent an implicit universal service subsidy imposed on long distance users. Intercarrier compensation reform that eliminates this implicit subsidy by moving terminating access rates toward cost may have to be accompanied by the creation of new sources of explicit universal service funding.", "The Broadband Plan proposes that \"the FCC should adopt a framework for long-term intercarrier compensation reform that creates a glide path to eliminate per-minute charges while providing carriers an opportunity for adequate cost recovery.\" Changes would be transitioned in over ten years, starting with reductions in the highest intercarrier compensation rates, which generally are intrastate rates.", "Since the federal courts have ruled that the FCC does not have authority over intrastate rates, however, legislation may be needed to give the FCC explicit authority to reform intrastate intercarrier rates as well as interstate rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fostering a Market for Set-Top Boxes", "paragraphs": ["Universal access to broadband networks is not an end in itself; it is a means to give consumers access to the applications that are provided over those networks. Consumers need devices\u2014computers, smart phones, set-top boxes\u2014to reach both their broadband network and the applications riding over the network. Those devices help consumers navigate to the many applications. Today, consumers can turn to many different manufacturers and retailers of computers and smart phones, but they generally have few options for set-top boxes (or, more broadly, for smart video devices). Virtually all such devices are provided by the consumer's multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD\u2014cable or satellite video service provider).", "Section 629(a) of the Communications Act directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),", "in consultation with appropriate industry standard-setting organizations, [to] adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability ... of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming [cable or satellite video service].", "There is a consensus that FCC and industry efforts to date have not achieved this goal. There are few devices available in the retail market; these devices cannot work with all MVPDs and, even where compatible, cannot be used to identify many video signals, particularly those of high-definition cable offerings.", "In its NBP, the FCC concluded that access to video services drives broadband usage and thus actions that would foster a market for smart video devices that make it easier for consumers to access broadband-enabled video would increase consumer adoption of broadband.

The adapter or gateway would communicate with the MVPD service, performing the tuning and security decryption functions specific to a particular MVPD. The smart video devices would perform navigation functions, including presentation of programming guides and search functionality.", "The envisioned \"AllVid\" solution would employ a nationwide interoperability standard analogous to how Ethernet and the IEEE industry standards have led to nationwide interoperability for customer data networks despite broadband service providers deploying differing proprietary network technologies.", "Critics of this gateway concept argue that the cable industry already has spent almost $1 billion attempting to implement the FCC's earlier, unsuccessful efforts to create a market for video devices and that there is no demonstrated consumer demand for these set-top boxes. They claim that most consumers would prefer to lease set-top boxes that might become obsolete in an environment characterized by rapid product and service innovation. The additional expenditures to construct the adapter, they claim, would be passed through to consumers in higher MVPD rates. The critics further contend that technological change inherently outpaces any government rule or one-size-fits-all requirement. They also question whether households that do not currently subscribe to broadband service would be motivated to do so simply because they had access to smart video devices that provide them with greater, but perhaps more complicated, access to video services. The critics suggest that the AllVid mandate would primarily serve tech-savvy individuals who already subscribe to broadband service.", "Proponents of the AllVid solution respond that, in the absence of standards and an interoperability requirement, there have been no incentives for MVPDs, manufacturers, and consumers to cooperate. They claim that consumer demand for smart video devices and manufacturer incentives to produce such devices have been constrained by the lack of a universal standard that would allow a single device to serve all MVPDs and by MVPD resistance to a device that would make it easier for consumers to access non-MVPD sources of video. They claim simple to use smart video devices would appeal particularly to non-tech savvy households. They dispute that the AllVid solution would constrain MVPD innovation or consumer choice by prescribing a single technical solution. Rather, they claim, it would foster innovation and choice by developing an industry-wide interoperability standard open to independent equipment manufacturers and applications providers without placing restrictions on MVPD networks.", "The FCC recognizes that it may be especially challenging to develop an adapter for satellite video providers because, unlike in cable networks where the intelligence resides deep in the network at the head-end, in satellite networks the intelligence resides in the set-top box at the customer premise. It therefore might be more difficult for the satellite company to troubleshoot whether the source of a customer complaint lies in equipment under the control of the satellite operator or in the smart video device.", "One NBP recommendation is that the FCC initiate a proceeding to ensure that all MVPDs install a gateway device or equivalent functionality in all new subscriber homes and in all homes requiring replacement set-top boxes by December 31, 2012. Many observers question whether the technical and market challenges to accomplish this can be performed in that period of time.", "An AllVid solution will not be available for several years. Currently, CableCARD technology\u2014which only works for cable, not for satellite\u2014is available to separate the system that customers use to gain access to video programming (called the conditional element) from the device customers use to navigate the programming. This allows independent smart video device manufacturers, such as TiVo, to serve end users, but there are problems with the technology, notably, it does not allow customers to receive certain high-definition cable channels.

In addition to the dashboard, the NBP proposes that the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) should create methods for recovering spectrum and that the FCC maintain an ongoing spectrum strategy plan. The NTIA manages federal use of spectrum, among other responsibilities. All of these steps will facilitate decisions about spectrum management by providing detailed information about the current and potential use of spectrum resources.", "From a policy perspective, the NBP recommendations that would speed the arrival of new, spectrally efficient technologies might have the most impact over the long term. In particular, support for exploring ways to use technologies that enable sharing could pave the way for dramatically different ways of managing the nation's spectrum resources.", "The need for a robust plan to accelerate the adoption of new technologies has, however, been eclipsed by public debate over the plan's proposed steps to add 300 MHz of licensed spectrum for broadband within five years. All of the spectrum assignment proposals put forth in the NBP are contentious in that the various parties affected by the decisions have diverging views on how technology should be used to provide access to these frequencies. The disagreements may be in part over the cost of implementing different technological solutions, or about a shift in who controls access, but these are associated with the technical fixes the FCC has proposed to facilitate the spectrum assignment.", "The NBP has laid out several opportunities for the FCC, the NTIA, and other government agencies to contribute to and encourage the development of new technologies for more efficient spectrum access. For example, Congress might choose to require performance goals for improved spectrum efficiency, not unlike the way federal goals have been set for energy conservation or transportation safety. Congress might also evaluate how a detailed plan to encourage new technologies might assist in resolving current disagreements about spectrum assignment and use.

Auctions are regarded as a market-based mechanism for assigning spectrum. Before auctions became the primary method for distributing spectrum licenses the FCC used a number of different approaches, primarily based on perceived merit, to select license-holders. The FCC was authorized to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ). Following passage of the act, subsequent laws that dealt with spectrum policy and auctions included the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), the Auction Reform Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-195 ), the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-494 , Title II), and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ).

An additional 40 MHz would be made available for auction, of which 20 MHz would be reassigned from federal to commercial use. Reallocating some spectrum from over-the-air broadcasting to commercial spectrum might provide an additional 120 MHz of spectrum.

The analog licenses would be yielded back when the transition to digital television was concluded. The completed transition freed up the 700 MHz band for mobile communications and public safety in 2009.", "The FCC has revisited the assumptions reflected in the 1997 Act and has made new proposals, and decisions based on, among other factors, changes in technology and consumer habits. The NBP announced that a new proceeding would be initiated to recapture up to 120 MHz of spectrum from broadcast TV allocations for re-assignment to broadband communications. This proceeding would propose four sets of actions to achieve the goal; a fifth set of actions to increase efficiency would be pursued separately.

Because over-the-air digital broadcasting does not necessarily require 6 MHz of spectrum, the NBP has proposed that some stations could share a single 6 MHz band without significantly reducing service to over-the-air TV viewers. The NBP also has proposed that broadcasters might form partnerships to provide other communications services using licenses assigned to TV. Among the proposals for how broadcasters might make better use of their TV licenses, the NBP has raised the possibility of auctioning unneeded spectrum and sharing the proceeds between the TV license-holder and the U.S. Treasury. The FCC has called on Congress to provide new legislation that would allow these \"incentive auctions.\" Although most spectrum license auction revenues are deposited as general funds, Congress has passed laws that permit the proceeds to be used for other purposes.

As part of its preparation for the auction (Auction 73), the FCC sought to increase the amount of spectrum available to public safety users in the 700 MHz band. Congress had previously designated 24 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band for public safety channels. In 2007, the FCC proposed to allocate 10 MHz of the public safety frequencies specifically for broadband communications and to match the allocation with 10 MHz of commercial spectrum. This commercial license, known as the D Block, was to be auctioned under rules that would require the creation of a public-private partnership to develop the two 10-MHz assignments as a single broadband network, available to both public safety users and commercial customers. The D Block license was offered for sale in Auction 73 but did not find a buyer. The FCC then set about the task of writing new service rules for a re-auction of the D Block.", "In the NBP, the FCC announced its decision to auction the D Block under rules that would not require a partnership with public safety but would establish a framework for priority access to the D Block network by public safety users. Generally, public safety officials had anticipated that the D Block would be an integral part of a public safety broadband network. Since the failed D Block auction of 2008, there has also been growing pressure on the FCC and on Congress to take the steps necessary to reallocate the D Block from commercial to public safety use. The NBP announcement regarding the D Block has increased that pressure.

In the future, channel management is likely to be replaced by technologies that operate without the need for designated channels.

Broadband Internet services are currently classified as information services, to which Title I of the Communications Act applies. The FCC does not possess direct authority to regulate services classified under Title I. The FCC has announced the possibility of reclassifying the transmission component of broadband Internet services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. The FCC hopes this potential reclassification would ground the FCC's authority to regulate broadband Internet services more firmly in the governing law.", "In order to understand the current uncertainty surrounding the FCC's authority over broadband Internet services, some background is needed. After the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC found it necessary to determine what kind of service broadband Internet service was. The agency's choices were to classify broadband Internet access as an information service, over which it would have no direct authority to regulate under Title I, or as a telecommunications service, over which it would have extensive authority to regulate under Title II. There was also an intermediate option. The FCC contemplated classifying the transmission component of a broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service, while classifying the processing component as an information service. The FCC ultimately chose to classify broadband Internet services as information services only. ", "At the time (2002), the provision of broadband Internet services arguably was still a nascent industry, and the FCC expressed a desire to avoid introducing into the developing market what it thought at the time could be too many regulations. However, this was a contentious question. The Supreme Court, in NCTA v. Brand X , made the final decision. The question before the court was whether the FCC could define cable-modem services (i.e., cable broadband services) as information services. Opponents of that classification argued that the FCC did not have discretion to define cable modem services as an information service. The Court, however, sided with the FCC. What is important for the purposes of this discussion is that the Court did not say that cable modem services are clearly and unambiguously information services. Instead, the court said that the definitions of telecommunications services and of information services were ambiguous as they related to cable modem services, and that the FCC, as the agency with jurisdiction under the Communications Act, had the authority to interpret those definitions. The Court gave deference to the FCC's determination that cable modem services should be defined as information services and determined that the FCC's classification of cable modem services in this way was reasonable. ", "However, three Justices dissented. Justice Scalia authored the dissent, concluding that cable modem services were actually two separate services: the computing service which was an information service, and the transmission service, which was a telecommunications service. The classification that these Justices believe the Communications Act clearly mandates is the classification that the FCC now proposes to apply to broadband Internet services.", "Chairman Genachowski has announced his intention to pursue what he has termed \"light touch\" Title II regulation of broadband services. As explained in the statement of the FCC's General Counsel, it is the intention of the FCC to commence a rulemaking to reclassify only the transmission component of broadband access services (\"Internet connectivity\") as a telecommunications service, while the data processing portion of the service would remain an information service. The Chairman argues that, in choosing only to reclassify the transmission component of broadband access services, the reach of the FCC's jurisdiction will be sufficiently narrowed so as to avoid giving the agency the authority to regulate Internet content. This plan would also avoid the imposition of regulation so pervasive as to become burdensome. ", "In keeping with this announcement, on June 17, 2010, the FCC released a notice of inquiry (NOI) into the framework of broadband Internet services. In the NOI, the agency asked for comment on a number of questions. The FCC made clear that its ultimate goal in issuing the NOI was to determine the best avenue for restoring the agency's previous understanding of its authority to regulate broadband Internet services. In other words, the FCC is seeking firmer ground for its authority to continue rulemakings along the lines of the broadband network management rulemakings and the order it issued in 2007 finding Comcast to be in violation of the FCC's network management policies. In doing so, the FCC recognizes that the D.C. Circuit's decision in Comcast v. FCC has thrown the agency's assertions of ancillary authority over broadband network management into considerable doubt.", "The NOI lists three main potential paths forward and seeks comment on the feasibility of each. The first question the NOI asks is whether the FCC may find a better way to assert ancillary authority over broadband Internet services. The D.C. Circuit did not foreclose on the possibility of the FCC asserting ancillary authority in other ways. It merely rejected the FCC's argument in that particular case. Therefore, the FCC asks whether broadband Internet services may continue to be classified as information services while the agency asserts a different statutory basis for exercising ancillary jurisdiction. There are a number of potential theories for ancillary jurisdiction for which the FCC seeks comment.", "The other two potential paths towards firmer authority to regulate would involve direct regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Therefore, it would be necessary to reclassify at least the Internet connectivity portion of broadband Internet services as a telecommunications service, because only telecommunications services are governed by Title II. The FCC asks for comment on how to define Internet connectivity for reclassification. Assuming the FCC chooses one of these two paths, this reclassification would likely be reviewed by the courts, in light of the fact that the Supreme Court upheld the agency's previous classification of broadband Internet services as a unified information service. However, as discussed earlier, Brand X gave deference to the FCC's interpretation of the Communications Act in this area. Furthermore, in the recent case FCC v. Fox Television , the Supreme Court held that when an agency issues a new (and different from its previous) interpretation of a statute it has the authority to implement, the agency \"need not demonstrate to a court's satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one.\" The agency must show only that its current interpretation is reasonable, though in some circumstances a more detailed justification for the change must be made than would otherwise be necessary if the agency was rulemaking on a blank slate.", "Assuming that such a reclassification is upheld by the courts, the second potential path forward would be to apply the full force of Title II regulation to broadband Internet connectivity (as the FCC would define it). The FCC seeks comment on the potential effects of such a decision. However, the Chairman and General Counsel have expressed that this is not the approach the agency is likely to take. Rather, they have announced that their intention is to forbear from applying the portions of Title II to broadband access services that the FCC deems contrary to the public interest. Section 401 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to forbear from applying any regulation or provision under Title II to a provider of telecommunications services if the Commission determines that:\u00a0", "(1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations by, for, or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;\u00a0(2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and\u00a0(3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.", "The Chairman and General Counsel argued, in their statements, that this provision would require forbearance from many of Title II's more onerous provisions, such as the rate regulation and tariff provisions, because applying those provisions would not be consistent with the public interest.", "The NOI asks for comment on this potential action. It further asks for comment on the provisions on Title II from which the agency should not forbear. In particular, the NOI asks for comment on applying the provisions of Title II that the FCC had identified as likely to be needed to have adequate enforcement authority in its earlier press releases on this issue. These provisions are Sections 201 (requiring service upon request and reasonable rates), 202 (prohibiting unreasonable discrimination), 208 (granting the FCC authority to act upon complaints), 222 (protecting privacy), 254 (universal service), and 255 (access for disabled persons). In the FCC's announcements, the General Counsel identified these provisions as potentially sufficient to \"do the job\" of providing enough authority to accomplish the FCC's goals. However, the NOI asks for comment on other provisions that may be necessary to assert jurisdiction.", "The NOI also asks for comment on a number of other issues, including the method of forbearing. Currently, companies seeking forbearance from a provision of Title II (which had heretofore presumably applied to such companies) apply to the FCC seeking such forbearance. Under the FCC's proposal, the FCC would forbear under its own motion to maintain what is currently the status quo. The FCC seeks comment on the process the agency should adopt for accomplishing this plan. The agency also seeks comment on how to treat wireless broadband services (terrestrial and satellite). The agency notes that \"there are technological, structural, consumer usage, and historical differences between mobile wireless and wireline/cable networks\" that may require different statutory and regulatory treatment. Furthermore, the agency seeks comment on other open questions, such as the implications changes may have for state and local regulators, and the effect any action taken to reclassify might have on the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.

Interconnectedness \u2014 the NBP views broadband as an \"ecosystem\" and suggests that many of the diverse topics and issues covered in the NBP, though seemingly distinct and separate, are in fact interconnected. For example, the NBP contains recommendations intended to allay consumers' concerns over Internet privacy, which in turn could lead to higher adoption rates and greater broadband and Internet utilization, which in turn could help provide more market incentive for private sector providers to deploy broadband infrastructure. The NBP identifies applications, devices, and networks as the key forces shaping the broadband ecosystem, and states that these three forces \"drive each other in a virtuous cycle.\" The NBP's focus on the quality of interconnectedness\u2014and the central metaphor of broadband as an ecosystem\u2014implies that policymakers should consider the various issues not in a vacuum, but as part of an integrated whole. National purposes \u2014as directed by the ARRA, the NBP emphasizes that broadband infrastructure and services should be utilized to advance important national purposes including health care, education, energy and the environment, economic opportunity, government performance, civic engagement, and public safety. Broadband availability and adoption could both drive and be driven by the growth of these national purpose applications. Recommendations addressing national purpose applications impact different sectors of society (e.g., health care, education, energy), and in turn call for action by different agencies of the federal government (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, Department of Energy). A challenge for policymakers will be to ensure adequate coordination among the disparate agencies and entities implementing various broadband-related policies.", "To achieve the goals it has set for the year 2020, the NBP has called for moving forward on a number of specific initiatives, many of which address some of the ongoing major telecommunications policy issues likely to be debated and considered by Congress, the Administration, and the FCC. A major issue for Congress will be how to shape the Plan's various initiatives when and if they go forward, either through oversight, through consideration of specific legislation, or in the context of comprehensive telecommunications reform. ", "While most agree with the general goals of the NBP\u2014for example, that robust and affordable broadband should be available and utilized throughout the United States\u2014disagreement persists on the best ways to reach those goals. A key challenge for Congressional policymakers will be to assess whether an appropriate balance is maintained between the public and private sectors, and the extent to which government intervention in the broadband marketplace would help or hinder private sector investment and competition.
