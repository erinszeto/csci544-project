Several issues in U.S.-Peru relations are likely to be considered in decisions by Congress and the Administration on future aid to and cooperation with Peru. The United States supports the strengthening of Peru's democratic institutions, its respect for human rights, environmental protection, and counternarcotics efforts. A dominant theme in bilateral relations is the effort to stem the flow of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, between the two countries. In the economic realm, the United States supports bilateral trade relations and Peru's further integration into the world economy. The United States is Peru's top trading partner. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) went into effect in February 2009. The Obama Administration requested $73 million in foreign assistance for Peru for FY2014 to advance these objectives.", "Ollanta Humala, of the left-wing Gana Peru, was sworn in as Peru's president in July 2011 for a five-year term. Gana Peru initially won 47 seats out of the 130 seats in the unicameral Congress, requiring Humala to rely on political alliances with lesser parties in order to pass legislation. As Humala has moderated his stance, he has lost left-leaning allies within his and other parties. Deep social divides over how to pursue development continue to undercut political stability. The more radical elements of Humala's original support base and his party urge the pursuit of more leftist policies, such as nationalization of strategic industries, which Humala called for during the election campaign. Forces that resist more radical policies include a strong business sector; a conservative, wealthy elite; a centrist middle class; and a divided Congress. Social unrest, especially over exploitation of natural resources, remains a challenge for the Humala government. It has established an office of conflict prevention and taken other actions to reduce social conflict.", "Since 2001 Peru's economy has been stronger than all others in the region, with its growth due mostly to the export of natural resources. High economic growth, along with social programs, has helped to lower Peru's overall poverty rates. Nonetheless, in some jungle, mountain, and rural areas of the country, over 60% of the population continue to live in poverty. The income distribution gap remains quite large as well. This economic disparity has contributed to rising social unrest. President Humala submitted, and the legislature approved, a bill increasing royalties mining companies must pay. The government estimates the royalties will generate about US$1 billion a year, which it will use to finance social development programs intended to narrow both the social divide and the economic distribution gap."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Peru has had a turbulent political history, alternating between periods of democratic and authoritarian rule. Political turmoil dates back to Peru's traumatic experience during the Spanish conquest, which gave rise to the economic, ethnic, and geographic divisions that characterize Peruvian society today. Since its independence in 1821, Peru has had 13 constitutions, with only 9 of 19 elected governments completing their terms. Peru's most recent transition to democracy occurred in 1980 after 12 years of military rule. The decade that followed was characterized by a prolonged economic crisis and the government's unsuccessful struggle to quell a radical Maoist guerrilla insurgency known as the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso). President Alan Garc\u00eda's first term (1985-1990) was characterized by many observers as disastrous. Of the leftist American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), Garc\u00eda's antagonistic relationship with the international financial community and excessive spending on social programs led to hyperinflation (an annual rate above 7,600%) and a debt crisis. ", "By 1990, the Peruvian population was looking for a change and found it in the independent candidate Alberto Fujimori. Initially applauded for his aggressive economic reform program and stepped up counterinsurgency efforts, Fujimori became increasingly autocratic, dissolving the legislature in 1992, overseeing the writing of a new constitution in 1993\u2014which allowed him to run again, and win, in 1995\u2014and engaging in strong-handed military tactics to wipe out the Shining Path that resulted in serious human rights violations. Reelected in 2000, Fujimori's government collapsed with revelations of electoral fraud and high-level corruption, and he fled the country later that same year. In a landmark legal case, on April 7, 2009, former President Fujimori was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for \"crimes against humanity,\" on charges of corruption and human rights abuses. Analysts regard the court's decision as a considerable accomplishment for Peru's judicial system, which has been considered weak and subject to political influence.", "Peru then entered a period of relative political stability, economic growth, and poverty reduction, begun by a capable interim government headed by President Valentin Paniagua (November 2000 -July 2001), and continued by Peru's first president of indigenous descent, Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006). Toledo pushed through significant reforms that increased tax collection, reduced expenditures and the budget deficit, and negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States.", "Softening his populist rhetoric, Alan Garc\u00eda launched a political comeback and won the presidential race in 2006. Many observers cast him as \"the lesser of two evils\" compared to his opponent, Ollanta Humala, who espoused nationalist, anti-globalization policies. Garc\u00eda (2006-2011) maintained orthodox macro-economic policies. Economic growth continued under Garc\u00eda, and so, too, did popular protests over the failure of that growth to improve social conditions for Peru's poorest people, and over the exploitation of natural resources. Humala went on to win the presidency in 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Political Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Following his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2006, Ollanta Humala moderated his stance five years later from an extreme leftist, populist, nationalist approach allied with Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, to a more center-leftist approach modeled after Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Humala won the elections and was sworn in as Peru's president in July 2011 for a five-year term. He defeated Keiko Fujimori, a conservative member of Congress and daughter of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. In his first address as president, Humala promised to maintain free-market policies while also working to narrow the wide economic distribution gap and eliminate the social exclusion of Peru's poor, mostly indigenous population. He reiterated that commitment in a speech to the Peruvian Congress as he completed his first year in office. Acknowledging that his government had not done all it pledged to do, Humala said his goal was to cut Peru's poverty by half, from 30% to 15% of the population by the end of his term in 2016. At the end of 2012, about a year and a half into Humala's term, the poverty rate had dropped to 26% of the population. Initially, Humala's cabinet encompassed a broad range of the political spectrum, from orthodox economists to former military officers and left wing radicals pursuing a consensus-based pragmatic approach. Humala shuffled his cabinet three times in his first year, dismissing all of his top leftist advisers in a major cabinet re-shuffle in late 2011, and consolidating a more centrist approach since then. ", "After he was elected, Humala began negotiations with the mining sector, so that, once inaugurated, he was quickly able to propose an increase in mining royalties paid to the government. Mining companies accepted the increase as inevitable, since both presidential candidates had advocated it, and were willing to accept moderate increases in exchange for a stable set of royalty payment rules. The Peruvian Congress passed the bill, which became effective in January 2012. The increased royalties are expected to provide an additional US$1\u00a0billion annually to the national budget to fund Humala's proposed social inclusion programs and infrastructure projects.

But he has found it difficult to balance his stated desire to help the poor and indigenous with his effort to encourage investment by the business sector.", "Peru's Ombudsman for Human Rights reported that there were over 200 civil conflicts across Peru as Humala came into office. The first law Humala signed was a prior consultation law, requiring mining, energy, and logging companies to consult with indigenous and rural communities about projects planned in their communities, which had been the source of much social conflict. Former President Alan Garc\u00eda had vetoed a similar law, and violent conflicts over land use continued throughout his term. The law brings Peru into compliance with the International Labor Organization's Convention on Indigenous Peoples, which Peru ratified in 1993. The convention requires that companies consult indigenous groups before entering their ancestral territories to exploit natural resources. Implementing regulations went into effect on April 4, 2012. No prior consultations had been carried out as of May 2013.", "As a complement to the new law, the Humala administration also created an office of conflict prevention. As part of that effort, the ministers' council released its first report on social conflict in December 2012, saying that 15 mining conflicts were under the auspices of state conflict prevention measures such as early alert mechanisms and communication strategies. ", "Because the prior consultation law does not grant local communities veto power over investments in their area, however, and does not require consultation for government coca eradication efforts, tensions have continued and are likely to remain an issue. Some businesses worry that the new consultation process could add bureaucratic impediments to their projects. And some conflicts have political or other roots besides land use issues. Although the government said it hoped to reduce the number of conflicts by increasing dialogue among communities, investors, and the state, major conflicts have continued, and some critics say not much has changed. The Humala government has declared states of emergency in the northern Cajamarca region of Peru, but protests against mining efforts there have continued, often turning violent. ", "In the southeastern region of Madre de Dios, the government is contending with illegal mining, which has also led to violence, pollution, and destruction of the Amazonian rainforest. Estimating there to be up to 50,000 small-scale miners in the area, the government decreed stricter penalties for illegal mining in February 2012, has removed thousands of miners, and plans to remove all illegal miners working near national parks. The ombudsman reported 84 new conflicts registered in 2012, involving 24 deaths and 649 injuries. That brought the total number of social conflicts for 2012 to 227. The ombudsman's office reported three cases as resolved in 2012, including one in the Ancash region involving a $1.3 billion expansion of a mine. As of April 2013, there were 229 cases of social conflict, with 76% of them active. The vast majority of the cases are socio-environmental: 73% involve mining. About 9% involve local government issues, and just 6% revolve around territorial disputes. ", "Tensions between indigenous and business concerns have created conflict within the Humala government as well. In an effort to speed approval of investment projects, the Energy and Mines Ministry proposed amending the Prior Consultation law to exclude groups that speak Quechua and Aymara, official national languages spoken by a substantial number of indigenous people. The proposal would make groups living in the highlands, where most mining occurs, and where most social conflict is occurring, ineligible for prior consultation. The deputy minister of intercultural affairs, whose office must implement the law, resigned in protest. ", "Government delays in publishing an Official Database of Indigenous Peoples and the consultation process rules are hindering implementation of the consultation law. The database determines which indigenous populations in which areas will be eligible for prior consultation. Therefore its contents are extremely controversial. The Humala administration has decided that some 14 mining projects can proceed without prior consultation of indigenous communities, without having a clear process or definition of eligible communities in place on which to base those decisions. The government again argues that this is necessary to speed up approval of investment projects, especially where concessions predate the prior consultation law. The Human Rights Ombudsman argues, however, that all of these mining projects are situated in areas where indigenous peoples live, and that those communities should be consulted before the projects proceed further.", "Deep social divides over how to pursue development continue to undercut political stability.

Some members of Humala's own party have left as well, in response to his shift away from the left and the crackdown on anti-mining protests. Unable to agree on candidates, the Congress left key positions including seven Constitutional Tribunal judges, the head of the human rights office, and three members of the central bank's board, vacant for over a year.

The international organization Human Rights Watch opposes granting Fujimori amnesty, saying it \"would be incompatible with Peru's obligations under international law,\" and that humanitarian pardons \"should only be granted on the basis of an independent, thorough, and conclusive medical determination of the gravity of the prisoner's condition and the seriousness of the risk continued detention might pose.\" Some opposed to his release warn it could lead to social unrest and greater influence by Fujimori; he is said to have played a key role in the last elections, in which his daughter lost her bid for the presidency but other supporters of his won seats in the Congress.

He also insists, however, that he will enact policies to eradicate poverty by spreading Peru's wealth to the country's poorest population. President Humala has maintained that \"Economic growth and social inclusion will march together,\" and that he will expand social programs to reduce the number living in poverty. ", "Peru's rapid and sustained economic growth has substantially reduced poverty and increased employment. Peru's poverty rates have been dropping since 2000. Peruvians living in extreme poverty, unable to purchase the most basic basket of necessities, fell from 24.1% in 2001 to 9.8% of the overall population of 30 million in 2010. The percentage of Peruvians living in poverty fell from 54.3% in 2001 to 25.8% in 2012. Social unrest has continued to rise in recent years, however, as Peru's poor have felt that the country's economic prosperity has not reached them. Indeed, the percentage of the population living in poverty in some mountain, jungle, and rural areas is over 60%. The disparity between rural and urban populations remains marked: as of 2012 over half (53%) of the rural population lives in poverty, while 16.1% of the urban population does so. The income distribution gap remains significant: the top 20% of the population garners 52.6% of the nation's income, while the lowest 20% garners only 3.9% of the income.

Overall, for example, chronic malnutrition among children under the age of five declined from 28.5% in 2007 to 23.2% in 2010. But among the poorest 20% of the country's population, 47% of children displayed stunting from malnutrition, as opposed to only 5% of children among the wealthiest quintile.

Some analysts reported that provincial and local governments were therefore not prepared, only two years later, to absorb the $1.13 billion in revenue generated by the Camisea project that the national government transferred to them between 2004 and 2009.

Furthermore, the government has approved 14 mining projects to proceed without prior consultation of the communities in which the projects are located. (See \" Addressing Social Conflicts \" above.)

While mineral extraction has gone on for decades in Peru, the government ministry responsible for protecting the environment is only five years old. In an effort to reduce a conflict of interest, the Humala administration shifted responsibility for approval of environmental impact studies from the mining and energy ministry to the environment industry.

Five protesters were killed when police shot into the crowd in July 2012. Protesters again clashed with police on May 29, 2013, after Newmont Mining announced it was transferring water from a lake the protesters have been trying to protect to the second reservoir the company is building. According to the Yanacocha company, the new reservoirs would increase some communities' access to water year-round. Newmont Mining's local partner, the Buenaventura company, said the communities' response to removal of the lake water could be the \"breaking point\" determining whether or not the mine construction moves forward. Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal says the first two reservoirs are strictly for community use, an effort on the part of the company to contribute to development of the region.

Given uncertainty over the country allocations that would be used as the base line to calculate the sequestration, CRS is unable to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Peru.

Peru is one of the three Andean countries that produce virtually all of the world's coca.

The upper Huallaga valley, formerly the country's largest producer of coca, experienced a strong drop in cultivation, due mostly to intensive eradication there. Producing as much as 40% of the country's coca, the valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers, known as the VRAE region, is now Peru's largest coca cultivating region. Because of security concerns there, however, Peru's eradication agency does not conduct operations there. According to the State Department, 93% of the coca grown in Peru is illegal and intended for cocaine production. The rest is for traditional domestic consumption. The State Department also reports that Peru is a major importer of precursor chemicals that are used to produce cocaine.

Some coca farmers have become allied with remnants of the Shining Path, or Sendero Luminoso, terrorist organization. Now closely linked with narcotics trafficking, the Shining Path conducted 87 terrorist acts in 2012, killing 1 civilian, 13 members of the military, and 5 police officers.

The United States has required total eradication of coca before a farmer can enter into alternative development programs in Peru; critics say farmers should be allowed to make a gradual transition to alternative crops so that they maintain a source of income. When the Humala administration stopped eradication shortly after assuming office, many observers thought it indicated a major shift in policy, especially considering that Humala had support from coca growers in his campaign.

Days after the state of emergency was declared, the defense minister announced that the military was going to \"take total control of the VRAE.\" According to the government, the military intervention to re-take control of the region was to be coupled with the development of infrastructure such as roads, communications, schools, and hospitals by army engineers. Nonetheless, the imposition of full military control of the area for the first time since the administration of former President Alberto Fujimori, now imprisoned for human rights violations and other crimes, raises concerns for many over human rights and development issues.

A Shining Path faction killed two police agents and injured two others in October 2012. In response, the Humala administration said it planned to monitor the Shining Path via satellite, and was in discussions with U.S. officials to allow helicopters provided by the United States for counter-narcotics operations to be used for counterinsurgency operations as well.
