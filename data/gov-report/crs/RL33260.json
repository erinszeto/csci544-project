Papua, for the purposes of this report, refers to the resource rich western half of the island of New Guinea and not the nation or people of Papua New Guinea which is situated on the eastern half of the Island. While the people of Papua have been subject to human rights abuses while under Indonesian rule, the ongoing expansion of democracy and civil society in Indonesia and the leadership of President Yudhoyono hold out the possibility that the human rights situation in Papua may improve. Some view the current improvement in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Indonesia as providing an enhanced opportunity for the United States to continue to support the expansion of democracy, the rule of law, civil society, and human rights while developing closer military-to-military relations with a valuable partner in the war against terror and a key geopolitical actor in the Southeast Asian region. Such policies, by fostering a more democratic and open society, may also contribute to an improved human rights situation in Papua. Others, including some Members of Congress, contend that Indonesia's failure thus far to bring to trial those responsible for the Timika incident and other human rights abuses, suggests that the Indonesian military (TNI) remains, at least in part, outside government control and that the United States should continue to suspend some kinds of military assistance. The recent arrest of Anthonius Wamang, who is thought to have carried out the attack which killed two Americans near Timika in 2002, may resolve what has been a key obstacle to improved military-to-military ties between Indonesia and the United States. It also has the potential to raise further questions concerning the incident.

In 2005 there was considerable change in U.S. relations with Indonesia. The February 2005 decision by the Bush Administration to allow Indonesia to participate in International Military Education and Training (IMET) was followed by a May 2005 decision to restart non-lethal foreign military sales (FMS) to Indonesia and a November 2005 decision to waive foreign military financing (FMF) restrictions due to U.S. national security concerns. In this way, past concerns over human rights in Indonesia, including those in Papua, which had limited the extent of the military-to-military relationship have apparently not been given as much weight by policy makers as they have previously due to Indonesia's democratic development and American security concerns. To many, this foreign policy issue has involved a congressional-executive dispute where democratic development in Indonesia and American security concerns have shifted the locus of policy determinants in favor of the executive branch which currently is seeking to develop closer ties with Indonesia. There is concern among some that the message that the United States is still concerned with the human rights situation in Indonesia needs to continue to be conveyed to Indonesia so that Jakarta does not view this shift in America's position as a signal that America is now less concerned with human rights issues.

To date, circumstances surrounding the Timika attack remain unclear. The two Americans killed were teachers at the International School at Tembagapura near Timika in Papua. They, and their family and friends, came under attack while on a picnic outing. Indonesian police indicated at one point early in the investigation that elements from the Indonesian military may have been involved in the attack. Some of those who believe that elements of the military may have played a role believe that it could have been done in an effort to discredit the Free Papua Movement (OPM) which seeks independence for Papua. Some pro-Papuan independence supporters believe Anthonius Wamang, who is believed to be an OPM operational commander and has been indicted for the attack in the United States, may have been an informer to the Indonesian Military (TNI).

The Indonesian House of Representatives reportedly warned the Indonesian government to take all possible measures to discourage legislation in the United States Congress on Papua. These fears in the minds of Indonesians are made more understandable given Indonesia's colonial past and the history of East Timor. The former Indonesian province of East Timor held a vote on autonomy or independence in 1999 which resulted in the independence of East Timor.

Papua's tribal groups are thought to speak some 15% of the world's languages. The indigenous Melanesian people of Papua have a culture dating back, by some estimates, 40,000 years. This background differs significantly from the Malay character of the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. The Spanish were the first Europeans to discover the islands in 1546. The Dutch laid claim to Papua in 1828, and by 1910 they had an agreement with Britain and Germany (who controlled the southeast and northeastern parts of New Guinea, respectively) which recognized Dutch control over the western half of New Guinea. Like Indonesia, Papua was a Dutch colonial possession. Unlike Indonesia, it did not become a part of newly independent Indonesia at the time of Indonesia's independence in 1949. The Dutch argued that its ethnic and cultural difference justified Dutch control until a later date. Under former President Sukarno, Indonesia began mounting military pressure on Dutch West Papua in 1961.", "As outlined in a report by the Council on Foreign Relations, in 1962 the United States pressured the Dutch to turn over control of West Papua to the United Nations (U.N.). Under the American-brokered New York Agreement of 1962 Indonesia was to \"make arrangements with the assistance and participation of the United Nations\" to give Papuans an opportunity to determine whether they wished to become part of Indonesia or not. Indonesia assumed control over Papua in 1963. In the \"Act of Free Choice,\" carried out in 1969, selected delegates decided to join Indonesia.", "The Act of Free Choice is generally not considered to have been representative of the will of all Papuans. A broad-based referendum on Indonesian control over West Papua was not held. Instead, a group of 1,025 local officials voted in favor of merging with Indonesia. The U.N. is generally considered to have failed in its mission to give the people of Papua an opportunity for self determination. To some, \"while Western colonial policy was coming to an end\u2014a new chapter of Asiatic colonial policy was opening.\" The pro-independence Free Papua Movement (OPM) emerged as these events were unfolding. It has been estimated by human rights advocate groups that 100,000 Papuans have died as the result of Indonesian control in Papua, though others have more recently challenged the scale of this figure.", "Declassified documents released in July 2004 indicate that the United States supported Indonesia's take over of Papua in the lead up to the 1969 Act of Free Choice even as it was understood that such a move was likely unpopular with Papuans. The documents reportedly indicate that the United States estimated that between 85% and 90% of Papuans were opposed to Indonesian rule and that as a result the Indonesians were incapable of winning an open referendum at the time of Papua's transition from Dutch colonial rule. Such steps were evidently considered necessary to maintain the support of Suharto's Indonesia during the Cold War. A similar view was taken towards East Timor.", "Central to the conflict in Papua is its vast natural wealth, most of which stems from resource extraction industry, particularly mining and logging. Fisheries resources are another potentially valuable resource. Economic activity in built-up areas is dominated by Malay migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia. Traditionally, only a small percentage of the wealth generated by the natural resources of Papua has remained in the province. Papua is one of Indonesia's poorest provinces despite its extensive natural resource wealth. Under the Special Autonomy Law for Papua of 2001, 70% of oil and gas royalties and 80% of mining, forestry and fisheries royalties are supposed to go to the province."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Human Rights Situation in Papua", "paragraphs": ["While noting that Indonesia generally \"made substantial progress in strengthening its democracy,\" the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices of 2004, which was released in February 2005, describes the human rights situation in Indonesia as \"poor; although there were improvements in a few areas.\" It states that \"security force members murdered, tortured, raped, beat, and arbitrarily detained civilians and members of separatist movements, especially in Aceh and to a lesser extent in Papua.\"", "With the conflict in Aceh appearing to be coming to an end through an ongoing peace process, there seems to be increased attention on the human rights situation in Papua.

Arbitrary detention, torture, disappearances, and arson are widespread in this vast and isolated region of Indonesia.\" HRW has also pointed to the influx of non-Melanesian Indonesians, who remain largely in the towns and are mostly Malay Muslims as opposed to the more rural and Christian native Melanesian Papuans and who present a \"volatile mix susceptible to manipulation by unscrupulous political leaders.\" While the 2004 report Indonesian Human Rights Abuses in West Papua , by the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale University Law School did \"not offer a definitive conclusion about whether genocide has occurred [in Papua] it finds in the available evidence a strong indication that the Indonesia government has committed genocide against the West Papuans.\" It goes on to state that even if the violence committed against Papuans were not committed with the intent to destroy the Papuans as a group \"many of these acts clearly constitute crime against humanity.\" An international dimension to the conflict arose in January 2006 when a group of 43 Papuans fled to Australia in an outrigger canoe and asked for political asylum.

It is at the local level that the environmental impact and social dislocating impact of the mine's operations are felt. The mine will generate an estimated 6 billion tons of waste before completion of operations. Much of the waste has made its way into ground water, rivers, and low lying wet lands rendering them, according to one study, unsuitable for aquatic life. Freeport has been accused in the past by tribal groups and Western activists of environmental degradation, abetting the military's presence in Papua, and not sharing enough wealth with local people. In 1995, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation withdrew Freeport's political risk insurance apparently over environmental concerns.", "In its defense, Freeport reportedly has undertaken initiatives to seek to address the negative impact of the mine.

This period of openness to local autonomy lost momentum and its provisions were never fully implemented.

In its ruling, the Constitutional Court did allow the division of Papua into two provinces, Papua and West Irian Jaya Provinces. Approval of the then yet to be established Papuan People's Council, which was to be made up of representative traditional leaders, religious leaders, and women, was viewed as important. The Indonesian government reportedly accepted the governor's plan to divide the province into five separate provinces by 2009 despite the constitutional court's earlier ruling.

Others would argue that the United States must do all it can to curb human rights abuses by the Indonesian military, while others would argue that these two approaches can be blended."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
