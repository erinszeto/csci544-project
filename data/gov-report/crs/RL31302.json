Most of the difference between theAdministration's budget request and the funding level endorsed by the committee related to fundingfor PRIME: the committee approved $14 million less than the Administration requested, mainly outof a concern about the ability of the IRS to manage the program efficiently. In its report to the fullHouse on the measure ( H.Rept. 107-575 ), the Committee expressed concern about recent reporteddeclines in compliance activity by the IRS and the agency's priorities in combating taxpayer fraudand errors.

A total of $7 million is provided for low-income taxpayer clinic grants, and at least $60million is to be spent on combating abusive tax shelters. The conference agreement on H.J.Res. 2 ( H.Rept. 108-10 ) directs the IRS to focus its resources on conducting \"baseoperations\" rather than undertaking new initiatives. This emphasis may partly explain why theagreement takes away $70 million in funding for PRIME in FY 2003 that Congress earlier hadapproved through the ITIA.

As it was last year, the Electronic Government Fund continues to be a somewhat contentious matter between the Presidentand Congress. In advance of his proposed budget for FY2002, the President released, on February28, 2001, A Blueprint for New Beginnings: A Responsible Budget for America's Priorities . Intendedas a 10-year budget plan, the Blueprint , among other innovations, proposed the establishment of anelectronic government account, seeded with \"$10 million in 2002 as the first installment of a fundthat will grow to a total of $100 million over three years to support interagency electronicGovernment (e-gov) initiatives.\" Managed by OMB, the fund was foreseen as supporting \"projectsthat operate across agency boundaries,\" facilitating \"the development of a Public Key Infrastructureto implement digital signatures that are accepted across agencies for secure online communications,\"and furthering \"the Administration's ability to implement the Government Paperwork EliminationAct of 1998, which calls upon agencies to provide the public with optional use and acceptance ofelectronic information, services and signatures, when practicable, by October 2003.\" (47) About onemonth later, on March 22, OMB Deputy Director Sean O'Keefe announced that the BushAdministration had decided to double the amount to be allocated to the e-gov fund, bringing it to $20million. (48)", "As included in the President's budget, the fund was established as an account within the General Services Administration (GSA), to be administered by the Administrator of GeneralServices \"to support interagency projects, approved by the Director of the Office of Management andBudget, that enable the Federal Government to expand its ability to conduct activities electronically,through the development and implementation of innovative uses of the Internet and other electronicmethods.\" The President's initial request for the fund was $20 million, to remain available untilSeptember 30, 2004. Congress, however, appropriated $5 million for the fund for FY2002, toremain available until expended. Appropriators specified that transfers of monies from the fund tofederal agencies could not be made until 10 days after a proposed spending plan and justification foreach project to be undertaken using such monies had been submitted to the Committees onAppropriations. Expressing general support for the purposes of the fund, they also recommended,and both chambers agreed, that the administration work with the House Committee on GovernmentReform and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to clarify the status of its authorization.", "The President's budget for FY2003 \"recognizes GSA as operator of the official federal portal for providing citizens with one-stop access to federal services via the Internet or telephone\" and,therefore, a key agency in implementing the President's e-gov vision, which will \"requirecross-agency approaches that permit citizens, businesses, and state and local governments to easilyobtain services from, and electronically transact business with the federal government.\" In thisregard, an administration interagency Quicksilver E-Gov Task Force, according to the budget, has\"identified 23 high priority Internet services for early development.\" Seeking $45 million for thee-gov fund, the budget acknowledged that this amount was \"a significant increase over the $20million requested in 2002,\" but noted that the request \"is supported by specific project plansdeveloped by the Quicksilver Task Force.\" (49) Furthermore, according to the fund account statement,these monies \"would also further the Administration's implementation of the GovernmentPaperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) of 1998, which calls upon agencies to provide the public withoptional use and acceptance of electronic information, services, and signatures, when practicable,by October 2003.\"", "The House Appropriations Committee again rejected the amount requested by the President and recommended $5 million for the fund, reiterating, as previously, that transfers of monies from thefund to federal agencies could not be made until 10 days after a proposed spending plan andjustification for each project to be undertaken using such monies had been submitted to theCommittees on Appropriations. The committee also declined to recommend an appropriation forthe fund as a GSA account, but did fund it as an account under the jurisdiction of the Office ofManagement and Budget within the Executive Office of the President. (50) The Senate Committee onAppropriations recommended the full $45 million requested by the President. Their report states thatOMB \"would control the allocation of the fund and direct its use for information systems projectsand affect multiple agencies and offer the greatest improvements in access and service.\" (51) As notedabove, P.L. 108-7 funds the account at $5,000,000.", "Election Reform.

For the last several years, Congress has limitedthe rates of adjustment, based on the rates of adjustment for the General Schedule( P.L. 108-7 , Division J, Sec. 613).

Pensions for federal employees are funded through contributions by employees andthe federal government to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund(CSRDF).

Pensions under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), whichcovers only federal employees who were hired before 1984, are not fully pre-funded. Contributions from employees and their employing agencies and the interest on thosecontributions do not cover the full cost of the pension benefits that employees in theCSRS accrue each year. The CSRS therefore has a substantial unfunded liability, andit accrues additional unfunded liability each year. Part of this unfunded liability ispaid for by annual transfers from the general revenues of the U.S. Treasury to theCSRDF. The part of the unfunded liability that is not paid for by these transferseventually will be paid for through additional transfers to the CSRDF from thegeneral revenues of the Treasury.", "Subtitle A of Title II of S. 1612 (107th Congress), the Managerial Flexibility Act, would have required each federal agency to make additionalcontributions to the CSRDF on behalf of employees covered by CSRS. (82) Theseadditional contributions would be made from the salary and expense accountsappropriated annually by Congress to each agency. Whether the agencies' salary andexpense accounts would be increased by the amount of the additional contributionswould be determined by the Congress. The additional contributions would preventfurther unfunded liability from accruing to the CSRS. They would not amortize (payoff) the unfunded liability that already has accrued under the CSRS. Increasingagency contributions to the CSRDF requires legislation and could not be done underthe existing regulatory authority of the Office of Personnel Management, whichadminister the Civil Service Retirement System.", "In the FY2003 Budget documents, the primary account presentations, for Salaries and Expenses Accounts, factor in the pre-funding proposals.

The costs ofadministration are covered by appropriation directly to the Labor Department.", "The proposed legislation would have charged administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs, i.e. through the budgets of each employing agency. Thestated intention was to make each agency explicitly bear the full cost of theiremployees' claims, thus \"bolstering their incentive to improve workplace safety.\" Based on recent experience, the administrative surcharge would be around 4.5% ofbenefit costs. (For example, in FY2000 this would have represented $92 million inadministrative costs related to $2,025 million in program benefits.) Most of thesurcharge would be paid by the two agencies that account for more than 60% ofFECA claims: the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department.
