More recently he has moved to deepen trade and economic ties with China.

The United States and Malaysia are major trade and investment partners. In 2016, Malaysia was the 24th-largest market for U.S. exports and the 14th-largest supplier of U.S. imports. The two countries negotiated and signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement (FTA), which would have removed tariff and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States, Malaysia, and the other 10 participants. President Trump withdrew from the pact in January, stating an intent to negotiate future FTAs bilaterally, potentially with TPP partners. To date, there appears to have been little discussion of resuming bilateral U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations, but there may be interest in Malaysia in some type of economic dialogue with the United States such as a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). Malaysia is also seeking to develop deeper regional trade ties through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which does not include the United States.", "Malaysia has enjoyed considerable political stability since it gained independence in 1957 despite potential cleavages within its multiethnic and multireligious social fabric. Political coalitions led by the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the country's dominant political party, have ruled Malaysia without interruption since independence. UMNO is a staunch proponent of economic and social preferences for ethnic Malays and other indigenous groups, collectively known as bumiputra. It has supported a wide-ranging economic program known as the New Economic Policy (NEP), which attempts to address socio-economic disparities by privileging bumiputra in government contracts, education, and government hiring.

Bilateral ties are considerably closer than they may appear to some observers, but political sensitivities in Malaysia as well as concerns related to allegations of corruption and mistrust lingering from less amicable periods constrain the establishment of a deeper strategic relationship. Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation of 31 million people, is a partner in numerous U.S. security and economic initiatives in Southeast Asia. It is a major U.S. trading partner and a site of substantial U.S. investment. Malaysia, for many years one of the leading voices behind building \"Asia-only\" regional institutions, more recently has been an advocate of a strong U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Some experts believe that Malaysian concerns about China's assertiveness in the South China Sea have been a primary driver behind closer U.S.-Malaysia strategic ties. Yet, some issues have proven contentious over recent years\u2014particularly Malaysia's human rights record and U.S. counter-terrorism strategy and policy in the Middle East\u2014and many observers still perceive a ceiling on the degree to which the two countries can deepen their relationship. Like many Southeast Asian nations, Malaysia has long maintained a foreign policy that hedges between the United States, China, and other powers\u2014a policy that continues under Prime Minister Najib Razak.", "The former Obama Administration's strategic \"rebalancing\" of foreign policy priorities to Asia placed increased attention on the nations of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia. Although the rebalancing did not feature high-profile bilateral initiatives with Malaysia, some observers say U.S.-Malaysia relations warmed considerably. Malaysia is one of the 12 nations that signed the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which the Trump administration decided to withdraw. Malaysia had placed high priority on being part of the U.S.-led initiative. The United States and Malaysia also conduct numerous military exchanges, training exercises, and port visits and cooperate in counter-terrorism and maritime domain awareness.", "Malaysia harbors a strong self-image as a moderate leader within the Islamic world, and plays an active role in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Malaysia has criticized U.S. military interventions in the Middle East and U.S. support for Israel, maintaining that these policies created a perception that the United States is \"anti-Islam,\" and that U.S. rhetoric generated broader support for Islamic militancy. Malaysian statements along these lines have moderated in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Najib. Some observers, however, point to stronger voices among some conservative Islamist Malaysians as a sign of rising tension among some of Malaysia's Muslim leaders.", "The United States' withdrawal from the TPP agreement, and other actions taken by the Trump Administration, such as seeking to block arrivals to the United States from select Muslim nations, has created uncertainty in Malaysia about the United States' approach and commitment to the region, and has contributed to perceptions that the U.S. may turn inward or may become anti-Islamic. Such ambiguity and uncertainty regarding U.S. policy shifts towards the region may influence how states in the region calibrate their relationships with both the United States and China. The Asia rebalance was welcomed by many in Asia, including Malaysia, as a reassuring sign of the United States' commitment to the region. Questions about whether that commitment may wane under the new administration are emerging.

In the late 18 th through mid-19 th centuries various principalities on the Malaysian Peninsula and northern Borneo fell under the British sphere of influence. Britain administered these resource-rich states through local leaders and eventually knit together these territories into the Federated Malay States in 1895.

The British and their anti-Communist allies in Malaysia defeated the Communist campaign, sometimes employing brutal tactics; this period is known as \"the Emergency.\" Peninsular Malaya gained its independence as a constitutional monarchy in 1957, and the colonies of Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak were relinquished by Britain in 1963 into the new Federation of Malaysia. Indonesian ruler Sukarno opposed this union and instigated low-level military conflict (known as konfrontasi ) with newly enlarged Malaysia until 1965.

A major consequence of the race riots was the New Economic Policy (NEP), which sought to remedy socioeconomic disparities by favoring bumiputra \u2014ethnic Malays and other indigenous groups\u2014over minority groups, including the economically preeminent ethnic Chinese minority. The Malaysian government promoted agricultural improvements, natural resource exploitation, and export-oriented industrialization (reserving opportunities for bumiputra ) that led to consistent economic growth through the 1970s and 1980s. In the political sphere, the UMNO-led Barisan National (BN) coalition of ethnically-based parties (including parties representing Malaysia's Chinese and Indian minorities) has maintained its preeminence since independence and delivered a measure of stability to Malaysia despite internal diversity and a volatile external security environment.", "A central figure in Malaysian politics is Mahathir Mohamad, who was Prime Minister from 1981 until 2003 and remains politically active. Mahathir helped to shape a more secular Malaysia by limiting the political strength of religious leaders and curtailing the privileges of Malaysia's royalty. He also aggressively sought to rein in critical voices in the political arena, the media, and civil society.

Compared to its Southeast Asian neighbors, Malaysia has a relatively high average income, but its economy has not yet made a full transition toward high technology, high value-added industries. Malaysia has been successful at developing manufacturing and service industries, but its economy continues to rely heavily on its natural resources, particularly oil, natural gas, and timber.

UMNO's position at the center of the ruling coalition reflects the importance of ethnicity, and to a lesser degree religion, in Malaysian politics. In the 1970s, in an effort to reduce tensions between the nation's Muslim Malay majority and minority groups (primarily Chinese and Indian), UMNO leaders implemented the NEP. At the same time, UMNO recruited smaller parties that represented the country's Chinese and Indian communities into the ruling coalition. In the decades since, the question of the NEP's bumiputra preferences (i.e., favoring ethnic Malays and other indigenous groups), and more broadly of ethnic identity, has become one of the defining issues in Malaysian politics. The Chinese- and Indian-based parties in the ruling coalition have performed poorly in recent elections, giving the ruling coalition a less multi-ethnic character.
