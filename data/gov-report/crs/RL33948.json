The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (P.L. 111-195) which was enacted in 2010, includes provisions authorizing state and local governments to divest from those businesses making investments of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector after adequate investigation and notification have occurred.

A variation of the latter is a state or local divestment law which, for example, may require divestment by state pension funds of stock in companies that either do business within a named country or with that country's government.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Foreign Commerce Clause", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to regulate both interstate and foreign commerce (Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3). In addition to this affirmative grant of constitutional authority, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Commerce Clause implies a corresponding restraint on the authority of the states to interfere with commerce, even absent Congressional action. This inferred restriction arising from congressional inaction is generally referred to as the \"dormant\" Commerce Clause. Under this established principle, states and localities are impliedly prohibited from unreasonably burdening or discriminating against either interstate or foreign commerce unless they are authorized by Congress to do so. In a series of cases involving state taxes, the Supreme Court has set out criteria for examining whether state measures impermissibly burden foreign commerce where affirmative congressional permission is absent. In sum, the Court has required a closer examination of measures alleged to infringe the Foreign Commerce Clause than is required for those alleged to infringe its interstate counterpart, but has also provided scope for state measures in situations where a federal role is not clearly demanded.", "In Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles , the Supreme Court struck down on Foreign Commerce Clause grounds a California state statute that applied an ad valorem property tax on foreign cargo containers. In doing so, the court identified two reasons why \"a more extensive constitutional inquiry is required\" in foreign commerce cases than those involving \"purely interstate commerce.\" First, there is an \"enhanced risk of multiple taxation\" upon goods involved in foreign commerce than in the case of domestic goods. Secondly, a state tax upon an instrumentality in foreign commerce \"may impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential,\" or, in other words, may \"prevent [] the Federal Government from 'speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.'\" The Court made clear that \"[i]f a state tax contravenes either of these precepts, it is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.\"", "Four years later in Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board , the Court upheld a state income tax law challenged by a multinational enterprise, finding that it did not infringe upon the federal government's authority over foreign commerce. The Court viewed the case as involving several facts which made it distinguishable from the state tax which had been struck down in Japan Line, Ltd . In upholding the California state income tax law, the Court also elaborated upon its prior recognition in Japan Line, Ltd. that a state tax may be impermissible if it prevents the federal government from speaking with \"one voice\" on international trade issues. Here, the Court indicated that state action may have \"merely foreign resonances\" without impermissibly treading upon the federal government's authority over foreign affairs. A state tax \"will violate the 'one voice' standard if it either implicates foreign policy issues which must be left to the Federal Government or violates a clear federal directive.\" The Court noted that the second of these factors \"is, of course, essentially a species of preemption analysis.\" ", "The Court later concluded in Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board of California , a case examining California's income-based corporate franchise tax, that even a state statute that may make it more difficult for the federal government to speak with a single voice on international trade will be sustained if there is no clear indication that Congress had intended to bar the state practice. The Court stated that Container Corporation and a subsequent case, Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Revenue , in which the Court upheld a state tax on jet fuel purchased by foreign airlines, suggested that \"Congress may more passively indicate that certain state practices do not 'impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential....'\" Moreover, Congress \"need not convey its intent with the unmistakable clarity required to permit state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce....\" ", "Where Congress has not clearly immunized a state selective purchasing or divestment law for Foreign Commerce Clause purposes, arguments that any such law impermissibly burdens foreign commerce may be countered by invocation of the market participant doctrine. First articulated in the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , the doctrine exempts from the clause those laws in which the state or local government acts as a buyer or seller of goods rather than as a regulator. It is counter-argued, however, that the doctrine is inapplicable where the state seeks to affect behavior beyond the immediate market in which it is operating; that it does not immunize laws from other constitutional challenges; and that, as suggested by the Supreme Court, it may not even apply in Foreign Commerce Clause cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intrusion into Foreign Affairs", "paragraphs": ["\"Power over external affairs is not shared by the States; it is vested in the national government exclusively.\" State or local laws which encroach upon the federal government's authority over foreign affairs may be deemed constitutionally impermissible. In its 1968 decision in Zschernig v. Miller , the Supreme Court struck down an Oregon law prohibiting nonresident aliens from inheriting property if they could not satisfy certain requirements. Namely, the Oregon statute required such aliens to demonstrate to the Oregon state courts that their home countries allowed U.S. nationals to inherit estates on a reciprocal basis and that payments to foreign heirs from the Oregon estates would not be confiscated. ", "Although the federal government had not exercised its power in the area, the Supreme Court nonetheless found that the inquiries required by the Oregon statute would result in \"an intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress.\" The Court distinguished its earlier decision in Clark v. Allen , which had upheld a similar California statute, on the ground that the statute in that case could be implemented through \"a routine reading of foreign law\" and did not require the particularized inquiries demanded by the Oregon statute. ", "Many observers have characterized the parameters of the Zschernig ruling as unclear. Application of the ruling is often an issue in litigation concerning state or local measures which restrict economic transactions with companies doing business with foreign entities whose conduct the state or locality finds objectionable. It has been argued, for example, that state or local selective procurement laws, through which jurisdictions condition eligibility for a public contract upon business entity refraining from certain activities within or in relation to a foreign country, are directed at influencing or scrutinizing foreign behavior in the manner that the Zschernig Court found objectionable. Courts that have upheld restrictive procurement laws that were challenged on Zschernig grounds have emphasized that the challenged laws applied neutrally to all foreign products, and thus did not require the assessment of a particular government's policies that might result in constitutional infirmity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preemption by Federal Enactment", "paragraphs": ["The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution establishes that federal statutes, treaties, and the Constitution itself are \"the supreme Law of the Land.\" Accordingly, states can be precluded from taking actions that are otherwise within their authority if federal law is thereby thwarted. The extent to which federal law preempts, or supersedes, state law in a given area is entirely within the control of Congress. Congress may, by clearly or expressly stating its intent, choose to preempt all state laws, no state laws, or only certain state laws. Absent an express statement from Congress, an act of Congress may also impliedly preempt state or local action in a given area. Where Congress has not expressly preempted state and local laws, two types of implied federal preemption may be found: field preemption , in which federal regulation is so pervasive that one can reasonably infer that states or localities have no role to play, and conflict preemption , in which \"compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\" or where the state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" The delineation between preemption categories, and in particular between conflict and field preemption, is not rigid.", "In preemption cases involving foreign affairs, courts may well weigh the deference traditionally accorded areas subject to state and local regulation against the policy considerations implicated by the federal scheme affecting foreign affairs or commerce. For example, in the Supreme Court's ruling in the 1941 case of Hines v. Davidowitz , which invalidated a state alien registration statute, the Court reiterated the long-recognized, constitutionally based supremacy of federal authority in foreign affairs and made clear that any concurrent state power in the area must be \"restricted to the narrowest of limits.\u2026.\" ", "Depending on the nature of a state statute and the type of federal action taken to deal with a problematic foreign nation, opponents of a state sanctions law may thus argue that, even absent express preemption by a federal statute, (1) a state law may conflict with federal laws and policies targeted at a specific country with respect to the activities and persons covered, or (2) there is reason to presume that Congress intended that all state and local measures targeting a particular country be preempted. In response, it might be maintained, inter alia , that federal limitations on the exercise of proprietary powers to contract and invest must be expressly intended or must result from a highly pervasive federal scheme. Moreover, state laws may arguably mandate consequences that differ from federal remedies or that do not exist on the federal level so long as the federal legislation or action involved does not constitute a \"complex and interrelated federal scheme of law, remedy and administration.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Notable Federal Judicial Rulings on State Sanctions (2000-Present)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Crosby v.

National Foreign Trade Council , the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a Massachusetts selective purchasing law targeted at Burma was impliedly preempted by federal sanctions against Burma contained in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 1997 ( P.L. 104-208 ). At the time, the absence of well-developed case law directly addressing sub-federal sanctions had made the outcome of a constitutional challenge to state sanctions laws unclear. Although various Supreme Court cases had previously examined aspects of such laws, none directly ruled on such a statute. Moreover, the few state cases scrutinizing such measures on constitutional grounds differed in result.", "Although Congress had not expressly preempted state laws in the federal Burma statute, the Court found the Massachusetts law was impliedly preempted because it \"undermines the intended purpose and 'natural effect' of at least three provisions of the federal Act, namely, its delegation of effective discretion to the President to control economic sanctions against Burma, its limitation of sanctions solely to United States persons and new investment, and its directive to proceed diplomatically in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy towards Burma.\"", "After rejecting the state's argument that the law could not be preempted because it was based on an exercise of the state's spending power, the Court found that the law lacked the flexibility inherent in the federal statute: the state law had stringent application requirements and no termination provision, while federal law authorized the President to lift federal measures in certain circumstances, allowed him to prohibit new investment based on his own findings, and provided waiver authority with regard to all sanctions imposed in the statute. The state law was also found to exceed federal authorities. While the Massachusetts law covered most state contracts, foreign and domestic firms, and firms already operating in Burma, the federal law imposed sanctions solely on U.S. persons, authorized a prohibition on new investment only, and exempted purchase and sales contracts from any ban. Finally, the Court ruled that the state law had impeded the President's ability to pursue the multilateral strategy envisioned in the federal act, with the Court noting formal protests from U.S. trading partners, World Trade Organization complaints, and the distraction caused by the state law in discussions with foreign countries regarding the situation in Burma.", "Finally, the Court rejected the state's argument that Congress had implicitly permitted the state law because it had failed to expressly preempt state sanctions against Burma. Massachusetts noted that Congress was aware of the state's law when it adopted the federal Burma statute in 1996. However, the Court found that \"[a] failure to provide for preemption expressly may reflect nothing more than the settled character of implied preemption doctrine that the courts will dependably apply\" and that \"in any event, the existence of a conflict cognizable under the Supremacy Clause does not depend on express recognition that federal and state law may conflict.\" The Court found that in this case Congress's silence was ambiguous and insufficient to warrant an inference of congressional intent to permit states to adopt their own Burmese sanctions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "American Insurance Association v.

An executive agreement with Germany signed by the President provided that the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims would serve as the sole vehicle for voluntary insurance claims to reduce litigation between foreign nationals and German firms. Despite the lack of a specific preemption clause, the Court, citing the \"kid glove\" approach chosen by the executive branch that was evident in the German agreement and similar agreements with Austria and France, along with executive branch statements supporting this approach, determined that there was a \"clear conflict\" between the policies adopted by the executive and the \"iron fist\" that California sought to use.

At issue in the February 23, 2007, decision was a statute that placed restrictions both on the deposit of state funds and the investment of state and municipal pension assets.

The statute ultimately required that none of the assets of the system or fund be invested in \"forbidden entities\" by the end of July 2007. For purposes of the pension amendments, the term \"forbidden entity\" included (1) the firms described above; (2) any publicly traded company that owned or controlled Sudan-related property or assets or engaged in other Sudan-related transactions; and (3) any non-publicly traded company that failed to submit to the fund's managing company a sworn affidavit averring that the company did not own or control any Sudan-related property or conduct business transactions in Sudan. The statute was challenged on preemption, foreign affairs, and foreign commerce grounds.", "In reaching its decision, the court set out federal law regarding Sudan, beginning with a 1997 Executive Order signed by President Clinton freezing Sudanese property in the United States and prohibiting various transactions between the United States and Sudan, and continuing with three subsequent public laws: the Sudan Peace Act (2002), the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act (2004), and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (2006). None of these statutes contains a provision expressly preempting states from enacting their own sanctions against the Sudan. ", "Addressing the statutory preemption argument, the court held that, with respect to the amendment to the Deposit of State Moneys Act, the Illinois statute's \"lack of flexibility, extended geographic reach, and impact on foreign entities interferes with the national government's conduct of foreign affairs,\" and was thus preempted by federal law. On the other hand, the pension amendments were found not to be preempted, since federal law did not expressly address divestment, and, in the district court's view \"the potential effects of pension divestment on the national government's ability to conduct foreign policy are highly attenuated.\" The court stated that it had not been presented with evidence \"suggesting that these pension funds' inability to purchase the securities of such companies would be in any way likely to affect their decision to do business in that country\" and thus it had not been shown \"that pension fund divestment stands as an 'obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress' with regard to Sudan policy.\"", "Regarding the claim that the state measure impermissibly intruded upon the federal government's authority over foreign affairs, the court found scant prior case law on the issue, but concluded that the amendments to the Deposit of State Moneys Act \"would have an impact on the national government's ability to deal with Sudan that is at least equal to or greater than the impact of the state laws in Zschernig and Garamendi. \" The court considered that the amendments might cause multinational companies to pull out of Sudan, resulting in a \"real and direct\" effect on Sudan's economy, and that they thus clearly had \"more than an incidental or indirect effect\" in Sudan. Noting as well the amendments' \"substantive and direct impact on the national government's ability to carry out the flexible and measured approach to Sudanese relations that Congress and the president have created,\" the court held that they interfered impermissibly with the federal government's power to conduct the nation's foreign affairs. At the same time, the court held that the pension amendments did not improperly intrude on the federal foreign affairs authority, finding that they did not place the same kind of pressure on firms to sever business ties with that country that flowed from the banking amendments and thus were not likely to affect the firms' willingness to do business in Sudan.", "Because the court had already found the banking amendments unconstitutional on two grounds, it did not consider them in light of the Foreign Commerce Clause. Nevertheless, it did find that \"there is little doubt that the conduct the Illinois Sudan Act seeks to proscribe involves foreign commerce\" and that \"[w]ithout the protection of the market participant exception, the amendment to the Pension Code violates the Foreign Commerce Clause.\" The court found that to the extent that the state was exercising control over municipal pension funds, however, it was acting as a market regulator and that the market participant doctrine, even if it were determined applicable in Foreign Commerce Clause cases, did not apply to this situation. With respect to the state's control of its own pension funds, the court held that, even if the amendment was constitutional if only applied to these funds, it could not be severed from the unconstitutional portion of the statute. The court therefore struck down the pension amendment as a whole.", "The State of Illinois appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. It also enacted new Sudan-related divestment legislation, which included a repeal of the invalidated provisions.

For instance, state investors rely on private organizations to identify firms with business interests in targeted countries. The particular concern is that this information might be inaccurate or fail to take account of the federal government's interests.

Besides questions of their efficacy in changing foreign government behavior, divestment measures could diminish the rate of return on investment. There are increased administrative costs related to screening investments for ties to targeted nations.
