In private sector organizations witha CIO, this person serves as the seniordecisionmaker providing leadership and direction for information resource development, procurement, andmanagement, with a focus on improving efficiency andthe quality of services delivered. The possibility of creating a federal CIO, to be located in the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB), was originallyconsidered in an early draft of what became the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1995 ( P.L. 104-106 ). However, the idea ofa single federal CIO was dropped in favor ofcreating CIO positions within the executive agencies in the final version of the law. The mixed results ofagency-level CIOs, combined with a growing interest inbetter managing government technology resources, brought renewed attention to creating a national CIO positionduring the 106th Congress. In addition, therecent piecemeal efforts to move governmental functions and services online has led some observers to call for anelectronic government (e-government) \"czar\" ora federal CIO to coordinate these efforts. (1)", "During the mid-1990s, Congress considered several bills focusing on governmental reform and improved management of public resources. The option ofestablishing a federal CIO was one of several proposals to address these problems. The success of CIOs in theprivate sector is often cited as an example forgovernment to follow. However, the interest in establishing CIOs in the federal government was generated by theexperience of local and state governments. Atthe time forty states had some form of a CIO operating in a policy capacity, as did several major cities. For many,their experience demonstrated that there was aneed for someone to articulate a \"vision\" of information resources that helped coordinate agency activities and goalsrather than reinforce the artificial\"stovepipes\" that separated them. ", "However, the idea of a federal CIO was dropped in favor of agency-level CIOs following testimony at a July, 1995 Senate Governmental Affairs Committeehearing. At this hearing, a number of arguments were made in favor of eliminating the single federal CIO provisionsin the Clinger-Cohen Act. Some critics ofthe proposal argued that the operational nature of the CIO position (i.e., the development of technical standards,determining the applicability of procurementlaws, and maintenance of performance and efficiency indicators) was a poor fit with the traditional policy role ofOMB. Other critics argued that creating a federalCIO was adding another layer of bureaucracy and centralizing decisionmaking procedures. They contended thatit was counterproductive to the purpose of theClinger-Cohen Act, which was to decentralize decisionmaking processes and purchasing decisions away from theGeneral Services Administration (GSA) to theindividual executive agencies. A third argument made by some critics at the time was that the role of a federal CIOwas too big for any one person or agency tohandle. Proponents of this view noted that the size of the Department of Defense alone was larger than some stategovernments, and that cross-agency groupsfocusing on specific problems would be a more effective approach. In light of this opposition, Congress decidedto instead designate a CIO in each of the majorexecutive branch agencies. These agency-level CIOs were tasked with the following responsibilities: ", "(1) providing advice and other assistance to the head of the executive agency and other senior management personnel of the executive agency to ensure thatinformation technology is acquired and information resources are managed for the executive agency in a mannerthat is consistent with chapter 35 of title 44,United States Code, and the priorities established by the head of the executive agency;", "(2) developing, maintaining, and facilitating the implementation of a sound and integrated information technology architecture for the executive agency; and ", "(3) promoting the effective and efficient design and operation of all major information resources management processes for the executive agency, includingimprovements to work processes of the executive agency.

The CIO Council meets monthly and has six committees to addressspecific information technology managementconcerns such as enterprise interoperability, security and privacy, and e-government. The committees work to helpfacilitate the growth of government standards,share best practices, and help agencies work to be in compliance with reform legislation such as the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act (GPRA).

Discussed in greater detail below, supporterscite a variety of reasons to justify creating a federal CIOposition. Some of the reasons include a need to develop government-wide cybersecurity (17) measures and a need for a voice to advocate the appropriate budgetarysupport for both short and long term information technology projects. Another reason frequently cited is the needto coordinate the growing number of federale-government initiatives. As more government functions become available online, sustained and focused centralleadership becomes critical to improving federalIT performance and enhancing the delivery of services. (18) This includes thedevelopment of government information technology standards that will contribute to arobust and secure information infrastructure. A common theme underlying many of these arguments is the beliefthat the role of information technology ingovernance requires leadership with strategic vision to ensure that the improved productivity and efficiency expectedby the investment in technology is realized. Some observers also point to the role of CIOs in improving the performance and productivity of private sectororganizations as an example of what could be donein the public sector. (19)", "In response, opponents of efforts to establish a federal CIO argue that the responsibilities of such a position are too complex and unwieldy for one person. Theybelieve that it is not possible for an individual to manage and coordinate the various information technology projectsand needs across the entire U.S. government. Related to this argument, some critics also contend that centralizing management of government informationtechnology is a step backward rather than forward.Instead, they suggest it is more appropriate to approach IT needs through smaller, interagency groups focusing ona specific task such as the processing of studentloan applications online or improving online tax filing procedures. (20) Another reason cited by some opponents is the organizational obstacles to change that willnot disappear with the establishment of a federal CIO. One obstacle cited is a budget process that favors separateagency projects rather than cross-agencyinitiatives. Another is a shorter term focus when major IT projects require long term planning and implementation. Some critics are also concerned about theimplications for agency-level planning and responsibility. They fear that centralized management by a federal CIOwill be a signal to agencies that they can relyon the federal CIO to supplant their responsibility for tougher IT issues and can reduce their resource commitmenttoward solving them. In contrast, these criticsbelieve that efforts to change from an industrial age government to an information age government must emanatefrom the bottom-up by agencies rather than fromthe top-down by a cabinet-level position.

Specifically, there is disagreement over whether the federal CIO should be placed inthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB), or if a new office should be established within the White House tofocus solely on information technology issues. In September, 2000 the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of theGovernment Reform Committee of the House ofRepresentatives held a hearing regarding two bills proposed by Representatives Turner and Davis earlier thatsummer (discussed above). Much of the testimonyfocused on the relationship between the proposed federal CIO and the OMB. Then-Deputy Director of Managementat the OMB, Sally Katzen, argued thatsituating oversight of information technology management within OMB's management and budgeting authority wasessential for the successful budgeting andexecution of information technology programs. ", "In response, critics of this approach argued that information technology programs are crucial enough to warrant autonomous management and budget authority byspecialists who can devote their full energy to the success of government information technology projects. Inaddition, some observers suggest there are lessons tobe learned from the lackluster results of the agency-level CIO provisions in the Clinger-Cohen Act. The GAO hascited the divided attention of agency-level CIOswith multiple spheres of responsibility as an obstacle for implementing information technology managementreforms. The GAO has further stated that the role ofthe CIO is a full-time leadership position requiring complete attention to information resource managementissues. (22)", "The Bush administration has indicated a preference for assigning some of the responsibilities associated with proposals for a federal CIO to the Deputy Director ofManagement of OMB. The bills introduced by Representatives Davis and Turner during the 106thCongress both called for the creation of a separate positionwithin the White House. It has been reported that Senator Lieberman favors the creation of a new, separate CIOposition with deputy director status within theOMB. (23)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Responsibilities of a Federal CIO", "paragraphs": ["The responsibilities of the federal CIO are closely related to the organizational location of the position. If the federal CIO is expected to manage interagencyprojects and influence budget decisions, then the position will need the appropriate authority and stature tosuccessfully carry out the mission of the office. However, there is some disagreement over what that appropriate authority should be. Some proponents, includingRepresentatives Davis and Turner, and manyfederal agency-level CIOs, favor the idea of the federal CIO being a cabinet-level position. Other policymakers,including President Bush and Senator Lieberman,contend that the federal CIO does not require cabinet-level status. (24) On theother hand, in its recent report, \"E-Government: The Next American Revolution,\" theCouncil of Excellence favors the creation of multiple positions at both the cabinet and sub-cabinet levels. (25)", "Information Security. More specifically, questions have been raised about oversight of government informationsecurity. Some proponents have advocated that the federal CIO should be empowered to develop and implementa comprehensive response to informationsecurity threats. Indeed, some observers cite information security as one of the most important roles for a potentialfederal CIO, noting that federal informationsecurity currently falls under the jurisdiction of twelve congressional appropriations subcommittees and in practiceis carried out through a multiple ofuncoordinated (and potentially incompatible) efforts by various agencies and departments. (26)", "In the September 2000 testimony before the House Government Management, Information and Technology Subcommittee, the GAO made three primaryrecommendations regarding governmental action to improve the state of federal information security. Two of thesethree recommendations focused on thecentralization of responsibilities. One recommendation was to have greater \"prescriptive guidance regarding thelevel of protection that is appropriate for thesesystems.\" (27) The GAO witness observed that discretion is left primarily withthe individual agencies to decide which computer security measures to take and howstrenuously to enforce them. The second recommendation was to implement \"stronger central leadership andcoordination of information security-relatedactivities across the government.\" (28) The GAO witness stated that oversightof government information security was \"divided among a number of agencies,including OMB, NIST, the General Services Administration, and the National Security Agency,\" and concluded thatthis dispersed oversight resulted in a lack of\"clear and central coordination\" over key \"roles and responsibilities.\" In addition, the GAO witness observed thatthere was a lack of sharing of informationregarding information security vulnerabilities and solutions. (29)", "One of the central arguments in favor of centralized federal information security management is that it will establish a clear level of accountability for federalinformation security that is currently diffused. However, it is this very concern about accountability that hasconcerned opponents of this idea. Critics ofproposals for an \"IT security czar,\" argue that agencies will assume they can minimize their responsibility to securetheir computer networks. Instead, thesecritics suggest IT problems such as computer security must be addressed at the agency level where change takesplace. (30)", "Budgetary Authority. Another issue is budgetary authority. Many observers consider some control overfunding of IT projects critical to the success of a federal CIO. They note that major IT projects require long termplanning and implementation that is ill-suited tothe short-term focus of most budgetary processes. Currently, interagency projects coordinated by the CIO Councilare funded through an ad hoc, voluntary\"pass-the-hat\" process. (31)", "Supporters of proposals to give a federal CIO some budgetary authority argue that having someone who recognizes the financial needs of information technology projects and has control over the flow of funding will help contribute to more stable planning and ensure thecompletion of the project. There appears to be little ifany significant opposition to assigning the federal CIO some form of budget authority. There has also beenrelatively little debate about what form it would take. Some observers have suggested either having the federal CIO control a portion of the various agencies' budgets forinformation technology projects or providingthe federal CIO with a single fund to support interagency projects. President Bush appears to favor the latter option. On February 28, 2001, President Bushproposed an \"E-Government Fund,\" with an initial funding of $10 million in 2002, which would rise to $100million over three years. The fund was to be usedby the federal CIO to support interagency e-government projects such as developing a government-wide public keyinfrastructure (PKI) (32) for secure transactionsand helping agencies comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA). (33) However, the fiscal 2002 Post Service appropriations bill that wassigned into law on November 21, 2001 provided for only $5 million for the e-government fund. For the fiscal 2003budget, President Bush has proposedallocating $45 million for the E-Government Fund.
