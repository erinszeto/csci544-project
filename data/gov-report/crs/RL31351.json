{"id": "RL31351", "title": "Presidential Advisers\u2019 Testimony Before Congressional Committees: An Overview", "released_date": "2014-12-15T00:00:00", "summary": ["Since the beginning of the federal government, Presidents have called upon executive branch officials to provide them with advice regarding matters of policy and administration. While Cabinet members were among the first to play such a role, the creation of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) in 1939 and the various agencies located within that structure resulted in a large increase in the number and variety of presidential advisers. All senior staff members of the White House Office and the leaders of the various EOP agencies and instrumentalities could be said to serve as advisers to the President.", "Occasionally, these executive branch officials playing a presidential advisory role have been called upon to testify before congressional committees and subcommittees. Sometimes, such invited appearances have been prompted by allegations of personal misconduct on the part of the official, but they have also included instances when accountability for policymaking and administrative or managerial actions have instigated the request for testimony. Because such appearances before congressional committees or subcommittees seemingly could result in demands for advice proffered to the President, or the disclosure\u2014inadvertent or otherwise\u2014of such advice, there has been resistance, from time to time, by the Chief Executive to allowing such testimony.", "Congress has a constitutionally rooted right of access to the information it needs to perform its Article I legislative and oversight functions. Generally, a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter, which is conducting an authorized investigation for legislative or oversight purposes, has a right to information held by the executive branch in the absence of either a valid claim of constitutional privilege by the executive or a statutory provision whereby Congress has limited its constitutional right to information.", "A congressional committee may request (informally or by a letter from the committee chair, perhaps co-signed by the ranking Member) or demand (pursuant to subpoena) the testimony of a presidential adviser. However, Congress may encounter legal and political problems in attempting to enforce a subpoena to a presidential adviser. Conflicts concerning congressional requests or demands for executive branch testimony or documents often involve extensive negotiations and may be resolved by some form of compromise as to, inter alia, the scope of the testimony or information to be provided to Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Since the beginning of the federal government, Presidents have called upon executive branch officials to provide them with advice regarding matters of policy and administration. The Constitution recognized such relationships when it authorized the President, in Article II, Section 2, to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\" There were, as well, reasons to expect that such advice, whether offered orally or in writing, would be held in confidence. The advice was for the President's consideration and his decision making. The matters involved were sensitive, perhaps bearing upon the foreign, military, economic, or law enforcement policy of the nation. Also, the provision, discussion, and use of such advice by the executive branch could affect its relationships with the other coequal constitutional branches. President George Washington and his Cabinet had these considerations in mind, as Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson's notes on their deliberations reflect, when they decided upon a response to a 1792 congressional request for information.", "We had all considered, and were of one mind, first, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might institute inquiries. Second that it might call for papers generally. Third, that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those, the disclosure of which would injure the public; consequently were to exercise a discretion. Fourth, that neither the committee nor House had a right to call on the Head of a Department, who and whose papers were under the President alone; but that the committee should instruct their chairman to move the House to address the President....", "The Cabinet, composed of the principal officers in each of the executive departments, failed, for several reasons, to develop as an important source of presidential advice. The department heads constituting the Cabinet were often chosen to satisfy interests that contributed significantly to the President's election. Considerations of partisanship, ideology, geography, public image and stature, and aptitude, among others, figured prominently in their selection. Sometimes the President was not personally well acquainted with these individuals and had only minimal confidence and trust in them. In a few cases, a political rival was included in the Cabinet.", "It is also very likely that some activist Presidents were ill suited to the group deliberation of the Cabinet. Similarly, many Cabinet members might have felt unqualified, or were unwilling, to offer counsel to the President on matters outside of their immediate portfolios; their advice was perhaps limited to, and protective of, departmental interests. Finally, personal hostilities between or among department heads could result in such tumult within the Cabinet that little useful advice could be gained.", "Consequently, Presidents generally looked to other quarters for advisers. One development in this regard was the creation of circles of advisers composed of both public officials and private citizens. President Andrew Jackson, whose election and White House tenure occurred in an era marked by violent political controversy and party instability, utilized an informal group of advisers which came to be known as the Kitchen Cabinet. The members represented \"rising social groups as yet denied the prestige to which they felt their power and energies entitled them\"\u2014newspapermen, the President's private secretary, campaign organizers and officials from prior administrations, and longtime personal friends.", "When John Tyler succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William Henry Harrison, he revived Jackson's practice. Deserted by Whigs and Democrats alike, Tyler resorted to a select circle of advisers composed of personal and political friends from his native Virginia\u2014a college president, a state supreme court judge, four members of the state's delegation in the House of Representatives, and a Senator. Following this practice, several succeeding Presidents had informal groups of advisers that were given colorful names by the press. For example, for Grover Cleveland, it was a Fishing Cabinet; for Theodore Roosevelt, a Tennis Cabinet; for Warren G. Harding, a Poker Cabinet; and for Herbert Hoover, a Medicine Ball Cabinet.", "Jackson's inclusion of his personal secretary in his Kitchen Cabinet reflects another line of development regarding presidential advisers. Beginning with Washington, Presidents sought to meet the demands of their office with the assistance of a single personal secretary, usually a relative, compensated from their own private resources. In 1833, Congress authorized the President to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, a secretary \"whose duty it shall be, under the direction of the President, to sign in his name and for him, all patents for lands sold or granted under the authority of the United States.\" Jackson named Andrew Jackson Donelson, his wife's nephew and current personal secretary, to this position, relieving himself of continued personal compensation of the young man. Ultimately, Congress appropriated funds to the Chief Executive in 1857 for an official household\u2014a personal secretary, a steward to supervise the Executive Mansion, and a messenger.", "Many years later, in 1929, Congress was persuaded to authorize an increase in the President's top personnel, adding two more secretaries and an administrative assistant. Appointed to these senior staff positions were presidential lieutenants, if not presidential intimates and advisers. When Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the presidency in 1933, he brought with him, from his New York gubernatorial experience, a new kind of advisory circle, composed of intellectuals, or at least a core group of Columbia University professors who were joined by other ideas people to form the \"Brains Trust.\" Because there were an insufficient number of staff positions at the White House to accommodate them, these advisers were placed elsewhere in the executive branch, but, for the most part, directly served the President.", "This staffing situation, coordination problems, and the development of a new administrative management concept prompted Roosevelt to create, by announcement, a study panel\u2014the President's Committee on Administrative Management, under the leadership of Louis Brownlow, a prominent public administration practitioner\u2014in 1936 to examine and make recommendations regarding these matters. Reporting some 10 months later, the Brownlow committee addressed presidential staffing in dramatic and detailed terms.", "The President needs help. His immediate staff assistance is entirely inadequate. He should be given a small number of executive assistants who would be his direct aides in dealing with the managerial agencies and administrative departments of the government. These assistants, probably not exceeding six in number, would be in addition to the present secretaries, who deal with the public, with the Congress, and with the press and radio. These aides would have no power to make decisions or issue instructions in their own right. They would not be interposed between the President and the heads of his departments. They would not be assistant presidents in any sense. Their function would be, when any matter was presented to the President for action affecting any part of the administrative work of the Government, to assist him in obtaining quickly and without delay all pertinent information possessed by any of the executive departments so as to guide him in making his responsible decisions; and then when decisions have been made, to assist him in seeing to it that every administrative department and agency affected is promptly informed. Their effectiveness in assisting the President will, we think, be directly proportional to their ability to discharge their functions with restraint. They would remain in the background, issue no orders, make no decisions, emit no public statements. Men for these positions should be carefully chosen by the President from within and without the Government. They should be men in whom the President has personal confidence and whose character and attitude is [sic] such that they would not attempt to exercise power on their own account. They should be possessed of high competence, great physical vigor, and a passion for anonymity. They should be installed in the White House itself, directly accessible to the President. In the selection of these aides, the President should be free to call on departments from time to time for the assignment of persons who, after a tour of duty as his aides, might be restored to their old positions.", "In addition to the proposed addition of six assistants to the President's staff, the committee's report also recommended vesting responsibility in the President for the continuous reorganization of the executive branch. Released to Congress on January 12, 1937, the report soon became lost in high politics. Three weeks after submitting the Brownlow committee's report to Congress, Roosevelt announced he wanted to enlarge the membership of the Supreme Court. His \"court packing\" plan not only fed congressional fears of a presidential power grab, but also so preoccupied Congress that the Brownlow committee's recommendations were ignored."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Executive Office of the President", "paragraphs": ["Although efforts at gaining legislative approval of the Brownlow committee's recommendations lay in ruin in the spring of 1938, the President had not deserted the cause. By July, Roosevelt was meeting with Brownlow and the other committee members. The panel would not be officially reassembled, but he wanted each man's help with a reorganization authority proposal. The resulting measure empowered the President to propose reorganization plans, subject to a veto by a majority vote of disapproval in both houses of Congress, and to also appoint six administrative assistants.", "After three days of discussion and debate, the House adopted the bill on March 8, 1939. Twelve days later, the Senate began considering the proposal. Following two days of sparring over amendments, the Senate adopted the bill. A quick conference cleared the measure for Roosevelt's signature on April 3. Earlier, the President had asked the Brownlow committee members to assist with the preparation of his initial reorganization plans.", "Following consultations with Budget Bureau Director Harold D. Smith, the Brownlow group presented two reorganization proposals to Roosevelt on April 23. Plan 1, submitted to Congress on April 25, transferred certain agencies to the Executive Office of the President, but offered no explanation of that entity. In Plan 2, a presidential emergency council was abolished and most of its functions were transferred to the Executive Office. While both plans were acceptable to legislators, their effective dates were troublesome in terms of accommodating fiscal calendar necessities. By joint resolution, Congress provided that both plans would be effective on July 1, 1939. Following this action, the President, on September 8, issued E.O. 8248, formally organizing the Executive Office and, thereby, defining it in terms of its components. Brownlow, who drafted the initial reorganization plan, viewed the Executive Office as the institutional realization of administrative management and \"the effective coordination of the tremendously wide-spread federal machinery.\" He called the initial version \"a little thing\" compared to its later size. It grew under Roosevelt and \"it continued to expand and was further regularized by statute, by appropriation acts, and by more reorganization plans\" during the succeeding years.", "The Executive Office organized by E.O. 8248 consisted of the White House Office, the Bureau of the Budget, the National Resources Planning Board, the Office of Government Reports, and the Liaison Office for Personnel Management. It also provided that, \"in the event of a national emergency,\" there could be established \"such office for emergency management as the President shall determine.\" The Office for Emergency Management was created by an administrative order on May 25, 1940, and its functions were further specified in an administrative order of January 7, 1941. It subsequently served as a parent unit for a number of subordinate emergency management bodies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Presidential Adviser Growth", "paragraphs": ["The creation of the Executive Office of the President contributed to an increase in the number of presidential advisers for several reasons. First, it provided an enclave for various agencies that immediately assisted the President. Primary among these was the White House Office, which was no longer merely the President's small office staff, but an agency with hierarchically organized staff positions whose personnel rapidly expanded during the next few decades.", "Second, it counted agencies, such as the Liaison Office for Personnel Management and the Office for Emergency Management, that were headed by an administrative assistant\u2014and adviser\u2014to the President on the White House Office payroll. It also included agencies, such as the Bureau of the Budget (and its Office of Management and Budget successor), that were headed by leaders for whom advising the President was a primary responsibility.", "Third, senior White House Office staff would come to supervise and direct the staff of other Executive Office entities: the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs would direct the National Security Council staff and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy would direct the Domestic Council staff.", "Fourth, in January 1973, President Richard M. Nixon vested his Secretary of the Treasury and his director of the Office of Management and Budget with dual White House Office positions, respectively, of Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs and Assistant to the President for Executive Management. He also vested his Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with dual White House Office positions, respectively, of Counselor to the President for Natural Resources, Counselor to the President for Human Resources, and Counselor to the President for Community Development. Having such dual White House Office titles was viewed as giving added emphasis, if not authority, to the role of these officials as presidential advisers.", "In the aftermath of World War II, Congress statutorily chartered most of the agencies within the Executive Office of the President. Furthermore, Congress routinely appropriated funds for the operating expenses of these entities. In 1944, Congress had adopted an amendment to an appropriation bill that was designed to restrain the creation of Executive Office agencies by executive order\u2014a frequent occurrence during 1941-1944. The amendment stated:", "After January 1, 1945, no part of any appropriation or fund made available by this or any other Act shall be allotted or made available to, or used to pay the expenses of, any agency or instrumentality including those established by Executive order after such agency or instrumentality has been in existence for more than one year, if the Congress has not appropriated any money specifically for such agency or instrumentality or specifically authorized the expenditure of funds by it.", "In 1982, when Title 31 of the United States Code was recodified, the amendment was repealed and replaced with new language at Section 1347. The opening sentence of the new section, which remains as operative law, states: \"An agency in existence for more than one year may not use amounts otherwise available for obligation to pay its expenses without a specific appropriation or specific authorization by law.\"", "With their growing number and influence, senior staff members of the White House Office and certain other Executive Office agencies began to become of interest to congressional committees when accountability for policymaking and administrative or managerial actions prompted requests for their testimony. Some, like War Production Board chairman Donald M. Nelson, who was popularly known as the \"arms czar,\" appeared before and cooperated with the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (\"Truman Committee\") during World War II to report on and discuss war material production and related coordination matters. Others, like Office of War Mobilization director James F. Byrnes, who was sometimes referred to as the \"assistant president,\" apparently avoided appearing before congressional committees during the World War II era, but were in communication with various individual Members of Congress in leadership positions and served as liaisons between the President and Congress on a number of war matters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Presidential Adviser Testimony", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the closing years of World War II, examples are provided below of instances when a presidential adviser\u2014a civilian executive branch official, other than a member of the traditional Cabinet, who, as part of that official's responsibilities and activities, consulted with the President\u2014testified before a congressional committee or subcommittee. Because these consultations with the President by such an official may be considered by the President to be privileged and constitutionally protectable, examples are also provided of instances when invited congressional committee or subcommittee testimony by a presidential adviser was refused. None of the examples involves testimony or refusal to testify by a former presidential adviser. All examples are based upon the public record.", "Jonathan Daniels, Administrative Assistant to the President, White House Office, appeared before the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry on February 28 and March 7 and 8, 1944, to discuss his involvement in the personnel policy of the Rural Electrification Administration.

When Congress has requested the appearance of such aides, Presidents and their aides have at times resisted, asserting the separation of powers doctrine and/or executive privilege. These two grounds for declining to comply with congressional requests for the appearance of presidential aides overlap, and it is sometimes difficult to determine which argument is being raised.", "The executive branch has articulated a long-standing position that \"the President's immediate advisers are absolutely immune from congressional testimonial process.\" This principle of absolute immunity would prevent Congress from compelling a presidential adviser to appear before a committee for purposes of providing testimony.", "The executive branch position, as articulated in various opinions of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, is grounded in the separation of powers and legal principles underlying executive privilege. Specifically, the DOJ argues that because the President must be immune from compelled congressional testimony, his close presidential advisers, who \"function as the President's alter ego,\" must also be immune from compelled testimony. To hold otherwise, the DOJ argues, would interfere with the President's \"discharge of his constitutional functions\" in two significant ways. First, permitting Congress to compel testimony from close presidential advisers would \"threaten the President's independence and autonomy from Congress\" in that committees could \"harass ... advisers in an effort to influence their conduct\" and \"promote a perception that the President is subordinate to Congress.\" Second, compelled testimony by presidential advisers would \"threaten executive branch confidentiality, which is necessary (among other things) to ensure that the President can obtain the type of sound and candid advice that is essential to the effective discharge of his constitutional duties.\" Although conceding that advisers could appear before Congress and invoke executive privilege with respect to specific questions, the DOJ finds that procedure insufficient to protect executive branch autonomy. \"In the heat of the moment, without the opportunity for careful reflection,\" the executive branch argues, \"the adviser might have difficulty confining his remarks to those that do not reveal [] sensitive information.\" ", "With respect to the many instances in which close presidential advisers have testified before Congress, the DOJ asserts that those officials have done so voluntarily \"as an accommodation to a congressional committee's legitimate interest in investigating certain activities of the Executive Branch.\" The DOJ argues that voluntary testimony, as opposed to compelled testimony, does not trigger the same concerns under the separation of powers, nor do examples of voluntary testimony \"undermine the Executive Branch's long-established position on absolute immunity.\" ", "No decision of the Supreme Court resolves the question of whether there are any circumstances in which close presidential advisers can refuse a subpoena to appear before a congressional committee for purposes of providing testimony. However, in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the long-standing executive branch position and held that close presidential advisers are not immune from compulsory congressional testimony. ", "The Miers case arose out of an investigation by the House Committee on the Judiciary into the termination and replacement of a number of U.S. Attorneys during the George W. Bush Administration. In the course of the investigation, the committee issued a subpoena to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, seeking her testimony on the matter. Following a legal conclusion from the DOJ that \"Ms. Miers is immune from compulsion to testify before the Committee on this matter,\" Miers informed the Committee that she would not appear. The Committee subsequently filed a civil lawsuit asking a federal court to order Miers to comply with the subpoena. ", "The Miers opinion represents a clear repudiation of the executive view of absolute immunity for close presidential advisers. The district court strongly disagreed with the executive's arguments, noting that:", "The Executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context. That simple yet critical fact bears repeating: the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law. In fact, there is Supreme Court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity. The Court therefore rejects the Executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides.", "Instead, the court held that Miers \"must appear before the Committee to provide testimony, and invoke executive privilege where appropriate.\" In reaching its conclusion, the district court also rejected the argument that close advisers should be considered the \"alter ego\" of the President. The court noted that this line of argument had been foreclosed by the Supreme Court in the case of Harlow v. Fitzgerald \u2014a civil suit for damages in which the Court expressly refused to accord presidential advisers with absolute immunity. Indeed, the district court in Miers went further and, in fact, questioned whether the president himself was absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony. Miers did, however, leave open the question of whether presidential advisers engaged in \"special functions\" relating to \"national security or foreign policy\" may be accorded some form of immunity from compelled testimony.", "The district court likewise rejected that argument that the absence of absolute immunity would create a \"chilling effect\" on the candid and frank advice advisers would provide to the President. The court reasoned that the ability of an adviser to appear, and invoke executive privilege in response to specific questioning, \"should serve as an effective check against public disclosure of truly privileged communications, thereby mitigating any adverse impact on the quality of advice that the President receives.\"", "The reasoning adopted by the Miers court may have significant influence in that it so clearly repudiated the executive's claim of absolute immunity for presidential advisers, while reaffirming Congress's essential role in conducting oversight and enforcing its own subpoenas. However, as a district court decision, the Miers opinion has limited precedential value. For its part, the executive branch maintains that Miers was wrongly decided. Consistent with that conclusion, DOJ continues to adhere to its position that close presidential advisers have absolute immunity from compelled testimony by Congress.

Both of these procedures are somewhat cumbersome, and their use may not result in the production of the information that is sought.", "When faced with a refusal by the executive branch to comply with a demand for information, Congress has several alternatives to inherent and statutory contempt, although these alternatives are not without their own limitations. One approach is to seek declaratory or other relief in the courts.
