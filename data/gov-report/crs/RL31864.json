Some have suggested that research into new antiviral andantibiotic compounds for use against biological agents might provide additional health benefits, asthese compounds may prove to be effective medications for other, more common illnesses. Becauseof the shortage of licensed vaccines for many high-threat pathogens, development of new vaccineshas been an area of congressional interest. The lack of a civilian market for biological weaponvaccines has inhibited private sector investment and production of these products. Since the naturalincidence of disease from biological-weapon pathogens is rare, and disease form is often differentthan that expected to result from a bioterror attack, there has been little impetus to develop andmarket these vaccines. Some have suggested that the federal government should take a role inproviding research incentives and a guaranteed market for any vaccines against biological weapons. A variety of mechanisms have been suggested, including expedited drug approval processes, taxincentives, liability protections, and expanded procurement practices. A form of expedited drugapproval has already been implemented by the FDA for drugs involved in biodefense; it requiresfewer animal studies before approval is given for human use.

Such a monitoring system for covert releases of biological agents mayprovide important early notification of potential danger. Since many pathogens have an incubationperiod of several days, it is often difficult to begin treatment at an early stage. Early treatment of theinhalation form of these diseases is essential to recovery, and a system that signaled pathogen releasebefore the appearance of symptoms in victims would be likely to increase the ability of victims toreceive medication and survive. By employing an array of such sampling devices, a city-widenetwork might detect pathogen releases in smaller amount and also aid in determining the epicenterof a release. Such information may be important to identify the perpetrators of such an attack.", "Since the BioWatch detectors are coupled to EPA air quality monitors, the locations are determined by air quality considerations, and it is not readily apparent that these locations willprovide adequate sampling of populated areas. If the air quality monitor is located well above streetlevel, it may not detect the release of biological agents at street level. Additionally, the effectivenessof these detectors in identifying small releases or indoor release of biological agents is notestablished, and so placement of these detectors may provide a false sense of security. Such adetection system may also detect naturally occurring biological agents which are not virulent. Forexample, anthrax spores naturally occur in some areas of the United States, and may provide falseindications of small-scale covert release. The continued cost of these detectors, reported at $1million per detector per year, is also of concern.", "An unknown aspect of the BioWatch program is the range of detector coverage. It has been reported that each metropolitan area chosen will have 10 to 12 distinct detectors built into differentair quality monitors. Also, a reported goal of this program is to provide detection for \"80% of theAmerican population by geographic distribution.\" (60) Since the EPA air quality monitors are notevenly spread throughout the various geographic areas of the country, it is not apparent whether theBioWatch program will be expanded to other sorts of monitoring stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biological Detectors", "paragraphs": ["Development and production of easily portable or handheld biological detection apparatus is another area where a pressing need has been identified.

Consequently,policymakers may decide to direct funding towards development of either a broad assortment ofinexpensive testing equipment or expanding the range of pathogens a given device can detect.

Tracking potential bioterror releases through monitoring hospital admissions and physician reports may indeeddetect a covert pathogen release, but such an approach requires that individuals first fall ill from thepathogen release. Critics claim that in the case of a contagious pathogen, such as pneumonic plagueor smallpox, the spread of the disease will occur at a rate greater than the government response, asthere will be a time delay due to the incubation period of the disease. Thus, there will be anexpanding number of people being infected even as public health workers attempt to determine theepicenter of the release. Such an argument has been made especially in the case of smallpox, astreatment for smallpox, once symptoms have begun to appear, is unavailable. In the smallpox case,the debate over which vaccination method should be used, the ring vaccination model based onidentifying the initial outbreak of the disease and then vaccinating contacts of the victims of theinitial outbreak, or the mass vaccination model, where people in a geographic area are innoculatedif smallpox is detected, has been very lively.
