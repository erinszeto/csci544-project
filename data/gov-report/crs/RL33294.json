This, they say, \"stifles debate\" and unfairly empowers well-financed lobbyists.", "Supporters of earmarking generally agree on the need for more transparency, but theycounter-argue that earmarks are not inherently wrong, nor should they be forbidden by rules ofcongressional process. At a February 2006 hearing on the subject, one proponent said,", "[The Constitution] placed the responsibility for makingspending decisions, not in the Executive Branch, but in the Congress.... Congress has always had thefinal say on that issue. Some would say that the earmarking process has been abused in recent yearsand I would agree, especially in cases where earmarks are inserted into Conference Reports that havenot been scrutinized by either body. (6)", "In general, proponents agree that some modification of the process may be needed, but otherwisecontend that earmarking is legitimate under the Constitution and is justified because elected officialsare better able to make decisions about funding for local needs than program managers in theexecutive branch.

Energy R&D earmarks total $266 millionin 2006, more than double the previous record from last year, and make up one out of every fiveR&D dollars. But they are especially concentrated in some areas, including biomass R&D wherethey make up more than 50% of total program funds, hydrogen (27%), and wind energy (33%), ratiosfar higher than in previous years. As a result, there will be enormous cuts to competitively awardedR&D grants in those areas.
