In the face of mounting public and congressional concern over allegations and convictions of certain lobbyists and public officials in a burgeoning \"lobbying and gift\" scandal, and with a recognition of legitimate concerns over undue influence and access of certain special interests to public officials, Congress has adopted stricter rules, regulations, and laws attempting to address these issues.", "This report provides summaries of the changes made to law and congressional rule in S. 1 , 110 th Congress ( P.L. 110-81 ), and the changes adopted to internal House rules earlier in the Congress in H.Res. 6 . The statutory and internal congressional rule changes which have been adopted address five general areas of reform: (1) broader and more detailed disclosures of lobbying activities by paid lobbyists, and more disclosures concerning the intersection of the activities of professional lobbyists with government policy makers; (2) more extensive restrictions on the offering and receipt of gifts and favors for Members of Congress and their staff, including gifts of transportation and travel expenses; (3) new restrictions addressing the so-called \"revolving door,\" that is, post-government-employment \"lobbying\" activities by former high-level government officials on behalf of private interests; (4) reform of the government pension provisions with regard to Members of Congress found guilty of abusing the public trust; and (5) greater transparency in the internal legislative process in the House and Senate, including \"earmark\" disclosures and accountability."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Congress has adopted several significant changes in the federal law concerning the disclosure of lobbying activities by professional lobbyists, and in internal congressional rules with respect to the acceptance of gifts and travel by Members of Congress and staff from certain outside private interests, such as lobbyists and their clients. Amendments to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, and to internal House and Senate rules, were made in S. 1 , passed by the House on July 31, 2007, and by the Senate on August 2, 2007, and signed into law, P.L. 110-81 , on September 14, 2007.

Over the last few years several instances of individual Members of Congress and of certain high-ranking officials in the President's Administration incurring ethics problems and/or being involved in federal or state corruption investigations and prosecutions have been widely reported in the press and have garnered significant national publicity. The unfolding of an extensive \"lobbying and gifts\" scandal concerning convicted lobbyists and their provision of privately funded travel, free meals, and entertainment to Members, congressional staff, and certain executive branch officials, has been a continuing major news story focusing public and congressional attention on questions of lobbying reform, gift rules, and transparency in congressional and other governmental operations. The subject of \"ethics\" and \"corruption\" in government may arguably have been the single most significant issue for voters in the 2006 congressional elections, with national exit polls showing that the issue of \"corruption\" was \"extremely important\" to 42% of the voters, greater even than \"terrorism\" (40%), the \"economy\" (39%), or \"Iraq\" (37%).", "The task facing the 110 th Congress was to enact legislation to help restore the confidence of the general public in the fairness and equity of the democratic processes in government, and in the integrity of the institution of the Congress and its Members. Any legislative \"solutions\" needed to take into consideration, however, the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, association, and the right to petition the government for all citizens, including those who are or who hire \"lobbyists\" to represent those interests, as well as the realities of representational self-government to prevent isolating or insulating Members of Congress from interactions with persons, groups, and parties representing varied public and private interests and concerns. Additionally, in the U.S. system of government and elections, campaigns for public office are privately financed, and any reforms enacted had to recognize the necessity and reality of having to raise large sums of campaign funds from private citizens by any Member of Congress or other candidate seeking to run a viable campaign for federal office.", "The statute and rule changes which have been adopted address five general areas of reform: (1) broader and more detailed disclosures of lobbying activities by paid lobbyists, and more disclosures concerning the intersection of the activities of professional lobbyists and government policy makers; (2) more extensive restrictions on the offering and receipt of gifts for Members of Congress and their staff, including gifts of transportation and travel expenses; (3) new restrictions addressing the so-called \"revolving door,\" that is, post-government-employment \"lobbying\" activities by former high level government officials on behalf of private interests; (4) reform of the pension provisions with regard to Members of Congress found guilty of abusing the public trust; and (5) greater transparency in the internal legislative process in the House and Senate, including \"earmark\" disclosures and accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lobbying Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["The activity of citizens joining together in an effort to influence policy makers and decision makers in the federal government, including hiring persons to represent such interests before the government and the public, involves expression and conduct protected by the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech, association, and petition. Any \"regulation\" of lobbying activities must therefore not overly or unduly interfere with such protected advocacy rights and activities. In the area of \"lobbying\" activities by paid, professional lobbyists, the \"regulation\" of such activity at the federal level has thus involved merely disclosure, reporting, and publicity, as opposed to prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions on such conduct.", "The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 [LDA], which replaced an earlier 1946 law governing lobbying disclosures, is directed at so-called \"professional lobbyists,\" that is, those who are compensated to engage in certain lobbying activities on behalf of a client or an employer. In addition to covering only those who are paid to lobby, the initial \"triggering\" provisions of the law cover only lobbying activities which may be described as \"direct\" contacts and communications with covered officials. The law's registration requirements are not separately triggered by \"grass roots\" lobbying activities. That is, an organization which engages only in \"grass roots\" lobbying, regardless of the extent of \"grass roots\" lobbying activities, is not required to register its members, officers, or employees who engage in such activities, and does not need to report or disclose its activities or expenses under the LDA.", "The provisions of S. 1 , 110 th Congress ( P.L. 110-81 ) expand the information that must be provided by those who qualify as professional lobbyists under the existing provisions of the LDA of 1995 (either as an outside lobbyist who must register and list his/her clients, or as an \"in-house\" lobbyist who is an employee engaging in a certain amount of lobbying on behalf of his/her employer).

This information will be publicly available on the FEC website, and linked electronically to the lobbying websites maintained by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. \"Bundled\" campaign contributions are those that are either forwarded by, or credited in some manner to, the registered lobbyist or employee/lobbyist. (Section 204, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 434). Electronic Filing. Requires the reports to be filed by registrants to be filed in electronic form to the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, and requires those offices to use the same software for receipt and recording of the filings under the LDA. (Section 205, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1604 by adding subparagraph (e)). Offering Gifts or Travel to Members or Employees of Congress. Places an express prohibition in the federal lobbying law on any registered lobbyist, organization that employs one or more lobbyists and is registered, and any employee required to be listed as a lobbyist by a registrant, from making a gift to a Member or staffer of Congress if the person has knowledge that the gift or travel offered may not be accepted under the respective, applicable rules of the House or Senate. (Section 206, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1601). Coalition Lobbying Disclosures. In addition to the disclosure of the client-\"coalition\" in lobbying registrations, the lobbyist-registrant for a coalition must also identify the name of any organization in the coalition which contributes at least $5,000 in a reporting quarter and actively participates in the planning, supervision, or control of such lobbying activities. If the organization is listed in the coalition's website as a member, then that organization need not also be listed in the lobbying registration (as long as the website is disclosed by the registrant), unless that organization \"in whole or in part\" plans, supervises, or controls the coalition's lobbying activities, and then such organization must be listed in the registration. (Section 207, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1603(b)(3)). Disclosure of Past Government Employment. A registrant-lobbyist must disclose if that person served as a covered executive branch or legislative branch official within the past 20 years. (Section 208, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1603(b)(6)). Availability of Lobbying Information. The Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, to whom lobbying registrations and reports must be filed, are required to make publicly available for free over the Internet in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable manner, the information required in the lobbying registrations and reports; to link this information to Federal Election Commission databases; and to retain all records for six years. (Section 209; amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1605). Disclosure of Non-Compliance Actions. The Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate are required to publicly disclose twice a year the aggregate number of referrals made to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for non-compliance with the provisions of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Attorney General is then required to report to the appropriate House and Senate Committees on the aggregate number of enforcement actions taken by the Department of Justice during the semi-annual period, and any sentences imposed, but need not disclose information on the identity of individuals not already a matter of public record. (Section 210; amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 605). Increased Civil and Criminal Penalties. The penalty for knowing failure to remedy a defective filing after being notified by the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate, or other knowing failure to comply with a provision of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, has been increased to a civil penalty of up to $200,000. A specific criminal penalty has been added to the LDA for knowing and corrupt failure to comply with the act of imprisonment of up to five years and a fine in accordance with code. (Section 211, amending 2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1606). Electronic Filing and Database for Foreign Agents. Agents of foreign principals who are required to register and file under the Foreign Agents Registration Act are now required to file in electronic form with the Attorney General, and the Attorney General is required to make publicly available for free over the Internet in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable manner, the information required in the registrations and reports. (Section 212, amending 22 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 612, 616). Annual Audit by Comptroller General. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to audit on an annual basis compliance with the lobbying disclosure laws through random sampling of registrations and reports, and to report to Congress an assessment of compliance and any recommendations for improvement in the disclosure system.

These changes were made pursuant to the express rule-making authority of the House and Senate under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, of the Constitution; and thus even though these rule provisions were enacted in a public law, they may be changed or modified by each House separately by way of a simple resolution (without the concurrence of the other body or the signature of the President).", "The provisions in S. 1 regarding the Senate rules on gifts are similar in many aspects to the internal changes made to the rules of the House in H.Res. 6 , in January of 2007. The new rules of both the House and Senate now work to restrict under-$50 gifts from lobbyists, foreign agents, and their private clients, which had been permitted under the former rules; change the manner in which tickets or passes to \"luxury boxes\" at sporting and entertainment events are valued for gift purposes; and substantially restrict quasi-official\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"officially connected\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094travel of Members and staff being paid for, arranged, or participated in by a registered lobbyist, a foreign agent, or their clients, with certain exceptions for educational institutions (House) or other qualifying charitable institutions (Senate), and for certain short-term conferences and events.", "Concerning such \"officially connected\" travel, one significant change which is intended to increase oversight and enforcement of the restrictions in the rules is that Members and staff must now receive advance approval from the appropriate ethics committee when such travel is to be paid for by any outside, private source. Prior to the current rules changes, receipt of expenses or payment for such travel from lobbyists, or travel which substantially involved \"recreational\" activities such as golfing, or water sports, or tennis, were already prohibited by the express provisions of both House and Senate rules, and legitimate questions of enforcement and oversight of those rules had been raised. Under the new rules, however, before receiving such approval for \"officially connected\" travel, a Member or staff employee must now certify to the appropriate ethics committee that the trip conforms to the requirements and strictures of the new regulations including the limitation on a lobbyist's involvement and participation in the trip, and assuring that the source of funds does not come from lobbyists, or (except in very limited circumstances) their clients. Additionally, registered lobbyists who must file periodic reports on expenditures under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended, must now also certify that they have not offered gifts, including travel, to Members of Congress or staff that would violate the provisions of House or Senate rules. Like any certification to an agency or department of the federal government, such statement, if intentionally false or fraudulent, could be subject to the criminal penalties for false statements and fraud, at 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1001.", "Changes have also been made in internal congressional rules that require a Senator or Senate staffer to reimburse for the use of a non-commercial aircraft at the higher charter or rental rate (as opposed to a commercial, first class rate), while the House has generally banned its Members and staff from accepting any flights on such private aircraft. Internal congressional rules will also now restrict official staff contact with the spouse of a Member who is a registered lobbyist and, in the Senate, also with the immediate family of their employing Senator.", "The internal congressional rule changes made by S. 1 (and the corresponding and similar changes made earlier for the House in H.Res. 6 ) are as follows:", "No Under-$50 De Minimis Gifts From Lobbyists. Amends Senate rules to eliminate the exception to the gifts restriction for (and thus prohibits) gifts of under $50 if the gift is from a registered lobbyist, a foreign agent, or a private entity that employs a registered lobbyist or a foreign agent. ( S. 1 , Section 541, amending Senate Rule XXXV, para. 1(a)(2)). Similar changes to House rules were adopted in H.Res. 6 , 110 th Congress, so that the under-$50 exception no longer applies to (and thus works to prohibit) even such de minimis gifts to House Members and staff from registered lobbyists, foreign agents, or their private clients. National Party Convention Events. A Member of the Senate or the House may not participate in an event to honor the Member during the course of the national party convention of his or her political party (other than in the capacity of the party's nominee for President or Vice President), if the event is paid for by a registered lobbyist or a private client that retains or employs a registered lobbyist. ( S. 1 , Section 542, amending Senate Rule XXXV, para. 1(d), and S. 1 Section 305, amending House Rule XXV(8)). Valuation of Tickets to Entertainment or Sporting Events. When a Senator or a staff employee is allowed to accept an under-$50 de minimis gift from an outside source, and the gift is in the form of a ticket or pass to a sporting event or an entertainment venue, then the \"value\" of the ticket is its face value, or if it has no face value (such as a pass to a luxury box or suite), then the value of the ticket with the highest face value for the event will be used (unless equivalency to another ticket with a face value can be established by the ticket holder). ( S. 1 , Section 543, amending Senate Rule XXXV, para. 1(c)(1)). Similarly, under the new rules adopted earlier by the House, the \"value\" of such a ticket or pass will be the actual \"face value\" printed on the ticket, or when there is no face value on the ticket, then the value of such pass or ticket will be the highest face-value price of a ticket to the same event. ( H.Res. 6 , amending House Rule XXV, clause 5(a)(1)(B)(ii)). Officially Connected Travel. One of the ongoing exceptions to the general prohibition in congressional rules on the receipt of gifts from private sources has been the permissibility of accepting from certain outside sources reimbursement or payment of expenses for travel by a Member or staffer when that travel is in connection with one's official duties, when the travel is not for recreational purposes, when the travel is limited in duration, and when the travel is not paid for by a lobbyist. In light of allegations and findings of abuses of this exception for ostensibly officially connected travel, whereby certain Members and staff would allegedly engage in substantially recreational travel with lobbyists, the internal congressional rules in the House and the Senate have been amended and tightened. Senate:(1) Donor of Travel Expenses or Payments . In addition to prohibiting a registered lobbyist from paying for a Member's or staffer's expenses for \"officially connected\" travel, the new provisions narrow the permissible acceptance of expenses by prohibiting the receipt of such expenses if provided not only by registered lobbyists or foreign agents, but also by their clients, that is, \"a private organization retaining one or more lobbyists or foreign agents,\" except that a charitable (501(c)(3)) organization may provide such expenses if approved by the Ethics Committee. ( S. 1 , Section 544, amending Senate Rule XXXV, para. 2(a)(1) and 2(a)(2)(A)(ii)). (2) Further Restrictions on Lobbyist Participation. In addition to the restriction on lobbyists paying for such travel, the new provisions bar the receipt of expenses if the trip was \"planned, organized, or arranged by or at the request of a lobbyist,\" or when the lobbyist accompanies the Member on \"any segment\" of an otherwise permissible one-day event, or if a lobbyist accompanies the Member \"at any point\" of any other trip. ( S. 1 , Section 544, new Senate Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(d)). (3) Duration of Travel. \"Officially connected\" travel, when permitted, may be for three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel, not counting travel days (newly numbered Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(f)), unless the expenses are provided by a private organization (including a non-approved charitable organization) which retains at least one lobbyist or foreign agent, and then trip may be for a one-day event only (including one overnight). ( S. 1 , Section 544, adding Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(a)(2)(A)(i)). The Senate Select Committee on Ethics may approve two overnights for extended-distance travel. ( S. 1 , Section 544, adding to Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(a)(2)(B)). (4) Prior Certification and Approval. Employees of the Senate have to receive advance approval for officially connected travel from their employing Member and, additionally, all Members and employees must provide a \"certification\" of conformance of the proposed trip with the restrictions and requirements of Senate rules, and must receive advanced approval from the Senate Ethics Committee. ( S. 1 , Section 544, amending Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(b) and adding new paragraph 2(e)). (5) Post-Travel Reporting . Within 30 days after the completion of any officially connected travel, the Member or staff employee must make disclosures of good faith estimates of expenses received, disclose a copy of the certification now required, and must also now include a \"description of meetings and events attended.\" ( S. 1 , Sec. 544, amending Senate Rule XXXV, paragraph 2(c)). (6) Ethics Committee Guidelines on \" Reasonable Expenses. \" Under congressional rules when expenses for officially connected travel are allowed to be accepted, such expenses must be \"necessary\" and \"reasonable.\" There are currently no specific guidelines or valuations for what \"reasonable\" expenses are in relation to any specific journey. The Ethics Committee is instructed to develop guidelines on the reasonableness of travel expenses. House of Representatives: The House adopted rules substantially similar to those changes made to the Senate rules by S. 1 for \"officially connected\" travel, in H.Res. 6 , on January 4, 2007. The principal difference is that instead of allowing \"officially connected\" travel to be compensated by any \"charitable organization,\" even if it employs lobbyists, as in the Senate, the House rules more narrowly allow such travel to be compensated by an \"institution of higher education,\" even if such institution retains or employs lobbyists. The duration of permissible trips in the House is four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel. Additionally, reporting and disclosures at the conclusion of a trip must be made by Members and staff in the House 15 days after the completion of the trip, as opposed to 30 days in the Senate. Non-Commercial Air Travel. Reimbursement by Members of Congress and staffers had to generally be provided for flights on private, non-commercial aircraft (such as \"corporate jets\") so that such flights would not constitute prohibited \"gifts\" from private sources, prohibited contributions to an \"unofficial office account,\" or illegal campaign contributions (2 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 441a, 441b, 441c)). No specific reimbursement amount had been provided in Senate or House rules, and such flights were generally reimbursed at a 1 st class commercial rate. In the Senate, under the new rules, \"fair market value\" for reimbursement for flights on such private, non-commercial airline flights is to be the pro rata share of the normal charter fare or rental charge for similar aircraft, instead of commercial fare. The higher reimbursement provision will not apply to aircraft owned or leased by a Member or the Member's immediate family. ( S. 1 , Section 544, adding Senate Rule XXXV, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C)(i)-(iii)). The House, however, has substantially banned a Member or employee of the House from taking trips on private, non-commercial aircraft, by prohibiting the reimbursement or payment of such trips with any funds, unless the aircraft is owned or leased by the Member personally, or by a family member. ( H.Res. 6 , as modified by H.Res. 363 , 110 th Congress). Constituent Events. In the Senate, the new Senate rules expressly permit a Member or employee to accept an offer of \"free attendance\" in the Member's home state at a \"constituent event,\" which is an event sponsored by constituents, or a group mainly of constituents, and attended by at least five of the Member's constituents, when the Member or staffer participates in the event as a speaker or panel participant and when a \"lobbyist\" will not be in attendance. \"Free attendance\" may include an \"accompanying individual\" where appropriate, and includes event fees, local transportation only, meals (if under $50), refreshments, entertainment, and instructional materials furnished to all attendees as an integral part of the event. ( S. 1 , Section 545, adding to Senate Rule XXXV, paragraphs 1(c)(24) and 1(g)). Public Information on Travel and Disclosure. In the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate is instructed to create a searchable, free website to post the travel information that must be disclosed concerning \"officially connected\" travel. ( S. 1 , Section 546). In the House, the Clerk of the House is instructed to establish a free, searchable website that contains the information, certifications, and disclosures relating to \"officially connected\" travel, and the personal financial disclosure reports that are required to be made under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 by Members. ( S. 1 , Section 304). Official Contact With Member ' s Spouse or Family Who Are Lobbyists. In the Senate, the Senate rules will now require that a Senator prohibit all staff from having any official direct \"lobbying contact\" with the Member's spouse or Member's immediate family if such spouse or family member is a registered lobbyist, or is employed or retained by a registered lobbyist or an entity retaining lobbyists. ( S. 1 , Section 552, adding Senate Rule XXXVII, para. 11(a)). All staff employees are further prohibited from having any official \"lobbying contact\" with a spouse of any Member of the Senate who is a registered lobbyist, or is employed or retained by a registered lobbyist, unless the spouse was serving as a registered lobbyist at least one year prior to the most recent election of that Member or at least one year prior to his or her marriage to that Member. ( S. 1 , Section 552, adding Senate Rule XXXVII, paragraphs 11(b) and (c)). In the House, a Member must instruct his or her staff (including personal, committee, or leadership offices) not to have official, direct \"lobbying contacts\" with that Member's spouse if the spouse is a lobbyist under the LDA of 1995 or is employed or retained by a lobbyist to influence legislation. ( S. 1 , Section 302, adding Rule XXV, cl. 7). Contractors and Members of their Firms Lobbying the House. The House rules (Rule XXIII, cl. (18)(b), as re-numbered by H.Res. 6 and S. 1 )) provide that contractors to the House are not permitted to lobby the contracting committee or Members or staff of that committee. The changes in S. 1 now provide that members and employees of the firm or business of which the contractor is a member are also prohibited from lobbying the contracting committee or Members or staff of that committee. ( S. 1 , Section 303, amending House Rule XXIII, cl.18(b)). Ethics Training. In the Senate, S. 1 requires Senators and staff to complete an ethics training given by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics within 60 days of commencement of service, or if currently serving, within 165 days after the enactment of S. 1 . ( S. 1 , Section 553). In the House, H.Res. 6 has amended the rules of the House to require the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to \"offer\" ethics training on a yearly basis to Members of the House and staff. Only staff employees, however, and not House Members, are required to take such ethics briefings and training. ( H.Res. 6 , Section 211, adding House Rule XI, cl. 3(a)(6)(A) and (B)). Financial Interests in \" Earmarks. \" The ethics rules in the Senate and the House have been amended to provide an express standard prohibiting Members of Congress from introducing, and Members and staff from working towards the passage of, an \"earmark\" in which they have a particular financial interest.
