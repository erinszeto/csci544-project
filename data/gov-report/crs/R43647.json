Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Some of these increases were quite substantial, particularly after FY2006, but Congress began reversing these increases in light of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and a drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan which began in 2012. In FY2014, the authorized end-strength for the Army was 520,000, while the authorized end-strength for the Marine Corps was 190,200. Given the budgetary outlook, particularly the future impact of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), the Army plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 420,000 and 450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 175,000 to 182,600. End-strength for the Air Force and Navy has decreased gradually since 2001. The authorized end-strength for FY2014 was 327,600 for the Air Force and 323,600 for the Navy.", "Discussion: In light of the ongoing drawdown in Afghanistan and the budgetary environment, the Administration requested major reductions in Army (-30,000), Air Force (-16,700), and Marine Corps (-6,100) end strengths in comparison to their FY2014 authorized end-strengths. The end-strength request for the Navy remained stable at 323,600 in comparison to FY2014. The figures in H.R. 3979 are identical to the administration's end-strength request except for the Air Force; the proposed final bill recommends an Air Force end-strength slightly higher (+2,080) than the Administration's request. Taken together, the proposed final bill stipulates a total active duty end-strength which is 50,720 lower than the FY2014 level. The committee report which accompanied H.R. 4435 noted that \"the services plan for more drastic reductions in end strength and force structure in fiscal year 2016 absent a change in the Budget Control Act of 2011\" and expressed concerns that \"This continued stress on the force, coupled with potential further reductions as a result of the BCA's discretionary caps, may have serious implications on the capacity and capability of the All-Volunteer Force and the ability for the services to meet the National Defense Strategy.\"", "Reference(s): Previously discussed in CRS Report R43184, FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues , and similar reports from earlier years.

Much of this can be attributed to the reductions in Navy Reserve strength during this period. There were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the Selected Reserve. For comparative purposes, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were as follows: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). Between FY2001 and FY2014, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Army and Navy Reserve (-29,800 or -33.5%), Army National Guard (+3,674 or +1.1%), Air Force Reserve (-3,958 or -5.3%), and Coast Guard Reserve (+1,000 or +12.5%). A smaller change occurred in the Air National Guard (-2,622 or -2.4%), while the authorized end strength of the Army Reserve (-300 or -0.15%) and the Marine Corps Reserve (+42 or +0.11%) have been largely unchanged during this period.", "Discussion: For FY2015, the Administration requested an authorized Selected Reserve end strength lower than those for FY2014 for all of the reserve components.

Section 1009 of Title 37 provides a permanent formula for an automatic annual increase in basic pay that is indexed to the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The increase in basic pay for 2015 under this statutory formula would be 1.8% unless either: (1) Congress passes a law to provide otherwise; or (2) the President specifies an alternative pay adjustment under subsection (e) of 37 U.S.C. 1009.", "The FY2015 President's Budget requested a 1.0% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 1.8%.

This FY 2014 plan called for pay raises of 1.0 percent in FY 2015 and FY 2016, 1.5 percent in FY 2017, and then returned to more likely ECI levels of 2.8 percent in FY 2018 and beyond.", "Similar to FY 2014, the FY 2015 President's Budget again seeks a 1.0 percent basic pay raise for military members in FY 2015, which is less generous than the 1.8 percent increase in ECI as of September 30, 2013.", "Discussion: The House bill contained no provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay, although the report accompanying it ( H.Rept. 113-446 ) contained the following statement:", "The committee continues to believe that robust and flexible compensation programs are central to maintaining a high-quality, all-volunteer, combat-ready force.

On August 29, President Obama sent a letter to Congress invoking 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise for 2015 at 1.0%. The proposed final version contains no general pay raise provision, thereby leaving in place the 1.0% increase specified by President Obama under 37 U.S.C. 1009(e), but section 601 freezes the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels.", "Reference(s): Previously discussed in CRS Report R43184, FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues , and similar reports from earlier years.", "CRS Point of Contact: [author name scrubbed], x[phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)", "paragraphs": ["Background: The armed services provide funds to assist members of the military to pay for housing when government quarters adequate for themselves and their dependents are not available. Originally known as Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ), such compensation was based on rank and whether or not dependents were involved. During the 1970s housing costs began to vary more by location. In 1980, Congress added a Variable Housing Allowance (VHA) as a means to defray high housing costs in certain areas. BAQ/VHA was not intended to defray the entire cost of housing. It was expected that service members would pay approximately 15% of these costs out-of-pocket. By 1997, the increase in housing costs increased this out-of-pocket amount to about 20%. In 1998, Congress combined BAQ and VHA and renamed it BAH. In 2001, Congress enacted language that would increase BAH over successive years to remove the out-of-pocket costs to the service member. Out-of-pocket costs were eliminated by 2005. The President's 2015 budget submission called for a slowing of BAH growth such that service members would pay 5% out-of-pocket by 2019.", "Discussion : The language in the proposed final version allows the Secretary of Defense to reduce monthly BAH payments by up to 1% of the \"national average monthly cost of adequate housing in the United States.\" The Joint Explanatory Statement which accompanied the bill also stated the following: ", "We note that while the Department of Defense (DOD) legislative proposal included proposed changes to BAH that would have been implemented over the next 3 years, this agreement includes those changes to BAH that the committees understand would have been implemented by DOD in 2015.

The Establishment Clause in the Bill of Rights is meant to stop the government from endorsing a national religion, or favoring one religion over another. Actions taken must be carefully balanced to avoid being in violation of one of these clauses.

This instruction indicates that DOD places a high value on the rights of military personnel to practice their respective religions. There have been instances where military personnel have become upset because the chaplain closed the prayer at a mandatory ceremony, such as a deployment ceremony, with a specific religious remark, such as \"praise be Jesus.\" In February 2014, an atheist soldier at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX, threatened the U.S. Army with a lawsuit because a chaplain allegedly prayed to the Heavenly Father during a secular event. However, no personnel are required to recognize the prayer, or participate in it (for example, they do not have to respond). Religious proselytizing is considered by some to be a prominent issue in the Armed Forces. Some believe it could destroy the bonds that keep soldiers together, which could be viewed as a national security threat. The ability for a chaplain to be able to close a prayer outside of a religious service may heighten the tension between soldiers and may worsen the problem.
