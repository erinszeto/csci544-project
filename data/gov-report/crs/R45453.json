During the Obama Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a final rule for CO 2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric power plants. The rule, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), appeared in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015.", "The CPP is the subject of ongoing litigation, and in 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the rule for the duration of the litigation. In March 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that directed EPA to review the CPP (and other rulemakings) and \"as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind the guidance, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding those rules.\" Pursuant to that order, EPA proposed to repeal the CPP in October 2017.

In this proposal, EPA determined that the agency had exceeded its authority with the Obama Administration's CPP. In the ACE rulemaking, EPA proposed a more narrow interpretation of best system of emission reduction , directing states (in contrast to EPA under the CPP) to establish performance standards for existing coal-fired electric generating units based on EPA-identified technologies (i.e., heat rate improvements) and other considerations (e.g., useful life of the unit). Many of the legal questions raised in the CPP proceedings will likely be central to any future legal challenges to the repeal of the CPP or the ACE rule if finalized.", "An understanding of GHG emission source data and the underlying factors that affect emission levels might help inform the discussion among policymakers regarding GHG emission mitigation.

As the figure illustrates, U.S. electricity generation generally increased between 1975 and 2007 and then decreased in 2008 and 2009. Historically, CO 2 emissions from electricity generation followed a similar course. However, in 2010, these trends decoupled. While electricity generation remained flat after 2010, CO 2 emissions continued a general trend of reduction. Thus in 2017, electricity generation was essentially equivalent to generation in 2005, while CO 2 emissions were 27% below 2005 levels.", "The decrease in CO 2 emissions in the electricity sector in recent years was likely a result of several factors, including overall economic conditions and electricity market developments. Historically, annual U.S. GDP decreases are a relatively uncommon occurrence: The United States has seen an annual decrease in GDP seven times over the past 50 years. The 2.9% GDP decrease in 2009 was the largest GDP decrease during that time frame. The economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a decrease of energy consumption (including electricity) across all economic sectors. The decline in electricity generation likely played a key role in the sharp decline in emission levels between 2007 and 2009. ", "Another factor contributing to the recent decrease in CO 2 emissions from electricity generation was the change in the electricity generation portfolio. Electricity is generated from a variety of sources in the United States. Some sources\u2014nuclear, hydropower, and some renewables\u2014directly produce no CO 2 emissions with their electricity generation. Fossil fuels generate different amounts of CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated (often described as carbon intensity). Figure 6 illustrates the relative comparison of CO 2 emissions between electricity produced from coal, petroleum, and natural gas. As the figure indicates, petroleum-fired electricity yields approximately 80% of the CO 2 emission of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Natural-gas-fired electricity from a steam generation unit yields approximately 60% of the CO 2 emissions of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Natural-gas-fired electricity from a combined cycle unit yields approximately 43% of the CO 2 emissions of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. ", "Therefore, a shift in the carbon intensity of the U.S. electricity generation portfolio would likely have (all else being equal) an impact on emissions from the electricity sector, which in turn, would have an impact on total U.S. GHG emissions.", " Figure 7 illustrates the percentage of electricity generated by source between 2005 and 2017. As the figure indicates, the U.S. electricity generation portfolio has changed considerably in recent years. Highlights include the following:", "Coal: Between 2005 and 2017, coal-fired generation decreased by 40%. Its contribution to total electricity generation decreased from 50% to 30%. Natural gas: Between 2005 and 2017, natural-gas-fired generation increased by 67%. Its contribution to total electricity generation increased from 19% to 32%. In 2016, natural gas surpassed coal in terms of percentage of total generation. Renewable energy: Between 2005 and 2017, non-hydro renewable energy generation increased by 343%. Its contribution to total electricity generation increased from 2% to 10%.", "Several factors likely played a role in these recent changes. Due in large part to technological advances\u2014particularly directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2014U.S. natural gas production increased dramatically (by 50%) between 2005 and 2015. In 2016, production declined by 2% compared to 2015 levels but increased slightly in 2017 (about 1% higher than 2016). Relatedly, the weighted average annual price of natural gas dropped by about 60% between 2005 and 2015. By comparison, the weighted average annual coal price increased by about 40% during that time frame. This change in relative fuel prices has played a key role in altering the economics of power generation (i.e., order of dispatch), leading to some natural gas displacement of coal in particular regions of the country. These market forces have played a role in the retirement of coal-fired electric power plants: Between 2006 and 2016, the number of coal-fired power plants decreased from 353 to 230. ", " Figure 8 provides a more detailed breakdown of the changes in generation from non-hydro renewable energy sources. The majority of the increased generation from renewable energy over the past 12 years is due to wind power, which increased 14-fold between 2005 and 2017. Although solar increased 96-fold over that time frame, the magnitude of wind generation exceeds solar generation: 254 Terawatt-hours of wind versus 53 Terawatt-hours of solar in 2017. Energy from wood fuels has remained relatively constant during this time frame. The increase in \"other\" renewable sources is due to increased use of landfill gas, which more than doubled between 2005 and 2017.

The difference between the two scenarios (CPP versus non-CPP) appears to be greater in the earlier studies, because the reference case scenarios in more recent studies project lower emissions by 2030 when compared to earlier studies. For example, the 2017 EIA reference case estimate was a 22% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030; the 2018 EIA reference case estimate was 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
