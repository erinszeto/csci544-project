{"id": "RS22512", "title": "Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Accounts Not Counted As Resources", "released_date": "2011-08-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["As a means tested program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) places a limit on the assets or resources of its beneficiaries. However, there are four types of accounts that can be used by SSI beneficiaries for specific purposes without affecting their SSI eligibility. Money placed into burial accounts, money used as part of a Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS), money placed in Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), and money placed in dedicated accounts for children are not counted as resources for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. These accounts can be used by SSI beneficiaries to build assets or plan for the future and represent an important part of the overall SSI program.", "This report provides an overview of these four types of accounts and outlines the cases when money placed into these accounts is exempt from the SSI resource limitations.", "This report will be updated to reflect any changes in this legislation or other relevant legislative activity."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Supplemental Security Income", "paragraphs": ["Under the provisions of Title XVI of the Social Security Act, disabled individuals and persons who are 65 or older are entitled to benefits from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program if they have income and assets that fall below program guidelines. SSI benefits are paid out of the general revenue of the United States and all participants receive the same basic monthly federal benefit. In most states, adults who collect SSI are automatically entitled to coverage under the Medicaid health insurance program. A participant in the SSI program receives the federal benefit rate (FBR), plus any state supplement, minus any countable income.", "At the end of June 2011, more than 8 million people received SSI benefits. In that month, these SSI beneficiaries each received an average cash benefit of $499.40 and the program paid out a total of nearly $4.3 billion in federally administered SSI benefits. The average monthly benefit is lower than the FBR because a person's final monthly benefit is based, in part, on his or her earnings and other income."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSI Resource Limits", "paragraphs": ["Individuals and couples must have limited assets or resources to qualify for SSI benefits. Resources are defined by regulation as \"cash or other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual (or spouse, if any) owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.\"", "The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. These limits are set by law, are not indexed for inflation, and have been at their current levels since 1989.", "Not all resources are counted for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. The Social Security Act and federal regulations provide various types of resource exclusions that allow individuals or couples to own certain assets and not have them counted against their $2,000 or $3,000 resource limit. In addition, the laws governing several federal benefit programs, including the Food Stamp program, prohibit the Social Security Administration (SSA) from counting benefits paid under these programs as resources when determining SSI eligibility. The following section of this report will detail the four types of accounts that a person or couple may have money in and not have that money counted as a resource for the purposes of determining their SSI eligibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Burial Accounts", "paragraphs": ["Money set aside by an SSI recipient to pay for his or her burial expenses can be excluded from the SSI resource limits. Each person may set aside up to $1,500 for burial expenses and these expenses must be separately identifiable from other assets and money held. A burial plot owned by an individual or a couple is not considered a resource and its value is not counted against the $2,000 or $3,000 resource limit.", "There are two cases in which the amount of the burial expense exclusion may be reduced. First, the total amount permitted to be excluded is reduced by the face value of all life insurance policies held by the individual or his or her spouse. The face value of a policy is the amount the insurer agrees to pay the beneficiary upon the death of the insured. Second, the excluded amount of burial expenses is reduced by the total amount of money held in an irrevocable trust (commonly called an irrevocable burial trust) available to meet the burial expenses of the individual or his or her spouse."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Special Rules for Trusts", "paragraphs": ["Under the provisions of the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, P.L. 106 - 169 , the corpus , or total value, of any trust established by an individual is counted as a resource when determining SSI eligibility unless there is no circumstance under which a payment from the trust could ever be made for the benefit of the individual or the individual's spouse. Nearly all trusts, even irrevocable burial trusts, trusts deemed irrevocable under state law and trusts with specific exculpatory clauses exempting the trust from parts of the Social Security Act, are covered by this provision and the entire value of the corpora of these trusts is counted as a resource.
