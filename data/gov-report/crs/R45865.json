However, some stakeholders have questioned the equity of the distribution of 2018 MFP payments and the rationale for determining payments based on \"trade damage\" rather than a broader \"market loss\" measure. Some economists have suggested that, even under the 2019 formulation, USDA is overpaying farmers for trade losses and that USDA's calculations failed to fully incorporate last year's record soybean harvest or new trade patterns that have emerged following China's reluctance to buy U.S. soybeans.", "Due to their price tag ($12 billion in 2018 and $16 billion in 2019) and the coupled nature of the MFP payments to planted acres, there is considerable interest from policymakers, market observers, and trading partners about whether these payments will be fully compliant with World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. In particular, there is some interest in whether large MFP payments might cause the United States to breach its $19.1 billion annual WTO spending limit on trade-distorting farm subsidies.", "Appendix A. MFP Payment Formula", "On August 23, 2019, USDA published the details on the calculation of MFP payment rates for USDA-designated eligible commodities under the 2019 trade aid package\u00e2\u0080\u0094including county-level MFP rates for non-specialty crops and national MFP rates for hogs, dairy, and specialty crops. ", "For both the 2018 and the 2019 trade aid packages, USDA defined economic losses due to foreign retaliatory trade actions narrowly in terms of gross trade damages rather than broadly as lost market value. Gross trade damages is defined as the total amount of expected export sales lost to the retaliating trade partner due to the additional tariffs. Gross trade damages were estimated for each of the major farm commodities affected by the retaliatory tariffs. The estimated trade damages were then used to derive both commodity-specific MFP payment rates and FPDP purchase targets for pork (hogs) and milk (dairy). ", "Both the 2018 and 2019 trade aid packages used the same methodology to estimate gross trade damages for USDA-designated commodities. However, the two estimates used different time frames to calculate the trade damages, thus producing different commodity-specific MFP payment rates ( Table A-1 ). The 2018 calculations of gross trade damages compared trade data from 2017 (pre-retaliatory tariffs) with 2018 data (post-retaliatory tariffs). The 2019 calculations used a longer historical time series, extending the \"look-back\" over a 10-year period from 2009 through 2018 compared with 2019 trade. ", "In a further change from the 2018 methodology, the 2019 MFP payment rates for non-specialty crops combined commodity-specific MFP payments rates at the county level in a formula (weighted by historical county planted acres and yields) to derive a single county-level MFP payment rate rather than separate national commodity-specific rates. Hogs, dairy, and specialty crops retained their national MFP payment rates but at different values due to the longer \"look-back\" period used to estimate gross trade damages.", "This appendix section briefly reviews the methodology used to derive the 2018 MFP commodity-specific payment rates. Then it discusses the adaptations made by USDA for 2019 to derive both the county-level payments for non-specialty crops and the national-level payment rates for specialty crops, hogs, and dairy. ", "2018 MFP Payment-Rate and Payment Methodology", "USDA calculated a unique national MFP payment rate for each affected commodity (as determined by USDA). A producer's MFP payment calculation involved three steps:", "First, USDA estimated the level of direct trade-related damage caused by 2018 retaliatory tariffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094imposed by Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico, and Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0094to U.S. exports for each affected commodity. Direct trade loss is the difference in expected trade value for each affected commodity with and without the retaliatory tariffs. To measure this, USDA compared U.S. exports for 2017 (the year prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs) with 2018 export levels when trade was subject to the retaliatory tariffs. ", "Much of the affected 2018 agricultural production had yet to be harvested and sold at the time the MFP payment rates were calculated. In addition, the final trade effect, with or without retaliatory tariffs, was not observable, and markets had yet to fully adjust to whatever new trade patterns would emerge from the trade dispute. As a result, USDA estimated both export values (with and without retaliatory tariffs) using a global trade model that accounted for the availability of both substitute supplies from export competitors and demand for U.S. agricultural exports from alternate importers. Indirect effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as any decline in market prices due to record 2018 soybean production and the build-up of domestic stocks, or resultant economy-wide \"lost value\" for non-producer owners of the affected commodities\u00e2\u0080\u0094were not included in the payment calculation. ", "Second, the estimated trade damage for each affected commodity was divided by the crop's production in 2017 to calculate a national commodity-specific, per-unit damage rate. This per-unit damage rate is the commodity-specific MFP payment rate. In the case of both pork and milk, FPDP purchases were subtracted from the estimated trade damage before the per-unit MFP payment rates for hogs and milk were calculated.", "Finally, a producer's 2018 MFP payment was equal to the commodity-specific MFP payment rate multiplied by the producer's 2018 production for corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, fresh sweet cherries, and shelled almonds. For hog producers, the MFP payment rate was multiplied by a producer-selected hog inventory from July 15 to August 15, 2018. For milk producers, the MFP payment rate was multiplied by the farm's production history as reported for the Margin Protection Program of the 2014 farm bill. ", "2019 MFP Payment-Rate and Payment Methodology", "To calculate the 2019 MFP payment rates, USDA made several adaptations to the 2018 methodology. As a result, a producer's MFP payment calculation in 2019 involved an additional fourth step.", "First, USDA again calculated the level of direct trade-related damage caused by retaliatory tariffs to U.S. exports for each commodity. However, USDA used 2019 retaliatory tariffs (not 2018) that were being imposed by China, the European Union, and Turkey. Canada and Mexico were removed from the calculations, as they were no longer imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. In addition, USDA adjusted the calculation of direct trade damage by using 10 years of historical U.S. export data (2009-2018) rather than a single year. This larger period captured trade losses for certain commodities that experienced fluctuating trade patterns in recent years and where trade levels during the 2017 data period were unrepresentative of historical trade volumes. ", "Second, the estimated trade damage for each affected commodity was divided by the crop's average production during the three-year period 2015-2017 to calculate a national commodity-specific, per-unit damage rate. In the case of both pork and milk, FPDP purchases were subtracted from the estimated trade damage before the per-unit MFP payment rates for hogs and milk were calculated.", "Third, the commodity-specific damage rates were then used to establish county-level, per-acre payment rates based on historical county data for average planted area and yields of the affected commodities. For each county, USDA multiplied three terms together to estimate the county-level trade damage for each MFP-eligible crop: (1) the three-year (2015-2017) average yield for each crop\u00e2\u0080\u0094taken from USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) crop insurance data, (2) the four-year (2015-2018) average planted acres of each crop in the county\u00e2\u0080\u0094taken from FSA's database of crop acreage reports\u00e2\u0080\u0094and (3) the commodity-specific, per-unit damage rate for each crop (from step two above). Then, for each county, the crop damage estimates were added across all MFP-eligible crops produced in the county to generate an estimate of the county's total trade damages. The county's total trade damage estimate was then divided by total planted acres of MFP-eligible crops within the county. The result is a unique county-level MFP payment rate. Under this formulation, MFP county-level rates will vary across counties based on the average crop mix, the average planted acres per crop, and average crop yields.", "Finally, a producer's 2019 MFP non-specialty-crop payment is equal to the county-level MFP non-specialty-crop payment rate (for the county where production occurs) multiplied by the total acreage of all non-specialty crops planted in that county by that producer. Thus, the 2019 MFP non-specialty-crop payment is independent of an individual farmer's crop mix (from among MFP-eligible non-specialty crops). ", "In 2019, many producers were prevented from planting acreage due to wet, cool conditions. These acres were not eligible for MFP non-specialty crop payments. However, if a USDA-approved cover crop was planted on the \"prevent-plant\" acres with the potential to be harvested, then those producers qualified for a $15-per-acre payment on \"prevent-plant\" acres.", "USDA suggests that this independence from individual crop choices prevents the county-level MFP payment from distorting producer planting decisions that were ongoing at the time of the initial trade aid package announcement on May 23, 2019. However, planting of an MFP-eligible crop was a requirement for MFP eligibility. Thus, the 2019 MFP payments may be non-commodity-specific outlays, but they are coupled to the planting of an MFP-eligible crop. These distinctions, although subtle, are important considerations for how the resultant outlays may be notified under WTO domestic-support program disciplines.", "Appendix B. FPDP Implementation", "The Administration is allocating about $1.4 billion of its 2019 trade aid package to USDA's AMS for purchasing various agricultural commodities and distributing them through domestic nutrition assistance programs ( Table B-1 ).
