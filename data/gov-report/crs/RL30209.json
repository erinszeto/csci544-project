This account funds the salaries andbenefits of judgesand supporting personnel and all operating expenses of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, BankruptcyCourts andthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The principal issue over this account concerned the funding level needed tomaintainessential court operations and services. ", "For Salaries and Expenses of the lower courts, the Judiciary had requested $3.25 billion, a 14.7% increase over FY1999funding of $2.83 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee, and then the Senate, approved $2.99 billion, a 4.5%increase. In recommending this amount, the Senate Appropriations Committee noted its understanding that up to$83.9million in \"carryover, reimbursables, and fees\" would be available to apply to this account. The committeeobserved thatthe Judiciary's request for space and facilities, included in the Salaries and Expenses account, represented 21% oftheJudiciary's FY2000 budget submission. The committee credited the Judiciary for making efforts to control GSAspacerental growth, noting, however, that GSA rental payments continued to consume a greater portion of the total fundsavailable to the courts. \"To accommodate this growth,\" the", "committee said, its recommendation \"adjusts downward the request for court staff.\" (32)", "The Judiciary, however, quickly protested these cuts. According to the Judiciary, the Senate provided $211million less intotal funding than required to maintain current services, which, in the Judiciary's view, might necessitate, inFY2000, anearly 11% reduction in court support staff from that authorized in FY1999 (the equivalent of approximately 2,300employees).

Under the House bill, it said, furloughs of Judiciaryemployeeswould not be necessary, although a freeze on filling most vacant positions would still be likely. (35) However, in an August9, 1999 letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist criticized both the SenateandHouse FY2000 appropriations bills. The Chief Justice said that despite its growing workload, the Judiciary under S. 1217 would receive $280 million less than was required to furnish the services it provided in FY1999. Such a budget cut, he said, was \"both unjustified and impractical.\" The House bill, H.R. 1670 , according tothe Chief Justice, while providing a significant increase above the Senate, would provide $180 million less than\"requiredto furnish the services the Judiciary provided this year, and it also would have a noticeable adverse impact on courtoperations.\" (36)", "Another issue regarding the Salaries and Expenses account for the lower courts concerned funding needed to handleworkload increases caused primarily by a sharp rise in criminal case filings. The Senate Appropriations Committee,in itsreport on S. 1217 , stated that it understood that increases in overall judicial caseloads were largely the resultof immigration proceedings. The committee said it also was aware that \"these cases, while numerous, can beresolvedexpediently as compared to other criminal filings.\" Accordingly, the committee requested that the Judiciary conductastudy of whether the ratio of magistrate judges to U.S. district judges should be changed \"to meet this pressingdemand onthe courts.\" ", "Ultimately, following the House-Senate conference, Congress approved $3.1 billion for Salaries and Expenses--a 10.0%increase over FY1999, $122.4 million over the earlier Senate-approved amount, and $48.0 million over the Housebill. ", "One of the more sensitive parts of the Judiciary's budget in recent years has been Defender Services . This account fundsthe operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations, and the compensation,reimbursementand expenses of \"panel attorneys\" appointed to represent persons under the Criminal Justice Act. Duringconsideration ofthe Judiciary's FY1999 budget, congressional appropriators had expressed concerns about rising Defender Servicescosts;subsequently, conferees for the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act directed the Judiciary to review DefenderServicescosts in \"capital cases\" (federal death penalty and death row appeal cases) and report its findings by to Congress bySeptember 30, 1999.", "For FY2000 the Judiciary requested $411.4 million for Defender Services (including $36.6 million in Violent CrimeReduction Program trust funds), a 5.0% increase over FY1999 budget authority of $391.8 million. (37) Congress, however,ultimately approved a 1.8% reduction in total FY2000 funding for Defender Services. The totalapproved, $385.1 million(including $26.2 million in violent crime reduction trust funds) was $2.7 million less than passed earlier by theHouse and$31.2 million more than approved by the Senate. (38)", "The Defender Services amount approved by Congress includes funding, as provided in the House bill, for an increase of $5an hour for in-court and out-of court compensation for Criminal Justice Act panel attorneys. Earlier, the Senatein its CJSbill, as requested by the Judiciary, (39) had providedfor a $10 increase in panel attorney hourly compensation rates--hikingin-court rates to $75 an hour and out-of-court rates to $55 an hour for all judicial districts, beginning April 1, 2000. According to the Judiciary, however, FY2000 funding approved for Defender Services by the Senate would beinsufficientto pay for panel attorneys at this higher rate for the entire fiscal year. Payments for panel attorneys, the Judiciarycontended, would have to be halted in late June 2000, deferring nearly $43 million in payments to these attorneysuntilFY2001. In that event, according to the Judiciary, a significant number of cases might not be able to proceed to trialduringFY2000 without violating the Sixth Amendment rights of persons to an adequate defense, in turn, compelling thecourts to postpone trials or dismiss charges against defendants. As noted above, Congress ultimately approved $31.2 millionmorefor Defender Services than did the Senate in its earlier CJS bill. ", "On another matter involving Defender Services, House-Senate conferees stated in their report that they had adopted byreference language in the House Appropriations Committee report relating to the U.S. Court of Appeals for theNinthCircuit. (40)", "In response to the Judiciary's request, Congress authorized a 3.4% cost-of-living increase in judges' and justices' salaries for FY2000, appropriating $9.6 million for this purpose. (41) The Judiciary had requested a salary increase for judicialofficers effective January 2000, which it stated was consistent with an expected cost-of-living increase for federalemployees. The requested salary increase was agreed to by the Senate but not by the House in their respective CJSbills; (42) House-Senate conferees then approved the Senate's recommendation, making the upward pay adjustment for judgeseffective January 2000. (43)", "Congress previously had approved a pay increases for judges in its FY1998 CJS bill; that one-time 2.3% salary adjustmentcorresponded with a cost-of-living increase which Congress allowed for itself effective January 1998. Despite arequest ofthe Judiciary that it again do so the next year, Congress declined to include a pay adjustment for judges in theFY1999Omnibus Appropriations Act. In his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice William H.Rehnquistfaulted Congress for again denying judges a pay raise (the fifth such denial, he noted, in the past 6 years). Denyingcost-of-living adjustments to top officials, he said, was \"a regressive approach to compensation and [was]counter-productive to the common sense goal of encouraging capable individuals to enter the Judiciary.\"", "Congress also approved a substantial increase in funding for Care of the Building and Grounds of the SupremeCourt-- $8.0 million for FY2000. This amount was $2.6 million (or 32.5%) above theFY1999 appropriation of $5.4million but $14.7 million below the Judiciary's initial FY2000 request of $22.7 million. House-Senate confereesnoted thatthe $8.0 million finally approved was \"the amount the Architect of the Capitol currently estimates is required forfiscal year2000, including building renovations and perimeter security.\" ", "Earlier, the Senate had approved $9.7 million for this account, including $8.5 million for building improvements andfunding \"for all requested perimeter security enhancements, including the replacement of aggregate sidewalks andtherestoration of brick walkways.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee had rejected $3.5 million requested foroff-sitedesign and construction, instead calling on the Court to provide the appropriations committees with a spaceutilizationstudy of the Court by February 1, 2000. (44)", "The House, for its part, had approved much less than the Senate for this account--$6.9 million ($15.8 million below theJudiciary's initial request). The House Appropriations Committee noted that in July 1999, relatively late in thebudgetprocess, it had received a letter from the Architect of the Capitol, indicating that the original request was beingmodified,and that in lieu of the $22.7 million in the budget request, the Architect's estimated requirement had been revisedto $8.0million. ", "Congress approved a relatively large proportional increase for Court Security , the account which covers the expenses ofsecurity and protective services for the lower federal courts in courtrooms and adjacent areas. Appropriated for thisaccount for FY2000 was $193.0 million, a 10.6% increase over FY1999 funding of $174.6 million. Earlier, theSenateappropriated $196.0 million for FY2000, a 12.2% increase over FY1999; this proposed amount, the SenateAppropriationsCommittee stated, reflected \"a refined estimate by the U.S. Marshals Service of court security requirements andfundscourt security personnel, equipment, and perimeter enhancements.\" The Judiciary, however, which had requested$206.0million (an 18.0% increase) expressed its unhappiness with the Senate amount; at that level, the Judiciarymaintained,nearly $10 million in planned security enhancements could not be funded, causing increased threats to judicialpersonnel,trial participants, and the general public. (45) Forits part, the House approved $190.0 million--$6 million less thanappropriated by the Senate and $3 million less than ultimately approved by Congress.

Earlier, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.7 million for theCommission, a 50.0% decrease from the FY1999 appropriation of $9.5 million. The Judiciary had requested $10.6million,an 11.7% increase over FY1999. Ultimately, the Senate approved $9.7 million for the Commission and the Houseapproved $8.5 million ($1.0 million below FY1999 funding).", "The Senate committee, in its June 14, 1999 report on S. 1217 , noted that the seven-member Sentencing Commission had been vacant since October 31, 1998, that no commissioners had been nominated or designated bythePresident and that, meanwhile, \"the carriage of justice has continued unabated in the absence of commissioners.\" Thecommittee recommended that the Judiciary reassess the need for the Commission, and it directed that a phase-outplan forthe Commission be provided before November 31, 1999 if no commissioners were appointed by October 1, 1999. Subsequently, on June 24, 1999, the White House announced a full slate of seven nominees to fill the Commission.Atabout the same time, the commission's interim director warned that the budget cuts contained in S. 1217 , ifenacted, would prolong the agency's recovery and result in personnel layoffs.

In its report, the Senate Appropriations Committee stated that its recommendation, of$56.1million, provided \"most of the requested base adjustments for this account and reflected a refinement of anticipatedfunding requirements.\" The Judiciary, however, asserted that at the funding level approved in S. 1217 , theSenate's CJS bill, the AO would be \"unable to pursue economy and efficiency efforts which benefit the entirejudiciary ormaintain base services to the court\" and that the funding initially requested by the Judiciary was required for the AOtomaintain current services.

", "In his message vetoing the initial FY2000 CJS appropriation measure, the President noted that one factor in his vetodecision was that funding for the EEOC was frozen at the FY1999 enacted level, an action which he said wouldunderminethe EEOC's progress in reducing the backlog of employment discrimination cases. Following the veto, Congressraised theEEOC appropriation to $282 million, which was the amount in the measure signed by the President.", "Commission on Civil Rights. The Commission collects and studiesinformation on discrimination or denials of equal protection of the laws. It received an appropriation of $8.9 millionforFY1999.

Congress approved $210 million in FY2000 for the Commission--a 9.4% increase over FY1999resources of $192.0 million but $20.9 million less than the Commission's FY2000 request. The total fundingamountapproved by Congress consisted of a direct appropriation of $24.2 million and $185.8 million in offsettingregulatory feecollections--compared with a direct appropriation of $19.5 million and $172.5 million in regulatory fees enactedforFY1999. Before resolving their differences in conference, the House and Senate had approved $192.0 million and$232.8million respectively in total FY2000 funding for the Commission. (52)", "President Clinton, in his October 25, 1999 veto message on the FY2000 CJS spending bill ( H.R. 2670 ), hadfound the bill's FCC section objectionable on several counts. First, the President said, the bill failed to include aproposedprovision to \"clarify current law and protect taxpayer interests in the telecommunications spectrum auctionprocess.\" (53) This statement concerned the issue of what kind of legislation, if any, was appropriate to deal with \"C-blockspectrum\" thathad been auctioned off to bidders who subsequently filed for bankruptcy. (The Clinton Administration reportedlyregardedrevenues from this spectrum as offset for other spending in the federal budget and favored a provision to allow theFCC toreclaim spectrum from the bankrupt licensees.) The President also faulted the bill for \"deny[ing] funds needed bythe FCCfor investments in technology to better serve the communications industry\" and for not providing \"sufficient fundsfor thecontinued operations of the FCC.\"", "Ultimately, language addressing these presidential concerns was not included in the omnibus budget agreement agreed onby Administration and congressional negotiators. Specifically, the agreement signed into law by President ClintononNovember 29, 1999 was without a provision sought by the President allowing the FCC to reclaim spectrum frombankruptC-block licensees. (Reports in the telecommunications trade press said that the Clinton administration and someSenatorsstill regarded re-auction legislation as a high priority and would push for re-auction legislation in 2000.) Also, thefundingtotal of $210 million enacted for the Commission was precisely the same amount as in the CJS bill vetoed earlierby thePresident. Moreover, the final agreement contained no new language to provide additional funds requested by thePresident for FCC investments in technology.", "The House-Senate conference report on the CJS bill ultimately agreed to by the President and Congress dropped languagewhich conferees earlier (prior to the President's veto of the CJS bill H.R. 2670 ) had approved involving FCCregulation of telephone companies' accounting methods. (54)", "Two other FCC provisions approved by the Senate in its CJS bill in July 1999 also were not included in the FY2000funding bill finally approved by Congress. One provision would have given the FCC the authority to independentlyoperateits headquarters building. The other would have called on the FCC to release a report regarding the proliferationof newtelephone area codes no later than December 31, 1999 while minimizing \"any disruptions and costs to consumersandbusinesses\" associated with the report's implementation. In not including this provision, House-Senate confereesnotedthat the FCC had issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to assist State public utility commissions in their effortstoconserve numbers in specific area codes. The conferees stated they expected the FCC to issue a final order on areacodeconservation measures no later than March 31, 2000.", "The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act approved by Congress also contained a major new piece of telecommunications legislation separate from the CJS appropriations bill--the Intellectual Property andCommunicationsOmnibus Reform Act of 1999. (55)", "Earlier in the FY2000 appropriations process, the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed its concern with an FCCdecision to increase charges on citizens' telephone bills for the e-rate program. Further, the committee maintainedthat theadministration of the e-rate program by the Schools and Libraries Corporation (SLC) had \"not been adequatelyexaminedand assessed.\" Accordingly, the committee directed that the General Accounting Office to review the SLC's role,as wellas assess the FCC's statutory authority to increase e-rate fees. For its part, the House Appropriations Committeedirectedthe FCC to submit, no later than December 15, 1999, a financial plan proposing a distribution of all funds in itsbudgetaccount.

The Senate AppropriationsCommittee,and the full Senate, recommended $14.2 million. The House Appropriations Committee, and the full House,recommendedthe same amount.

The Committee, however, chose a different approach. It recommended $9.3 million bederivedfrom prior-year unobligated fee collections and $144 million from current year offsetting fees. But, as with theAdministration's assumptions, no direct appropriations would have been required. The Senate approved theCommittee'srecommendation. The full House, following the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, approved atotalbudget authority of $116.7 million for FY2000, a decrease of $16.7 million below the agency's request, and the sameas theFY1999 appropriation. Of this amount, $39.5 million was to be derived from prior year unobligated fee collections,and$77 million from current year offsetting fee collections from premerger filing fees under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,resulting -- as with the Senate bill -- in no net direct appropriation for the agency ", "For FY2000, Congress approved a total operating level of $125 million for the FTC, a reduction of $8.4 million from theagency's FY1999 figure.

(This one-time proposed increase in the general fund (direct) appropriation, accordingto theAdministration, would enable the Commission to accommodate the elimination of appropriated budget authoritywhichprovides a guaranteed funding level that is later reduced as actual collections, are received.)", "The Administration's suggested approach -- noted in the previous paragraph -- generally met with the approval of theHouse CJS appropriations subcommittee, albeit at a funding level of $324 million, $17.1 million less than theagencyrequested. The House-passed bill ( H.R. 4276 ) accepted the subcommittee's recommendation for a totalappropriation of $324 million to be comprised of the following components: (1) a direct appropriation of $23million forFY1999; (2) offsetting fees of $214 million to be collected during FY1999; and (3) offsetting fees of $87 millioncollectedin 1998. The CJS bill ( S. 2260 ) passed by the Senate, following the recommendation of the AppropriationsCommittee, rejected the approach of a one-time-only total direct appropriation. The Senate bill provided a totalappropriation for the agency of $341.1 million as requested in the President's FY1999 budget. However, it providednodirect appropriations at all; the full $341.1 million for the agency's Salaries and Expenses would be derived fromfeescollected in fiscal 1999. Congress generally adopted in P.L. 105-277 the Administration's suggested approach.
