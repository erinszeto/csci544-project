Critics contend, however, that the accent on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the multilateral forum and increases the risk of trade diversion away from competitive countries not in the trade bloc. On May 10, 2007, Congressional leaders and the Bush Administration announced a conceptual agreement on changes to currently notified free trade agreements (FTA).", "Negotiations have been concluded with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in time to be considered by Congress under U.S. trade promotion authority.

It is meant to further trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join free trade agreements, and to put pressure on other countries to negotiate in the WTO. According to former United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert B. Zoellick,", "we want to strengthen the hand of the coalition pressing for freer trade. It would be fatal to give the initiative to naysayers abroad and protectionists at home. As we have seen in the League of Nations, the UN, the IMF and the World Bank, international organizations need leaders to prod them into action.", "Critics assert that the emphasis on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the World Trade Organization (WTO) and increases the risk of trade diversion. Trade diversion occurs when the existence of lower tariffs under a trade agreement cause trade to be diverted away from a more efficient producer outside the trading bloc to a producer inside the bloc. What also results from the plethora of negotiated FTAs, according to one economist, \"is a 'spaghetti bowl' of rules, arbitrary definitions of which products come from where, and a multiplicity of tariffs depending on source.\" More recently, new USTR Susan Schwab described the negotiation of bilateral and regional FTAs as a way to \"establish the breadth and scope of potential multilateral agreements in years to come by setting precedents and by demonstrating the real benefits of free and fair trade.\"", "The manner in which the Administration chooses potential FTA partners has been the subject of scrutiny by some Members of Congress. Traditionally, regional and bilateral trade agreements have been negotiated for a mixture of economic, political, and development reasons. The U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) was primarily economic in nature: recognizing the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world between two countries at a similar stage of development. The partnership with Mexico to create NAFTA brought in a country at a different stage of development and gave attention to trade as a lever to encourage economic advancement. It also had a geopolitical rationale of encouraging stability in the U.S. neighbor to the south. The FTA with Israel was seen by supporters as an affirmation of U.S. support for the Jewish state, while the FTA with Jordan could be seen as a reward for Jordan's cooperation in the Middle East peace process.", "In May 2003, then-USTR Zoellick enumerated several factors used to evaluate countries seeking to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, but he said there were no formal rules or procedures to make the determination. A GAO study released in January 2004 reported that an interagency process had been established to assess FTA partners using six factors. These factors include a country's readiness in terms of trade capabilities, the maturity of its political and legal system, and the will to implement reforms; the economic benefit to the United States; the country's support of U.S. trade liberalization goals; a partner's compatibility with U.S. foreign and economic policy interests; congressional or private sector support; and U.S. government resource constraints. The ability of the United States to attract future FTA negotiating partners may now depend on the reauthorization of trade promotion authority, which lapsed on July 1, 2007.", "Some Members of Congress have questioned the manner in which potential FTA partners are chosen. Senator Baucus, now Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the Administration for overlooking high volume trading partners in Asia and was quoted saying that \"this Administration's trade policy is dictated largely by its foreign policy, not by economics.\" In addition, some business groups have expressed a desire to concentrate more on the multilateral negotiations of the WTO, which potentially could yield greater commercial gains.", "The Administration cites the negotiation of free trade agreements in multilateral, regional, and bilateral settings as an integral part of its strategy to enhance prosperity and freedom for the rest of the world. In its September 2002 National Security Strategy, the Administration seemed to equate the concept of 'free trade' with a basic freedom or moral principle, \"the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living.\" According to this document, free-market economic and trade policies, more than development assistance, provides nations with the ability to lift themselves out of poverty and to ensure stability.", "Although the Administration is pursuing trade agreements on multiple fronts, some critics question whether the United States should be negotiating trade agreements at all. They contend that American jobs are lost because of cheaper imports, and that relocation of U.S. production to other countries has been facilitated by trade agreements. Some argue that trade agreements do not adequately address the problem of countries with lower labor and environmental standards that are able to produce at lower cost. Some critics believe that the U.S. economy will be harmed by the Administration's pursuit of free-trade agreements.", "With party control switching in the 110 th Congress, Democratic leaders have sought to make changes in U.S. trade negotiating strategy. On March 27, 2007, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel and Trade Subcommittee Chairman Levin unveiled a set of Democratic trade principles, including some that likely will require, if implemented, the modification of the currently notified FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea. After several weeks of negotiations, congressional leaders and the Bush Administration announced a conceptual agreement on May 10 on several issues that may clear the way for consideration of the Peru and Panama agreements.", "The conceptual template provides for enforcement of international labor standards in an FTA partner's domestic laws and regulations, adherence of FTA partners to certain multilateral environmental agreements, an assurance that trade agreements accord \"no greater substantive rights\" to foreign investors in the United States than U.S. investors in the United States, a clarification that each agreement's \"essential security\" provision is not subject to challenge, insurance that government procurement policies promote basic worker's rights, and the incorporation of certain flexibilities concerning test data and the approval of pharmaceutical products in developing countries.", "The result of the competitive liberalization strategy is that the United States has been involved in an unprecedented number of trade negotiations during this Administration.

While the United States strongly condemned the coup, the negotiations reportedly were not formally suspended, though they remain in limbo. In June 2006, Ways and Means Committee Member Phil English announced his opposition to the U.S.-Thailand FTA, claiming that \"Thailand continues to demonstrate that it does not share common views with the United States with respect to ... a country's right to police its markets effectively from predatory or illegally traded imports.\"", "The Administration sees the potential benefits of an FTA with Thailand as: (1) promotion of U.S. exports, notably benefitting U.S. farmers and the auto and auto parts industries; (2) protection of U.S. investment; and (3) advancement of the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative (mentioned later in this issue brief) and the U.S.-Singapore FTA.

The first stage of this process is expected to be the negotiation of a region-wide trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA), which is seen as the first step in the process of negotiating individual FTAs with ASEAN member states. Thailand is the first candidate for an FTA under this initiative (see earlier section on \" Thailand \"). As seen by the Administration, the principal benefits to the United States of FTAs with ASEAN member states are the potential to reduce high tariffs on agricultural products and to eliminate restrictive tariff-rate quotas on other U.S. exports, while the major benefit to ASEAN countries would be improved access to the U.S. market.

In addition, discriminatory taxes on imports and poor labor rights standards have also been mentioned as impediments to an agreement.
