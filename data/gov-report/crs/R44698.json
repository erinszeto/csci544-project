It shows that people from families whose income falls below the federal poverty thresholds represent a diverse subset of the overall population.", "There were 43 million people living below the federal poverty level in 2015, representing 13.5% of the total population. Nearly half (45.1%) of all people in poverty lived in deep poverty (with income below 50% of the poverty threshold). The largest share of people in poverty were non-Hispanic white (41.2%) but the majority were not. Almost all other racial and ethnic groups were over-represented among the poor, relative to their prevalence in the overall population. Similar to the overall population, children who were poor were more racially and ethnically diverse than adults who were poor, especially aged adults. A majority (55.9%) of poor people were women. Children (under age 18) were disproportionately represented among people in poverty, constituting fully one-third of this group. Most poor children (two-thirds) lived in families where there was at least one earner; however, only 10.5% lived in families with at least two earners. Conversely, in the overall population, half of all children lived in families with two earners. Most poor children lived in single parent homes, but one-third lived in married-couple families. Two-thirds of children in the overall population lived in married-couple families. The majority of people in poverty were working-age adults (age 18-64). While most (76.2%) working-age adults in the overall population were working in 2015, most (61.3%) working-age adults in poverty were not working in 2015. The most common reasons reported for non-work among those in poverty were illness or disability, the need to meet caretaking responsibilities, or being enrolled in school. Although most working-aged adults in poverty were not working, nearly 40% were working in 2015; 10.4% were working full-time, full-year. Most working-age adults in poverty lacked a post-secondary educational credential; 80.6% had a high school diploma or less, compared to 58.7% in the overall population. Fewer than 10% of people in poverty were aged (age 65 and older); since aged adults make up 14.9% of the overall population, this means they are underrepresented among people in poverty. The vast majority of aged adults in poverty either had, or lived in families that had, income from work or from retirement or other social insurance tied to prior work. Aged adults in poverty are far more likely to live alone than aged adults overall (50.2% compared to 28.7%)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Poverty has become a topic of interest for Congress. While the most recent Census report, for 2015, shows the largest statistically significant one-year decline in the overall poverty rate since 1999, poverty remains higher than it was prior to the Great Recession. Further, poverty rates have primarily been rising since 2000, with statistically significant declines occurring only three times between 2000 and 2015. The fact of a persistently high poverty rate has led policymakers to reexamine the drivers of poverty\u2014both economic and social\u2014and the effectiveness of various policy responses. As the conversations about poverty and public policy continue, it may be useful to ask: Who are the people who are poor in the United States? ", "This report provides a snapshot of who was poor in 2015 by selected demographic, economic, and social characteristics. The data presented here show that people in poverty are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse collection of families and individuals at different stages of life, living in different circumstances. Special attention is paid in this report to the role of work in the lives of people who are poor. Income from work, or the lack thereof, is central to the economic fortunes not only of those considered \"working-age,\" but also of children, who are generally dependent on working-age adults, and persons who are aged (age 65 and older), who generally have prior experience in the workforce that shapes their economic well-being after they retire. Attention is also paid to living arrangements. Because poverty is measured at the family level, considerations such as whether someone lives alone, or whom someone lives and potentially shares resources with, influence economic well-being. Other factors that affect family well-being, and that influence individuals' attachment to and success in the labor market, are important for considering individuals' experiences of poverty but are beyond the scope of this report.", "This snapshot looks at the composition of people in poverty\u2014what groups comprise what share of the poverty population\u2014rather than at poverty rates among different groups. This provides a different perspective in viewing poverty. A large population group such as non-Hispanic whites might have relatively low poverty rates, but because of the group's size in the overall population it represents a relatively large share of the poverty population. A small population, such as American Indians, might have relatively high poverty rates, but because of the group's size it represents a relatively small share of the poverty population. Both perspectives on poverty are valid and relevant to public policy. Readers interested in an examination of poverty rates for different demographic groups\u2014and trends in poverty over time\u2014should see CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Used in this Report", "paragraphs": ["Poverty, in general, is a lack of resources to meet basic needs. This report uses the official measure of poverty used by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify individuals as \"poor.\" However, it is important to note that the Census poverty measure is actually family -based. Whether a person is considered poor depends on his or her money income and the income of any other family members\u2014those related to a family head by birth, marriage, or adoption\u2014with whom the person lives and presumably shares resources. If an individual is living alone or with people who are not relatives, that individual is considered a family of one and only his or her income is counted in determining his or her poverty status. That money income is then compared with a dollar threshold, which is based on that individual's family composition. For example, the poverty threshold for a working-age single person (who does not live in a family) in 2015 was $12,331. A single person with income below that amount is considered poor. The poverty threshold for a family of two adults and two children was $24,036. If the combined income of all family members was below that amount, all people in that family would be considered poor.", "The current official poverty measure has existed for about 50 years and is widely used, but it does have limitations. For example, the official measure looks only at pre-tax money income and does not examine the impact of government taxes and non-cash benefits on family well-being. The official measure also generally does not take the value of assets into account, though a recent change in measurement now considers distributions from retirement savings as income. The official measure is also the same across the country, and does not take into consideration differences in living costs in different geographical areas. Additionally, the measure's current definition of family does not take into account modern resource-sharing arrangements, such as those of cohabiting couples. The Census Bureau now publishes a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) for research purposes that does take into account taxes and transfers, make adjustments for housing costs by geographical area, and use an expanded definition of family."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Many People Were Poor in 2015?", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had pre-tax money income below the poverty threshold.

The report also shows the central role of income from work in determining whether a group is over-represented among those living in poverty. For children, this income is based on the work of their parents or other family members. For working-age adults, it is their own work that generally determines their poverty status. For aged adults, who are often retired from the workforce, it is primarily their past work or the work of those they live with that determines their status. However, sometimes earnings from work are not enough to prevent poverty. Two-thirds of children living in poverty in 2015 were in families with at least one adult earning income during the year. In 2015, more than seven out of ten poor aged persons had some form of work-based income.", "The complexity of circumstances that result in individuals experiencing poverty\u2014both individual and systemic\u2014are beyond the scope of this report.
