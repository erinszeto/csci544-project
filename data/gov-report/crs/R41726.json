This report, by illustrating trends in broad budgetary categories, provides a starting point for discussions about fiscal priorities. Other CRS products analyze spending trends in specific functional areas. Functional categories (e.g., national defense, agriculture, etc.) provide a means to compare federal funding for activities within broad policy areas that often cut across several federal agencies. Subfunction categories provide a finer division of funding levels within narrower policy areas. Budget function categories are used within the budget resolution and for other purposes, such as estimates of tax expenditures. Spending in this report is measured and illustrated in terms of discretionary budget authority as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Measuring spending as a percentage of GDP in effect controls for inflation and population increases. A flat line on such graphs indicates that spending has increased at the same rate as overall economic growth. In some cases, rescissions, offsetting receipts, or budgetary scorekeeping adjustments can result in negative budget authority.", "Discretionary spending is provided and controlled through appropriations acts, which provide budget authority to federal agencies to fund many of the activities commonly associated with such federal government functions as running executive branch agencies, congressional offices and agencies, and international operations of the government. Essentially all spending on federal wages and salaries is discretionary. Administrative costs for entitlement programs such as Social Security are generally funded by discretionary spending, while mandatory spending\u2014not shown in figures presented in this report\u2014generally funds the benefits provided through those programs. For some federal programs, such as surface transportation, the division of funding into discretionary and mandatory categories can be complex.", "Spending caps and budget enforcement mechanisms established in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25; BCA) strongly affected recent budgets. The BCA set discretionary spending caps on defense (budget function 050) and non-defense funding and created a formula to lower those caps to achieve a portion of spending cuts called for in the BCA. Congress modified BCA caps several times, first for FY2013 as part of the fiscal cliff deal at the start of January 2013 (American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012; P.L. 112-240), then through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA2013; P.L. 113-67) and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74), thus avoiding decreases in levels of discretionary funding.

For example, rapid growth in national defense and other security spending during the past decade, along with the fiscal consequences and responses to the 2007-2009 Great Recession, has played an important role in fiscal discussions. Since FY2010, base defense discretionary spending has essentially been held flat and non-defense discretionary spending has been reduced significantly.

For some program areas, such as surface transportation, the division of expenditures into discretionary and mandatory categories can be complex.", "Discretionary spending in this report is measured in terms of BA. Budget authority for an agency has been compared to having funds in a checking account. Funds are available, subject to congressional restrictions, and can be used to enter into obligations such as contracts or hiring personnel. Outlays occur when the U.S. Treasury disburses funds to honor those obligations. Thus, outlays follow BA with a lag. For personnel costs, lags are generally short and outlays mostly occur in the same year that BA is provided. For large and complex projects, outlays may be spread over several years. Nearly all budget authority eventually results in outlays, although some major federal initiatives were later curtailed or cancelled, resulting in the rescission of BA. For instance, most funding for the Carter Administration's synthetic fuels program and the Obama Administration's plans for high-speed rail did not result in outlays.", "In some cases, changes in funding levels recorded in historical budget data reflect changes in budgetary concepts or the budgetary treatment of some types of spending.

Imposition of an initial set of discretionary caps was estimated to save about $900 billion over 10 years. A bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, popularly known as the \"Super Committee,\" was charged with developing a plan to reduce deficits by $1.2 trillion or more.

Those revised caps were to be lowered in each year by an amount calculated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) according to a formula designed to achieve a pro-rated share of the $1.2 trillion that a Joint Select Committee plan did not achieve. An annual sequester of non-exempt mandatory spending accounts also contributes to those savings.", "The spending trajectory implied by those backup enforcement measures implied discretionary base defense spending would revert to a level slightly above its FY2007 level in real dollar terms (i.e., adjusting for inflation but not for growth in population or the economy), while non-defense discretionary spending would revert to a level near its 2003 level. Discretionary spending as a share of GDP, if BCA caps remain in place, would decline to levels well below those seen in recent decades.

Conversely, the budgetary costs of federal loan programs, which required upfront federal disbursements, did not reflect future repayments.

Discretionary funding for water resources projects has, by and large, declined as a percentage of GDP since the mid-1970s, as Figure 11 indicates. That decline has been attributed to a number of reasons. Presidents Carter and Reagan both targeted perceived excesses in federal spending on water resources projects during their terms in office and were reluctant to agree to new project authorizations and spending without corresponding alterations to federal cost-sharing policies. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA; P.L. 99-662 ) made changes requiring greater contributions from local governments that benefit from federal water infrastructure. Those changes included reductions in the federal share of project costs, and combined with the aforementioned reduced emphasis on new water resources infrastructure in general, led to a decrease in water resources spending. Overall spending on these projects has also declined as agency focus has shifted away from construction of new projects. In 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation, which built large federal dams and water projects throughout the West during the 20 th century, acknowledged a shift in its focus from development and construction of water projects to management of water resources.", "Forest Service funding, including costs of responding to forest fires, along with funding for the DOI Bureau of Land Management, are the largest items within the conservation and land management (302) budget subfunction.", "In FY2009, ARRA supported large supplemental increases in funding for multiple federal agencies, including EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, for water projects within the pollution control and abatement subfunction.
