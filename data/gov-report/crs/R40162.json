Others dispute this contention. Additionally, considerable implementation issues also arise, such as \"which periodicals should receive these subsidies?\"", "Since 1792, Congress has provided periodical mailers with reduced rates that are lower than their delivery costs.

Senders of other types of mail, such as first-class letters, have paid rates that covered the revenue shortfall of periodicals.", "In 2007, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) restructured the postage rate schedule to more accurately peg periodical rates to their delivery costs. The postage paid by some periodical mailers jumped dramatically and their postage subsidies fell. Later that same year, the PRC established the new rate-setting system mandated by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA; P.L. 109-435; 120 Stat. 3198-3263). The system requires each class of mail to bear its \"direct and indirect costs,\" but it also includes a rate cap that forbids the USPS from raising postage rates by more than the rate of inflation, except in \"extraordinary or exceptional circumstances.\" The long-term effects of the new rate schedule and rate-setting system on periodicals subsidies are unclear.

The aforementioned factors are not the only factors that have negatively affected the survival of periodicals.

The Post Office Act of 1792 (1 Stat. 238) set the postage charged to the recipients of newspapers lower than the postage charged to the recipients of letters. In 1794, Congress expanded this subsidy to include magazines, although the postage on magazines was not set as low as the postage on newspapers (1 Stat. 362).", "These subsidies were problematic for the Post Office. It struggled to collect postage from mail recipients, who often balked at paying, and suffered significant costs from carrying periodicals. According to one estimate, by 1801, \"newspapers constituted 45 percent of all pieces mailed, but defrayed a mere eight percent of the [Post Office's] costs.\" The Post Office's costs exceeded its revenues, so each year, Congress appropriated funds to cover the costs not provided for by postage.", "The Post Office's periodicals revenue problem continued unabated until 1874, when Congress enacted a statute that required publishers to prepay postage (18 Stat. 232).

First, some Members of Congress reasoned that if citizens were to play their role in a democratic republic, they needed to have information on matters affecting the nation. Telegraphs, radio, and other modern information technologies did not yet exist. Newspapers were a means to provide information to the geographically dispersed members of the public so they might ably discharge their duties as citizens. Second, publishers, who gained increased readerships through subsidized delivery, actively lobbied Congress and, by editorial and other means, could attempt to unseat Members who voted contrary to the publishers' interests. Third, as the newly formed political parties developed, Congress saw the mails as a means for getting their message out and winning elections.", "This national policy of subsidizing newspapers was problematic, though, because it did not clearly define what constituted a newspaper. Postmasters general and postal employees were obliged to work out definitions themselves on the fly. Some Post Office officials thought a publication's format was conclusive\u2014if it was printed on a single sheet of large paper, it was a newspaper. Others at the Post Office looked to the publication's contents or frequency of publication.", "Seeing the incentives available, advertisers produced advertisements that looked like newspapers and magazines in order to receive the periodicals postage subsidy. Over the course of the 19 th century, Congress and the Post Office sought a policy that would clearly distinguish between publications with contents worthy and unworthy of government postage subsidies. In 1852, Congress reworked the postage rate schedule to provide the same subsidized postal rates for newspapers, magazines, and circulars (10 Stat. 38-39). Congress enacted other incremental alterations in 1863 (12 Stat. 705), 1872 (17 Stat. 300), and 1874 (18 Stat. 233), which set higher postal rates for other \"printed matter,\" such as advertisements, and, critically, required mailers of periodicals to prepay postage. The Post Office was no longer obliged to attempt to collect postage from mail recipients.", "Despite these efforts, the Post Office continued to be inundated with non-periodical mail pieces that mailers wished to send at subsidized periodicals postage rates. They could do this because the laws governing the mails simply did not provide a clear distinction between periodicals and non-periodicals.", "With the Post Office's support, Congress further refined postal classifications. An 1876 statute distinguished advertising mail from periodicals by referring to the former as a \"publication designed primarily for advertising\" (19 Stat. 82). Three years later, Congress enacted a significant reclassification of mail types and postage (20 Stat. 358-361). The statute limited periodical or second-class mail to \"printed paper sheets, without board, cloth, leather, or substantial binding.\" It required a publisher seeking a periodical postage rate to register the publication with the Post Office, which would certify that the printed matter met the new statutory criteria for second-class mail. By law, a periodical had to be published at regular, stated intervals, and be addressed to a particular subscriber (e.g., John Q. Public, 74 Further Lane), not the household (Resident, 74 Further Lane).", "The 1879 law also included a provision that attempted to distinguish periodicals from non-periodicals based on content. While a periodical was permitted to carry advertisements, its total contents had to be devoted primarily to \"information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the sciences, arts, or some special industry\" (20 Stat. 359). Reduced postage rates, then, would not be limited only to magazines that carried information directly relevant to government, policy, and politics.", "Mail pieces that failed to meet the second-class criteria were charged the higher third-class postal rates levied on pamphlets, books, and other printed matter. Underlying the 1876 and 1879 laws' distinction between periodical mail and advertising mail was a principle enunciated by Arthur H. Bissell, an attorney for the Post Office\u2014postage on periodicals that benefited the nation by informing the public on useful matters might justifiably be subsidized by taxpayers. However, \"the government should not carry at a loss to itself publications which are simply private advertising schemes.\" Despite these efforts to limit access to subsidized periodicals postage, some publishers still attempted to pass off non-periodicals as such.", "During the first seventy years of the 20 th century, Congress little altered the postal laws that provided reduced rates for periodicals. Congress did expand the range of mailers whose publications could qualify for periodical postage rates even if they did not meet the legal standards for what constituted a periodical. Fraternal groups, religious organizations, and not-for-profit entities were permitted to mail their publications at the reduced periodicals postage rates (28 Stat 104-105; 37 Stat. 551; and 40 Stat. 328). Some lauded these expansions of the availability of subsidized periodical postage, while others expressed concerns over the utility of these policies.", "Congress also further refined the postal laws to distinguish editorial from advertising content. In 1917, Congress bifurcated the postage rates paid by periodicals. Mailers would be charged one rate for the editorial portion of the periodical, and a higher rate for the advertising portion (40 Stat. 328). In 1951, Congress enacted a statute that prohibited providing periodicals postage rates to any publications \"having more than 75 per centum advertising in more than one-half of its issues during any twelve-month period\" (65 Stat. 762).", "In 1960, Congress enacted a statute to recodify the nation's postal laws.

Thus, the PRC recommended rates that would increase periodicals rates 11.8 percent. Additionally, the PRC held that the periodicals postage schedule should identify more of the \"cost drivers\" within USPS's mail handling process.

However, neither the law nor the PRC's rules require periodicals or any other market dominant product to cover a particular percentage of these institutional costs.", "Third, the PAEA contains provisions that clearly favor the continued subsidization of periodicals as a class of mail.

Postage may not be increased more than the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) (120 Stat. 3202-3203). Thus far, it appears that both the PRC and the USPS strongly respect the PAEA's rate cap. On February 11, 2008, the USPS filed its first notice of increased postage for market dominant products. The Postal Service proposed to raise postage beginning May 12, 2008. It sought to increase periodicals postage 2.71%, an amount beneath the CPU-U of 2.9%.

During 2008, the monthly CPI-U has been between 3.0% and 4.5%. The USPS is experiencing financial distress and operating deficits, due in part to a decline in mail volume. If the USPS's revenues continue to drop significantly and its operating costs increase, the USPS may argue that it is experiencing an \"extraordinary and exceptional circumstance\" that would justify raising the postage of periodicals and other market dominant products sharply. It is unclear whether the PRC would agree and accede to such an argument. Nor is it clear whether the PRC would interpret the law to permit the USPS to raise periodicals postage at a rate higher than that charged to other mail classes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations and Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Over the long-term, it is unclear whether the periodicals postage subsidy will increase or decrease. To date, the new rate schedule and the PAEA have not had any obvious effects on the periodicals postage subsidy. A PRC analysis found that in FY2007 periodicals postage revenues covered only 83% of the class's attributable costs, a shortfall of $448 million, and made no contribution toward the USPS's institutional costs.", "Government provision of postage subsidies for periodicals long has been a contentious issue because it involves disputed principles and vexing implementation issues. Some persons argue that periodicals play a unique role in a representative democracy, that they provide for a flow of information and ideas that benefit the nation. Adherents of this viewpoint argue that this special role means that periodicals deserve subsidization, and that this role was recognized by PRA, which requires USPS to \"have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people\" (39 U.S.C. 101(a)).", "Not everyone agrees with this policy. Some persons contest the purported contribution of periodicals to the public weal or suggest that other means of information transmission, such as the telephone, television, and the World Wide Web are at least equally effective. Still other individuals take the position that fairness requires that each mailer should pay his or her total postage costs.", "Meanwhile, other observers accept the importance of periodicals to a representative democracy, but suggest that actuating this idea into a policy has been an overly complex undertaking. As the above review of postage subsidy policy indicates, none has worked perfectly. Postage subsidies policies inevitably have raised two contentious questions: (1) Which periodicals should receive these subsidies?; and (2) Who should pay for these subsidies? The sheer diversity and plenitude of periodicals\u2014from The Atlantic Monthly to People to Sports Illustrated to Zymurgy \u2014has made enacting periodical postage subsidies a challenging and, frequently, expensive undertaking.", "Should Congress wish to consider attempting to assist periodicals publishers, it may wish to consider the following seven issues:", "(1) Are the conditions that are negatively affecting periodicals likely to continue?", "(2) Does the closure of some periodicals negatively affect the health of the U.S.'s democratic republic?", "(3) Is the transformation of periodicals from paper publications to online publications a positive or negative development?", "(4) Would increased postage subsidies greatly decrease the probability that more publishers will cease publication?", "(5) Would some other form of governmental aid\u2014such as below market loans\u2014be more helpful to periodicals publishers?", "(6) Should government assistance be provided to all periodicals regardless of their editorial subject matter (e.g., government and politics, celebrity news, sports, and hobbies)?", "(7) If periodicals should be further subsidized, what should be the goal of that subsidy? Should it cover the shortfall between periodicals postage revenues and periodicals attributable costs? Or should it also provide a contribution toward periodicals institutional costs?"], "subsections": []}]}}
