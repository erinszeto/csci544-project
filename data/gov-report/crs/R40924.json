In recent years, China has become the world's largest automotive producer, with annual vehicle output of over 18 million units in 2011. China is now also the world's biggest market for automobile sales. Meanwhile, China's auto sector development and policies have caused concerns in the United States, from automotive trade, China's failure to effectively enforce trade agreements and laws, to market barriers and government policies that increasingly favor Chinese manufacturers, which could affect business operations and prospects of international companies doing business in (or with) China.", "China's auto industry has developed extensively through foreign direct investment, which has come in the form of alliances and joint ventures between international automobile manufacturers and Chinese partners. These international automobile manufacturers, who generally dominate the higher end of the Chinese market, have focused on making cars for China's large and fast-growing market. The domestic Chinese automakers, who occupy the lower end of the market, struggle to improve design and quality to expand sales overseas.", "China exports and imports relatively few vehicles. Most of the cars produced in China stay in China and its vehicle exports are mostly light trucks and passenger cars shipped to developing country markets. Automotive trade between the United States and China has increased in recent years, primarily in auto parts. In 2011, the United States imported over $12 billion in auto parts from China, making it the second-largest source of auto parts for U.S. imports (behind only Japan). Many of these imported parts are aimed at the aftermarket, as most of what China exports to the U.S. market now are standard products such as brake parts and electrical parts. But with high rates of investment and growth in China by the leading U.S. manufacturers of both cars and parts, major motor vehicle companies are increasingly sourcing parts from China.", "There have been a number of auto sector trade disputes between the United States and China, addressing issues such as China's implementation of its WTO obligations, failure to implement an effective IPR enforcement regime, market barriers such as high tariffs on vehicle imports, export restrictions of raw materials such as rare earths, and various forms of government assistance to domestic auto and parts companies, such as tire producers.", "An emerging issue is that the Chinese government's policies and measures are becoming increasingly restrictive towards foreign auto companies, while at the same time giving preferential support to its domestic car makers. As the central government designates clean-energy vehicles and their components as one of the seven \"strategic and emerging\" industries (in which it aspires to become a world leader), foreign companies, such as GM, reportedly have been pressured to transfer technology and/or help their Chinese partners to develop these new technologies. These new restrictions and conditions imposed by the Chinese government have caused concerns among global auto companies regarding the business environment in China and how these measures may affect their business operations, growth plans, and competitiveness.", "This report provides an overview of China's auto sector development: vehicle production, sales, market drivers, foreign and domestic manufacturers, and automotive trade.

", "While the U.S. automotive market was impacted by the global economic downturn that started in late 2008 and throughout 2010, the Chinese auto market has been growing rapidly. It has been a bright spot for foreign auto makers with a presence in China, such as General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen (VW). Spurred by the central government's stimulus spending and financial incentives to encourage vehicle ownership, the Chinese vehicle production was over 18 million units each in 2010 and 2011. In the span of just a few years, China has become the world's top auto producer and also the biggest auto sales market. ", "It is not clear whether China will mainly consume automobiles in its own market, take a more aggressive export-oriented approach similar to that of Japan and Korea, or create some mixture of these two. Industry data and forecasts suggest that China may take a hybrid approach that focuses on domestic consumption while also building vehicles for export in order to induce Chinese companies to produce world class cars. Additionally, China's automotive parts manufacturing sector is export focused, increasingly complex, and rapidly moving from low-cost to more value-added production. ", "As China becomes a bigger player in the global auto market, its impact on the domestic U.S. industry could increase. So far the most significant impact may be in automotive parts exported into the United States. While U.S.-China trade in motor vehicles is relatively limited, and likely to remain so for the short- to medium-term, bilateral trade in auto parts has grown significantly since 2001.", "The Obama Administration has taken direct measures to address U.S.-China automotive trade, such as the tariffs on Chinese tires. However, as China becomes a top automotive manufacturer and a major consumer market, there are lingering concerns about the conditions under which U.S. manufacturers must compete with Chinese firms both in and outside China, including the domestic U.S. market. These concerns have focused on such issues as", "China's export restrictions on certain raw materials, including rare earths, which are necessary for many auto parts production, including those for use in hybrid and electric cars; China's incomplete implementation of its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization, especially with respect to domestic content rules, protection of non-Chinese firms' intellectual property rights, and technology transfer requirements; the extent to which Chinese firms are subsidized or otherwise supported and protected by the government when they compete with foreign companies domestically and with imports into China; and the implications of China's recently announced restrictions on foreign carmakers' expansion in China amid the government's efforts to promote domestic producers, for example, how they may affect U.S. auto companies' profitability and business prospects in China.", "This report provides an overview of China's auto sector development, including vehicle production, sales, market drivers, manufacturers, and automotive trade.

Although the automotive industry has always been viewed as a strategic sector to move the country into the modern industrial age, it did not substantially develop until the late 1980s, after Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping came to power and moved the country toward economic and trade liberalization. In 1988, after a visit to China and its fledgling automotive industry, then-Chrysler Corporation CEO Lee Iacocca is said to have reflected that China's modernization process would be, \"A long haul. A very long haul.\" ", "Since the late 1980s, Chinese vehicles have become increasingly sophisticated as a result of partnerships with major foreign automakers (e.g., VW, GM, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Hyundai, and Kia) designed to foster \"cooperation in technology development.\" An activist government policy has liberalized the Chinese automotive sector in some key respects such as permitting foreign investment, but it requires foreign manufacturers to undertake joint ventures with local partners in order to obtain market access. The stated goal of the Chinese government then was to create a market dominated by a limited number of internationally competitive joint venture assemblers, supplied by local parts manufacturers, and producing to world standards.", "After nearly three decades of rapid economic growth, the domestic Chinese auto industry has made substantial progress. Many independent domestic automotive manufacturers have emerged and have ambitions to become global auto companies. Although they have to overcome hurdles, such as creating their own designs and meeting world standards in terms of product quality, safety, and environmental features, the domestic manufacturers are expanding their market share and are slowly moving up the value chain.", "China's annual vehicle output increased from less than 2 million vehicles in the late 1990s to over 18 million in 2011. Its auto industry is already a major force propelling the Chinese economy and its workforce, with an annual gross output of more than Rmb 3 trillion yuan (approximately $ 440 billion) in 2009 and over 3.7 million workers in automotive production, according to China's auto industry association and official."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "China Becomes a Top Motor Vehicle Producer", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The World Leader in Vehicle Output", "paragraphs": [" Figure 1 illustrates the speed with which China has become one of the world's top automotive manufacturers. China first produced more than 2 million vehicles, of all types, in 2000. Since then, it surpassed South Korea (in 2002) and France (not shown on graph, in 2003). With nearly 5.8 million units of total production in 2005, China approached the production level of Germany, Europe's largest national producer and then-number three in the world, and eventually, overtook Germany for third place in 2006. Since then, China's vehicle production has accelerated, passing the 7 million mark in 2006 and approaching 9 million units in 2007.", "From late 2008 throughout 2009, with the global economy mired in an economic slowdown, global vehicle production dropped more than 10 million units in 2009 from the record high of over 72 million units built in 2007. The impact of the downturn was particularly pronounced for U.S. automakers, with two major U.S. companies, GM and Chrysler, filing for bankruptcy and restructuring their operations. China's automotive industry, on the other hand, showed considerable strength and continued to expand. With an output of 9.5 million vehicles in 2008, China overtook the United States in total vehicle production for the first time and became the second-largest motor vehicle producer\u2014trailing only Japan, which produced 11.6 million vehicles that year. ", "An economic stimulus package initiated by the government in 2008 enabled China's auto industry to continue its rapid growth in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, China produced more than 13.6 million vehicles, overtaking Japan to be the world's largest producer. In 2010, the growth momentum continued, bringing China's vehicle production to nearly 18.3 million units, almost doubling its 2008 output. Moreover, among the leading vehicle producers, China has been the only one showing substantial and continuous growth in production levels since 2000, though its growth seems to have flattened in 2011. ", "Auto sectors in other parts of the world didn't fare as well during the economic crisis. At the pre-recession level in 2005, North America and Western Europe each produced more than three times as many vehicles as China. Between 2005 and 2009, however, total U.S. production was halved to 5.7 million units; Canada also registered a net decline of over 1 million units. Even Mexican production, which appeared to be the most resilient among the North American carmakers, saw a slight decrease of over 100,000 units between 2005 and 2009. In 2010 and 2011, the United States auto sector started to recovery, finishing in 2011 as the second-largest auto producing country, behind China. For carmakers in Europe (after an increase in production between 2004 and 2007), overall production dropped by about 6 million units in 2009 from the 2007 level. ", "Japan, formerly the largest motor vehicle producer, had shown relatively little overall growth in production before being affected by the global recession. This was, in part, because of a domestic economic slowdown that has lasted for nearly two decades, the strengthening of the yen, and increased production in overseas manufacturing plants. Its total output has stagnated at around 10 million vehicles per year between 2000 and 2003. Strengthening exports, including to China and the United States, led to an increase to about 11.6 million units of production each in 2007 and 2008. In 2009, hit by global economic crisis, Japan's auto production dropped to below 8 million units. Production level slowly recovered in 2010, and then dropped again in 2011 to below 8 million units, in part because of the severe earthquake and tsunami that hit northern Japan in March 2011, which had an immediate impact on the auto industry. ", "Among the developing nations, China's increase in output has also placed it far ahead of other countries that are considered as actual or potential major automotive producers. In the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), which showcase emerging economies, there has been considerable growth in automotive production (see Figure 2 ). However, the combined net growth of vehicle production in these other three BRIC countries between 2000 and 2011 was only slightly over a quarter of the total volume growth in China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing Composition of Production", "paragraphs": ["Along with the volume of vehicles, product composition of Chinese motor vehicle output is also changing toward meeting growing domestic consumer demand for personal vehicles, notably passenger cars. This is closer to the model of production seen in a mature industrial market than in a developing economy. It is also an indication that, as per capita income grows rapidly, especially in the coastal regions and big inland cities, personal vehicles are no longer seen as luxury items exclusively for the privileged few.", "In the mid-1990s, out of a total annual output of 1.2 million vehicles, China produced 300,000 passenger cars, with trucks and buses accounting for the majority of the output. The United States in the 1990s also produced more trucks than passenger cars. But in the U.S. case, trucks overwhelmingly consisted of minivans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, which were generally considered being more for personal use. In China, however, the \"truck\" category in the 1990s was much more oriented toward heavy duty and mass transit equipment, while the \"bus\" category appears to include at least some types of minivans. As late as 2004, combined truck and bus production in China was still slightly higher than output of passenger cars. ", "Although there are differences in vehicle categorization, a key indicator for China's auto industry is the rise of the share of production devoted to passenger cars. Figure 3 shows that production of passenger cars started to rise consistently after 2000.", "Prior to 2000, China's leading automakers were joint-venture partners with foreign automobile companies, with product mix and output subject to bureaucratic intervention and negotiations\u2014a process well documented in the book Beijing Jeep . But this began to change, as noted in Ward's 2001 Automotive Yearbook:", "In years past, the Chinese government would decide what product would best suit a proposed automotive joint venture, usually a 50/50 partnership between a global automaker and a state-run Chinese firm. Although the products often were ill-suited to market conditions, multinational automakers agreed to build them in order to get a foothold in the potentially high-volume Chinese market.... In 2000, China granted the wishes of many global automakers, allowing them to build small, affordable vehicles\u2014known as \"people's cars\"\u2014for the domestic market.", "The liberalization of product regulations undoubtedly positioned China for long-term growth in the private car ownership market. The country's pending entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) was expected to open the market even further for private consumers and ensure a big pay-off for companies waiting to tap China's boundless potential.", "China's passenger car output increased slowly from a quarter of total motor vehicle production in 1994 (not shown in Figure 3 ) to about 30% in 2000-2001. After that, passenger car output drove rapid motor vehicle production growth. As overall output increased from an annual range of 600,000 to 700,000 vehicles to over 5 million annually by 2004, nearly 50% of total production was passenger cars by that year (see Figure 3 ).

The first wave of car buyers appeared in China's large cities along the prosperous eastern seaboard, where vehicle ownership surged around 2000. Five years later, the car market took off in the smaller coastal urban areas and major inland cities. ", "The growth in vehicle sales in China slowed in 2008, reflecting the weakened state of the domestic economy and low consumer confidence amid a global economic downturn. In response, the Chinese government introduced several policy measures (as part of the aforementioned economic stimulus) to boost car sales, including a number of subsidies to consumers, lower purchase taxes, and expansion of bank credit to encourage lending (see Text Box ). These incentives, which were initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2009, were extended to 2010 and further propelled vehicle sales to over 18 million units in 2010.", "A number of factors are likely to drive market demand in the next few years:", "Market potential arises from China's relatively low rate of car ownership, which stood at about 30 cars per 1,000 people. This ratio is low compared with a global average of 120 per 1,000 and 700 to 800 per 1,000 in the United States. China's rapid economic growth and rising personal income, particularly in big cities, will likely continue to fuel the demand for personal motor vehicles. Since 2002, both foreign and domestic carmakers have expanded production capacity in China in anticipation of continued strong demand growth. This has generated significant competition and made vehicles more affordable. For example, average car prices across China in 2007 dropped by nearly 6% from 2006, while the per capita income of urban residents increased by 12.2%, to $1,942. With more products available at competitive prices, car ownership could continue to expand rapidly among the expanding middle-class. Another factor resulting in greater demand for cars is the improvement and expansion of China's road network. China has been investing heavily in improving its highway network. According to an industry report, by the end of 2010, China had about 74,000 kilometers (km, approximately 45,982 miles) of high-speed roads (expressway), making it one of the largest motorway systems in the world.

In August of 2010, China recorded what is described as its worst traffic jam in history, when road work and a high volume of commercial vehicles clogged a highway north of Beijing for over 10 days, stretching as long as 100 kilometers (approximately 62.14 miles) at one point. ", "Parking has become another major headache for drivers in big Chinese cities. Since many residential communities were built before the boom in car ownership, parking spots are scarce. The construction of public parking lots as well as roadside parking spots has not kept up with the growth of cars on the road. It is reported that the number of cars in Beijing has more than doubled within the last decade to 5 million, but there are only an estimated 740,000 spaces for parking.", "In 2011, some municipal governments, including Beijing, moved to limit new vehicle registrations in order to ease traffic congestion. Shanghai, the country's wealthiest metropolis, began auctioning license plates as early as 1994. About 8,000 to 9,000 license plates are auctioned monthly, according to a Wall Street Journal report, at an average price of $6,000 or more. In March 2012, one weekly average bid for a new Shanghai license plate reached $9,380. The city of Shanghai also bans vehicles with non-Shanghai plates from highways at rush hour.
