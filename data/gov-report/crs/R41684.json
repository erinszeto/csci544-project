The incident disabled the facility and led to a full evacuation before the platform sank into the Gulf on April 22, 2010. A significant release of oil at the sea floor was soon discovered.

Some identified responsible parties, including BP, have entered in civil and/or criminal settlements with the federal government (see Text Box below).

", "CWA Section 311 authorizes certain civil judicial penalties to the owner, operator, or person in charge of a vessel, onshore facility, or offshore facility for violations of that provision. A civil judicial penalty applies to a violation of the CWA prohibition on discharging oil into navigable waters of the United States. The monetary penalty for this violation may be up to $37,500 per day of violation, or up to $1,100 per barrel discharged. If the violation is deemed a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the penalty is not less than $140,000 for the violation, nor more than $4,300 per barrel discharged. No such negligence determination has been made in connection with the 2010 oil spill.", "According to the most recent estimate from the federal government, the 2010 oil spill resulted in a discharge of approximately 206 million gallons (4.9 million barrels) in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the responsible parties are reportedly disputing this estimate. Moreover, an estimated 17% of the 4.9 million barrels did not enter the Gulf environment, but was directly recovered from the wellhead by BP. It is unknown whether this portion of the oil will be counted in a potential CWA penalty determination. ", "The $1,100 to $4,300 per-barrel range is the basis of the oft-cited judicial penalty range for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill: $4.5 billion to $21.5 billion. The low end of this range is achieved by multiplying 4.1 million barrels (amount of discharge after removing the 17% directly captured by BP) by $1,100/ barrel. The upper end of the range is achieved by multiplying 4.9 million barrels (total discharge amount) by the maximum penalty of $4,300/barrel, which presumes a determination of either gross negligence or willful misconduct. ", "In addition, when determining the amount of the judicial penalty, CWA Section 311(b)(8) states that \"the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator, the Secretary [of Homeland Security], or the court, as the case may be,\" must consider the following factors:", "1. the seriousness of the violation or violations, 2. the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, 3. the degree of culpability involved, 4. any other penalty for the same incident, 5. any history of prior violations, 6. the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, 7. the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and 8. any other matters as justice may require.", "Therefore, the judicial civil penalty for the incident could be less than the low end of the above range ($4.5 billion), even if gross negligence or willful misconduct is determined.
