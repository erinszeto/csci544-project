Under the provisions of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), states must prepare plans that reduce either total CO2 emissions or emission rates at affected EGUs. When implemented, EPA projects the state plans will reduce CO2 emissions from U.S. power generation approximately 32% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.", "EPA prepared state-specific CO2 emissions rates based on newly established national performance standards and the state's existing power generation portfolio.

BB 2 substitutes generation from (lower-emitting) existing natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) units for generation from (higher-emitting) steam generating units. BB 3 has generation from new (zero-emitting) renewable energy generating capacity replacing generation from fossil fuel-fired generating units.", "EPA has modeled potential implications of the CPP in its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), and emphasizes demand-side energy efficiency (DSEE) as a potential low-cost option. While DSEE is not a part of the BSER (and is an \"outside the fence\" activity), EPA's RIA assumes DSEE can lower electricity demand and reduce electric system costs, thereby offsetting estimated electricity price increases. As a result, EPA projects lower average electricity bills nationally by 2030. EPA's RIA also estimates reduced electricity demand will lower natural gas consumption, even as more NGCC capacity may be called upon to back up increased intermittent and variable renewable electric generation. Increased dependence on renewable generation may require new transmission lines. Many of today's transmission projects awaiting regulatory approvals are intended to serve renewable electricity projects. It can take from 3 to 10 years to get the federal, state, and local permits to build a major electric transmission line; planning may need to begin now so that new lines will be in place for when they may be needed in the early 2020s. State decisions on the design and availability of DSEE programs may be crucial to attaining the levels of subscribership necessary to achieve the demand reductions projected in the RIA. For some states, attaining the levels of cost-effective DSEE projects needed to reduce CPP compliance costs may be a challenge, while for the top tier of states currently engaged in DSEE, the challenge may be identifying the next increment of cost-effective projects.", "Going forward, EPA's GHG regulations may provide a basis for the evolution of the U.S. electric power sector. EPA has based the CPP on increasing renewables as the technology of choice for new power generation. EPA declares in the CPP that states and affected EGUs can essentially use whatever methods they choose to meet CO2 emissions and emission-rate reductions in timeframes proposed, and in so doing, creates a plan it believes most states and affected EGUs may be able to comply with in the timeframe allowed.

Coal is also the fossil fuel which emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of electric power produced, averaging 216 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units (mmBTUs) of energy produced. By comparison, natural gas combustion releases about half the carbon emissions at 117 pounds of carbon dioxide per mmBTU of energy produced. ", "In a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court found in Massachusetts vs. EPA that GHG emissions were air pollutants which could be regulated under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA then moved in 2009 to declare that GHGs were a threat to public health and welfare in an \"endangerment\" finding, which served as a basis for subsequent actions from the agency.

In addition, states can meet their goals using an emission standard plan or a state measures plan. The \"emissions standard approach\" is based on the EGU-specific requirements so that all affected EGUs will meet their emission performance rates or equivalent mass-based goals. States can also choose a \"state measures approach\" using a mixture of state-enforceable measures (such as a renewable electricity standard and programs for improvement of energy efficiency) to achieve (on aggregate) equivalent emissions or emission rate reductions. If a state measures approach is chosen, the plan must also include a \"contingent backstop of federally enforceable emission standards for affected EGUs that fully meet the emission guidelines and that would be triggered if the plan failed to achieve the required emission reductions on schedule.\" ", "States will also be able to formulate their own plans to reduce CO 2 emissions (as opposed to using the BSER), and can use an integrated resource plan (IRP) or other method.

New power plants or increased utilization of existing NGCC capacity may require upgraded transmission facilities and potentially new natural gas infrastructure to provide fuel. Increased dependence on renewable generation will likely require new transmission lines, and many of today's transmission projects awaiting regulatory approvals are intended to serve renewable electricity projects.

Power plants in Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) regions operate in competitive environments where a power plant's operating and maintenance costs are not guaranteed recovery. Additional costs for plant upgrades may not be cost-effective under RTO electricity market regimes or prices, and state implementation plans for EPA's CPP may also result in differing requirements within RTO regions for competitive generators. Capacity markets designed to incentivize the construction of new generation in regions with competitive markets have had mixed results. New power plants will most likely be built in regions of the country with traditional regulation using tools like integrated resource planning, and rules allowing cost recovery from ratepayers for approved investments.

Building Block 2 would shift the dispatch of power generators to lower-emitting sources by increasing the scheduled operation of higher efficiency natural gas combined cycle units. Scheduling these plants more often would be expected to result in higher natural gas consumption. In addition, Building Block 3 requires the use of more zero-emitting renewable generation sources, which in many parts of the United States may require more natural gas consumption in fast-ramping power plants to make variable renewable electric generation more firm (i.e., provide power as renewable electric generation ebbs).", "However, increasing the use of natural gas for power generation raises some concerns, as deliverability and price volatility issues have emerged as recently as this past winter with the demand spikes associated with the Polar Vortex cold weather events. Recovery of costs from the Polar Vortex of January 2014 proved to be an issue for some utilities. ", "FERC is working to improve coordination between the electricity and natural gas industries. Major pipelines or local distribution companies have firm deliveries usually scheduled during nomination cycles, and often release unused natural gas to secondary markets. Electricity generators in competitive markets, where dispatch of generation is not certain, frequently obtain their natural gas from secondary markets. The utilization of more NGCC capacity (especially in the competitive markets) may require changes in the way fuel is obtained so that power generation can be guaranteed. More cost-effective, natural gas storage facilities may be required for electric power production purposes, if greater natural gas use for power generation is expected. However, the regulatory regime (i.e., Regional Transmission Organization markets or traditional regulation) in place will likely have a bearing on what choices are available to natural gas generators with regard to gas storage options or contracting for firm capacity vs. the \"just-in-time\" manner of natural gas deliveries traditionally available to power generators.", "The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave electricity producers vulnerable to price and supply volatility. EPA expects additional retirements of coal-fired power plants, with some new NGCC capacity likely built to replace retiring coal capacity. Nuclear power plants are also aging. Some plants expected to be in operation in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe could face premature retirement for a variety of reasons ranging from plant age to competitive electricity market fundamentals (wherein cost recovery is not guaranteed) or other conditions. Unless electricity storage capacity is increased or other concepts developed, natural gas will likely be used to smooth the variable output of some renewable electricity technologies.

While some dispatch of renewable generation is prioritized in some markets (assuming the resource is available), economic dispatch is generally the rule. Dispatch of intermittent renewables may also require the operation of higher cost natural gas units to firm up power (and thus compensate for the ebb and flow of the wind or solar resource).

While EPA observes that the cost of renewable electricity is declining in many areas, increasing renewable energy may require a continuation or expansion of state RPS policies which require a mandate for load-serving electric utilities to procure renewable electric generation. In most state jurisdictions, these electric utilities pass the costs of procuring renewable energy through to electric rate payers. Expanding renewable energy may therefore be a challenge in some state jurisdictions, if this means an increase in costs for ratepayers. In some states, utilities are excused from RPS requirements if these costs exceed specified limits.
