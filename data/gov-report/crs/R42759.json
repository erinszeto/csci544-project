Importantly, the Senate bill covers only crop years 2014-2018. It also suspends permanent price support authority under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1949, which would increase price supports well above current market levels and create substantial government outlays.

Similar to SCO, STAX sets a revenue guarantee based on expected county revenue (but not revenue or yield as under SCO). Producers could purchase this policy in addition to their individual crop insurance policy (as done for SCO) or as a stand-alone policy.

The 10-year savings from commodity programs in the House committee bill is $18.7 billion and savings in the Senate bill is $17.4 billion. In contrast to scoring savings under Title I, expenditures for crop insurance in both bills increase relative to baseline levels. The increase is about $4 billion lower in the Senate bill, in part because the new revenue program contains an option for a farm-level guarantee that is expected to reduce demand for crop insurance and offset some costs associated with the crop insurance changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impacts of S. 954 and H.R. 2642", "paragraphs": ["A number of researchers have analyzed the proposed changes made to the farm safety net by the Senate and House farm bills. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri concludes in an October 2013 sector-wide study that the economic consequences of the two bills would be similar in many respects, with reduced federal spending and relatively small effects on commodity markets. Comparing the two bills, FAPRI's analysis indicates that the House bill, given its parameters and structure, would provide substantially more support than the Senate bill to producers of rice, barley, and peanuts, while corn and soybean producers would benefit relatively more under the Senate bill. Actual program benefits will be sensitive to market conditions and producer participation, with government costs depending in part on eventual enrollment in the Supplemental Coverage Option (65% subsidy rate) and other factors. Under each bill, average net farm income would decline slightly as the sector would receive somewhat less federal support than under a continuation of 2008 farm bill programs. According to the study, impacts on food prices for consumers would be very small.", "A separate analysis by the Agricultural and Food Policy Center (AFPC) at Texas A&M University concludes that 53 of 64 of the representative farms (80%) that it models nationwide would receive greater financial benefits (i.e., higher average net cash farm income) under the House bill relative to the Senate bill over the life of the farm bill. The study reports that under a baseline price scenario, the average difference in net cash farm income as a result of differences in policy parameters would be $19,900 per farm, in favor of the House bill in cases when the House bill results in higher cash income than the Senate bill. A major driver is the attractive combination of reference prices (increased from 2008 farm bill levels) in the House bill\u2014which provide support through the Price Loss Coverage program when farm prices decline\u2014combined with the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) to address shallow losses beyond a 10% deductible. (In the Senate bill, the SCO deductible is expanded from 10% to 22% if the farmer also participates in Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)). Under a declining price scenario, the proportion of farms receiving greater financial benefits under the House bill declines to 74% compared with 80% under the baseline price scenario, primarily reflecting higher potential income for California rice producers under revenue guarantees in ARC compared with potential benefits under SCO, which is not designed to protect farmers against multi-year price declines.", "Other researchers have concluded that the SCO approach combined with the new revenue programs (ARC in the Senate bill and RLC in the House bill) could create situations of overcompensation for shallow losses (out-of-pocket costs absorbed by producers), while SCO alone is likely to result in fewer such concerns because it is integrated more closely with existing crop insurance coverage. The potential impact of a multi-year price decline is another major policy concern. The researchers point out that in the Senate bill, the ARC program guarantees will decline over time if market prices drop, which lengthens the adjustment period for producers. This is in contrast to the House bill (and Senate bill for rice and peanuts) which sets fixed minimum prices in the price and revenue programs. The House bill increases these parameters differently for each crop relative to their respective (and recent) market values, which the authors say could create planting incentives that differ from market signals, thereby shifting acreage toward crops that have more attractive program benefits. ", "Some have expressed concern that costs of farm programs could be sharply higher than CBO estimates. An analysis by university researchers and sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute estimates that the cost of the House farm bill would be relatively modest (about $1.1 billion) if farm prices remain historically high. However, it also concludes that the annual cost could exceed $18 billion if farm prices drop to a 15-year average level. Others have criticized the analysis, calling it \"an improbable price scenario,\" contrasting it with a stochastic scoring method used by CBO, which accounts for the probability of various price scenarios that result in either very high or low costs.", "Appendix A.
