On April 8, theState of Nevada exercised its authority under NWPA to disapprove the site. As a result of this state disapproval,the site may be approved only if a joint resolutionof repository siting approval becomes law after being passed by Congress during the first period of 90 days ofcontinuous session after the disapproval. Thisperiod appears likely to terminate just after the August recess.", "The Act establishes an expedited procedure for congressional consideration of this approval resolution. Pursuant to this expedited procedure, approval resolutionswere introduced in both houses and referred to the respective committees of jurisdiction, which had until the60th day of continuous session after the statedisapproval to report or be discharged. The House committee reported on May 1, and the Senate committee on June10.", "In the House, once an approval resolution has been on the calendar for 5 legislative days, a supporter may call it up if the Speaker recognizes him or her for thepurpose. After 2 hours of debate, the House then votes on the resolution without amendment or other interveningmotion. The House passed its resolution onMay 8. In the Senate, once such a resolution is on the calendar, any Senator may make a nondebatable motion toproceed to consider it. Normally, such a motionwould be offered by the majority leader. If rejected, the motion may be repeated. If adopted, the Senate debatesthe resolution for 10 hours (which may bereduced by nondebatable motion), after which a final vote occurs. The statutory procedure forestalls filibustersagainst the resolution by prohibiting mostintervening motions or other actions, but does not on its face preclude amendment of the resolution. An attemptto consider the measure in the Senate wasexpected in early July.", "After one house passes an approval resolution, the other takes up and debates its own measure, but takes a final vote on the measure received from the first house. This procedure facilitates clearing the resolution for presidential action. The Act provides for this action to occuronly if the two measures are identical, as thepresent House and Senate measures are. If the Senate resolution were to be amended, however, the terms of the Actwould apparently make this clearanceprocedure unavailable. An amended measure also would cease to have the form prescribed by the NWPA for anapproval resolution, and accordingly might fail toqualify for further action under the expedited procedure.", "Either house might overcome such difficulties by using its constitutional power over its own rules to alter the procedure by which it considered an approvalresolution.

The Constitution mandates that neither house adjourn for more than 3 days without the consentof the other. (10) Pursuant to this mandate, eachhouse recesses its session for more than 3 days only under authority of an adjournment resolution, which is aconcurrent resolution adopted by both houses. As aresult, the days not counted in the 90-day period will be only and exactly those included in any session recess ofeither house that is authorized by an adjournmentresolution.", "It is evident from this definition that actual days of continuous session can be counted with certainty only after the fact. Prospectively, the count can be only anestimate.

The Senate is scheduled to return from itsAugust recess the preceding Tuesday, and the House on the Wednesday. ", "Continuing Action in a New Session. If Congress adjourns its session sine die before the 90-day periodexpires, continuity of session is \"broken,\" meaning that a new period of continuous session begins with theconvening of the next session. (11) As a result, if a statenotice of disapproval were to be received less than 90 days of continuous session before a sine die adjournment, Congress would have until the 90th day ofcontinuous session in the following session to complete action under the statute. Because Congress is not scheduledto conclude its current session within 90 daysof session from the April 8 notice, these provisions are unlikely to come into play in the present instance.", "These provisions could come into play if Congress were to receive a disapproval notice late in a session of a Congress.

By contrast, if the notice were received late in a secondsession, the following session would be thefirst session of the next Congress.

Some discussion has occurred over whether it would beinappropriate for any Senator other than the majorityleader or his designee to offer a motion to proceed to consider the resolution pursuant to the statute. In practice, theSenate normally concedes to its majorityleader the prerogative of making motions to proceed to consider pursuant to the Standing Rules.

Although the statutory procedure prohibits amendment of the motion to proceed toconsider an approval resolution, and of the motion to reduce the time for debating one, it contains no provisionprecluding amendment of the approval resolutionitself. The Act does forbid a motion to recommit the resolution, which might have included amendatoryinstructions, (37) but does not explicitly prohibit theoffering of an amendment by other means, either from the floor or by recommendation of the reporting committee. It is unclear whether this omission wasdeliberate, though it may be noteworthy that Congress found it appropriate to include an explicit prohibition againstamendment for the House, but not for theSenate.", "On the other hand, it can be argued that the legislative history of the NWPA, as well as the overall purposes of expedited procedures generally, imply that theapproval resolution was intended not to be subject to amendment in either house. The close specification made bythe Act for the language of a resolution ofrepository siting approval might be cited in support of the same conclusion.

Like a permanent change in rules, a special rule takes the formof a resolution that the Committee on Ruleshas jurisdiction to report, and is considered under procedures that permit the House to vote to terminate debate, andpreclude amendment, after one hour. In thepast, the majority party leadership and Committee on Rules have often preferred that measures eligible for expeditedprocedures be considered instead underspecial rules. This form of consideration preserves to a greater degree the normal control of the leadership over flooraction.", "A special rule for consideration of a siting approval resolution could provide that after consideration of the House measure, an automatic final vote occur on anySenate measure approving the same site that the House might already have received, or even on one that it mightlater receive. Alternatively, it also would bewithin the scope of normal practice for a special rule to provide that the approval resolution be considered underan entirely different procedure from that specifiedin the Act. A special rule might, for example, provide that the resolution be called up immediately or in thediscretion of the Speaker, provide for or prohibitamendment, shorten or lengthen the time for debate, alter the division and control of that time, or permit or waivethe application of certain points of order, as theleadership and the Committee found appropriate. ", "The House also often supersedes the procedures otherwise applicable to the consideration of a specific measure by considering the measure pursuant to a motionto suspend the rules. A motion to suspend the rules and pass a measure is subject to 40 minutes' debate, precludesfloor amendment, and requires a two-thirds'vote. Finally, the House could consider an approval resolution by unanimous consent, and the unanimous consentrequest might include a specification of termsof consideration.", "The Senate normally establishes modified or altered procedures for the consideration of a specific measure only by unanimous consent. It is normally consideredthe prerogative of the majority leader to propound requests for unanimous consent for such purposes. The Senateoften uses unanimous consent agreements of thiskind to restrict or even prohibit amendments to a specified measure, and sometimes to provide that final action ona companion measure received from the Houseoccur automatically. In contentious situations, such as may likely accompany consideration of a siting approvalresolution, however, unanimous consent to anagreement regulating consideration in such ways may be difficult to obtain. ", "Senate rules also include a procedure, little known today, for suspending specified rules in relation to action on a given measure. Although such a motion couldpresumably be used in relation to statutory provisions operating as rules, it appears ill adapted for this purpose. Senate rules impose no time limit on considerationof a motion to suspend the rules, so that it could be subjected to filibuster, delaying or blocking the attempt toestablish any modified procedure for acting on theapproval resolution. As in the House, suspension of the rules in the Senate requires a two-thirds' vote. (41)", "Interpreting Rules Through Application. In recent times, the Senate has more often exercised its power todetermine the intent and effect of its rules by voting on procedural questions either submitted to it by the chair, orarising through appeals of rulings of the chair. If a floor amendment were offered to an approval resolution, for example, the Senate might decide, on appeal, thatthe statute implicitly forbade such amendments. If an amendment to the resolution were adopted, the Senate might in the same way decide that the amended statutestill qualified for further consideration underthe expedited procedure. ", "This course of action would presumably not be subject to filibuster, because the statute requires that all appeals on questions raised during consideration of anapproval resolution be settled without debate. Action of the Senate in this form, however, would not merelydetermine the application of the rule in the particularsituation in which the question was raised. Because the Senate possesses ultimate authority to determine its ownrules, its decision on a question such as thiswould establish precedent. It would conclusively establish the general meaning of the statutory provision, subjectto revision only by subsequent action of theSenate itself.", "In principle, the House might engage in similar proceedings, but in practice that chamber has a strong tradition of deferring to the rulings of its Speaker onprocedural questions. A point of order might be raised, for example, that the statutory procedure for automatic finalaction on an approval resolution was intendedto apply whenever a received Senate companion would approve the same repository site as the House measure, evenif the text is not identical. If the Speakersustained the point of order, the House would in all probability accept such a ruling, or at least sustain it if it wereappealed. Subsequently, the House would nodoubt accept this ruling as precedent controlling the meaning of the provision for any future uses of the expeditedprocedure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Statutory Requirements for Site Approval", "paragraphs": ["The previous section addresses whether, if an approval resolution were to be amended into a form other thanthat prescribed by the NWPA, it would continue tobe eligible for consideration under the expedited procedure of the Act. Certain provisions of the Act, however,suggest that if the measure were enacted in such aform, it might raise additional questions as well. Pursuant to this language, it might be argued that unless a measurehad the form prescribed for an approvalresolution, it might not suffice to authorize construction of the repository. Related passages could be used to arguethat even if the measure had the prescribedform, it might not achieve its purpose if Congress did not pass it during the prescribed 90-day period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Requirements of Form and Timing", "paragraphs": ["Expedited procedure statutes commonly permit Congress to approve (or disapprove) a specified action by using the expedited procedure to enact the measure forwhich the statute provides. They do not purport to require Congress to use, for this purpose, the means of approval(or disapproval) they provide. The language ofthe NWPA appears to reflect an intent to go farther, and prohibit construction of a civilian nuclear waste repository unless Congress enacts the resolution ofapproval in the prescribed form within the specified 90-day period. ", "Specifically, subsection (b) of 42 U.S.C. section 10135 states that once a state \"notice of disapproval has been submitted, the designation of such site shall not beeffective except as provided under subsection (c) ....\" Subsection (c) provides that under these conditions,the \"site shall be disapproved unless , during the ... [prescribed 90-day] period ... the Congress passes a resolution of repository siting approval in accordance withthis subsection approving this site ....\" (Italicsadded throughout). The text that a resolution of repository siting approval must possess is prescribed, as alreadynoted, by subsection (a). ", "By no statutory language, of course, could Congress vitiate its own capacity subsequently to pass any legislation within its constitutional power. It could hardly bequestioned that if, independent of the provisions of the NWPA, legislation were enacted specifically providing thata repository be constructed at a given site, theenactment would legally suffice for the purpose. Any conceivable uncertainty could be removed if the enablingstatute explicitly superseded or repealed pertinentprovisions of the NWPA. ", "An argument might be raised, however, that outside the context of the statutory procedure, a measure containing the language prescribed for an approvalresolution would not suffice for this purpose. A resolution of repository siting approval is to state only that \"therehereby is approved the site\" specified. The Actrequires this approval in order for the site designation to become \"effective.\" It gives meaning to this term bydirecting that when the site designation is effective,the Secretary of Energy is to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for authorization to construct the site. (42) On this basis, it might be argued that only incontext of the Act does \"approval\" have specific meaning in relation to establishment of the repository. ", "By this argument, if a resolution was couched in the terms required by the Act, but also had been amended to include other language, or was not passed within therequired 90-day period, it might not constitute statutory authorization to proceed with establishment of therepository. Instead, it might be contended, the processof establishing the repository cannot go forward unless Congress passes either (1) the approval resolution in the formand within the time required by the NWPA,or (2) legislation independent of the requirements of the Act and explicitly directing that the repository beconstructed (or, for example, that the Secretary apply forthe construction authorization). ", "A contrary interpretation of the language of the statute might hold that congressional \"approval\" of a site designation entails authorization to proceed with therepository, even independently of the statutory mechanism of the NWPA. To preclude such contentions altogether,however, any approval resolution passed eitherin amended form, or outside the statutory time frame (or both), might have to be amended also to contain languageexplicitly authorizing construction (orapplication for authorization to construct), and perhaps explicitly superseding the statutory process of the NWPAas well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relation of Statutory Requirements to Expedited Procedure", "paragraphs": ["These questions of the potential force and effect of an approval resolution under the NWPA are separate from those that might be raised about the eligibility of theresolution for consideration under the expedited procedure of the Act. The NWPA attempts to require that anapproval resolution must be passed in a specifiedform, and within specified time constraints, in order to permit establishment of the repository to go forward. It doesnot require that the approval resolution beenacted in accordance with the expedited procedure itself. The provisions of section 10135 quoted earlier requireaction in accordance with subsections (b) and(c), but not with subsections (d) and (e), which set forth the expedited procedure. ", "It accordingly appears that, for example, the Senate might amend its approval resolution, then continue considering the measure without regard to the constraintsof the expedited procedure on debate and other procedural actions, and ultimately pass in lieu thereof an unamendedcompanion previously received from theHouse. This process would result in an approval resolution becoming law in the form prescribed by statute, but notin accordance with the expedited procedure. The language of the Act would not seem to cast any doubt on the force and effect of a resolution of siting approvalenacted under those conditions. Similarly, aslong as Congress passed an approval resolution having the prescribed form within the required 90 days ofcontinuous session, the measure would apparentlysuffice to approve the site designation even if Congress did not consider it in accordance with the expeditedprocedure.", "It is, in any case, most doubtful that a statute could effectively require action pursuant to a specified expedited procedure as a condition of the effectiveness of anapproval resolution. If either house departed from the prescribed procedures in its consideration of the resolution,its action presumably would amount to animplicit exercise of the chamber's power to alter the expedited procedure in its application to the specific instance. Such alterations in statutory procedures areimplicitly understood as authorized by the rulemaking clause of the Constitution, even where not explicitlyauthorized by the rulemaking language of the statuteitself.", "Conversely, however, it does not appear that Congress could in any way use the rulemaking power to establish the effectiveness of an approval resolution that didnot meet the statutory requirements of form and timing. The Act gives the status of congressional rules only to theprovisions of subsections (d) and (e) thatgovern congressional action on an approval resolution from introduction through final action. The provisions ofsubsections (a) through (c), which specify therequired wording and timing of an approval resolution and establish its effects, are not declared to have this status. Nor is it clear that they could be appropriatelyconstrued as having this status, for their effects go beyond procedural implications internal to Congress. Accordingly, if an approval resolution did not meet thestatutory requirements of form and timing, then Congress might prefer to include in the resolution an explicitstatement of its intended force and effect, in order toensure that it would have that force and effect. ", "Finally, if Congress determined to authorize construction of a nuclear waste repository by means of legislation that did not meet the requirements of form andtiming provided by the NWPA, that legislation would presumably be ineligible, under the statute, for considerationunder the expedited procedure. The Act makesthat procedure available only for measures meeting the statutory requirements of form for a resolution of repositorysiting approval. Presumably, as a result,approval legislation of any alternate kind would not be subject to the restrictions imposed by the statute oncommittee action, calling up, debate, amendment, andother procedural actions. It would instead have to be considered under the general procedures of each house. Itcould, accordingly, be considered underprocedures equivalent to the expedited procedure, but only if each house, using its general practices of makingprocedural decisions, so determined.
