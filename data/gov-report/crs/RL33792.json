BLM and FS lands also are required to be managed for sustained yield\u2014a high level of resource outputs in perpetuity\u2014without impairing the productivity of the lands. However, each agency also has unique emphases and functions. For instance, most rangelands are managed by the BLM, and the BLM administers mineral development on all federal lands.
