The 110th Congress may consider similar issues. At issue for Congress is whether it should further restrict state prisoners' access to federal habeas relief by limiting the federal role in policing constitutional violations in the states' criminal justice systems. Two issues have emerged as Congress considers such legislation\u2014trial finality and adequate representation. Proponents contend that restricting state prisoners' access to federal habeas relief is necessary due to many prisoners filing excessive and frivolous claims that result in a backlog in the system and substantial delays in the processing of these cases. Critics contend, however, that many states' criminal justice systems are flawed, with many indigent defendants lacking proper representation throughout all stages of the criminal justice system. They argue that for many defendants, the writ of habeas corpus plays a key role in restoring justice when the system fails.", "The current debate over whether to reform the federal habeas corpus law is centered around state capital cases. These cases experience some of the lengthier delays that have been highlighted in congressional testimony. The issue of trial finality becomes apparent in these cases because the mandated outcome\u2014execution\u2014is suspended pending the outcome of the habeas proceeding. An analysis of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' (AOUSC) data, however, does not fully support the claim that state capital habeas cases take excessively long to process. The data reveals that although the median time for state capital cases to make their way through a federal habeas proceeding is twice as long as state non-capital cases, the rate of filing for habeas relief for both types of cases has remained constant.", "Since 1988, prisoners serving a federal capital sentence are entitled to counsel during all post-conviction proceedings. Unlike the federal criminal justice system, most states do not afford prisoners the same right. Critics contend that by not having a mandatory system of post-conviction representation, many states ignore the reality that indigent death row prisoners are not able to competently engage in post-conviction litigation. A study that was conducted over a 23-year period raised the question of whether the delays commonly associated with federal habeas corpus review are necessary to make sure that justice is administered fairly. The research also raised the possibility that the errors found in capital cases may be the result of poor representation.

For the 1% under a sentence of death,\" the U.S. Supreme Court has already addressed concerns about unwarranted delay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-Conviction Representation", "paragraphs": ["The Sixth Amendment of the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution provides that any individual accused of a crime is entitled to counsel. The Constitution, however, does not require the appointment of counsel in post-conviction proceedings.

Unlike the federal criminal justice system, most states do not afford its prisoners with the same right. Critics contend that by\u00a0having a non-mandatory system of post-conviction representation, many states ignore the reality that indigent death row prisoners are simply not able to competently engage in post-conviction litigation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access to Representation", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, Congress eliminated funding for Post-Conviction Defender Organizations (PCDO). PCDOs were created in the 1980s in response to the federal judiciary's concern about the growth of the death row population in some federal circuits and the lack of qualified counsel to handle post-conviction appeals. PCDOs were non-profit organizations that recruited and trained private attorneys to represent death row prisoners. Attorneys recruited by PCDOs were well versed in death penalty litigation. PCDOs served as consultants to the attorneys they recruited and provided expertise in the litigation of these cases. At its peak, PCDOs employed full-time, salaried attorneys in 20 of the 38 death penalty states. Before funding for PCDOs was eliminated, PCDOs received grants from the Judicial Conference that were contingent upon the PCDO receiving state funding to support the work it did in state courts.", "Since the elimination of PCDOs, many states lack a system for the appointment of counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings. In states that do provide an attorney for post-conviction appeals, the system to appoint such representation varies from state to state. Some states have a public defender's office that handles post-conviction representation, however, these offices are often understaffed and underfunded. In some states that do not have public defender's offices to handle appeals, counties in the state will handle the responsibility of providing post-conviction representation. Some counties do this by awarding a contract to a law firm to handle all post-conviction cases (usually to the lowest bidder), other counties use a list of attorneys that can be appointed to take the case. If an attorney is appointed to the case, a cap is usually placed on the amount of money the state will reimburse the attorney to cover the cost of investigation and legal fees. Also, standards used by the state to determine which attorneys are eligible to handle post-conviction representation vary from state to state. If the state chooses not to provide post-conviction representation, then the petitioner must file the petition himself or hope to find an attorney that will take the case pro bono."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Representation", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of defense counsel can have an effect on the length of post-conviction proceedings. Some have attributed the excessive length of post-conviction review to the lack of adequate representation for indigent defendants. In a report published in 1990, the American Bar Association (ABA) concluded that inadequate counsel greatly increases the risk of convictions that are flawed by fundamental, factual, legal or constitutional error. Hence, a great deal of time during state and federal post-conviction review, especially in a capital case, is used to determine whether or not a defendant received adequate representation.", "The importance of effective representation is further buttressed by research conducted by Liebman, Fagan, West and Lloyd. The authors conducted a study of death sentences over a 23-year period (from 1973 to 1995). According to the authors, there were approximately 5,760 death sentences handed down in the United States during the 23-year period that was studied. Of these sentences, 79% were reviewed on direct appeal and 41% were reversed due to \"serious error.\" With respect to the death sentences that were not overturned after direct review, 40% were overturned on post-conviction review due to serious error. According to the authors, the overall error rate in capital cases for the period 1973-1995 was 68%. The study showed that among the most common errors that were cited during state post-conviction review, egregiously incompetent defense lawyers accounted for 37% of reversals.", "The research concluded that during the period examined, a majority of the death sentences with reversible error were overturned by state courts. In 40% of the cases where reversible error was found, it took an average of 7.6 years after the defendant was sentenced to death for the case to complete all stages of review. It took an average of nine years for cases in which no reversible error was found to complete all stages of review. However, the authors' results led them to conclude that, \"indeed, it may be that capital sentences spend so much time under judicial review precisely because they are persistently and systematically fraught with alarming amounts of error, and that the expanding production of death sentences may compound the production of error.\"", "Not all states, however, have a public defense system with similar records. For example, Arizona appoints post-conviction representation to all indigent defendants and requires the appointed attorney to be different from the one that represented the defendant at trial. Arizona has also established mandatory competency standards for any attorney that wishes to be placed on the list of eligible attorneys for appointment in capital post-conviction cases. The standards evaluate the attorney's bar status, continuing legal education, and years of experience in the practice of criminal law or post-conviction proceedings. According to congressional testimony, since 2002, Arizona has spent more than $1million for post-conviction representation in 21 cases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Attorney General Determination of AEDPA \"Opt-in\" for States", "paragraphs": ["The issue of post-conviction representation is highlighted in the debate of further limiting state prisoners' access to appeal to the federal courts for habeas relief. Under current law, states have the opportunity to \"opt-in\" to an expedited review process for federal habeas corpus proceedings in capital cases if they meet certain conditions. The \"opt-in\" provision only applies to capital cases and for qualifying states. For states that successfully \"opt-in,\" a six-month statute of limitation for filing habeas corpus petitions is imposed on state prisoners, and the district court is required to render a final determination and judgment on a petition brought forth under the new chapter no later than 180 days after the date on which the petition is filed. The Streamlined Procedures Act ( S. 1088 / H.R. 3035 ) would allow the Attorney General to decide if states have met the requirements set forth by AEDPA to \"opt-in\" for the special set of rules governing federal review of state court decisions. In deciding whether a state can \"opt-in,\" the Attorney General must determine whether the state has developed a sufficient system for appointing and funding qualified counsels during the state post-conviction process.", "Under the current system, federal courts must rule on whether a state has met the requirements to \"opt-in.\" If a state has successfully met such requirements, then the federal district court would be subjected to the limitations set forth by AEDPA, as discussed above. Proponents contend that such a system produces a reluctance on the court's part to determine whether states have met the criteria. This is evident in the fact that out of the 38 states that have the death penalty, only thirteen have petitioned the courts to \"opt-in\" to the expedited review process since its enactment\u2014and only one of those states was successful (Arizona).", "Opponents contend, however, that it would eliminate the chance for federal courts to ensure reliable convictions in state capital cases (the only exception would be for claims of actual innocence).

Although trial finality is often cited by proponents who favor further restricting federal habeas corpus relief to state prisoners as a desirable goal when discussing the scope of such relief, the question of a prisoner's constitutional rights is often cited by those holding an opposing viewpoint as equally paramount to the discussion of the proper scope of habeas corpus relief. The question of what is the purpose of constitutional rights in the criminal justice system, however, can be supported by both views. For example, do such rights exist primarily to protect the innocent and ensure that only those who actually committed a crime will be convicted or does the litigation of rights serve other purposes such as controlling police and prosecutorial behavior and protecting individual privacy and dignity? Regardless of the question, there appears to be a consensus among legislatures that adequate representation, arguably at all stages of the criminal justice system, is critical to ensure that an individual's constitutional rights are not violated.", "As early as 1989, the Powell Committee studied the federal habeas corpus system. Although the committee found that prisoners' abuses of the system were rampant, it also found that many states lacked representation for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings. As a result of the committee's study, as well as several U.S. Supreme Court rulings that addressed some of the issues with the system, Congress passed AEDPA. Among other provisions, AEDPA created a two-tier system for states with respect to federal habeas corpus proceedings. Although there was already an existing system for the processing of federal habeas corpus cases, AEDPA created a second, expedited system for capital cases for states that met certain requirements. As was the case with the committee, Congress, in passing AEDPA, recognized the need to provide an incentive to states to have a system in place that would call for the appointment of adequate counsel as well as provide compensation for the litigation of post-conviction cases. The need for such a system was more apparent in capital cases where prisoners were facing a death sentence. Although Arizona is the only state that has successfully opted-in to the expedited system, 12\u00a0additional states have attempted to do the same to no avail.", "Once again Congress recognized the need for effective representation in post-conviction proceedings, especially in capital cases, when it passed the Justice for All Act ( P.L. 108-405 ). Title IV of the act ( the Innocence Protection Act of 2004 ) permits the Attorney General to make grants to states so they can improve the quality of legal representation provided to indigent defendants in state capital cases. The research of Liebman, Fagan, West and Lloyd discussed previously raised the question of whether the delays commonly associated with federal habeas corpus review are necessary to make sure that justice is administered fairly. Moreover, the research raised the possibility that the errors found in capital cases may be the result of poor representation. Until the issue of adequate representation is fully addressed in the nation's criminal justice system, reform efforts will continue to be debated."], "subsections": []}]}}
