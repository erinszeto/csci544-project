Since then, bilateral ties have expanded remarkably, to the point where the relationship has been virtually normalized. Indeed, since 2002, overlapping strategic and economic interests have compelled the United States and Vietnam to improve relations across a wide spectrum of issues. Congress played a significant role in the normalization process and continues to influence the state of bilateral relations. Voices favoring improved relations have included those reflecting U.S. business interests in Vietnam's reforming economy and U.S. strategic interests in expanding cooperation with a populous country\u2014Vietnam has over 85 million people\u2014that has an ambivalent relationship with China. Others argue that improvements in bilateral relations should be conditioned upon Vietnam's authoritarian government improving its record on human rights. The population of over 1 million Vietnamese Americans, as well as legacies of the Vietnam War, also drive continued U.S. interest.", "Economic ties are the most mature aspect of the bilateral relationship. The United States is Vietnam's largest export market. The final step toward full economic normalization was accomplished in December 2006, when Congress passed and President Bush signed H.R. 6111 (P.L. 109-432), extending permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to Vietnam. For years, the United States has supported Vietnam's market-oriented economic reforms, which many credit with Vietnam's extraordinary economic performance; from 1987-2007, annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged over 7%. Since the early 1990s, poverty levels have been halved, to less than 30%. In 2008, the two countries launched bilateral investment treaty (BIT) talks and the Bush Administration announced that it would explore whether to add Vietnam to the Generalized System of Payments (GSP) program, which extends duty-free treatment to certain products that are imported from designated developing countries.", "Since 2002, the United States and Vietnam have expanded political and security ties, symbolized by reciprocal summits that have been held annually since 2005. Vietnam is one of the largest recipients of U.S. assistance in East Asia; estimated U.S. aid in FY2008 surpassed $100 million, much of it for health-related activities. In September 2007, the House passed the Vietnam Human Rights Act, H.R. 3096, which would freeze some non-humanitarian U.S. assistance programs at existing levels if Vietnam does not improve its human rights situation. Since 2006, arrests of dissidents and other developments have increased concerns about human rights.", "Vietnamese leaders have sought to upgrade relations with the United States due in part to worries about China's expanding influence in Southeast Asia and the desire for continued U.S. support for their economic reforms. Many argue, however, that there is little evidence that Hanoi seeks to balance Beijing's rising power. Also, some Vietnamese remain suspicious that the United States' long-term goal is to end the Vietnamese communist party's monopoly on power through a \"peaceful evolution\" strategy."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Developments in 20081", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "June 2008 Summit", "paragraphs": ["Against a backdrop of the expanding and deepening of U.S.-Vietnam relations, in late June, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with President Bush.

In the year after Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007, U.S.-Vietnam trade rose more than 30%, to over $12.3 billion. For the first eight months of 2008, year-on-year trade was up by 30%.

The current program is scheduled to expire with the end of the Bush Administration. The U.S. imported about $4.3 billion in clothing items from Vietnam in 2007. ", "Vietnamese officials also are concerned that the implementation of certain provisions of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-246 ), passed in June 2008, may reduce Vietnamese fish farmers' catfish exports to the United States. Among other items, the law will effectively transfer catfish inspection from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which currently is drafting regulations to implement the provision. These regulations conceivably could require a formal USDA determination that Vietnamese safety standards are equivalent to U.S. standards, before such catfish could be imported into the United States, which might at least temporarily disrupt such shipments. Catfish exports account for about one-quarter of the exports by Vietnam's aquatic industry, an important sector in Vietnam. In 2007, Vietnamese fish farmers exported approximately 21,200 MT of catfish (worth about $67.6 million) to the United States, up from 14,800 MT ($35.3 million) in 2005.

In 2007 and the first half of 2008, the country experienced soaring inflation and acute, downward pressure on the country's currency, the dong. The problems caused by inflation were particularly onerous, as the prices of some food items rose by over 50%, leading workers in a number of factories to go on strike demanding higher wages. Although the increase in the inflation rate has halted and perhaps reversed, the year-on-year rise in prices is still over 20% (it was 26.7% in October). Some economists have said Vietnam's still-developing institutional and financial infrastructure has contributed to or even caused many of the problems. Vietnam's growing trade and budget deficits continue to cause concern, including among credit agencies, which in 2008 have downgraded the outlook on Vietnam's sovereign rating from stable to negative.", "Although restrictions on international financial transactions have limited Vietnam's direct exposure to the global financial and credit crises, the secondary effects have created new pressures on Vietnam, which is heavily dependent on trade and foreign direct investment inflows. Some selected figures illustrate Vietnam's vulnerability to the global slowdown and collapse in commodity prices: exports are equivalent to 80% of GDP; about 60% of Vietnamese exports go to the United States, the European Union, and Japan; and oil revenue accounts for 30% of the government's revenue. For 2008, GDP growth is expected to be just over 6%. Many forecasters expect growth to be even lower in 2009, perhaps in the 4%-6% level. Nominal GDP growth of 7% is a key threshold in the minds of many Vietnamese policymakers for creating the jobs necessary for the VCP and the government to maintain social stability. To spur economic growth, the Vietnamese government took a number of steps in the fall and winter of 2008, including announcing a $6 billion stimulus package, lowering some corporate tax rates, cutting interest rates, and allowing the dong to depreciate against the U.S. dollar. ", "In March 2008, Vietnam, the world's second-largest exporter of rice, imposed restrictions on rice exports in order to lower prices in its domestic market.

The reformers are generally thought to have been ascendant since 2000, when a prolonged logjam over the future of economic reform was broken in favor of a new consensus to deepen Vietnam's integration with the global economy and to push through a new series of market-oriented economic reforms. Additionally, the ascendancy of the reformers has coincided with Hanoi's moves to upgrade relations with the United States, its increased willingness to discuss human rights disagreements, its loosening of restrictions on the Vietnamese press, and its more aggressive drive to root out corruption, which the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) sees as one of the greatest threats to its legitimacy. ", "Among the indicators that the conservatives may be pushing back: the arrest and sentencing of Thanh Nien journalist Nguyen Viet Chien for \"abusing\" his position by reporting on corruption at high levels in the government; a decision by the 160-person VCP Central Committee in May 2008 to give greater authority over the economy to the 14-member Politburo (presumably diminishing the prime minister's role); and an escalating land dispute between the Catholic archdiocese of Hanoi and the Hanoi People's Committee (Hanoi's communist party organ), in which the Hanoi authorities have broken up sit-ins by Catholics protesting the city's plans to redevelop land that the church was forced to turn over to the government decades ago.

Hanoi and Beijing continue to deal with resurfacing disputes over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. Most notably, in December 2007, the Vietnamese government allowed anti-Chinese demonstrations outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi and consulate in Ho Chi Minh City. The protestors were angered by reports that Beijing had created a new municipality in Hainan Province that would have jurisdiction over three islets claimed by Vietnam.

Some economists have criticized the government's latest five year development plan, issued in 2005, that focuses on the development of heavy industries such as electricity, energy, steel, and mining. The previous plan emphasized lighter industries such as foodstuffs, textiles, and electronics. Most of Vietnam's SOEs are functionally bankrupt, and require significant government subsidies and assistance to continue operating. Although more than 2,500 SOEs officially have been partially privatized since 1990 under the government's \"equitization\" program, most of these are small and medium-sized firms, and the government still owns substantial stakes in them. In January 2007, Vietnam's Finance Minister said that the privatization of SOEs would be accelerated, with the goal of completing the process by 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Trends", "paragraphs": ["Vietnam's experiments with political reform have lagged behind its economic changes. A new constitution promulgated in 1992, for instance, reaffirmed the central role of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) in politics and society, and Vietnam remains a one-party state. In practice, the VCP sets the general direction for policy while the details of implementation generally are left to the four lesser pillars of the Vietnamese polity: the state bureaucracy, the legislature (the National Assembly), the Vietnamese People's Army (VPA), and the officially sanctioned associations and organizations that exist under the Vietnamese Fatherland Front umbrella. The Party's major decision-making bodies are the Central Committee, which has 150 members, and the Politburo, which in recent years has had 15 members. Membership on the Politburo generally is decided based upon maintaining a rough geographic (north, south, and central) and factional (conservatives and reformers) balance. The three top leadership posts are, in order of influence, the VCP General Secretary, followed by the Prime Minister, and the President. Since the death in 1986 of Vietnam's last \"strong man,\" Le Duan, decision-making on major policy issues typically has been arrived at through consensus within the Politburo, a practice that often leads to protracted delays on contentious issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Assembly", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 15 years, Vietnam's legislative organ, the National Assembly, has slowly and subtly increased its influence to the point where it is no longer a rubber stamp. Although more than 80% of parliamentarians are VCP members and the VCP carefully screens all candidates before elections are held, in recent years the Assembly has vetoed Cabinet appointments, forced the government to revise major commercial legislation, and successfully demanded an increase in its powers. These include the right to review each line of the government's budget, the right to hold no-confidence votes against the government, and the right to dismiss the president and prime minister (though not the VCP general secretary)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Tenth Party Congress", "paragraphs": ["In the spring of 2006, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party held its 10 th Party Congress. These events, held every five years, are often occasions for major leadership realignments and set the direction for Vietnam's economic, diplomatic, and social policies. At the 9 th Party Congress in 2001, for instance, the VCP endorsed the acceleration of economic reforms that apparently had been stalled by policymaking paralysis. The former VCP general secretary, an ideological conservative, was ousted in favor of the current secretary, Nong Duc Manh , who generally is considered a more pragmatic figure. Significantly, Manh's selection reportedly was made possible when the Party's Central Committee rejected\u2014an unprecedented move\u2014the Politburo's decision to endorse Manh's predecessor.", "The 10 th Party Congress reportedly resulted in few if any major changes to current policy direction of the country\u2014an indication that the economic reformers remain in the ascendency\u2014with the ultimate goal remaining creating a \"socialist-oriented market economy.\" During his opening address, Manh outlined the party's five-year development strategy, including accelerating the doi moi reforms, further integrating Vietnam into the world economy, and laying the foundations for becoming an industrialized country by 2020. The Congress also outlined specific targets, such as maintaining average annual GDP growth of 7.5-8%, creating 8 million jobs, and reducing urban unemployment to below 5%.", "There were some major personnel changes. As expected, the sitting Prime Minister (Phan Van Khai) and President (Tran Duc Luong) resigned their Politburo positions, effectively ending their official political careers. Both had served two terms. Changes in their government posts will be confirmed by the National Assembly, either in its ninth session in May or its tenth session later this year. In May 2006, Khai endorsed Vietnam's deputy premier, Nguyen Tan Dung (56) as his successor. Dung is a southerner and widely considered to be an economic reformer. During the 10 th Party Congress, he was elevated to the third-highest post in the Politburo. Luong's successor as President is another southerner, Nguyen Minh Triet (64), formerly the party secretary in Ho Chi Minh City. Triet also is widely considered an economic reformer and is known for fighting corruption and criminal gangs in Ho Chi Minh City.", "Vietnam's leadership is trying to confront the problem of how to reverse the Communist Party's declining legitimacy. Attracting new recruits into the Party has become increasingly difficult, particularly among young Vietnamese, though there are some signs this may be changing. A key issue for the VCP leadership is combating official corruption, which was a major topic during the Party Congress. Vietnam regularly is ranked near the bottom of surveys of foreign executives on corruption in various countries. Under Manh's leadership, the government appears to have attacked corruption in a much more systemic fashion than in the past, including passage in November 2005 of a new anti-corruption law that aims at increasing government transparency. However, pervasive and high-level corruption is widely considered to be endemic, as revealed by the breaking of a major scandal in the winter and spring of 2006, in which top officials in the Transportation Ministry apparently embezzled more than $7 million in foreign assistance funds. The deputy minister was arrested for his suspected involvement in the case, and the transport minister resigned to take responsibility for the scandal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Foreign Policy", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 10 th Party Congress, there was some speculation that China's economic and diplomatic resurgence in Southeast Asia was driving some soul-searching in Hanoi on foreign policy issues. Some in Hanoi are wondering how much additional utility Vietnam would gain from continuing its \"omnidirectional foreign policy,\" which has successfully restored cordial relations with the rest of the world but has left Vietnam without truly warm relations with any one country or grouping of countries. It is unclear whether these debates over foreign policy took place during the congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sino-Vietnam Relations", "paragraphs": ["Since the late 1990s, when China began espousing its \"new security concept\" of cooperation with its neighbors, improvements in Sino-Vietnamese relations have accelerated, most notably with the signings of a land border treaty in 1999 and a sea border treaty for the Gulf of Tonkin in 2000. For Vietnamese leaders, this process has been fraught with ambivalence. On the one hand, maintaining stable, friendly relations with its northern neighbor is critical for Vietnam's economic development, and Hanoi does not undertake large-scale diplomatic moves without first calculating Beijing's likely reaction. China's ruling communist party is an ideological bedfellow, as well as a role model for a country that seeks to marketize its economy without threatening the communist party's dominance. China also is Vietnam's largest trading partner.", "On the other hand, many Vietnamese are believed to be wary of China's increased influence in Southeast Asia. Beijing's outreach to Cambodia and Laos in recent years has rekindled internal battles between pro-Hanoi and pro-Beijing camps in both countries, and has spurred counter-moves by Hanoi. Vietnam and China still have overlapping claims to the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea, differences that led to military clashes in the late 1980s. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, a non-binding agreement to resolve disputes diplomatically, exercise restraint, and respect the freedom of navigation and overflight. Significantly, Vietnam did not succeed in its efforts to have the agreement specifically include the Paracel Islands, claimed by both Vietnam and China. Instead, the declaration is vague on its geographic scope. Like other countries in the dispute, Vietnam has continued to expand its presence in the island chain. China also represents an economic rival, as both countries compete for foreign direct investment and for markets in many of the same low-cost manufacturing products. Vietnamese leaders periodically express concern about Vietnam's rising trade deficit with China.", "Another sign that Hanoi is seeking regional counterweights to China is that Vietnam, along with Indonesia and Singapore, supported efforts to include Australia and New Zealand in the East Asia Summit that was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in December 2005. China and some Southeast Asian countries favored excluding countries outside of North and Southeast Asia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Refugees in Cambodia", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, hundreds of Montagnards have crossed into Cambodia, to escape continuing unrest in the Central Highlands region. In 2002, Cambodia accepted an offer from the United States to resettle the more than 900 Montagnards who remained following the 2001 protests and crackdown. More than 700 Montagnards have fled to Cambodia since then, particularly after a wave of unrest in April 2004. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has found the majority of the border-crossers to be refugees and therefore entitled to asylum. While most of these are being resettled in the United States, Canada, or Finland, others have returned to Vietnam following a January 2005 agreement between UNHCR, Cambodia, and Vietnam in which Hanoi agreed that those returning to Vietnam would not be punished, discriminated against, or prosecuted for fleeing to Cambodia. Vietnam also agreed to drop its refusal to allow UNHCR to monitor the returnees' well-being, though some human rights groups have criticized UNHCR's monitoring visits, as well as its process for screening border crossers in Cambodia. More than 200 individuals, including many who have been recognized as refugees by UNHCR, refused offers to be resettled in third countries outside Southeast Asia. In the past, Cambodia has been accused of abiding by Vietnamese requests to close its borders and repatriate individuals forcibly. In May 2007, the United States adopted a new policy toward the Montagnards in Cambodia, in which individuals UNHCR deems not to be refugees will not be considered for resettlement in the United States.
