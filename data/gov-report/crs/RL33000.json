The United States has provided security assistance to regional governments tocounter such groups.

TSCTI would reportedly include a geographicalexpansion of the kind of CT training provided under PSI, to include Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,Nigeria, and Senegal; a broadening of TSCTI assistance, to include development assistance (DA)and increased regional U.S. public diplomacy efforts; and a rise in program funding, to $132 millionfor first year start-up costs, and about $125 million per year in subsequent years, for a five to six yearprogram. (6) According toState Department officials, TSCTI is at present technically a conceptual plan only, but has reportedlybeen agreed upon by key U.S. implementing agencies at the deputy principal level. TheAdministration has sought Congressional approval to use a mix of about $11 million in StateDepartment and $5 million in Defense Department FY2005 and FY2006 funds to initiate TSCTIstart-up activities. It may then request full TSCTI funding under its FY2007 budget proposal.Despite the State Department's view that TSCTI is not yet a fully-fledged program, U.S. EuropeanCommand (EUCOM) already uses the term TSCTI to describe its activities under PSI (whichEUCOM documents have described as \"formerly known\" as PSI), as well as some training exercises. These include Exercise Flintlock, a June 2005 effort in which U.S. special operations forces providedseven Saharan host country armed forces with tactical military training aimed at improving regionalsecurity and stability.

Obstetric fistula, which affects an estimated two million women mainly in Africa, occurs primarilyfrom a prolonged labor that results in a hole or rupture in tissues between the vagina and bladder(and at times the rectum). Women with this condition are stigmatized and often shunned by theirfamily and community. It is especially common in girls aged 15-19 whose bodies are not fullydeveloped for childbirth and in girls and women suffering from malnutrition. Obstetric fistula occursalmost exclusively in developing countries where access to health care services is severelylimited.

The provision specified that to the maximum extentpossible, each center would perform certain services, including surgical repair and post-surgerysupport, educational activities to prevent incidents of fistula, and expanded access to contraceptiveservices for the prevention of pregnancies among women that were at high risk for a prolonged orobstructed childbirth. During floor debate, Representative Smith (N.J.) proposed an amendment thatdeleted the requirement for each center to expand contraceptive services for high-risk women, andadded a new activity requiring centers to broaden \"abstinence education, postponement of marriageand child-bearing until after teenage years, and activities to expand access to family planningservices\" for women in a high-risk category. Unlike the treatment services that each center mustprovide \"to the maxim extent possible,\" the revised prevention activities would be provided at thediscretion of the centers. The Smith amendment further increased funding to $7.5 million annually.", "In support of his amendment, Congressman Smith argued that the changes would allowfaith-based hospitals to perform the required activities, something that would not have occurredunder the committee-reported language because of opposition of faith-based facilities to providingcontraceptive services. He further stated that the amendment's reference to \"family planningservices\" would include contraception. Opponents of the amendment, however, charged that therevised text \"gutted\" the prevention aspect of the obstetric fistula centers by making these activitiesdiscretionary rather than mandatory in the original text. They contend that the most effective methodto reduce the incidents of obstetric fistula is to ensure that young girls and high-risk women do notget pregnant.

They argue that familyplanning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications ofthe restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for USAID funding. Opponents also believethe conditions undermine relations between the U.S. government and foreign non-governmentorganizations (NGOs) and multilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United Stateschallenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and impose a so-called \"gag\" orderon their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations. The latterrestriction, these critics note, would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups working inthe United States.

The policy, they contend, stops the fungibility \"loophole.\"", "During debate on S. 600 , the Senate approved (52-46) on April 5 an amendmentoffered by Senator Boxer that would effectively overturn the President's Mexico City policy.

This exemption would apply so long as the services do not violatethe laws of the country in which they are performed and that they would not violate U.S. laws ifprovided in the United States. The amendment further provides that non-U.S. government fundsused by foreign NGOs for advocacy and lobbying activities shall be subject to conditions that alsoapply to U.S. NGOs.
