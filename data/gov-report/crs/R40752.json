The Supreme Court struck down military commissions established pursuant to the M.O. as inconsistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). To permit military commissions to go forward, Congress approved the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), conferring authority to promulgate rules that depart from the strictures of the UCMJ and possibly U.S. international obligations. The Department of Defense (DOD) published regulations to govern military commissions pursuant to the MCA. Three prosecutions under those regulations resulted in convictions.", "Shortly after taking office, President Obama took action to suspend the operation of military commissions pending a review of all Guantanamo detentions for the purpose of assessing options for the lawful disposition of each detainee. The Detention Policy Task Force set up to conduct the review issued a preliminary report announcing that while federal criminal court would be the preferred forum for trying enemy terrorists who are suspected of having violated U.S. criminal law, military commissions, with significant reforms, would remain an option for prosecuting violations of the law of war.", "This report provides a background and analysis of military commissions rules under the MCA. After reviewing the history of the implementation of military commissions in the \"global war on terrorism,\" the report provides an overview of the procedural safeguards provided in the MCA. The report identifies pending legislation, including Senate-passed S. 1390, and describes proposals suggested by the Obama Administration. Finally, the report provides two charts comparing the MCA with proposed legislation. The first chart describes the composition and powers of the military tribunals, as well as their jurisdiction. The second chart, which compares procedural safeguards under the MCA with those established for courts-martial as well as proposed amendments to the MCA, follows the same order and format used in CRS Report RL31262, Selected Procedural Safeguards in Federal, Military, and International Courts, to facilitate comparison with safeguards provided in federal court and international criminal tribunals. For similar charts comparing military commissions as envisioned under the MCA to the rules that had been established by DOD for military commissions and to general military courts-martial conducted under the UCMJ, see CRS Report RL33688, The Military Commissions Act of 2006: Analysis of Procedural Rules and Comparison with Previous DOD Rules and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Shortly after combat operations began pursuant to the congressional authorization to use military force in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush issued a Military Order (M.O.) authorizing trial by military commission of non-citizens suspected of terrorist acts or associations who were to be designated as subject to the M.O. President Bush subsequently determined that 20 of the detainees at the U.S. Naval Station in Guant\u00e1namo Bay held in connection with the conflict were subject to the M.O., and 10 were eventually charged for trial before military commissions. The M.O. specified that persons subject to it would have no recourse to the U.S. court system to appeal a verdict or obtain any other sort of relief, but the Supreme Court essentially invalidated that provision in its 2004 opinion, Rasul v. Bush . ", "Military commissions are courts usually set up by military commanders in the field to try persons accused of certain offenses during war. They may also try persons for ordinary crimes in cases of martial law or military occupation, where regular civil courts are not able to function. Past military commissions trying enemy belligerents for war crimes directly applied the international law of war, without recourse to domestic criminal statutes, unless such statutes were declaratory of international law. Historically, military commissions have applied the same set of procedural rules that applied in courts-martial. By statute, military commissions have long been available to try \"offenders or offenses designated by statute or the law of war.\" For the most part, military commissions have been employed where U.S. armed forces have established a military government or martial law, as in the war with Mexico, the Civil War, the Philippine Insurrection, and in occupied Germany and Japan after World War II.", "President Bush's Military Order establishing military commissions to try suspected terrorists was the focus of intense debate both at home and abroad. Critics argued that the tribunals could violate any rights the accused may have under the Constitution as well as their rights under international law, thereby undercutting the legitimacy of any verdicts rendered by the tribunals. The Bush Administration established rules prescribing detailed procedural safeguards for the tribunals. These rules were praised as a significant improvement over what might have been permitted under the language of the M.O., but some continued to argue that the enhancements did not go far enough. Critics also noted that the rules did not address the issue of indefinite detention without charge, as appeared to be possible under the original M.O., or that the Department of Defense (DOD) may continue to detain persons who have been cleared by a military commission. The Pentagon reportedly stated that its Inspector General (IG) looked into allegations, made by military lawyers assigned as prosecutors to the military commissions, that the proceedings were rigged to obtain convictions, but the IG did not substantiate the charges.", "Congress took no action with respect to military commissions until after the Supreme Court's Rasul decision. At the end of December 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA). The DTA did not authorize military commissions, but amended title 28, U.S. Code to revoke all judicial jurisdiction over habeas claims by persons detained as \"enemy combatants,\" and it created jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of final decisions of military commissions. The Supreme Court, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , invalidated the military commission system established by presidential order, holding that although Congress had in general authorized the use of military commissions, such commissions were required to follow procedural rules as similar as possible to courts-martial proceedings, as required by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In response, Congress promptly passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) to authorize military commissions and establish procedural rules that are modeled after, but depart from in some significant ways, the UCMJ.", "The Department of Defense issued regulations for the conduct of military commissions pursuant to the MCA. One detainee, David Matthew Hicks of Australia, was convicted of material support to terrorism pursuant to a plea agreement in 2007. In 2008, Salim Hamdan was found guilty of one count of providing material support for terrorism and sentenced to 66 months' imprisonment, but credited with five years' time served. Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al Bahlul of Yemen was found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and solicitation to commit certain war crimes and of providing material support for terrorism in connection with his role as al Qaeda's \"propaganda chief.\" He refused representation and boycotted most of his trial, and was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. ", "On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order requiring that the Guantanamo detention facility be closed no later than a year from the date of the Order. The Order requires specified officials to review all Guantanamo detentions to assess whether the detainee should continue to be held by the United States, transferred or released to another country, or be prosecuted by the United States for criminal offenses. During the review period, the Secretary of Defense is required to take steps to ensure that all proceedings before military commissions and the United States Court of Military Commission Review are halted, although some pretrial proceedings have continued to take place. Fifteen detainees currently stand charged under the MCA, while charges were dismissed without prejudice against five other detainees, one of whom has been ordered released by a federal judge. One case was moved to a federal district court.", "In May, 2009, the Obama Administration announced that it was considering restarting the military commission system with some changes to the procedural rules. The Department of Defense informed Congress about modifications to the Manual for Military Commissions, to take effect July 14, 2009. ", "President Obama's Detention Policy Task Force issued a preliminary report July 20, 2009, reaffirming that the White House considers military commissions to be an appropriate forum for trying some cases involving suspected violations of the laws of the war, although federal criminal court would be the preferred forum for trials of detainees. The disposition of each case referred is to be assigned to a team comprised of DOJ and DOD personnel, including prosecutors from the Office of Military Commissions. Appended to the report was a set of criteria to govern the disposition of cases involving Guantanamo detainees. This protocol identifies three broad categories of factors to be taken into consideration:", "Strength of interest, namely, the nature and gravity of offenses or underlying conduct; identity of victims; location of offense; location and context in which individual was apprehended; and the conduct of the investigation. Efficiency, namely, protection of intelligence source and methods; venue; number of defendants; foreign policy concerns; legal or evidentiary problems; efficiency and resource concerns.

Instead, it establishes chapter 47A in title 10, U.S. Code and excepts military commissions under this chapter from the requirements in article 36. It provides that the UCMJ \"does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commissions except as specifically provided in this chapter.\" While declaring that the enacted chapter is \"based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under [the UCMJ],\" it establishes that \"[t]he judicial construction and application of [the UCMJ] are not binding on military commissions established under this chapter.\" It expressly exempts these military commission from UCMJ articles 10 (speedy trial), 31 (self-incrimination warnings) and 32 (pretrial investigations), and amends articles 21, 28, 48, 50(a), 104, and 106 of the UCMJ to except military commissions under chapter 47A.

The M.O. was initially criticized by some as overly broad in its assertion of jurisdiction, because it could be interpreted to cover non-citizens who had no connection with Al Qaeda or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as offenders or offenses not triable by military commission pursuant to statute or the law of war. A person designated by the President as subject to the M.O. was amenable to detention and possible trial by military tribunal for violations of the law of war and \"other applicable law.\" The MCA largely validated the President's jurisdictional scheme for military commissions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Personal Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The MCA authorizes military commissions to try any \"unlawful enemy combatant,\" which includes:", "(i) a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces); or", "(ii) a person who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.", "Thus, persons who do not directly participate in hostilities, but \"purposefully and materially\" support hostilities, are subject to treatment as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" under the MCA. Citizens who fit the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" are not amenable to trial by military commission under the MCA, but their detention is not expressly precluded.", "The MCA does not define \"hostilities\" or explain what conduct amounts to \"supporting hostilities.\" To the extent that the jurisdiction is interpreted to include conduct that falls outside the accepted definition of participation in an armed conflict, the MCA might run afoul of the courts' historical aversion to trying civilians before military tribunals when other courts are available. It is unclear whether this principle would apply to aliens captured and detained overseas, but the MCA does not appear to exempt from military jurisdiction permanent resident aliens captured in the United States who might otherwise meet the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" It is generally accepted that aliens within the United States are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials that apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, to subject persons to trial by military commission who do not meet the exception carved out by the Supreme Court in ex parte Quirin for unlawful belligerents, to the extent such persons enjoy constitutional protections, would likely raise significant constitutional questions. To date, no resident aliens have been charged for trial before a military commission under the MCA.", "The MCA did not specifically identify who makes the determination that defendants meet the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" The government sought to establish jurisdiction based on the determinations of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), set up by the Pentagon to determine the status of detainees using procedures similar to those the Army uses to determine POW status during traditional wars. The CSRTs, however, are not empowered to determine whether the enemy combatants are unlawful or lawful, which led two military commission judges to hold that CSRT determinations are inadequate to form the basis for the jurisdiction of military commissions. One of the judges determined that the military commission itself is not competent to make the determination, while the other judge appears to have determined that the government's allegations did not set forth sufficient facts to conclude that the defendant, Salim Hamdan, was an unlawful enemy combatant. The Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) reversed. While it agreed that the CSRT determinations are insufficient by themselves to establish jurisdiction, it found the military judge erred in declaring that the status determination had to be made by a competent tribunal other than the military commission itself.", "In denying the government's request to find that CSRT determinations are sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the accused, the CMCR interpreted the MCA to require more than establishing membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The CMCR found:", "no support for [the government's] claim that Congress, through the M.C.A., created a \"comprehensive system\" which sought to embrace and adopt all prior C.S.R.T. determinations that resulted in \"enemy combatant\" status assignments, and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" Similarly, we find no support for [the government's] position regarding the parenthetical language contained in \u00a7 948a(1)(A)(i) of the M.C.A.\u2014\"including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces.\" We do not read this language as declaring that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces is per se an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction before a military commission. We read the parenthetical comment as simply elaborating upon the sentence immediately preceding it. That is, that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents will also qualify as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" under the M.C.A. (emphasis added [by the court]).", "The CMCR further explained that executive branch memoranda defining \"enemy combatant\" status were implemented solely for purposes of continued detention of personnel captured during hostilities and applicability of the Geneva Conventions. By contrast:", "Congress in the M.C.A. was carefully and deliberately defining status for the express purpose of specifying the in personam criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials. In defining what was clearly intended to be limited jurisdiction, Congress also prescribed serious criminal sanctions for those members of this select group who were ultimately convicted by military commissions.", "Further, because detainees could not have known when their CSRT reviews were taking place that the determination could subject them to the jurisdiction of a military commission, the CMCR suggested that the use of CSRT determinations to establish jurisdiction would undermine Congress's intent that military commissions operate as \"regularly constituted court[s], affording all the necessary 'judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples' for purposes of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\"", "As a consequence of the decision, the prosecution has had the burden of proving jurisdiction over each person charged for trial by a military commission. The Manual for Military Commissions was amended in May 2009 to reflect this practice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subject Matter Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The MCA provides jurisdiction to military commissions over \"any offense made punishable by this chapter or the law of war when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant....\" Crimes to be triable by military commission are defined in subchapter VII (10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 950p - 950w). Offenses include the following: murder of protected persons; attacking civilians, civilian objects, or protected property; pillaging; denying quarter; taking hostages; employing poison or similar weapons; using protected persons or property as shields; torture, cruel or inhuman treatment; intentionally causing serious bodily injury; mutilating or maiming; murder in violation of the law of war; destruction of property in violation of the law of war; using treachery or perfidy; improperly using a flag of truce or distinctive emblem; intentionally mistreating a dead body; rape; sexual assault or abuse; hijacking or hazarding a vessel or aircraft; terrorism; providing material support for terrorism; wrongfully aiding the enemy; spying; contempt; perjury and obstruction of justice. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950v. Conspiracy (\u00a7 950v(b)(28)), attempts (\u00a7 950t), and solicitation (\u00a7 950u) to commit the defined acts are also punishable.", "The MCA adopted the list of offenses DOD had authorized for trial by military commission under the presidential order . That list was not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it was intended as an illustration of acts punishable under the law of war or triable by military commissions. The regulations contained an express prohibition of trials for ex post facto crimes.", "Although many of the crimes defined in the MCA seem to be well established offenses against the law of war, at least in the context of an international armed conflict, a court might conclude that some of the listed crimes are new. For example, a plurality of the Supreme Court in Hamdan agreed that conspiracy is not a war crime under the traditional law of war. The crime of \"murder in violation of the law of war,\" which punishes persons who commit hostile acts that result in the death of any persons, including lawful combatants, may also be new, depending on how it is interpreted. The Department of Defense has argued that the element \"in violation of the law of war\" is established by showing that the perpetrator is an unprivileged belligerent. While it appears to be well established that a civilian who kills a lawful combatant is triable for murder and cannot invoke the defense of combatant immunity, it is not clear that the murder constitutes a violation of the law of war (rather than domestic or martial law), or that the same principle applies in armed conflicts of a non-international nature, where combatant immunity does not apply. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has found that war crimes in the context of non-international armed conflict include murder of protected persons, but have implied that the killing of a combatant is not necessarily a war crime. Thus, prison guards at Omarska and other detention camps were found guilty, among other crimes, of \"murder, as a violation of the laws or customs of war.\" Similarly, the International Criminal Court applies a definition of murder in the context of a non-international armed conflict to require that the victim is a protected person, while the killing (or wounding) of a \"combatant adversary\" is defined as a war crime only if it is done \"treacherously.\"", "While one of the Guantanamo military commission judges found, without elaborating on what \"murder in violation of the law of war\" entails, that Congress could reasonably conclude that it constitutes a common law violation of the law of war, another read the crime to consist of two elements: \"the [attempted] killings ...were committed by an unlawful enemy combatant AND (2) that the method, manner or circumstances used violated the law of war.\" There is historical support for the view that the offense pertains to means and methods of killing, but the requirement that the offender be an \"unlawful combatant\" is not well supported. Military commissions were used during the U.S. Civil War to try the charge of \"murder in violation of the law of war,\" but this charge apparently applied to privileged belligerents who committed murder perfidiously or who killed prisoners of war, while unprivileged belligerents were charged simply with murder. The charge of \"murder, in violation of the laws of war\" was occasionally brought against Filipino natives during the Philippine Insurrection, generally involving the killing of unarmed civilians or prisoners. However, it is not easy to discern why some cases were charged as \"murder\" while others had added the phrase \"in violation of the laws of war.\" Sometimes the distinction appears to turn on the status of the victim, while sometimes the determining factor seems to be the status of the perpetrator, or more precisely, the authority under which the hostile act was carried out. Murder qualified by reference to the law of war was charged most frequently against those whose legitimacy as combatants was not challenged. In one case in which insurgents killed U.S. soldiers during a firefight, the conviction for murder in the violation of the laws of war was overturned in part on the basis that \"[t]he killing of the deceased soldiers in an engagement with a regular detachment of the public enemy is not murder but a natural consequence incidental to a state of war.\" ", "Similarly, defining as a war crime the \"material support for terrorism\" does not appear to be supported by historical precedent. The military judge in the Hamdan military commission case deferred to Congress's determination in the MCA that \"material support for terrorism\" describes a traditional offense against the law of war, citing Civil War precedents for trying crimes such as cooperating with guerrillas or \"guerrilla-marauders.\" Yet the Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan may have limited the extent to which such crimes may be tried by military commissions where martial law has not been established, and may also call into question whether such crimes are properly considered war crimes or should be treated as ordinary crimes triable by military commissions when necessity demands it. Charges related to aiding guerrillas were typically accompanied by a specification stating that the accused was a citizen and owed allegiance to the United States, but not ordinarily stating that the activity violated the law of war, suggesting that the offense was a violation of martial law rather than the international law of war applicable to belligerents.", "Many persons were tried by military commissions during the Philippine Insurrection for consorting with insurgents or other armed outlaws, but only after the commanding general issued a proclamation to the public explaining its obligation under the law of military occupation (a subset of the law of war analogous to martial law) to refrain from such activity. In any event, the Obama Administration has expressed misgivings as to whether the crime of \"material support for terrorism\" amounts to an ex post facto law, and recommended the offense be eliminated from the MCA. All but one of the detainees against whom charges have been filed so far have had at least one count of \"material support for terrorism\" among them, although in most cases the allegations underlying the charge appear under other charges as well. ", "Part IV of the Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.) sets forth the elements of crimes defined by the MCA. There are few substantive differences between the M.M.C. definitions and those previously set forth DOD regulations for military commissions prior to the MCA. The M.M.C. definition of \"Aiding the Enemy\" incorporates the element of wrongfulness added by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950v(26), necessitating a new finding that the accused owed some form of allegiance to the United States at the time the conduct took place. Two crimes, \"mutilation or maiming\" and \"causing serious injury,\" were altered to remove the element that required that the victim was in the custody or control of the accused. The crime \"murder by an unprivileged belligerent\" was broadened in the definition of \"murder in violation of the law of war\" to include not just killing, but also deaths resulting from an act or omission of the accused, where the accused intended to kill the victim or victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporal and Spatial Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The law of war has traditionally applied within the territorial and temporal boundaries of an armed conflict between at least two belligerents. It traditionally has not been applied to conduct occurring on the territory of neutral states or on territory not under the control of a belligerent, to conduct that preceded the outbreak of hostilities, or to conduct during hostilities that do not amount to an armed conflict. Unlike the conflict in Afghanistan, the conflict related to the September 11 attacks does not have clear boundaries in time or space, nor is it entirely clear who the belligerents are.", "The broad reach of President Bush's M.O. to encompass conduct and persons customarily subject to ordinary criminal law evoked criticism that the claimed jurisdiction of the military commissions exceeded the customary law of armed conflict, although DOD regulation purported to restate customary law. The MCA provides jurisdiction to military commissions over covered offenses \"when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after September 11, 2001.\" The elements of crimes set forth in the Manual for Military Commissions include a nexus to an armed conflict, but neither the manual nor the MCA contains a definition. The Supreme Court has not clarified the scope of the conflict authorized by Congress in 2001, but it has not simply deferred to the President's interpretation.", "In enacting the MCA, Congress seems to have provided the necessary statutory definitions of criminal offenses to overcome previous objections with respect to subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions. However, questions may still arise with respect to the necessity for conduct to occur in the context of an armed conflict in order to be triable by military commission. There is no express requirement to that effect in the MCA. The overall purpose of the statute together with the elements of some of the crimes arguably may be read to require a nexus. In 2008, the military judge in the Hamdan case concluded as much, holding that a charge of \"[m]embership in a conspiracy that planned and carried out the attacks of September 11 th , 2001 will be deemed to be in violation of the law of war; membership in a conspiracy that planned or carried out other attacks long before that date and unrelated to hostilities will not.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Composition and Powers", "paragraphs": ["The DOD regulations for military commissions prior to the MCA provided for military commissions to consist of panels of three to seven military officers as well as one or more alternate members who had been \"determined to be competent to perform the duties involved\" by the Secretary of Defense or his designee, and could include reserve personnel on active duty, National Guard personnel in active federal service, and retired personnel recalled to active duty. The rules also permitted the appointment of persons temporarily commissioned by the President to serve as officers in the armed services during a national emergency. The presiding officer was required to be a judge advocate in any of the U.S. armed forces, but not necessarily a military judge.", "The MCA provides for a qualified military judge to preside over panels of at least five military officers, except in the cases in which the death penalty is sought, in which case the minimum number of panel members is twelve. Procedures for assigning military judges as well as the particulars regarding the duties they are to perform are left to the Secretary of Defense to prescribe, except that the military judge may not be permitted to consult with members of the panel outside of the presence of the accused and counsel except as prescribed in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0949d. The military judge has the authority to decide matters related to the admissibility of evidence, including the treatment of classified information, but has no authority to compel the government to produce classified information.", "Like the previous DOD rules, the MCA empowers military commissions to maintain decorum during proceedings. Previously, the presiding officer was authorized \"to act upon any contempt or breach of Commission rules and procedures,\" including disciplining any individual who violates any \"laws, rules, regulations, or other orders\" applicable to the commission, as the presiding officer saw fit. Presumably this power was to include not only military and civilian attorneys but also any witnesses who had been summoned under order of the Secretary of Defense. The MCA, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950w authorizes the military commissions to \"punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in its presence, or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder.\" It is unclear whether this section is meant to expand the jurisdiction of military commissions to cover non-enemy combatant witnesses or civilian observers, but the M.M.C. expressly provides for jurisdiction over all persons, including civilians, and permits military judges to sentence those convicted with both fines and terms of confinement. In the case of military commissions established under the UCMJ, there is statutory authority for military commissions to punish contempt with a fine of $100, confinement for up to 30 days, or both. Neither the MCA nor the M.M.C. sets any limit on punishment for contempt. ", "The MCA provides that military commissions have the same power as a general court-martial to compel witnesses to appear in a manner \"similar to that which courts of the United States having criminal jurisdiction may lawfully issue.\" However, rather than providing that the trial counsel and the defense are to have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, as is the case in general courts-martial, the MCA provides the defense a \"reasonable opportunity\" to obtain witnesses and evidence. The M.M.C. provides the trial counsel with responsibility for producing witnesses requested by the defense, unless trial counsel determines the witness's testimony is not required, but the defense counsel may appeal the determination to the convening authority or, after referral, the military judge.", "Under article 47 of the UCMJ, a duly subpoenaed witness who is not subject to the UCMJ and who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court. Presumably, this article could be used to prosecute civilians residing in U.S. territory who refuse to comply with a subpoena issued under the MCA. The M.M.C. provides the military judge or any person designated to take evidence authority to issue a subpoena to compel the presence of a witness or the production of documents. As is the case with general courts-martial, the military judge may issue a warrant of attachment to compel the presence of a witness who refuses to comply with a subpoena. Subpoena authority under the UCMJ may not be used to compel a civilian witness to travel abroad in order to provide testimony, so the corresponding authority under the MCA be insufficient to compel civilian witnesses to travel to Cuba. Testimony by video transmission may be permitted in such cases.", "One of the perceived shortcomings of the M.O. had to do with the problem of command influence over commission personnel. M.C.O. No. 1 provided for a \"full and fair trial,\" but contained few specific safeguards to address the issue of impartiality. The President or his designee were empowered to decide which charges to press; to select the members of the panel, the prosecution and the defense counsel, and the members of the review panel; and to approve and implement the final outcome. The President or his designees had the authority to write procedural rules, interpret them, enforce them, and amend them. Justice Kennedy remarked in his concurring opinion in Hamdan v. Rumsfed that the concentration of authority in the Appointing Authority was a significant departure from the structural safeguards Congress has built into the military justice system. ", "The MCA, by providing requirements for the procedural rules to guard against command influence, may alleviate these concerns. In particular, the MCA prohibits the unlawful influence of military commissions and provides that neither the military commission members nor military counsel may have adverse actions taken against them in performance reviews. Many of the procedural rules are left to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense or his designee, more so than is the case under the UCMJ. Rule 104 of the Rules for Military Commissions (R.M.C.) prohibits command influence in terms similar to those in the Manual for Courts-Martial, except that they apply more broadly to \"all persons\" rather than only to \"all persons subject to the [UCMJ].\" ", "On the other hand, it has been argued that the multiple roles assigned to the convening authority, the DOD official who decides which charges to bring, allocates resources among the parties, and then approves or disapproves the findings of the military commission, create an inherent risk of unfairness (or the perception of unfairness). While the convening authority for courts-martial also plays multiple roles, these functions serve as commanders' tools for enforcing discipline among subordinates, a context that arguably differs in important ways from bringing criminal cases against alleged enemies. Improper influence by the legal advisor to the convening authority has been alleged at a few military commission proceedings, prompting military judges to issue orders in some cases granting relief. Executive branch control over who serves as military judges has also led to charges of unfairness.

Further, \"evidence known to trial counsel,\" includes evidence that the prosecution would be required to disclose in a trial by general court-martial, which covers information under the control of the government.", "The Obama Administration has proposed some amendments to section 1031 of S. 1390 . ", "It proposes excluding all involuntarily given statements by the accused, rather than just those obtained through the use of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The voluntariness standard would entail taking into account the \"challenges and realities of the battlefield and armed conflict.\" It does not propose a requirement that battlefield captives be warned that their statements can be used against them, as is the case in ordinary criminal prosecutions in U.S. courts. The Obama Administration would retain language asserting that offenses are codifications of the common law of war, but would eliminate the material support charge. The Administration supports the Senate proposal for treating hearsay evidence, but would adopt a somewhat different standard as to when the exception should apply, based on whether the hearsay evidence is more probative than other evidence that could be procured through reasonable efforts, rather than strictly on the availability of the witness to testify. The Administration proposes keeping the present appellate structure intact, but modifying the role of the Court of Military Commissions Review to make it more like one of the services Courts of Criminal Appeals, empowering it to address questions of fact as well as law. The Administration would include a five-year sunset provision for the M.C.A.", "The following charts provide a comparison of the military tribunals under the regulations issued by the Department of Defense, standard procedures for general courts-martial under the Manual for Courts-Martial, and military tribunals as authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.
