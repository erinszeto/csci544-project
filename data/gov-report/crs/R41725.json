It requires the President in every possible instance to consult with Congress before introducing American armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities unless there has been a declaration of war or other specific congressional authorization. It also requires the President to report to Congress any introduction of forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities, Section 4(a)(1); into foreign territory while equipped for combat, Section 4(a)(2); or in numbers which substantially enlarge U.S. forces equipped for combat already in a foreign nation, Section 4(a)(3). Once a report is submitted \"or required to be submitted\" under Section 4(a)(1), Congress must authorize the use of force within 60 to 90 days or the forces must be withdrawn.

The Defense Department expects that operations in the following three weeks through April 16 could cost about $40 million more, or a weekly average of about $13 million. DOD also projects that continuing operations will cost about $40 million a month thereafter, without significant munitions costs, though it acknowledges that future costs are highly uncertain.", "These figures suggest that DOD expects that costs could decline from about $550 million for the first 10 days of operation to a weekly rate of $13 million through April 16, 2011, and $10 million a week after that, with much of the difference presumably reflecting lower operating tempo and lower costs for additional munitions.", "At that rate of expenditures, DOD estimates that the total incremental cost (i.e., expenses over and above the normal costs of day-to-day activities) of Libya-related operations could reach about $800 million during FY2011. The Defense Department expects to cover the added operational costs temporarily, at least, through \"cash flowing,\" which involves reallocating funds originally intended for other purposes within the defense budget.

The munitions expended are being drawn from current inventories, which may not be replenished immediately. ", "A key question about DOD cost estimates has to do with the ongoing nature of the mission. U.S. costs of continued enforcement of a no-fly zone might be quite limited, since Libyan air operations appear to have ceased. U.S. expenses for maintaining a no-fly zone would be further constrained if allies carry out most of the ongoing flight operations. U.S. contributions might then be restricted to providing surveillance and air traffic control capabilities with Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, for example, supplemented by other intelligence and communications activities and maintenance of reserve forces for additional missions. Even some of those capabilities could come from allies\u2014NATO has AWACS aircraft as well. Moreover, many of the capabilities the United States would contribute under those circumstances are normally on station in the Mediterranean or nearby, so the incremental costs (i.e., expenses over and above normal operating costs) might be limited to begin with. ", "Conversely, U.S. costs might climb to the extent the mission involves continuing attacks on ground targets. In that case, U.S. strike aircraft might be preferred over allied forces, particularly because of extensive U.S. experience in recent conflicts and the precision strike capabilities of U.S. forces. U.S. forces have been using the Global Hawk unpiloted air vehicle (UAV) for ground surveillance.

Of these, Operation Noble Anvil, the air war in Yugoslavia designed to contain a conflict in Kosovo, was the most intense. It involved initially limited and later extensive attacks to degrade air defenses throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including all of Serbia. Those were followed by escalating air attacks initially focused on the military infrastructure and later on strategic targets. The operation lasted for two and a half months, from March 24 through June 10, 1999. The operation\u2014including the no-fly zone and extensive additional activities\u2014cost a total of $1.8 billion.", "Toward the lower end of the spectrum are costs of the two no-fly zone operations in Iraq. The costs to the U.S. Government of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) averaged somewhat more than $700 million per year, or $60 million a month, although the amounts varied substantially from year to year. Costs of Operation Northern Watch (ONW) averaged about $123 million a year, or $10 million a month. The OSW mission required coverage of a relatively large geographic area, punctuated by occasional strikes against Iraqi air defense sites. U.S. aircraft were not necessarily always in the air, however, since they were based close to Iraqi airspace. The operation imposed a considerable burden on U.S. Air Force units, mainly because of its long duration.", "Perhaps in the middle of the spectrum, at least in cost, are air operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the mid-1990s. Operation Joint Endeavor, carried out under the auspices of the Implementation Force (IFOR) from December 1995 to December 1996, involved a similar range of air operations as the current mission in Libya. Air operations included enforcement of a no-fly zone, attacks on Bosnian-Serb military forces, and close air support for Croatian ground operations. The combination of air and ground operations ultimately may have helped shift the balance of power in Bosnia enough to foster a political settlement. Air Force and Navy costs (though not entirely limited to air operations), totaled $298 million in FY1995 and $446 million in FY1996. IFOR operations continued for only the first three months of FY1996, so air operation costs appear quite substantial.", "Whether the costs of these earlier operations provide a reasonable basis of comparison with current costs is uncertain. Inflation in itself would increase costs by about 50%. Current costs for comparable operations may also be higher today.

Earlier press reports cited a recent study by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments which estimated the cost of initial operations and the cost of establishing and continuing a no-fly zone using various top-down methods and historical costs. This study estimates that initial operations could run between $500 million and $1 billion, based on attacks on some 250 to 500 targets, and that the ongoing cost of a no-fly zone could range from $15 million to $300 million a week depending on the area of Libya that would be covered.

This estimate reflects operational details provided in DOD press briefing, which may not capture full costs. Like DOD's estimate, the bulk of these costs reflect potential replacement costs for the Tomahawk missiles launched from Navy ships and the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) dropped by B-2 bombers at the beginning of the operation to suppress Libyan air defenses (about $285 million). The estimate in Table 1 also shows the potential cost of replacing the F-15E strike fighter aircraft lost over Libya because of mechanical failures ($75 million replacement cost), which DOD does not count in its estimate. ", "Together, these hardware costs for the aircraft and munitions could total about $360 million, or about 85% of the estimated total, with munitions expended alone accounting for 70% of the total (see Table 1 ). Unless Libya is able to reconstitute its air defense network and airfields, daily munitions costs are likely to decline sharply. Further, on March 30, 2011, allied countries assumed full operation of the combat air patrol portion of Libya operations, further reducing U.S. expenses.", "DOD may or may not request additional funds to replace this hardware. It is not clear whether either the F-15 lost or all of the Tomahawk missiles expended would qualify as war-related expenses. Since 2009, DOD has been following new criteria for war-related funding, which prohibit requests for procurement items which are already scheduled for replacement. The Air Force expects to replace F-15E fighter aircraft with Joint Strike Fighters and some of the Tomahawk missiles used were of an older variant which is being replaced with a new version. The Navy may not need to replace all those expended, as some of the missiles used were of the older variant that is currently being replaced. The Navy is currently buying some 196 new Tomahawk missiles to expand the size of its current inventory. \"[T]he Tomahawks will be replaced from the existing inventory, [Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary] Roughead said. More than 3,200 Tomahawks are in the inventory, and the missiles used in the operation represent 'relatively minor increases in cost,' he added.\"", "If the Administration does not request a supplemental, DOD could re-direct funds for some or all Libya-related hardware costs from another internal source, as is done each year in reprogrammings or transfers submitted to the four congressional defense committees by which DOD moves funds from less- to more-urgent needs. Typically, DOD reprograms several billion dollars each year. Alternatively, DOD could accept temporarily reduced inventory levels for munitions until the delivery of new procurements, or permanently reduced inventory levels without requesting replacement weapons.

Most of the operational costs are being paid for out of the Air Force's FY2011 Operations & Maintenance (O&M) account, which includes some $21.0 billion dedicated to training for combat operations and related support.
