Successful recruiting efforts, aided by a downturn in the U.S. economy, enabled the Army and Marine Corps to achieve these new end strength targets three years earlier than originally projected. Even with these increases, the nation's armed forces, especially the Army and Marine Corps, continue to experience high deployment rates.

However, Congress, in FYs 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009 approved the pay raise as the ECI increase plus 0.5%. The FY2007 pay raise was equal to the ECI.

This practice was forbidden by law until 2004. The first time concurrent receipt legislation was enacted was in FY2003, and successive legislation since then has extended concurrent receipt to additional populations and further modified the program. There are two common criteria that define eligibility for concurrent receipt: (1) all recipients must be military retirees and (2) they must also be eligible for VA disability compensation. Beyond these common criteria, there are separate and distinct components: (1) Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) for those with service-verified combat disabilities and (2) Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for those with service-connected disabilities. A retiree cannot receive both CRSC and CRDP. At present, all disabled retirees with combat-related disabilities rated at 10% or greater are eligible for CRSC. However, two groups of retirees with service-connected disabilities are not currently eligible: (1) Chapter 61 retirees (a reference to the chapter of Title 10 that governs military disability retirement) who were determined to be unfit for continued military service and generally due to service-connected (CRDP) disabilities prior to completing 20 years of service, and (2) longevity retirees (those with 20 or more years of service) who have service-connected (CRDP) disabilities rated at 40% or less.", "The President's FY2010 Budget request proposed a concurrent receipt expansion similar to that in H.R. 2647 .

Reservists are also eligible to retire after 20 years of qualifying service, but until recently they could not receive retired pay or access to retiree health benefits until age 60. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 ( P.L. 110-181 ) contained a provision which permitted certain reservists to draw retired pay as early as age 50, while maintaining the age for access to the military health care system at 60. This provision reduced the age for receipt of retired pay for members of the Ready Reserve by three months for each aggregate of 90 days of specified duty performed. Specified duty includes active duty under any provision of law referred to in 10 USC 101(a)(13)(B), active duty under 10 USC 12301(d); or active service under 32 USC 502(f) if responding to a national emergency declared by the President or supported by federal funds. However, the provision only applied to duty performed after January 28, 2008 (the date of enactment of P.L. 110-181 ).

", "Discussion: The Senate provision would have expanded the time frame in which qualifying duty performed by reservists could be counted towards early receipt of retired pay by including any such duty performed since September 11, 2001. Given the large number of reservists who performed qualifying duty between September 11, 2001, and January 28, 2008, this would have significantly increased the number of reservists eligible to receive retired pay prior to age 60.

Those already in the military who had renounced a previous affiliation with a hate group would have been exempted from separation. There was no exemption for those seeking to join the military who have renounced a previous affiliation, which could have affected recruiting in neighborhoods where some form of criminal gang affiliation by teenagers is relatively common.

The legislation mirrored a similar prohibition applicable to the Medicare program. As with Medicare, employers can continue to offer \"cafeteria benefit plans.\" The legislation was intended to address employer shifting of health-care costs to Tricare. After enactment, many Tricare beneficiaries no longer were offered Tricare supplements as an employer-sponsored benefit. Insurance companies that marketed such supplemental plans were also impacted by the provision. There also is some question as to whether loss of employer-provided Tricare supplemental insurance may have led Tricare beneficiaries to move from Tricare Standard to Tricare Prime and the budgetary consequences to the Defense Health Program of such an enrollment shift.
