One set of bills would authorize a legalization program for certain agricultural workers. Another set of bills, known as the DREAM Act, would enable certain unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the United States as children (often described as students) to become LPRs. There has been ongoing debate among supporters of legalization in recent years as to whether it is advisable to pursue an incremental approach and try to enact measures to grant legal status to certain segments of the unauthorized population, such as agricultural workers and students, as stepping stones to a broader legalization, or whether the better strategy is to press for these more limited legalization programs only as part of one larger package. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agricultural Worker Bills", "paragraphs": ["Since the late 1990s, major immigration legislation has been regularly introduced in Congress that would help make legal agricultural workers more readily available to U.S. employers. Such legislation has often combined a reform of the existing H-2A temporary agricultural worker program with a legalization program for certain agricultural workers in the United States. Beginning in the 108 th Congress, major immigration legislation combining H-2A reform and agricultural worker legalization was known as the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or AgJOBS. AgJOBS was regularly introduced in Congress as stand-alone legislation and was a standard feature of comprehensive immigration reform bills in past Congresses.", "More recently, there has been a move away from the AgJOBS formulation with its H-2A reform component. Instead, Senate and House bills on foreign temporary agricultural workers in the 113 th Congress would combine establishment of new temporary agricultural worker visas with provisions to enable certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal temporary or permanent immigration status in the United States. The agricultural worker provisions in S. 744 , as passed by the Senate, would establish a two-stage legalization program, through which farm workers who had performed a requisite amount of agricultural work in past years and who satisfy other requirements could obtain a temporary resident status, termed \"blue card\" status. After performing additional agricultural work and meeting other requirements, these workers could apply for LPR status. An alternative proposal in the House, the Agricultural Guestworker Act ( H.R. 1773 ), as ordered to be reported by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal temporary status under a new agricultural worker visa program.

In the 111 th Congress, the House approved DREAM Act language as part of another bill. DREAM Act legislation, which sometimes carries a different name, would enable eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status in the United States through cancellation of removal (see \" Cancellation of Removal \"). While in legalizing its target population through the cancellation of removal procedure the DREAM Act is arguably using an existing mechanism under immigration law, the legislation is also effectively creating a new legalization program with a tailored set of procedures and requirements. An alien granted cancellation of removal under the DREAM Act would be adjusted initially to a conditional legal status. To have the condition removed and become a full-fledged LPR under standard versions of the DREAM Act, the alien would have to meet additional requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Establishing New Mechanisms: General Population", "paragraphs": ["In 2005 and 2006, during the 109 th Congress, and in 2013, during the 113 th Congress, immigration reform took center stage. In the 109 th Congress, these efforts led to passage of major immigration bills in the Senate and the House. The bill passed by the Senate ( S. 2611 ) contained a new general legalization program. The House-passed bill ( H.R. 4437 ) contained no such provisions, and the two bills were never reconciled.

These various proposals can be seen as striking different balances between the granting of relief to unauthorized aliens on the one hand and the imposition of requirements, such as penalties and wait times (in consideration of the aliens' unlawful status and of other aliens' lawful pursuit of legal status), on the other. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "To Obtain LPR Status", "paragraphs": ["A number of proposals have been put forward in recent years to grant LPR status to a significant portion of the unauthorized population. Under these various proposals, applicants typically must meet a set of requirements in order to, as it is sometimes termed, \"get right with the law\" and \"earn\" relief. Continuous physical presence requirements and work requirements are common, and applicants often must pay fines. Other requirements may include payment of federal income taxes and demonstration of basic citizenship skills. These proposals also commonly include a \"back of the line\" provision, which would require eligible aliens to wait to adjust to LPR status. The waiting period is often pegged to when visas become available for aliens whose permanent employment-based or family-based petitions were filed under current law prior to enactment of the legalization program, and is also sometimes defined as a minimum number of years. Under these legalization proposals, adjustments of status are typically not subject to any existing INA numerical limitations.", "New mechanisms for adjustment to LPR status have taken different forms. For example, S. 2611 , as passed by the Senate in the 109 th Congress, proposed to establish a one-stage legalization program for eligible aliens. More recent comprehensive immigration bills, including Senate-passed S. 744 in the 113 th Congress, have often included two-stage legalization programs, in which eligible aliens first apply for some type of temporary status and then apply to adjust to LPR status. At each stage, applicants must meet a set of requirements. Under some two-stage legalization proposals, unauthorized aliens would apply for temporary guest worker status in the first stage and then could apply to adjust to LPR status in the second stage. Another version of a two-stage legalization mechanism would have aliens first apply for temporary legal status, and then apply to adjust to LPR status under current law, as opposed to through a special legalization program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "To Obtain Temporary Residence and Other Statuses", "paragraphs": ["Another category of proposals has sought to provide relief to unauthorized immigrants in the United States without providing them a pathway to LPR status. One subset of these proposals would create mechanisms for unauthorized aliens to obtain nonimmigrant status, in some cases as temporary workers. Some of these proposals would place a limit on the number of years an alien could be in the nonimmigrant status, while others would allow aliens to remain in the nonimmigrant status indefinitely, provided that they continued to meet the applicable requirements. ", "A second subset of proposals would enable eligible unauthorized immigrants to remain in the United States for a certain period of time but would not grant them an established legal immigration status. Instead they would be granted a type of \"quasi-legal\" status that would enable them to remain in the United States temporarily. One type of \"quasi-legal\" status that was proposed for unauthorized aliens in past Congresses was termed Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status. Under one concept of DMD status, this status would be granted for a limited period of time to unauthorized aliens who meet a set of requirements to enable the aliens to leave the United States and to seek legal admission as nonimmigrant or immigrant aliens from abroad. The aliens would not receive any special consideration for that admission, but, if they complied with the terms of DMD status and departed prior to its expiration date, they would not be subject to the ground of inadmissibility discussed above that bars previously unlawfully present aliens from being admitted to the United States for 3 or 10 years.
