Previous cutbacks to CVP deliveries (in particular during periods of increased precipitation) have caused some to criticize Reclamation's management of the CVP and question the extent to which factors beyond limited water supplies (e.g., restrictions to protect endangered species and water quality) influence water management and the quantity of water delivered to contractors. They argue that congressionally directed changes in the operation of the CVP that would result in increases to water allocations are needed. Other stakeholders argue that some of these changes could undercut environmental regulations, harm fish and wildlife, and potentially lower water quality.

In contrast to recent years, Reclamation estimated that it would be able to provide 100% of CVP water supplies for most water rights contractors with senior water rights predating the project, including Sacramento River Settlement Contractors and San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors. NOD CVP agricultural and M&I water service contractors also were expected to receive their full contract allotments in 2017, as were Friant Division contractors. Most CVP SOD agricultural water service contractors, including those in many of the state's largest and most prominent agricultural areas, received an initial allocation of 65% of contracted supplies, and SOD M&I contractors initially received a 90% allocation for 2017. However, these allocations were subsequently revised upward to 100% in April 2017.

", "Reclamation previously had noted that its lower initial allocation for SOD agricultural water service contractors was largely a result of two factors: (1) a conservative estimate of water supplies expected to be added to the system for the remainder of the year (thus, if the remainder of the year is not abnormally dry, the initial allocation might increase) and (2) limits to available water supplies in the federal half of San Luis Reservoir (an important provider of SOD water storage) due to rescheduled and carryover water from 2016. Reclamation noted that for 2017, environmental restrictions (e.g., Endangered Species Act and state water quality requirements) were expected to account for a relatively small share of cutbacks relative to prior years. To minimize future limitations on storage and allocations associated with the second item above, Reclamation stated that it plans to limit the availability of water to be carried over to the 2018 contract year to a maximum of 150,000 acre-feet.

Many plant and animal populations declined, and a number of major wildfires occurred throughout the state. Some of these effects may linger for years. Thus, considerable attention is likely to be paid to CVP and SWP allocations in 2017 and beyond.", "Although agriculture constitutes a much smaller percentage of California's economy now than it did in the early and mid-20 th century, California agriculture is still the nation's largest producer in terms of cash farm receipts\u2014accounting for 12.5% of the U.S. total in 2015, the last year for which national data are available. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture/National Agricultural Statistics Service Crop Year Report, California farm and ranch receipts totaled $47 billion in 2015, down from $57 billion and $55 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although some agricultural users with access to groundwater or other supplies may have seen receipts grow despite the drought, others had to fallow land or uproot trees and shrubs. Some livestock producers had to purchase supplemental hay and grain. Fruit and nut orchards largely rely on irrigation to keep trees alive, and hundreds of thousands of acres were fallowed because sufficient water was not available. ", "In addition to agriculture, water flows are also critical for hydropower, recreation, and fish and wildlife. For example, cool temperatures are needed in waterways and lakes to maintain aquatic ecosystems and species viability. Some salmon runs experienced a 95% loss of eggs laid in 2015 due to warm water temperatures, and surveys of Delta smelt in June 2016 found 13 adult smelt, the lowest catch in the history of the survey (the total population is estimated at 13,000\u2014a record low. Although recent rains and projected runoff may improve conditions for salmon and smelt, poor ocean conditions in 2015 and 2016 will affect adult returns for coho and Chinook salmon; thus, 2017 returns remain uncertain. In addition to fisheries, recreational reservoirs, river-rafting opportunities, and recreational and commercial fisheries are all potentially at risk during a drought. California wetlands, which might adversely be affected by drought, also provide Pacific Flyway habitat, which is critical to migrating birds. Thus, some observers pay close attention to the allocations not only for irrigators but also to wildlife refuges and species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Factors", "paragraphs": ["Complicating the hydrologic situation and water supply allocations is a complex web of state and federal regulatory requirements on CVP and SWP operations.

", "In many years, pumping restrictions to protect state-set water quality levels, particularly increases in salinity levels, are greater than restrictions to protect endangered species. In contrast, in wet years, pumping restrictions due to regulations under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531 et seq.) may have a higher impact on exports than water quality restrictions, and they may have proportionally higher impacts in certain months. There is disagreement over how much water might be available absent state and federal restrictions. Reclamation estimated that ESA restrictions accounted for a reduction of 62,000 acre-feet from the long-term average for CVP deliveries in 2014, while water quality restrictions accounted for another 176,300 acre-feet of this reduction. For 2015, Reclamation estimated that ESA accounted for approximately 144,800 acre-feet of CVP delivery reductions from the long-term average, but did not have a comparable estimate for water quality restrictions. For its part, DWR estimated that ESA restrictions resulted in a reduction of 47,000 acre-feet to SWP deliveries in water year 2014, and a reduction of 92,000 acre-feet in water year 2015. Comparable figures were not available for water quality restrictions.", "Ongoing cutbacks to CVP contractor allocations during times of increased water supplies have caused continuing criticism of Reclamation's operation of the CVP. As previously noted, Reclamation argued that its 2017 allocations for SOD users were largely the result of rescheduled and carryover storage in San Luis Reservoir requested by service contractors and contained minimal restrictions associated with environmental regulations. However, some users have noted that they would not need to be so reliant on carryover and rescheduled water in San Luis Reservoir if there were more certainty of additional water supplies during drought years.", "In recent years, debates have focused on the extent to which factors other than drought (e.g., endangered species and water quality requirements) have led to curtailments. To address these concerns and provide more water to agricultural and municipal contractors, some have proposed, among other approaches, that Congress amend Reclamation's directives in operating the CVP, including directing altered implementation of regulatory requirements under ESA that may restrict pumping operations (some of these proposals were enacted in the WIIN Act, see \" WIIN Act ,\" below). Others, however, are opposed to modifying the implementation of ESA regulations and propose water conservation, water recycling, and increased storage, among other strategies, to provide more water for users and avoid possible extinction of certain species.

Opponents worried that the changes may have detrimental effects on species' survival in both the short and long terms and may limit agency efforts to manage water supplies for the benefit of species. Some of the notable CVP operational provisions in the WIIN Act aimed to provide the Administration with authority to make available more water supplies during periods in which pumping otherwise would have been limited. According to Reclamation, changes in the WIIN Act that directed increased communication and transparency in certain operational decisions influenced some decisions in the early part of winter 2016-2017 and led to the avoidance of certain pumping restrictions. However, Reclamation also has stated that many of the act's other authorities seem most applicable to drought years, when sensitivity to reverse flows in the delta is particularly acute and the need to preserve and maximize the use of available water supplies often is at its highest.
