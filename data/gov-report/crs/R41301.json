This spending includes premium tax credits and other subsidies for individuals and families that purchase private insurance coverage through the health insurance exchanges established under the ACA, as well as federal matching funds for states that have expanded their Medicaid programs.", "In addition, the ACA included numerous appropriations that have provided billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support new and existing grant programs and other activities. Other ACA provisions require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to transfer amounts from the Medicare Part A and Part B trust funds for specified purposes. The law appropriated significant amounts to support short-term health care programs for targeted groups prior to the health insurance exchanges becoming operational in 2014. It also created a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and appropriated $10 billion for the FY2011-FY2019 period\u2014and $10 billion for each subsequent 10-year period\u2014for CMMI to test and implement innovative payment and service delivery models.", "The ACA established four special funds and appropriated substantial amounts to each one. First, the Community Health Center Fund, to which the ACA appropriated a total of $11 billion over the five-year period FY2011-FY2015, has helped support the federal health centers program and the National Health Service Corps. Second, the Prevention and Public Health Fund, for which the ACA provided a permanent annual appropriation, is supporting prevention, wellness, and other programs authorized under the Public Health Service Act. Third, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund is supporting comparative effectiveness research through FY2019 with a mix of annual appropriations, fees assessed on private health insurance, and Medicare trust fund transfers. Finally, the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund, to which the ACA appropriated $1 billion, helped pay for implementing the law. Overall, the ACA included more than $100 billion in appropriations over the 10-year period FY2010-FY2019, including $40 billion to fund the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for FY2014 and FY2015.", "In subsequent legislative actions, Congress has extended funding through FY2017 for several programs whose ACA appropriations were about to expire, and reduced or rescinded ACA funding other some other activities.", "Federal outlays on insurance expansion coverage under the ACA, which constitutes most of the law's mandatory spending, are almost entirely exempt from sequestration.

For calendar year 2014, the 27 states that implemented the expansion reported spending a total of $36.7 billion on newly eligible adults, which under the ACA was paid for entirely with federal funds (i.e., 100% federal match). The same states spent an additional $10.5 billion on adults that were previously eligible at traditional federal match rates or subject to technical adjustments. Expenditures for these individuals were subject to a higher rate than the traditional match rate, but not 100%. ", "In its March 2016 baseline budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that gross spending on insurance coverage expansion under the ACA will total $1.938 trillion over the 10-year period FY2017 through FY2026. That total includes $866 billion on exchanges subsidies\u2014premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions\u2014and related spending, and $1.063 trillion on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CBO projects that these costs will be offset by revenues from the ACA's taxes and fees, and by savings from the law's changes to the Medicare program that are designed to slow the rate of growth of Medicare payments to certain health care providers.", "The ACA also included numerous appropriations that are providing billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support new and existing grant programs and other activities.

This report is periodically revised and updated to reflect important legislative and other developments.", "A companion CRS report discusses the ACA's impact on discretionary spending, which is controlled by the annual appropriations process. Discretionary spending under the ACA falls into two broad categories. First, there are the amounts provided in appropriations acts for specific grant and other programs pursuant to explicit authorizations of appropriations in the ACA.

The first column shows the ACA section or subsection number. The second column indicates whether the provision is freestanding (i.e., statutory authority that is not amending an existing statute) or amendatory (i.e., amends an existing statute, typically the Social Security Act). Amendatory provisions either add a new program to the statute or modify an existing one. The third column gives a brief description of the program or activity, including details of the appropriation or fund transfer. The entry also includes the name of the administering agency within HHS and, if applicable, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for the grant program. The fourth column shows how much funding has been obligated to date. An agency incurs an obligation, for example, by placing an order, signing a contract, awarding a grant, purchasing a service, or taking other actions that require the government to make payments.

Generally, these funds must be obligated during the fiscal year in which the funds become available for obligation. A few provisions are multiple-year appropriations , in which the amount appropriated is available for obligation for a period of time in excess of one fiscal year (e.g., for the period FY2011 through FY2014). Often the provision includes additional language stating that the funds are to remain available \"until expended\" or \"without fiscal year limitation.\" ", "Most ACA appropriations and fund transfers are temporary (i.e., time-limited). Often they end in FY2014 or FY2015, though in a handful of instances they extend until FY2019. The law included four provisions (i.e., Sections 3021(a), 3403, 10323(b), and 4002) that continue to provide annual or multiple-year appropriations in perpetuity.", "The ACA also included three indefinite appropriations that provide an unspecified amount of funding as indicated by the phrase \"such sums as may be necessary,\" or SSAN. One such provision (i.e., Section 1311) appropriated SSAN and authorized the HHS Secretary to determine the specific amount necessary for the grant program.

It also established and funded an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make recommendations to Congress for achieving specific Medicare spending reductions if costs exceed a target growth rate. IPAB's recommendations are to take effect unless Congress overrides them, in which case Congress would be responsible for achieving the same level of savings.", "The ACA created four special funds and appropriated substantial amounts to each one:", "The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) , to which the ACA appropriated a total of $11 billion in annual appropriations over the five-year period FY2011-FY2015, has helped support the federal health centers program and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). (Note: A separate ACA appropriation provided $1.5 billion for health center construction and renovation.) Congress has since appropriated two additional years of funding for the CHCF (see below). While CHCF funding may have been intended to supplement annual discretionary appropriations for the health centers program and the NHSC, the funds have partially supplanted (i.e., replaced) discretionary health center funding and have become the sole source of funding for the NHSC program, which has not received an annual discretionary appropriation since FY2011. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) , for which the ACA provided a permanent annual appropriation, is intended to support prevention, wellness, and other public health-related programs and activities authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). In two separate legislative actions, Congress has reduced the ACA's annual appropriation to the PPHF for each of FY2013 through FY2024 by a total of $9.75 billion. PPHF funds have been used to support several new discretionary grant programs authorized by the ACA. The funds are also supplementing, and in some cases supplanting, annual discretionary appropriations for a number of established programs, including ones that were reauthorized by the ACA. In FY2013, almost half of the PPHF funds were used to help pay for CMS's administrative costs associated with exchange operations.

Annual Spending Reductions Under the Budget Control Act", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) by establishing two budget enforcement mechanisms to reduce federal spending by at least $2.1 trillion over the 10-year period FY2012 through FY2021. First, the BCA established enforceable discretionary spending limits, or caps, for defense and nondefense spending for each of those years. Second, the BCA created a Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop legislation to further limit federal spending. The failure of the Joint Committee to agree on deficit-reduction legislation triggered automatic annual spending reductions for each of FY2013 through FY2021.", "The BCA specified that a total of $109 billion must be cut each year from nonexempt budget accounts. That amount is equally divided between the categories of defense and nondefense spending. Within each category, the spending cuts are allocated proportionately to discretionary spending and nonexempt mandatory (i.e., direct) spending. Under the BCA, the spending reductions are achieved through two methods: (1) sequestration (i.e., an across-the-board cancellation of budgetary resources); and (2) lowering the BCA-imposed discretionary spending caps.", "The BCA requires that the mandatory spending reductions in each category\u2014defense and nondefense\u2014must be executed in each of FY2013 through FY2021 by a sequestration of all nonexempt accounts, subject to the BBEDCA sequestration rules. Discretionary spending in each category is also subject to sequestration, but only in FY2013. For each of the remaining fiscal years (i.e., FY2014 through FY2021), discretionary spending reductions are to be achieved by lowering the discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending by the total dollar amount of the required reduction. Thus, congressional appropriators get to decide how to apportion the cuts within the lowered spending caps rather than having the cuts applied across-the-board to all nonexempt discretionary spending accounts through sequestration. ", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for calculating the percentages and amounts by which mandatory and discretionary spending are required to be reduced each year, and for applying the BBEDCA's sequestration exemptions and rules.", "Congress has amended the BCA several times since its enactment in 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) revised the discretionary spending caps for FY2013 and FY2014 and reduced the overall dollar amount that needed to be sequestered from FY2013 mandatory defense and nondefense spending.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established new discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015 and eliminated the requirement for these caps to be lowered. It also extended the sequestration of mandatory spending in the defense and nondefense categories for two additional years\u2014FY2022 and FY2023\u2014and specified that the percentage reduction calculated for FY2021 be applied to both those years.", "A provision in a 2014 law on military retirement pay extended the sequestration of mandatory spending to include FY2024 and, again, specified that the percentage reduction calculated for FY2021 be applied to that additional year.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 established new discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017 and eliminated the requirement for these caps to be lowered.
