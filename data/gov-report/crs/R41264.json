{"id": "R41264", "title": "The DISCLOSE Act: Overview and Analysis", "released_date": "2010-07-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["As it has periodically for decades, Congress is again considering how or whether to regulate campaign financing. The latest iteration of the debate over which kinds of groups should be permitted to spend funds on political advertisements, and how so, was renewed on January 21, 2010, when the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Following Citizens United, corporations and labor unions may now fund political advertisements explicitly calling for election or defeat of federal candidates\u2014provided that the advertisements are not coordinated with the campaign. The legislative response receiving the most attention to date\u2014and the emphasis of this report\u2014is the DISCLOSE (\"Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections\") Act. The House measure, H.R. 5175, sponsored by Representative Van Hollen, was reported, as amended, by the Committee on House Administration on May 25, 2010. The House of Representatives passed the bill, with additional amendments, on June 24, 2010, by a 219-206 vote. Senator Schumer's companion legislation that was first introduced in the Senate, S. 3295, is generally similar to the bill passed by the House. The same is true for S. 3628, a second measure\u2014apparently intended to supersede S. 3295\u2014that Senator Schumer introduced on July 21, 2010. There are, however, some important differences across the three bills, as discussed in this report.", "The bills appear to be aimed primarily at non-campaign actors, particularly corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. The bills propose a combination of disclosure provisions and disclaimer provisions (which are sponsorship information included within a communication) that would apply to these entities and are designed to give regulators and the public additional information about political advertising that could emerge following Citizens United. The legislation also prohibits certain government contractors, foreign-controlled or owned corporations (including some U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations), and prospective recipients of Temporary Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds from making certain political expenditures.", "The bills do not increase contribution limits for candidate campaigns; they also generally do not address other political committees\u2014parties and PACs. A notable exception would permit parties to make additional coordinated expenditures supporting their candidates. This is the only instance in which the bills explicitly allow for more political spending than would be possible under the status quo.", "This report provides an overview and analysis of (1) major policy issues addressed in the DISCLOSE Act, which responds to Citizens United; (2) major provisions of H.R. 5175, as passed by the House, and S. 3295 and S. 3628 as introduced in the Senate, versus current federal law; and (3) issues for congressional consideration and potential implications of enacting or not enacting the DISCLOSE Act.", "The report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Political information\u2014particularly political advertising\u2014has been at the heart of American campaigns and elections for more than a century. Throughout the last century, candidates, parties, and interest groups have competed to make their case to voters in the hopes of winning elections and shaping policy debates. At the same time, Congress, regulatory agencies, and the courts have wrestled with how much, and what kind, of information should be available to the public about the sources of those political messages. Questions have also emerged about whether certain actors, such as corporations and unions, should be permitted to participate in elections and other political debates to the same extent as voters. Modern campaign finance policy and law, which emerged in the 1970s, but which built on reforms first pursued in the early 1900s, has responded with a combination of provisions designed to restrict the amounts and sources of funds in federal elections on one hand, and documenting the sources and amounts of funds that are permitted on the other. ", "Political advertising has both enabled the public to become more informed about campaigns and policy contests, and, perhaps, made it more challenging for the electorate and policymakers to keep track of the various players and issues involved in political debates. This has been particularly true since the 1960s, when broadcast political advertising first became prominent, political professionals began to specialize in media production, and the electorate increasingly turned to television for information. ", "The latest iteration of the debate over which corporations, unions, and other groups should be permitted to spend funds on political ads, and how so, was renewed on January 21, 2010, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its highly anticipated decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (FEC) . The DISCLOSE Act, \"Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections,\" which the Committee on House Administration reported, as amended, on May 25, 2010, is the most prominent legislative response to Citizens United to date. As with the case itself, the DISCLOSE Act is particularly relevant for the ongoing policy debate surrounding political advertising and its transparency.", "This report is designed to provide an overview and analysis of (1) major policy issues addressed in Citizens United and the DISCLOSE Act; (2) major provisions of H.R. 5175 , S. 3295 , and S. 3628 compared with current federal campaign finance law, as shown in Table 1 at the end of this report; and (3) selected issues for congressional consideration and potential implications of enacting or not enacting the DISCLOSE Act. Legislative developments surrounding the DISCLOSE Act have generally unfolded quickly since the House and Senate bills were introduced. As such, this report will be updated periodically to reflect recent developments and emerging issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Policy and Legal Issues", "paragraphs": ["Citizens United is significant because of its potential to change the ways in which corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations participate in American elections. Although restrictions on those actors have evolved over time, corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt organizations were largely banned from spending treasury funds in federal elections for decades. As a result of Citizens United , these groups are permitted to use general treasury funds to make independent expenditures, which are defined as communications \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\" and that are not coordinated with any candidate or party, and electioneering communications, which are defined as broadcast, cable or satellite transmissions that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate, aired within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. Corporations and unions are still subject to the prohibition on using general treasury funds to make contributions to candidates and political parties. ", "The 1907 Tillman Act, which is considered to be the first major federal campaign finance law, prohibited corporations from making contributions to political parties. With the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, Congress expanded the prohibition to include corporate contributions to both parties and candidates, as well as expenditures in federal elections. Taft-Hartley also included labor unions in the prohibition. The early prohibitions on corporate and labor union treasury funded contributions and expenditures were included in the first modern federal campaign finance law, the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, also known as FECA. The prohibitions are codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b. In an exception to the prohibition on corporate and union treasury spending, FECA allows for the creation of separate segregated funds or political action committees , also known as PACs . Specifically, corporations and unions can use their treasury funds to establish, operate and solicit voluntary, limited contributions to their PACs. These voluntary PAC donations can then be used to contribute to federal campaigns or to make expenditures that expressly advocate election or defeat of federal candidates. ", "In the 1976 landmark Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo , the constitutionality of many provisions in FECA was challenged. This case is important because it established the framework for constitutional analysis of campaign finance regulation. In Buckley , the Court upheld reasonable contribution limits, invalidated certain expenditure limits, and upheld reporting and disclosure requirements. In addition, the Court created the distinction between issue advocacy and express advocacy , finding that a communication could be regulated if it contained words express advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate, which includes words such as \"vote for\" or \"vote against.\" By contrast, such ads could not be regulated if they only contained general public policy messages that fell short of calling for election or defeat of candidates, sometimes referred to as issue advocacy . A generation would pass between the enactment of FECA and the next time that Congress would again enact major campaign finance legislation\u2014the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)\u2014but political advertising and the funding sources for that advertising remained prominent during both legislative debates.", "As the legislation that became BCRA was being debated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a chief concern surrounding issue advocacy was whether the ads were actually about public policy issues\u2014as proponents of the advertisements suggested\u2014or whether they were really messages designed to encourage votes for or against candidates within in the context of ads that were only nominally related to public policy. In an effort to restrict issue advocacy, BCRA created a new concept within FECA known as electioneering communications in order to regulate messages that might affect elections, but did not expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate. Importantly, BCRA prohibited corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications, meaning that potentially any ad that even mentioned a political candidate during pre-election periods would have to be paid for with PAC funds or not aired. ", "In 2007, in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., the Supreme Court limited the application of the prohibition, thereby easing some restrictions on corporate- and union-funded ads that would otherwise be classified as electioneering communications. As a result of the Court's ruling, if an advertisement could reasonably be interpreted as something other than calling for a vote for or against a candidate, it could not be prohibited. While this ruling limited the application of the electioneering communication prohibition, it did not expressly overrule it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission", "paragraphs": ["Citizens United, a corporation exempt from taxes under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7 501(c)(4), produced a documentary about a presidential candidate, then-Senator Hillary Clinton. The group released the film in theaters and on DVD, and planned to make it available through video-on-demand and to fund broadcast and cable television advertisements promoting the movie. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (FEC), the U.S. Supreme Court considered to what extent the organization was subject to the federal prohibitions on corporate treasury funding of independent expenditures, electioneering communications, and related reporting requirements. ", "On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court issued its long-awaited ruling in this case, and invalidated the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures and electioneering communications. The Court determined that these prohibitions constitute a \"ban on speech\" in violation of the First Amendment. In so doing, the Court also overturned its 1990 ruling in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce , which had upheld restrictions on corporate-funded independent expenditures, finding that it provided no basis for allowing the government to limit such independent expenditures. The Court also overturned the portion of its decision in McConnell v. FEC upholding the facial validity of the prohibition on electioneering communications in BCRA, finding that the McConnell Court relied on Austin. ", "The Court in Citizens United , however, upheld the disclaimer (which is sponsor information included within a communication) and disclosure requirements for electioneering communications as applied to the documentary. These requirements, the Court held, could be applied to the film and related advertisements that Citizens United had produced. According to the Court, while they may burden the ability to speak, disclaimer and disclosure requirements \"impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities.\" ", "It does not appear that the Court's ruling in Citizens United affects the validity of Title I of BCRA, which generally bans the raising of unregulated, also known as \"soft,\" money by national parties and federal candidates or officials, and restricts soft money spending by state parties for \"federal election activities.\" Furthermore, Citizens United does not appear to affect the ban on corporate or union contributions to political candidates. As a consequence of Citizens United , federal campaign finance law does not limit corporate and labor union treasury funding for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Corporations and unions may still establish PACs, but are only required to use PAC funds in order to make contributions to candidates, parties, and other political committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Response", "paragraphs": ["Given these developments, questions have emerged about how political advertising might be affected by the Court's decision in Citizens United and whether the airwaves will be flooded with corporate and labor union express advocacy. Similar questions have arisen about the extent to which the Court's decision might lead to increased campaign activity by tax-exempt organizations, particularly \u00a7 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations and \u00a7 501(c)(6) trade associations. Many of the these organizations are incorporated, and thus, prior to Citizens United , were generally prohibited from using their treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Additionally, all \u00a7 501(c) organizations, regardless of whether they were incorporated, could not serve as conduits for corporate or labor union treasury funds to fund independent expenditures and electioneering communications. In light of the Court's decision in Citizens United , some are expecting increased campaign activity by tax-exempt organizations. Additionally, some have expressed concern that organizations might be used as shadow groups\u2014groups to which corporations, other entities, and individuals might give funds to engage in campaign activity with little or no public disclosure.", "Because this is the first time in modern history that corporate and union independent expenditures have been permitted at the federal level, it remains to be seen how much additional money, if any, might flow into the political system. A more complete understanding of how Citizens United will affect the political environment, including campaign spending, will likely be unavailable until after the 2010 election cycle, at the earliest.

H.R. 5175 as introduced and reported from the Committee on House Administration contained similar findings, but the relevant section was omitted from the version of the bill passed by the House. The bills contain different thresholds for restricting independent expenditures and electioneering communications by government contractors. S. 3295 would bar such expenditures for entities holding contracts of at least $50,000. H.R. 5175 as passed by the House would set the threshold contract value at $10 million, as would S. 3628 . The bill passed by the House also contains a restriction on Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lessees not found in the Senate bill. The House bill would prohibit entities holding or negotiating these leases from making contributions, independent expenditures, and electioneering communications in federal elections. Neither Senate measure contains such a provision. The bills would redefine foreign nationals , who are restricted from making contributions or expenditures in U.S. elections, differently. All three measures would expand the current foreign national definition to include certain foreign-controlled U.S. corporations, but H.R. 5175 and S. 3628 contain additional prohibitions on entities owned by or under control of foreign governments or foreign-government officials. Unlike H.R. 5175 and S. 3628 , S. 3295 would revise the lowest unit charge ( LUC , also called the lowest unit rate ). Currently, the LUC essentially permits candidate committees to purchase preemptible broadcast advertising time at the cheapest price offered to commercial advertisers for comparable time. In addition to other revisions, S. 3295 would bar preemption of LUC ads (unless beyond a broadcaster's control) and would extend the rate to national party committees in some circumstances. Both Senate bills would require Senate political committee reports to be filed electronically and directly with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) rather than with the Secretary of the Senate. Senate campaign committees, party committees, and PACs currently are not required to file campaign finance reports electronically. The House bill does not address these provisions. H.R. 5175 , as passed by the House, excludes \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations and certain large \u00a7 501(c)(4) organizations from the disclosure and disclaimer provisions.

In brief, the DISCLOSE Act appears aimed at documenting additional political advertising in general, and restricting it where potential corruption might occur in specific circumstances. Nonetheless, the disclosure provisions would not necessarily affect political spending per se, nor would they necessarily deter those entities that wished to call for election or defeat of federal candidates. As such, the bill would not necessarily ensure an equal playing field among various political advertisers\u2014including campaigns\u2014nor could it necessarily do so.", "In general, the bills would broadly apply additional disclosure and disclaimer provisions to entities making independent expenditures and electioneering communications, as defined in the bills.

In addition, the bills would increase the period (from 60 to 120 days for the House bill and S. 3628 , and from 60 to 90 days for S. 3295 ) prior to general election in which communications are treated as electioneering communications.

First, it appears that once an organization elected to establish the account, it would be required to use that account exclusively for future campaign-related activity \u2014 a strategic or administrative decision that some organizations might not be willing to make on a permanent basis. Second, the provisions specify that amounts in the account be \"exclusively for disbursements by the covered organization for campaign-related activity.\" Given this language, it is unclear whether or not an organization using a campaign-related activity account could dispose of its funds if it decided to abandon political spending altogether. If Congress wishes to provide a non-campaign-related mechanism to do so, existing provisions in FECA permitting charitable contributions could be an option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Implementation Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Even if Congress enacts the DISCLOSE Act quickly, aspects of the legislation will require agency implementation. The process could affect how quickly and how clearly the act affects campaigns and related spending (e.g., independent political advertising). Because the DISCLOSE Act would primarily amend FECA, the FEC would be responsible for administering and enforcing most of the bill's provisions. ", "It is possible that the FEC could implement the DISCLOSE Act quickly, although various factors suggest that it is unlikely the Commission could fully implement the act before the 2010 November general elections. In addition to the time required to develop and reach agreement on rules, for those rules to be finalized (upon publication in the Federal Register ), the Commission would have to also approve an explanation and justification (E&J) statement explaining its rationale and offering practical guidance about what the regulations mean and how they will be enforced. This process routinely takes months, even for expedited rulemakings. The Commission would have to also amend its reporting forms to adhere to the act's new requirements. ", "Importantly, FECA requires that adopting rules and developing forms (among other provisions) requires affirmative votes from at least four of the six Commissioners. A series of deadlocked votes (e.g., 3-3 ties) among members of the current Commission, however, suggests that disagreement among Commissioners is possible\u2014particularly on controversial or ambiguous aspects of the legislation. If disagreements resulted in deadlock or failure to implement the law as Congress intends, the DISCLOSE Act's effectiveness could be delayed or compromised. ", "Perhaps in response to those concerns, many of the DISCLOSE Act's provisions would become effective 30 days after enactment, with at least one becoming effective immediately upon enactment. The bills specify that their provisions would generally take effect regardless of whether the FEC had promulgated rules to implement the legislation. Nonetheless, the \"regulated community\" might lack practical and administrative guidance about how to comply with the act's provisions until the Commission could issue rules and begin considering advisory opinions. Nonetheless, even if rulemaking or amending forms were delayed, the law itself would still take effect as stated in the act. Therefore, even if some details remained to be determined, enacting the DISCLOSE Act or other legislation could permit Congress to place additional requirements on political advertisers or other campaign actors regardless of Commission action or inaction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As Congress considers the DISCLOSE Act, it may be too soon to predict precisely how Citizens United might affect campaigns or political advertising in the absence of legislation. If Congress chooses to enact the DISCLOSE Act, it would provide additional information to the public and regulators about political advertising funded by corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. It would also prohibit certain entities from funding electioneering communications and independent expenditures, as well as providing political parties with greater ability to make coordinated party expenditures in some cases.", "Except for the spending prohibitions in the bill, nothing in the legislation would necessarily prevent corporations, unions, or other entities from funding political advertising calling for election or defeat of clearly identified candidates. The disclosure and disclaimer provisions could, however, provide the public and regulators with additional information about the sources of that advertising. Public disclosure could also cause would-be advertisers to think carefully before making political expenditures. For those who believe that Citizens United will usher in a new era of corporate or union dominance in elections, such an outcome might be welcome. On the other hand, those who believe that Citizens United correctly strengthens corporate and union speech rights might be wary of any provisions perceived as stifling the ability to participate in elections. As Congress considers the DISCLOSE Act, issues related to how terms are defined, the kinds of organizations that would be regulated, implementation, and other concerns may be relevant."], "subsections": []}]}}
