Because none of the presidential candidates won an absolute majority, a runoff was held June 5 between two center-right candidates. Economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defeated former congresswoman Keiko Fujimori by less than 1% of the vote, 50.12% to 49.88%.", "For months, Fujimori had maintained a strong lead in what began as a field of 18 candidates. However, there is strong sentiment against her candidacy, as well. Both the strong support for and the opposition to Fujimori stem mostly from the legacy of her father, Alberto Fujimori, whose harsh security policy helped to squash the Sendero Luminoso terrorist group but also entailed gross violations of human rights. The elder Fujimori is serving a 25-year prison sentence in Peru for crimes against humanity and corruption. In the first round, Keiko Fujimori won 40% of the vote and Kuczynski won 21% of the vote. Kuczynski pulled ahead in the final round in part because of support from anti-Fujimori voters, including leftist Ver\u00f3nika Mendoza, who had placed third in the first round. The new president and congress are to assume office on July 28, 2016, for five-year terms.", "Since 2001, Peru's economy has been one of the strongest in Latin America. President Humala's economic strategy has been to maintain free-market policies while working to narrow the wide economic distribution gap and eliminate the social exclusion of Peru's poor, mostly indigenous population. Deep social divides over how to pursue this aim have continued to undercut political stability in Peru. Social unrest and debate over exploitation of natural resources has long been and will likely remain a major challenge for any Peruvian government. The more serious disputes have involved the mining industry and the rights of indigenous peoples in those areas where mining exists or where mining interests intend to operate. Humala has found it politically difficult to balance his stated desire to help the poor and indigenous with his effort to encourage investment by the business sector, especially the extractive industry. In addition, some observers project that the current El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern hitting Peru could hurt Peru's economic growth.", "Peru and the United States have a strong and cooperative relationship. Several issues in U.S.-Peruvian relations are likely to be considered in decisions by Congress and the Administration on future aid to and cooperation with Peru. The United States supports the strengthening of Peru's democratic institutions, counternarcotics efforts, security and respect for human rights, and environmental protection. A dominant theme in bilateral relations is the effort to stem the flow of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, between the two countries. In the economic realm, the United States supports bilateral trade relations and Peru's further integration into the world economy. A bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) between the United States and Peru entered into force on February 1, 2009.

The president has appointed seven prime ministers in less than five years. The sixth prime minister was censured by congress after the national intelligence agency allegedly spied on members of the political opposition. Humala, a former military officer, is said to have staffed the intelligence agency with army associates. Brazilian federal police investigating corruption at Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras, are reportedly investigating President Humala in relation to $3 million in bribes in exchange for Petrobras contracts in Peru. In February 2016, Peru's attorney general's office announced that it had begun its own investigations into the allegations.", "The Peruvian general public has expressed widespread disillusionment with the country's political class. In the regional and municipal elections held in October 2014, more than 100 candidates were shown to have links to drug-trafficking cases\u2014and several of those candidates still won. Five of those who were elected have been investigated for corruption and/or money laundering. Several recent corruption scandals involve close associates of the president. In one high-profile case, government investigators are looking into First Lady Nadine Heredia's ties to Martin Belaunde, a former Humala adviser awaiting trial on political espionage and money-laundering charges. These scandals, combined with a slowing economy, have led to extremely low approval ratings for Humala. Heredia is now facing a new investigation into possible procedural fraud charges for denying that she was the owner of diaries containing key information regarding Humala's presidential campaign. ", "Heredia is also the leader of the PNP. She and Humala backed off from earlier consideration of changing the electoral law to allow the first lady to run for president in the 2016 election. The PNP withdrew its eventual presidential candidate, Daniel Urresti, before the first round of elections was held. Urresti was garnering only about 2% of voters in preelection polls; each party must obtain at least 5% of the vote to remain a registered political party. Parties are allowed to skip one election, though, and remain registered. Humala's party has been losing members, however, as the president has promoted more orthodox policies over populist ones.

The dynamics of what seemed like an ordinary national election became more controversial when two leading candidates were disqualified just one month before voting took place. On March 4, 2016, Peru's Special Elections Board (JEE, by its Spanish acronym) ruled that presidential candidate Julio Guzm\u00e1n could not run for president in 2016 because of technical irregularities of his Todos por el Per\u00fa (All for Peru) party's internal selection process.

", "The JEE also disqualified Cesar Acu\u00f1a of the Alianza Por El Progreso (Alliance for Progress) party, who was polling in third and fourth place. The JEE disqualified Acu\u00f1a as a candidate for giving cash to voters while campaigning, a violation of a relatively new electoral law. His campaign was already faltering, though, after a string of scandals and allegations of perjury, plagiarism, and vote-buying. The expulsion from the race of Guzm\u00e1n and Acu\u00f1a, whom the public viewed as outsiders, stoked anger against the political establishment and front-runner Keiko Fujimori (whom Humala defeated in 2011). ", "Because no presidential candidate garnered 50% plus one vote, Peru held a run-off election between the top two contenders: Keiko Fujimori, aged 41, who won 40% of the vote, and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, 77, who won 21% of the vote in the first round.

As the younger Fujimori, remains strongly linked to her father and his legacy, thousands of Peruvians protested in the streets against her, shouting, \"Never again.\" Fujimori was generally expected to take a hard-line approach to security issues. She also is being investigated by state prosecutors for links with drug traffickers. ", "Kuczynski, a former prime minister and economy minister, held various ministerial positions from 1980 to 1982 and 2001 to 2006. He ran for the centrist Peruanos por el Kambio (Peruvians for Change) party. A former World Bank economist, Kuczynski espouses fairly orthodox economic views, so he appeals to the business sector. He is also considered a moderate and therefore appeals to some on the left as well. His past service on the boards of several multinational mining companies raised concerns that he might favor big business interests in the national debate over mining. (See \" Conflicts over Natural Resources ,\" below.)", "The special electoral court investigated complaints against both Fujimori and Kuczynski for allegedly handing out gifts to supporters. Public suspicion that the disqualifications of Guzm\u00e1n and Acu\u00f1a were politically motivated was reinforced in mid-March when a court cleared Keiko Fujimori of campaign corruption allegations for actions very similar to those that disqualified Acu\u00f1a. Later, the court also cleared Kuczynski. Much of the public and many analysts felt that the rulings indicated, at a minimum, inconsistent application of the electoral law, and possibly either incompetence or corruption in the electoral institutions.", "Other candidates who have been under investigation included former presidents Alan Garc\u00eda (1985-1990 and 2006-2011) and Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006). Both former presidents have been investigated for corruption, and both say the investigations were politically driven to hamper their candidacies. Garc\u00eda is being investigated for illicit enrichment and a payment-for-pardons case, in which hundreds of convicted drug traffickers were released early from prison during his presidency. Toledo has been indicted for money laundering in a real estate deal.", "Polls before the April elections indicated that if Fujimori were to face Kuczynski in the second round, Kuczynski would get the anti-Fujimori votes and win by a narrow margin, and this proved to be the case. Acu\u00f1a, who was polling strongly when he was disqualified, formally endorsed Kuczynski on May 3. Left-wing candidate Ver\u00f3nika Mendoza, who placed third in the first round, threw her support behind Kuczynski just days before the election, probably giving Kuczynski some of the rural vote, where his support was weakest and Fujimori's support was strongest.", "As president, Kuczynski will have to negotiate with Fujimori's Popular Force party, which won 71 out of the 130 seats in the congress, an absolute majority. This majority will enable the party to pass or defeat legislation and censure ministers without having to compromise with other parties. Mendoza's Broad Front won 22 seats, and Kuczynski's Peruvians for Change party won only 18 seats. Keiko Fujimori may face challenges to her leadership, however. She will not be a member of the legislature and has now lost the presidential bid twice. Her younger brother, Kenji, won a seat in the congress with more votes than any other legislator. He pointedly announced that if his sister lost, he would run for president in 2021 and that he was not voting in the second round.", "Kuczynski acknowledges the need to work with both the left and Fujimori's party to reach a consensus on a legislative agenda. The president-elect has suggested that he may offer Fujimori supporters, or Fujimoristas, a compromise on the fate of former president Alberto Fujimori, who is 77 years of age and in prison, to gain their support. According to the Financial Times , the president-elect said that, \"If Congress passes a law\u2014not just for him\u2014that says people of a certain age with certain sentences can complete their sentences at home, I will sign it.\" He said his priority is to get consensus on a basic program of economic reforms and improved social services, which his team calls \"popular capitalism.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Background", "paragraphs": ["Peru's economy has been one of the strongest in Latin America since 2001.

The first law Humala signed as president was a prior-consultation law requiring mining, energy, and logging companies to consult with indigenous and rural communities about projects planned in their communities. The prior-consultation law does not grant local communities veto power over investments in their area, however, and the Humala administration has allowed various mining projects to proceed without prior consultation and without a clear process or definition of eligible communities in place on which to base decisions. Humala has found it politically difficult to balance his stated desire to help the poor and indigenous with his effort to encourage investment by the business sector.

Total trade with Peru (imports plus exports) decreased by 13.7% in 2015, mostly due to a decline in oil prices. U.S. imports from Peru totaled $5.1 billion in 2015, a 16.5% decrease from 2014. Major import items included gold, non-crude petroleum oil products, vegetables, grapes, and silver. U.S. exports to Peru totaled $8.8 billion in 2015, a 12.9% decrease from the previous year. Major U.S. exports to Peru in 2015 included non-crude petroleum oil products, telephone sets (including cell phones), corn, automatic data processing machines, and turbojets and other gas turbines.

The OTLA report states that Peru's decree may violate labor provisions of the U.S.-Peru FTA. The report responded to a complaint filed in July 2015 by the U.S.-based International Labor Rights Forum and other labor rights groups. The organizations argued that Peru's law violates its FTA commitments to abide by International Labor Organization (ILO) standards. The OTLA report raised concerns that the legislation allows nontraditional export sectors to employ workers using short-term contracts on an unlimited basis. Peruvian authorities and representatives from the business sector contend that the OTLA report verified Peru's compliance with the FTA, while labor groups argue that the Peruvian government must make \"substantial changes\" to the trade promotion legislation if it is to meet its commitments under the U.S.-Peru FTA. OTLA, in coordination with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the State Department, will decide on next steps, and progress will be assessed nine months from the release of the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Protection Issues49", "paragraphs": ["Peru and the United States signed a debt-for-nature swap for 2008 to 2015 that was to reduce Peru's U.S. debt by more than $25 million.

In January 2013, the two countries agreed on an action plan to target continued challenges in the forestry sector, such as improving systems to track and verify timber exports from Peru to the United States. The United States has provided nearly $75 million in technical assistance and capacity building to address these challenges. This includes the development of an electronic timber-tracking system to trace every log from stump to port. While Peru has made progress in addressing illegal logging, challenges remain. In February 2016, the USTR announced that it had made its first verification request to the government of Peru to verify whether a 2015 timber shipment exported to the United States complied with all applicable Peruvian laws and regulations. USTR officials accompanied Peruvian officials as they conducted the governmental accreditation process from April 18 to April 22, and they are expected to issue a report about a month later.", "In 2015, Peru made illegal logging on indigenous lands an aggravated offense, and the government committed more resources to enforcing the law.
