However, no housing finance reform legislation or broad FHA reform legislation was enacted during the 113th Congress. Additionally, Congress was interested in overseeing the implementation of several mortgage-related rulemakings that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) in the 111th Congress, and deliberated on other issues related to housing finance.", "Congress also considered a number of issues related to housing assistance for low-income individuals and families.

At the same time, in response to growing concerns about the long-term budget outlook, less funding has been provided for many of the housing assistance programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Therefore, an issue before the 113th Congress was how to prioritize funding for housing programs. Congress also considered additional issues related to housing for low-income families, including extensions of certain provisions related to the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program and efforts to reauthorize the major federal program that provides federal housing assistance to low-income Native Americans living in tribal areas.", "Congress also weighed whether to extend certain housing-related tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013, such as the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt income."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Housing and mortgage markets in the United States have experienced significant turmoil in recent years.

These concerns provoked a number of state and federal regulators to initiate multiple investigations, enforcement actions, lawsuits, and legal settlement negotiations. Although the alleged servicer misconduct is a common thread in these regulatory actions, the legal authorities at the disposal of the regulators differ considerably, which has resulted in varied remedies.

As a result of its findings, the banking regulators entered into binding consent orders in April 2011 with these mortgage servicers and several of the third-party service providers that the servicers used in various ways during foreclosure processes.

The settlement provides mortgage servicers some certainty regarding their legal liability, while securing approximately $25 billion in monetary relief for individuals who lost homes through foreclosure in recent years and current homeowners who are struggling to maintain monthly payments.", "Other litigation, enforcement actions, and legal settlements have involved mortgage-related activities outside of the context of mortgage servicing. For example, on October 19, 2013, the Justice Department, acting through the Obama Administration's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force's RMBS Working Group, announced that federal and state regulators and JPMorgan Chase & Co. had reached a legal settlement stemming from the company's \"packaging, marketing, sale and issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).\" As part of the agreement, JPMorgan is required to pay approximately $13 billion, which will take various forms including civil penalties, restitution, and consumer relief.

Although no U.S. city has actually exercised its condemnation powers to effectuate such a plan, the proposals would entail the cities exercising their eminent domain powers to purchase underwater mortgages and selling them to MRP, which would issue new mortgages to the same homeowners for more than their condemnation prices but less than the outstanding principals on the original mortgages. The proposals reportedly would focus on purchasing performing mortgages that are held by private-label (i.e., issued by private companies, not by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae), residential mortgage-backed securitized trusts (RMBS trusts). The cities and MRP reportedly would also target homeowners whose newly issued mortgages could qualify for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance.", "The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which is applicable to states and localities through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, limits the government's sovereign power to seize private property by eminent domain. States and municipalities also must adhere to their respective state constitutions, almost all of which have analogous provisions. The constitutionally valid exercise of eminent domain requires that two basic principles be met: the private property must be acquired for a \"public use\"; and the property owner must be paid \"just compensation.\" Although legal challenges against these plans would be very fact specific, the condemnation of underwater mortgages to bolster economic development arguably could raise constitutional questions under both the public use and just compensation principles of state and federal takings clauses. ", "In addition to potential questions regarding their constitutionality, some Members of Congress and other policymakers have expressed policy concerns about plans to acquire underwater mortgages through eminent domain. Critics argue that these proposals would be unfair to mortgage holders, would undermine private contracts, and could be detrimental to future mortgage lending because lenders may be hesitant to offer mortgages in areas that had used eminent domain in the past or may charge higher interest rates to compensate for the perceived increase in risk. In an effort to discourage the condemnation plans, a provision of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, P.L. 113-235 , prohibits FHA, Ginnie Mae, and HUD from using funds appropriated in the act \"to insure, securitize, or establish a Federal guarantee of any mortgage or [MBS] that refinances or otherwise replaces a mortgage that has been subject to eminent domain condemnation or seizure, by a state, municipality, or any other political subdivision of a state.\" Policymakers also have called on government agencies, such as FHA, to explain what kind of policies they might adopt if a local jurisdiction proceeded with such a program.

Funding for Section 8 vouchers makes up the largest share of HUD's budget, accounting for nearly half. The cost of the Section 8 voucher program has been growing in recent years since Congress has created more vouchers each year over the past several years (largely to replace units lost to the affordable housing stock in other assisted housing programs), and since the cost of renewing individual vouchers has been growing as gaps between low-income tenants' incomes and rents in the market have been growing. The cost of the project-based Section 8 program has also been growing in recent years as more and more long-term rental assistance contracts on older properties expire and are renewed, requiring new appropriations. Public housing, the third-largest expense in HUD's budget, has, arguably, been underfunded (based on studies undertaken by HUD of what it should cost to operate and maintain public housing) for many years, which means there is regular pressure from low-income housing advocates and others to increase funding for public housing.

Public housing is owned by the same local PHAs that administer the Section 8 voucher program and those PHAs receive annual operating and capital funding from Congress through HUD. Much of the public housing stock is old and in need of capital repairs. According to the most recent study conducted by HUD, addressing the outstanding physical needs of the public housing stock would cost nearly $26 billion. The amount Congress typically provides in annual appropriations for capital needs has not been sufficient to address that backlog. In response, PHAs have increasingly relied on other sources of financing, particularly private market loans, to meet the capital needs of their housing stock. However, there are limits on the extent to which PHAs can borrow funds; most notably, they are generally restricted by federal rules from mortgaging their public housing properties. Further, the public housing program has, like the voucher program, been criticized for being overly complex and burdensome to administer, especially in light of recent funding reductions.", "Recent reform proposals have included changes to the income eligibility and rent determination process for both programs, designed to make it less complicated, and changes to the physical inspection process in the voucher program to give PHAs more options for reducing the frequency of inspections and increasing sanctions for failed inspections.
