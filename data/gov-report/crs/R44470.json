The CR generally provided funding at the FY2016 level (in Division G, P.L. 114-113), minus an across-the-board reduction of 0.1901% for the period covered. Funding was provided for continuing projects and activities, under the same authority and conditions, and to the same extent and manner, as for FY2016. An earlier CR (Division C, P.L. 114-223), and P.L. 114-254, contained a total of 10 exceptions for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.

By contrast, both H.R. 5538 as passed by the House and S. 3068 as reported from the Senate Appropriations Committee would have provided lower appropriations than enacted for FY2016. The House bill was $779.3 million (2.4%) less than FY2016, whereas the Senate bill contained $163.6 million (0.5%) less than FY2016.", "The FY2016 appropriation, and FY2017 appropriations requested, approved by the House, and reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee, differed in a number of ways. For instance, only the President's request did not include discretionary appropriations for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, as the President proposed mandatory funds for this program. PILT compensates counties and local governments for nontaxable lands within their jurisdictions. The total amounts also represented different levels of funding for wildland fires on DOI and Forest Service lands, as well as varied approaches to providing funds. The President proposed a new adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law for wildfire suppression, the House bill included funding for the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Accounts, and the Senate bill provided some wildfire funds as emergency appropriations. The FY2016 appropriation included FLAME and emergency funding, but not a discretionary cap adjustment.", "Other differences related to the amount of funds proposed for particular agencies. For example, whereas the President sought an increase in funds over FY2016 for EPA, the House and Senate bills provided lower funding. In other cases, the President, House, and Senate Committee proposed increased funds of varying amounts over the FY2016 level, as for the National Park Service, Indian Affairs bureaus, Indian Health Service, and Smithsonian Institution, among other agencies.

The agency is also responsible for about 700 million acres of federal onshore subsurface mineral estate throughout the nation and supervises the mineral operations on about 56 million acres of Indian trust lands. The Fish and Wildlife Service administers 91 million acres of federal land within the National Wildlife Refuge System and other areas, including 77 million acres in Alaska. It also manages several large marine refuges and marine national monuments, sometimes jointly with other federal agencies. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service is the primary agency responsible for implementing the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531 et seq.) through listing of species; consulting with other federal agencies; collaborating with private entities and state, tribal, and local governments; and other measures. It is also the primary agency responsible for promoting wildlife habitat; enforcing federal wildlife laws; supporting wildlife and ecosystem science; conserving migratory birds; administering grants to aid state fish and wildlife programs; and coordinating with state, international, and other federal agencies on fish and wildlife issues. The National Park Service administers 80 million acres of federal land within the National Park System, which includes 417 diverse units in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Roughly two-thirds of the system's lands are in Alaska. The National Park Service has a dual mission\u2014to preserve unique resources and to provide for their enjoyment by the public. The agency also supports and promotes some resource conservation activities outside the Park System through grant and technical assistance programs and cooperation with partners. The U.S. Geological Survey is a science agency that provides physical and biological information related to geological resources; climate and land use change; natural hazards; and energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences and resources. In addition, it is the federal government's principal civilian mapping agency and a primary source of data on the quality of the nation's water resources. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management manages development of the nation's offshore conventional and renewable energy resources in the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic. These resources are in areas covering approximately 1.7 billion acres located beyond state waters, mostly in the Alaska region (more than 1 billion acres) but also off all coastal states. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement provides regulatory and safety oversight for resource development in the outer continental shelf. Among its responsibilities are oil and gas permitting, facility inspections, environmental compliance, and oil spill response planning. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement works with states and tribes to reclaim abandoned coal mines. The agency also regulates active coal mines to minimize environmental impacts during mining and to reclaim affected lands and waters after mining. Indian Affairs agencies provide and fund a variety of services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and their members. Historically, these agencies have taken the lead in federal dealings with tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for programs that include government operations, courts, law enforcement, fire protection, social programs, roads, economic development, employment assistance, housing repair, irrigation, dams, Indian rights protection, implementation of land and water settlements, and management of trust assets (real estate and natural resources).

It also provides technical and financial assistance to states, tribes, and private forest landowners and conducts research on sustaining forest resources for future generations. The Indian Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services provides medical and environmental health services for more than 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Health care is provided through a system of facilities and programs operated by the agency, tribes and tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. The agency operates 26 hospitals, 59 health centers, and 32 health stations. Tribes and tribal organizations, through Indian Health Service contracts and compacts, operate another 19 hospitals, 284 health centers, 79 health stations, and 163 Alaska Native village clinics.

The Smithsonian Institution is a museum and research complex consisting of 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and nine research facilities throughout the United States and around the world. Established by federal legislation in 1846 with the acceptance of a trust donation by the institution's namesake benefactor, the Smithsonian is funded by both federal appropriations and a private trust. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities make up the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. The National Endowment for the Arts is a major federal source of support for all arts disciplines. Since 1965, it has awarded more than 145,000 grants, which have been distributed to all states. The National Endowment for the Humanities generally supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs; creation of regional humanities centers; and development of humanities programs under the jurisdiction of state humanities councils. Since 1965, it has awarded approximately 63,000 grants. It also supports a Challenge Grant program to stimulate and match private donations in support of humanities institutions.

Of the total proposed adjustment for FY2017, $290.0 million was for DOI Wildland Fire Management and $864.1 million was for Forest Service Wildland Fire Management.", "Appropriations for agencies vary widely for reasons relating to the number, breadth, and complexity of agency responsibilities; alternative sources of funding (e.g., mandatory appropriations); and Administration and congressional priorities, among other factors. Thus, although the President's FY2017 request covered approximately 30 agencies, funding for a small subset of these agencies accounted for most of the total. For example, the requested appropriations for three agencies\u2014EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service\u2014were nearly three-fifths (57.9%) of the total request. Further, more than three-quarters (76.0%) of the request was for these three agencies and two others, National Park Service and Indian Affairs.

Some of the National Park Service increase was intended to enhance park units in light of the agency's 2016 centennial. Activities receiving additional funds included repair, rehabilitation, and maintenance of facilities; line item construction; visitor services for young people and families; historic preservation; and the Centennial Challenge program (a federal matching program to leverage donations for park units).

The second-largest increase was for the Working Capital Fund, primarily for cybersecurity and DOI compliance with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act, P.L. 113-101 ). For Indian Affairs, the President requested increases for many activities, among them education, natural resource management, and social services. For the U.S. Geological Survey, the President requested additional funds across agency activities, including ecosystems, climate and land use change, natural hazards, water resources, and facilities. ", "Two DOI agencies, Departmental Offices and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, would have received decreased appropriations under the President's FY2017 request. For Departmental Offices, the decrease was primarily because the President did not seek discretionary funding under this account for PILT, as noted. For the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, the decrease was primarily because the President did not request to continue the FY2016 appropriation of $90.0 million for grants to three states for reclamation of abandoned mine lands, together with economic and community development activities. ", "Within the overall increase for EPA, the President sought additional funds for each of the agency's accounts except State and Tribal Assistance Grants. The $239.2 million (9.2%) increase for the Environmental Programs and Management account was the largest overall dollar increase proposed for EPA accounts. This account funds a broad array of activities supporting EPA's development and enforcement of pollution-control regulations and standards, technical assistance, and administrative and operational expenses. The $40.2 million (3.7%) increase for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account was the second-largest overall dollar increase for EPA accounts. This account supports the assessment and cleanup of sites contaminated from the release of hazardous substances. EPA administers these activities under the Superfund program, as authorized in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a79601 et seq.).

For instance, grants to states for wastewater infrastructure projects through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund would have declined by $414.4 million (29.7%), whereas funding for drinking water infrastructure grants to states through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund would have increased by $157.3 million (18.2%).", "Thirteen of the 20 Title III agencies would have received increases over FY2016 enacted levels under the President's FY2017 proposal, and two of the three largest agencies would have received the biggest dollar increases. Specifically, the President sought an additional $377.4 million (7.9%) for the Indian Health Service and $82.0 million (9.8%) for the Smithsonian Institution. The Indian Health Service increases were for many programs and activities, including hospitals and health clinics, mental health, alcohol and substance abuse, contract support costs, and construction of health care and other facilities. The Smithsonian Institution's additional funds were to be directed to facilities maintenance, operations, security, and construction, among other purposes. By contrast, two Title III agencies would have received level funding and five agencies would have received decreases.
