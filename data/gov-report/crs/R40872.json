It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural). These characteristics are graphically portrayed in Figure 1 as a resource pyramid. At the top of the pyramid are the deposits that are high quality and easy to access. These deposits have been generally discovered and produced first. Examples of the deposits at the top of the resource pyramid are the large oil deposits of Saudi Arabia and the enormous natural gas deposits of Qatar. Moving down the pyramid, the quality and/or accessibility declines, and production becomes more difficult and expensive. A large oil deposit in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico would be further down the pyramid than a comparable deposit on land because of the added expense and technology required to produce it.", "It is important to note that the deposits at the bottom of the pyramid may be quite extensive. Deposits may be of poor quality or diffuse, but may occur in vast quantities. Examples of fossil fuel deposits that would be found at the bottom of the pyramid are oil shale and methane hydrates (both discussed further under \" Sub-Economic Oil and Natural Gas Resources \"). Oil shale and methane hydrate deposits contain massive amounts of oil and natural gas, but their mode of occurrence, poor accessibility, and difficult recovery make them difficult to produce and/or sub-economic currently. The economic threshold for producing deposits further down the pyramid is partly a function of commodity price. That threshold is also moved by the development of new extraction technologies that make production feasible at lower cost.", "For U.S. oil deposits, the resource pyramid ( Figure 2 ) indicates that many of the high-quality, easy-to-find deposits have already been produced. Current proved reserves (see \" Terminology \") include many deposits that are of lower quality or with poorer access than some historical production, but which are still economic under current market conditions. As long as demand for oil continues, the exploration and production process will move down the pyramid under the influences of price (including environmental costs in some cases) and technology. Whether the vast deposits of oil shale that are lower on the pyramid will be produced depends on the price of oil, the cost of production (including environmental cost), and the availability of technology to produce it. Although this example is for oil, similar relationships exist for natural gas and coal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Terminology", "paragraphs": ["A search for energy statistics in the literature quickly reveals a large number of terms used to describe amounts of fossil fuels. Most of these terms have precise and legitimate definitions, and even a careful comparison of statistics for diverse forms of fossil fuels can become quite difficult to reconcile or understand. Not only do oil, natural gas, and coal occur in many diverse geologic environments, but each commodity may occur in different modes or in different geologic settings that impose vastly different economics on their recovery and delivery to market. A vocabulary of terms has developed over the decades to capture the nature of deposits in terms of their likelihood of being developed and their stage of development.", "Examples of terms used for fossil fuel deposits (not an exhaustive list) include", "Proved reserves Probable reserves Possible reserves Unproved reserves Demonstrated reserve base Undiscovered resources Probable resources Possible resources Speculative resources Potential resources Technically recoverable resources Economically recoverable resources", "Definitions for several of these terms are included in the Appendix .", "It is important to note that no systematic statistical data exist for most of these categories.

Understanding these terms will help avoid confusion about statistical energy data.", "Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined at a significant level of certainty, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered. In the United States, proved reserves are typically measured by private companies, who report their findings to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and to the Securities and Exchange Commission because those reserves are considered capital assets. Because proved reserves are defined by strict rules, they do not include all of the oil or gas in a region, but only those amounts that have been carefully confirmed by drilling or some other geophysical technique. Because proved reserves are, by definition, economically recoverable, the proportion of the oil in the ground that qualifies as proved reserves increases when prices are high, and decreases when prices are low. That is, even without new discoveries, oil that may be sub-economic at $70 per barrel might become economic at $100 per barrel and so the total proved reserves increase simply because price increases.", "In addition to the volumes of proved reserves, there are other deposits of oil and gas that have not yet been discovered, which are called undiscovered resources. The term \"resource\" has often been used in a generic sense to refer to quantities of energy (or other) commodities in general. Observers may refer to resource-rich nations, or speak about a large resource base, for example. But the phrase \"undiscovered resources\" has a specific meaning. Undiscovered resources are amounts of oil and gas estimated to exist by examining geologic characteristics in unexplored areas. Certain geologic processes and characteristics are required for the formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons, and careful geologic study can reveal whether those characteristics exist in a particular area, and whether the potential for hydrocarbon resources is large or small. The proportion of undiscovered resources that might be recovered is determined by comparing the area with production wells in a known area and volumes are constrained by current technology and production practices. Thus the phrase \"undiscovered technically recoverable resources\" (UTRR) refers to estimates of oil and gas that might be produced in the future using current proven technology, but without regard to cost. The cost factor is an additional applied to UTRR to determine the \"economically recoverable\" resources for an area, which are reported as separate figures. Estimates of undiscovered resources for the United States are made by the U.S. Geological Survey for resources on land, and by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly the Minerals Management Service) for resources offshore. These assessments are based on observation of geological characteristics similar to producing areas and many other factors. Reported statistics for undiscovered resources may vary greatly in precision and accuracy (determined retrospectively), which are directly dependent upon data availability, and their quality may differ for different fuels and different regions. Because estimates of undiscovered resources are based partly on current production practices, they are generally reported as undiscovered technically recoverable resources.", "Another term sometimes used in the fossil fuels literature is \"in-place\" resources. In-place resources are intended to represent all of the oil, natural gas, or coal contained in a formation or basin without regard to technical or economic recoverability. Because only a small proportion of the total amount of the fossil fuel in a deposit is ever recovered, there are often large discrepancies between volumes of in-place resources and the proportion of those resources that are technically recoverable. In-place resource estimates are sometimes very large numbers, which may be misleading if the reader does not appreciate that usually only a small proportion of the in-place volume of a resource can ever be produced or recovered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Importance of Terminology: The Example of the Bakken Formation", "paragraphs": ["Research by a USGS geologist during the 1980s and 1990s revealed that a rock formation in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and southern Canada contained an abundance of hydrocarbons dispersed throughout layers of shale and sandstone. The numbers reported were quite impressive; estimates of 271 to 503 billion barrels of oil attracted the attention of the oil industry. However, those estimates, while huge, represented \"in-place\" oil. That is, the total volume of oil was huge, but it was disseminated throughout thousands of square miles of shale and only a small portion of that total would be technically recoverable using technologies available at that time. ", "With the development of new production technologies, some of the oil in the Bakken Formation has become producible and, subsequently, the USGS has conducted a more detailed and thorough estimate of the technically recoverable resources. USGS now estimates that the Bakken Formation contains 3.65 billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and 1.85 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of undiscovered technically recoverable natural gas. These estimates are still substantial in volume, and production in the Bakken Formation is increasing. But the gap between estimates of in-place oil and technically recoverable oil demonstrates vividly the importance of knowing what the numbers represent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conventional Versus Unconventional Oil and Natural Gas Deposits", "paragraphs": ["The first oil and gas deposits discovered consisted of porous reservoirs in geologic formations, capped by an impervious rock \"trap\" within which migrating fluids such as oil, natural gas, and water would accumulate. Within the reservoir, natural gas would be the least dense fluid and would have accumulated at the top of the reservoir. Oil is more dense than gas, but less dense than water and would pool in a layer below the gas cap. Below the oil and gas, water would fill the confined reservoir. This layered arrangement of natural gas, oil, and water within a reservoir contained by a trap is called a conventional deposit and has historically provided most of the oil and natural gas that has been produced.", "In recent decades, geologists began to realize that considerable volumes of oil and natural gas exist outside conventional reservoirs in sedimentary rocks situated in geologic basins. The distribution of oil or natural gas throughout a geologic formation over a wide area, but not in a discrete reservoir, is called an unconventional deposit (sometimes called a continuous deposit). The amounts of oil and gas contained in unconventional deposits may be very large, but recovering those deposits is sometimes difficult and expensive. Oil sands provide an example of an unconventional oil deposit in which the oil is distributed widely through the sandstone formation. Recovering the oil from oil sands requires special technologies and treatments such as heating, steam flooding, or even excavation. An example of an unconventional natural gas deposit is coalbed methane. The natural gas (methane) does not exist in a discrete reservoir but is distributed throughout the pore spaces of coal and held in place by water. When the water is removed from the coal, the gas is released and can be produced. Another type of unconventional natural gas deposit is shale gas, which is discussed below (see \" Shale Gas \").", "There is no direct correlation between the economic recoverability of a deposit and whether it is conventional or unconventional. Some conventional deposits are not economically recoverable because they are too small, too deep, or lack surface access. On the other hand, certain unconventional deposits such as oil sands and coalbed methane are economically recoverable in some locations. For example, coalbed methane production was 1.9 tcf in 2009 out of a total U.S. natural gas production of 22.5 tcf (approximately 8%), and is an important component of the U.S. natural gas supply."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Authoritative Data Sources for U.S. Fossil Fuel Reserves and Resources", "paragraphs": ["Many individuals and institutions have attempted to compile and publish estimates of resources.

The USGS has conducted a number of national assessments of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources over several decades. The most recent complete comprehensive national assessment for onshore oil and gas was completed in 1995, but USGS updates that assessment on an ongoing basis as new data become available for individual basins. Responsibility for assessment of offshore undiscovered technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources belongs to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, also within the Department of the Interior.

Some shale gas is currently economic, and improved production methods are leading to increasing production. Shale gas is a classic unconventional type of deposit; the gas is distributed throughout the low-permeability shale formations rather than in a localized accumulation in a more permeable reservoir. The occurrence of gas in this manner requires special production techniques that often involve horizontal drilling into the gas-bearing formation, followed by hydrofracturing of the rock (exerting pressure in the gas well so high that it causes brittle rock to fracture) to release the gas from the rock. The use of hydrofracturing has caused some environmental concerns arising from the injection of large amounts of water into the well, concerns about the chemical composition of the injected fluids, disposal of production fluids after hydrofracturing is completed, fears that the fractured rock will expose local water wells to non-potable waters, and the observation that some hydrofracturing jobs have apparently created small earthquakes. However, industry officials insist that any environmental concerns could be mitigated through careful production practices. Shale gas is being developed in several basins within the U.S. and the proportion of total natural gas reserves comprised of shale gas is rising, though precise reserves figures are difficult to obtain in this rapidly changing sector.

When using any international fossil fuel statistics, users should be cognizant of ultimate sources of data among these energy data organizations.", "Using the best-available data, it is possible to draw a comparison of the total endowment of fossil fuels for nations. Table 5 includes the basic data for oil, natural gas, and coal for selected nations, with calculations of the total fossil fuels in each nation, expressed in billions of barrels of oil equivalent (billion BOE).", "Using only proved reserve numbers for the United States and other nations shows that the United States remains among the top nations in proved reserves of all fossil fuels taken together. Importantly, however, more than 92% of the fossil fuel reserves of the United States is coal.", "Values for technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources estimated by the USGS contain greater uncertainty than the statistics for proved reserves. Nevertheless, adding the estimates for undiscovered technically recoverable oil and natural gas provides a more inclusive estimate of total endowment of technically recoverable fossil fuels. Table 6 adds technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources to the proved reserve figures of Table 5 to provide a more complete tabulation of technically recoverable fossil fuels. Values for total fossil fuels in Table 6 include the estimates for coal reserves in the first column but do not include any estimates for undiscovered coal resources; those data simply do not exist in any consistent form for various nations.", "As an example of how such undiscovered coal resources might affect the ultimate total endowment of fossil fuels, the U.S. coal resource estimates do not include some potentially massive deposits of coal that exist in northwestern Alaska. These currently inaccessible coal deposits have been estimated to be more than 3,200 billion short tons of coal. Only a portion of that coal would likely be technically recoverable even if development were pursued but, nevertheless, it suggests other fossil fuel deposits in many parts of the world that have not been estimated or are not available for extraction.", "Again, it is noteworthy that approximately two-thirds of the total fossil energy endowment (reserves plus UTRR) of the United States is coal. That proportion may shift somewhat as new deposits of tight oil and shale gas are identified. In addition, a comparison of the ultimate endowments of fossil fuels among nations would include the important deposits of oil, natural gas, and coal that are lower on the resource pyramid in Figure 1 , and that might be exploited in the future given the appropriate technology, economic viability, and environmental acceptability. However, the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. For example, the values in Table 6 could be amended further by including estimates of oil shale or methane hydrate resources, but the final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources. The United States has considerable amounts of fossil fuels, both conventional and unconventional, both discovered and undiscovered, that are not currently economically viable. However, it is likely that other nations contain similar deposits but lack any comprehensive assessment of those resources.", "Finally, comparisons of global fossil fuel resource estimates should consider that apples-to-apples comparison of resources among countries is very difficult for a variety of reasons. Differences in definitions used in each nation, the extent to which reliable data are collected, and the transparency of data reporting all contribute to the estimates of a nation's fossil fuel endowment. The data represented in this report should be viewed only as gross approximations based on data available today, and may not represent the ultimate rankings of national endowments. An absence of data\u2014either because the data don't exist or because they are not made available\u2014produces imprecise and perhaps inaccurate estimates and, in fact, estimates made in the absence of specific data are often assumed to be zero. As data become available through exploration and development of resources in a particular region, the estimates become more accurate and more precise and sometimes grow larger. For example, the United States is an extremely well-studied and well-developed area, so estimates may be larger than an equivalent area elsewhere in the world. A country with vast areas of unexplored territory might have estimated resources that look small by comparison because there are no data to support a larger estimate. Therefore, rankings may change over time as different regions are explored and developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Production and Consumption of Oil, Natural Gas, and Coal", "paragraphs": ["To provide some scale for the reserves and undiscovered resource values reported above, Table 7 lists production and consumption of oil, natural gas, and coal by the United States.
