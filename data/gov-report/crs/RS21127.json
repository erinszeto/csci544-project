Certain federal statutes have provisions that have been used to prosecute insider trading violations. For example, Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the disgorgement of short-swing profits by named insiders\u2014directors, officers, and 10% shareholders. The 1934 Act's general antifraud provision, Section 10(b), is frequently used in the prosecution of insider traders. Although the statute does not specifically mention insider trading but, instead, forbids the use of \"manipulative or deceptive\" means in buying or selling securities, case law has clarified that insider trading is the type of fraud that is prohibited by Section 10(b). Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules issued to implement Section 10(b), particularly Rule 10b-5, have also been frequently invoked in insider trading prosecutions. With the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Congress enacted legislation that imposed up to treble damages (and in some cases the greater of $1 million or up to treble damages) on persons found guilty of insider trading. More recently, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-105) explicitly stated that there is no exemption from the insider trading prohibitions for Members of Congress, congressional employees, or any federal officials. As noted above, SEC Rule 10b-5 is the most frequently used SEC rule in lawsuits that charge violations of insider trading prohibitions. However, other SEC rules, some of which specifically target insider trading, are also important.", "There are numerous cases in which Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 have been used to prosecute insider trading violations. The most recent case of note is the Supreme Court's decision in Salman v. United States. On December 6, 2016, the Court unanimously upheld the conviction of Bassam Yacoub Salman for insider trading on tips that he had received from his brother-in-law. The Court agreed with federal prosecutors that a trader can be guilty of violating insider trading prohibitions even if the insider did not receive a tangible benefit, such as money or property, for passing the tip so long as the trader and insider are friends or relatives.", "No bill concerning insider trading appears to have been introduced in the 115th Congress to date. However, several bills, including H.R. 1173, H.R. 1625, and S. 702, were introduced in the 114th Congress before the Supreme Court's Salman decision.

According to the Court, a corporate director may not generally have an obligation of a fiduciary nature to disclose to a shareholder the director's knowledge affecting the value of the shares.

However, the SEC held that the broker's conduct violated at least clause (3) of the above-quoted SEC Rule 10b-5 in that the conduct operated as a fraud or deceit on the purchasers and, thus, there was no need to decide the scope of clauses (1) and (2). In determining that there was a violation of clause (3), the SEC appears to have found fraud committed on both the company and on persons on the other side of the market, noting:", "Analytically, the obligation [not to trade on inside information] rests on two principal elements: first, the existence of a relationship giving access, directly or indirectly, to information intended to be available only for a corporate purpose and not for the personal benefit of anyone, and second, the inherent unfairness involved where a party takes advantage of such information knowing it is unavailable to those with whom he is dealing. In considering these elements under the broad language of the anti-fraud provisions we are not to be circumscribed by fine distinctions and rigid classifications. Thus, it is our task here to identify those persons who are in a special relationship with a company and privy to its internal affairs, and thereby suffer correlative duties in trading in its securities.

Chiarella v. United States involved an alleged violation of Rule 10b-5 by an employee of a financial printer.

However, the duty arises from a fiduciary relationship, in the Court's view. In addition, there must be manipulation or deception to bring about a breach of the fiduciary duty. Here, according to the Court, the insider did not trade on the inside information, nor did he make secret profits. For the officer of the broker-dealer to have a duty to disclose inside information or abstain from trading, the officer must have a fiduciary duty and must have breached that fiduciary duty.

The standard for the wrongfulness of a communication is based on information that has been obtained by activities such as theft, breach of a fiduciary duty, or violation of a federal law protecting computer data. Specific knowledge of how the information was obtained is not necessary for a violation so long as the person trading was aware or recklessly disregarded that the information was wrongfully obtained or communicated. The bill would also have authorized the SEC to provide exemptions from these prohibitions by rule if the exemptions were not inconsistent with the purposes of the section.", "S. 702 , 114 th Congress, referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, would have added a new subsection (d) to Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act. This new subsection would have prohibited securities transactions on the basis of material information that a person knew or had reason to know was not publicly available. It also would have prohibited knowingly or recklessly communicating information that was not publicly available if it was reasonably foreseeable that the communication was likely to result in a securities transaction. \"Not publicly available\" would have been defined in such a way that it would not have included information that a person had independently developed from publicly available sources. The SEC would also have been authorized to provide for exemptions by regulations if it determined that such regulations were necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.", "The Supreme Court's decision in Salman may accomplish at least part of the goals of the legislation proposed in the 114 th Congress. However, the Salman decision does not appear to go as far as the bills in prohibiting the act of trading in securities with inside information and disclosing inside information. Salman addressed the issue of whether it is necessary for a tipper to receive something of a tangible nature when providing inside information to a trading relative or friend. However, the bills are not limited to relatives and friends; instead, they appear to prohibit in a broad way the trading of securities by any person who knows or should know that he possesses inside information."], "subsections": []}]}}
