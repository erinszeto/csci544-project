One concerned the status of funding for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI): H.R. 2995 as reported would have created a separate appropriations account for the TFF, whereas both the Administration's budget request and S. 1910 as reported proposed combining funding for the Office with overall DO funding. Another issue was the future status of two CDFIF programs: the Healthy Food Initiative and the Bank Enterprise Award Program.

No funds could be used in ways that \"violate the confidentiality of tax returns.\" No funds could be used to design pre-populated individual tax returns.", "Taxpayer Ser vices", "H.R. 2995 would have provided $2.232 billion for taxpayer services in FY2016, or $75.0 million more than the amount enacted for FY2015 but $177.2 million less than the budget request. In its report on the bill, the committee noted that the increase from FY2015 was intended to improve IRS's level of service to taxpayers. The committee also stated that the Taxpayer Advocate Service should be \"sufficiently\" funded from the funds appropriated for taxpayer services. ", "The report also addressed the committee's concerns about recent increases in instances of tax fraud related to identity theft. In the committee's view, this problem has become \"especially pernicious\" in U.S. territories and possessions. To monitor the results of IRS's efforts to combat identity theft and refund fraud, the committee directed the agency to submit a report to the two appropriations committees by June 17, 2016. The report should cover the period from 2009 to 2015 and provide the following details: (1) the number of taxpayers who had their tax return rejected because their Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers were stolen by someone to commit tax fraud; (2) the average time required to resolve the problem and send a refund to taxpayers who were due one; (3) the number of cases involving stolen taxpayer identification numbers of residents of U.S. territories and possessions; and (4) the effectiveness of steps taken by the IRS to expedite the resolution of identity theft cases, to prevent others from becoming victims, and to educate the public on the risk of identity theft.", "Another concern addressed in the report was the persistence of fraudulent and erroneous claims for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). To lower the incidence of such claims, the committee recommended that the IRS convene a summit meeting in 2016 of tax-preparation firms, payroll and tax refund processors, and state tax commissioners to agree on new, more effective strategies for verifying that someone is eligible to claim the credit without deterring eligible individuals from filing such a claim.", "The committee also expressed its opposition to pre-filled or so-called simple tax returns. In its view, such a filing system would \"change the relationship between taxpayers and their government,\" strain IRS resources, impose new burdens on employers (especially small companies), and create a conflict of interest by forcing the IRS to act simultaneously as a tax collector and enforcer of tax compliance on the one hand, and as a financial advisor and tax preparer on the other hand. As a result, the committee added language to the report that would have prohibited the agency from working on a pilot project involving a simple tax return without first getting both the approval of the two appropriations committees and appropriations for that purpose.", "Enforcement", "H.R. 2995 , as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, would have provided the IRS with $4.325 billion in appropriations for tax law enforcement in FY2016, or $535.0 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $1.075 billion less than the budget request. Of the recommended funding, $57.5 million would be reserved to support IRS's involvement with the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement program. None of the enforcement funds could be used to implement the ACA.", "In its report on the bill, the committee addressed several issues. One was the regulation of paid tax preparers. In June 2014, in response to a federal court ruling that the IRS lacked the authority to regulate professional tax preparers, the agency initiated a voluntary regulatory program with many of the same requirements as the mandatory program that was rejected by the courts. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the voluntary program, the committee directed the IRS to submit a report, after it had been reviewed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), to both appropriations committees within 120 days of the enactment of the bill. The report should evaluate the accuracy of returns prepared by participants in the voluntary program and the amount of improper IRS payments resulting from those returns. The report should also compare the costs of voluntary and mandatory regulatory programs and evaluate the likely impact on accuracy of a mandatory program. ", "Another issue was the timing of information returns. To decrease the number of improper refunds, the Treasury Department had proposed setting the filing deadline for information returns earlier in the filing season. To assess the feasibility of such a proposal, the committee ordered the IRS to submit a report, after it had been reviewed by the GAO, to both appropriations committees not later than 120 days after the enactment of H.R. 2995 on the cost to the federal government and the private sector of setting an earlier filing deadline for information returns. The report should examine the time it would take the government and private entities to implement such a change and its impact on the accuracy of information returns in general.", "In addition, the committee urged the IRS to work with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to devise a common approach to reducing and preventing tax fraud from identity theft. Such an approach should take into account the needs and concerns of vulnerable groups of taxpayers, such as senior citizens. In the committee's view, the IRS should try to notify taxpayers in a timely manner when they are \"potential victims of identity theft.\"", "Compliance with the requirements for the EITC also drew comments from the committee. It attributed improper payments of the credit, in part, to the complexity of the credit itself. To address this issue, the committee directed the Treasury Office of Tax Policy and the IRS Office of Research, Analysis, and Statistics to undertake a \"data-driven\" study, in collaboration with paid tax preparers, of ways to improve EITC compliance. ", "Another issue addressed by the committee was the ongoing controversy over IRS's management of the process of reviewing applications for tax-exempt status by social welfare entities under Section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code. H.R. 2995 would have barred the IRS from implementing in FY2016 any new regulations on the criteria used to determine an entity's eligibility for that status.", "Operations Support", "In H.R. 2995 , the House Committee on Appropriations recommended that the IRS receive $3.300 billion for operations support, or $338.4 million less than the amount enacted for FY2016 and $1.443 billion below the budget request. None of the recommended funding could have been used to implement the ACA.", "In its report on the bill, the committee encouraged the IRS to continue provide printed tax forms and instructions to \"vulnerable populations.\" Among such groups were residents of rural areas where Internet usage rates are below the national average.", "The committee also directed the IRS to prepare a report on the number of official hours employees spend on union activities and on the amount of related travel expenses and submit it to both appropriations committees within 90 days of the enactment of H.R. 2995 .", "At the behest of the committee, the GAO was to assess the cost and production schedule for all major IRS IT projects during FY2016, especially the projects that the IRS covered in quarterly reports to the committees, and submit an annual report to both committees.", "Another concern discussed in the report was IRS's pilot program for identity protection, which was intended to cut the incidence of refund fraud resulting from identity theft. The committee ordered the IRS to submit a report to both committees within 120 days of the enactment of the bill on the effectiveness of the program. The report should examine the following topics: (1) the cost of expanding the program to cover all taxpayers, (2) the reduction in tax fraud that might result from such an expansion, and (3) the cost of assisting taxpayers who were victims of identity theft.", "Business Systems Modernization", "As reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, the bill would give the IRS $250 million for the BSM program, or $40 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $129.2 million below the budget request.", "In its report on H.R. 2995 , the committee pointed out that the major expenses for developing and implementing the program had already been incurred. Therefore, future funding requests, in the committee's view, should decline as the agency realized savings from retiring aging IT systems.", "As it did with funding for operations support, the committee directed the GAO to submit an annual report to both committees on the cost and deployment schedule for all major IRS IT projects in FY2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "S. 1910", "paragraphs": ["The bill, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, would have provided $10.475 billion in appropriations for the IRS in FY2016, or $470.0 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $2.456 billion less than the budget request.", "In explaining why it sought another cut in funding for the IRS, the committee argued that the IRS \"continues to ignore the impact of its own behavior on the attitudes of taxpayers.\" As result, taxpayers have \"lost faith in the institution, and it is incumbent upon the agency to regain\" their trust. The committee cited three examples to support its case: (1) the IRS's \"disparate treatment\" of politically conservative and politically liberal entities seeking tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4); (2) the IRS's practice of hiring former employees with past performance problems; and (3) its \"willingness to cut services to taxpayers in an effort to garner support for increased resources.\"", "The committee expressed concern about the IRS's ability to allocate resources among its primary responsibilities during a period of \"fiscal austerity and budgetary constraints.\" It noted that the IRS collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fees annually for the services it provided to taxpayers, and that the IRS had almost complete control over how those fees were used. According to an estimate by the IRS, the agency could receive an estimated $450.4 million in such fees to supplement its appropriated funds in FY2016. In the committee's view, the IRS's process for allocating resources lacked \"transparency.\" As a result, the committee directed the agency to submit a spending plan for the user fees it received within 60 days of the enactment of S. 1910 ; the plan should provide details on how the IRS would allocate those fees among its four appropriations accounts to support specific programs, initiatives, and investments.", "In addition, the committee recommended that no appropriated funds be used for awarding bonuses to employees or hiring former employees without first considering their job performance and tax compliance.", "Taxpayer Services", "As reported by the committee, S. 1910 would provide $2.246 billion in appropriations for taxpayer services in FY2016, or $90 million more than the amount enacted for FY2015 but $163 million less than the budget request. Of the recommended funding, at least $5.6 million would go to the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program; $12.0 million to Low-Income Tax Clinic grants; $12.0 million to the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance matching grant program (to be made available over two fiscal years); and $206.0 million to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, of which $5.0 million would be set aside for assisting victims of identity theft and refund fraud.", "In its report on the bill, the committee pointed out that the IRS had control over how it allocates the user fees it receives among its major functions and was allowed to transfer up to 5% of the funding enacted for FY2016 among those functions, with the consent of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In FY2015, the IRS allocated 75% less of its user fees to taxpayer services than it did in FY2014. The committee urged the IRS to devote a greater proportion of its user fees to taxpayer services in FY2016. Of the recommended appropriation for these services, $90 million was designated for \"measureable\" improvements in taxpayer services and faster resolution of identity theft cases.", "The committee criticized the IRS for recent declines in the level of telephone service (LOS). According to a 2015 TIGTA report, the number of Automated Collection Service contact representatives decreased by 24% from FY2011 to FY2014, and this decline contributed to a 25% decrease in the number of taxpayer phone calls answered in that period. The average wait time for a caller increased nearly 97% from the 2011 filing season to the 2014 filing season, when it reached 15.9 minutes. In the committee's view, the IRS had the authority to offset any reductions in taxpayer service appropriations with user fees. The committee urged the agency to assign a high priority to improving its LOS in FY2016. ", "The committee also expressed concern about the possible closure of taxpayer assistance centers (TACs) in FY2016. When the report on S. 1910 was issued, the IRS was in the midst of a six-year effort to evaluate taxpayer preferences in dealing with the IRS. The main goals of the effort were to improve taxpayer services and to provide taxpayers with more secure self-service options through the IRS's website. At the behest of the committee, before the IRS closed another TAC, it had to submit a report to the committee describing the characteristics of the taxpayers that had used the centers in the past decade, including their computer and language proficiencies, and explaining how the IRS planned to meet the needs of those taxpayers. The report should discuss the criteria used by the IRS to select TACs for closure and the likely impact of planned closures on the tax compliance of the affected taxpayers. The committee also directed the IRS to take the following steps before closing a center: (1) notify the public about the geographic area served by the center; (2) hold at least one public hearing on the possible effects of the closure on taxpayer compliance; and ( 3) report to the committee on the concerns expressed by the taxpayers served by the center.", "Another issue addressed by the committee in its report on S. 1910 was the availability of adequate service for taxpayers residing in rural areas and in Alaska and Hawaii. In the case of rural areas, it directed the IRS to report to the committee within 120 days of the enactment of the bill on the measures it was taking to \"alleviate\" the problems faced by rural taxpayers in getting the needed guidance to file their returns. In the case of Alaska and Hawaii, the committee directed the IRS to ensure that each Taxpayer Advocate Service Center in the two states was staffed with a Collection Technical Advisor and an Examination Technical Advisor, in addition to other staff.", "Enforcement", "S. 1910 recommended that the IRS receive $4.500 billion in appropriations for enforcement activities in FY2016, or $360 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $900 million less than the budget request. ", "One issue the committee addressed in its report on the bill was identity theft and related refund fraud. It expressed concern about the IRS's performance in reducing the level of such fraud and the time it took to resolve cases involving taxpayers who were victims of identity theft and refund fraud. In a bid to improve that performance, the committee directed the agency to report to the two appropriations committees within 90 days of the enactment of the bill on its plans for implementing a more effective approach to authenticating the identity of a taxpayer, and for cutting in half the average time a taxpayer must wait to resolve a case involving refund fraud.", "The committee also discussed the question of how to reform the process for reviewing applications for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c) (4) to ensure it was untainted by partisan bias. It recommended that the IRS wait until existing investigations into past allegations about political bias in the screening of applications were resolved before issuing new regulations.", "Several other varieties of tax fraud drew the attention of the committee as well. One was the recent growth in the number of fraudulent tax returns filed under a prisoner's Social Security number. The committee urged the IRS to continue working with the Federal Bureau of Prisons and state Departments of Correction on more effective ways to prevent such fraud. ", "Fraudulent claims for the EITC were another concern. Improper EITC payments rose from $10.5 billion in FY2003 to about $18.0 billion in FY2014. According to the GAO, two factors accounted for these payments: (1) the difficulty some taxpayers experienced in determining by themselves if they are eligible for the credit and (2) the limited ability of the IRS to verify eligibility before refunds were issued. The committee recommended that the IRS expand its education programs for taxpayers and professional tax preparers to improve compliance with the credit. ", "On the issue of processing applications for the federal employment tax status of workers under the SS-8 program, the committee urged the IRS to maintain adequate staffing to meet the program's growing workload. The classification of a worker as an independent contractor or employee has significant tax implications for employers, workers, and the IRS. At issue is whether an individual or an employer is responsible for paying Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes, and for withholding federal income taxes. In 1994, the IRS established what was then called the Determination of Worker Status Program to permit an employer or a worker to request an IRS determination of a worker's status as an employee or independent contractor; the program is now known as the SS-8 program. According to a 2013 TIGTA report, the inventory of cases and processing times increased from FY2009 to FY2012. In January 2012, the IRS began to use a new method for prescreening requests for worker status determinations designed to speed up the process. The committee directed the IRS to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee before reducing or reassigning staff for the program.", "Operations Support", "S. 1910 would have provided $3.468 billion in appropriations for operations support in FY2016, or $170 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $1.275 billion less than the budget request. ", "Most of the IRS's planned 20 major IT investments in FY2016 will be funded through the recommended appropriations. To maintain oversight of the results and costs of these investments, the committee directed the IRS to provide both appropriations committees and the GAO with quarterly reports on \"major project activities\" no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter in 2016. The reports should discuss cumulative expenditures and the performance schedules for previous fiscal years, the costs and schedules for the previous three months, and the costs and schedules for the next three months, for the following IT projects: IRS.gov, Returns and Remittance Processing, EDAS/IPM, Information Returns and Document matching, E-services, Taxpayer Advocate Service Integrated System, and implementation of the ACA. In addition, each report should explain when the projects began, their expected dates of completion, the percentage of work already completed, the current usefulness of the technology, and any anticipated changes in the schedule for completion.", "As a supplement to these reports, the committee ordered the Treasury Department to review IRS's IT investments every six months to \"ensure the cost, schedule, and scope goals are transparent.\" It also directed the GAO to submit an annual report to both appropriations committees on the cost and results of all major IRS IT projects in FY2016.", "Business Systems Modernization", "In its report on S. 1910 , the committee recommended that the BSM program receive $260.0 million in appropriations in FY2016, or $30 million less than the amount enacted for FY2015 and $119.2 million less than the budget request.", "The committee expressed concern about the continuing risk of cost overruns and delays in getting the desired results from the BSM projects. To manage that risk, the committee directed the IRS to continue to submit quarterly reports in FY2016 on the cost and performance schedules for two projects: CADE2 and MeF.

Three of those issues are discussed here: ", "Did the IRS need a larger budget relative to FY2015 to accomplish its strategic goals and effectively carry out its legal responsibilities? Was there a sound rationale for the requested increase in FY2016 funding for enforcement and operations support related to the proposed adjustments to the program integrity caps for the IRS established by the BBEDCA? Should Congress consider the return on investment from spending on IRS enforcement activities when deciding how much to appropriate for IRS operations?", "Adequacy of the IRS Budget", "The Obama Administration contended that the IRS budget in FY2015 was insufficient in light of the agency's strategic goals, legal responsibilities, and mounting work load. To rectify that deficiency, it asked Congress to increase IRS appropriations by $1.986 billion in FY2016, relative to FY2015. ", "Between FY2010 and FY2015, IRS appropriations fell $1.2 billion (or 9.9%) and staffing by about 13,000 FTEs (or 14.1%). These declines contributed to reductions in both the assistance the IRS provided to taxpayers so they could meet their tax obligations and the actions taken by the IRS to enforce tax laws, including measures to curb tax evasion and refund fraud born of identity theft. During the 2015 filing season, over 60% of calls to the IRS's toll-free telephone taxpayer assistance lines went unanswered; the average wait time for those who got through was 23 minutes; and IRS assistors were allowed to answer basic tax questions only. Audit rates for all individual and business tax returns in FY2014 dropped to their lowest level since FY2005. And IRS's staff involved in enforcement decreased by 7,600 persons (or 18%) from FY2010 to FY2014.", "At the same time, the IRS's work load grew considerably. From FY2010 to FY2015, the number of individual tax returns filed with the IRS rose seven million (or 5.0%). The IRS had to take on two new major responsibilities: implementing the ACA and FATCA. And cases involving identity theft increased 700% from FY2010 to FY2013.", "In 2015, the IRS Commissioner, the National Taxpayer Advocate, TIGTA, and GAO issued statements calling for an increase in IRS funding. A primary concern was that continued declines in the resources available to the IRS would further diminish the effectiveness of taxpayer services, delay or cancel the implementation of critical new business systems, increase levels of tax evasion and identity theft, make the IRS more vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at stealing taxpayer information, and undermine taxpayer confidence in the fairness and efficacy of the federal income tax system.", "But critics of the IRS, including some leaders in the House and Senate, argued that the IRS needed to demonstrate that it was using available resources as effectively as possible and that it was taking advantage of opportunities for greater program efficiencies and cost savings, before increases in its budget could be considered. They maintained that with careful planning and strategic uses of the hundreds of millions of dollars in user fees the IRS collected each year, it should be able to meet its mandated responsibilities and make significant progress in achieving its strategic objectives.", "In deciding how much money to appropriate for the IRS in the future, Congress may want to consider the implications of budget proposals for the ability of the IRS to efficiently and effectively meet its statutory responsibilities and to achieve its strategic goals, including a reduction in the federal tax gap and an improvement in the integrity of a tax system that relies on voluntary compliance to raise needed revenue.", "Increased Funding for Enforcement T hrough Program Integrity Cap Adjustments", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ) amended the BBEDCA by reinstating limits on discretionary budget authority that had lapsed at the end of FY2002. The current limits apply from FY2012 to FY2021. Section 251(b) (2) of the BBEDCA authorizes certain adjustments to the spending caps after the enactment of appropriations. Under the BCA, the limits on discretionary spending can be adjusted for six reasons:", "1. changes in budget concepts and definitions, 2. appropriations designated for requirements for emergencies, 3. appropriations designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, 4. appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, 5. appropriations for controlling health care fraud and abuse, and 6. appropriations for disaster relief.", "The adjustments for health care fraud and abuse and for disability reviews and eligibility redeterminations allow for additional appropriations to carry out program integrity initiatives, which are activities intended to bring about a net reduction in federal spending, in part through reductions in improper benefit payments. In each case, the adjustment must exceed a specified minimum amount of appropriations for those activities and cannot exceed a specified maximum amount. Those amounts vary from year to year between FY2012 and FY2021. This budget mechanism is intended to ensure that the additional funding does not supplant other federal spending on these activities or is not diverted to other purposes.", "The Obama Administration asked Congress to provide more funding for IRS enforcement activities and operations support in FY2016 through a program integrity cap adjustment for collecting taxes (and related penalties and interest charges) owed but not paid and reducing improper refund payments. The request would have amended the BCA to allow an adjustment to the discretionary spending limits for the IRS from FY2016 to FY2025. In FY2016, the adjustment would have totaled $667 million in budget authority and outlays; over the entire period, the cap adjustments would have added $18.716 billion in BA and $18.570 billion in outlays. According to an IRS estimate, the cap adjustments would have led to the collection of $432 million in added tax revenue in FY2016 and $59.735 billion in added revenue from FY2016 to FY2025. This estimate assumed that one additional dollar in enforcement spending eventually would result in $6 in additional revenue, mostly from the collection of delinquent taxes.", "Every budget request for the IRS since FY2006 has included a program integrity cap adjustment for IRS enforcement funding. Congress enacted such a proposal for FY2006, FY2009, and FY2010. Enacted cuts in IRS appropriations since then did not include any of the requested program integrity cap adjustments from FY2011 to FY2015. In an effort to make further reductions in the federal tax gap and foster increased tax compliance, Congress may want to assess the advantages and disadvantages of funding IRS's enforcement activities partly through such an adjustment, as part of its consideration of future budget requests.", "Revenue Effects of Changes in IRS Appropriations", "Under current federal budget scorekeeping rules, any budgetary savings (such as increased revenue) from additional appropriations for government administrative programs is not counted as an offset to that spending. This rule goes back to the scorekeeping guidelines included in the conference report for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) and reaffirmed in the conference report for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ). The guidelines are intended to ensure the consistent treatment of the budgetary effects of government programs over time. None of the guidelines can be changed without the unanimous consent of all budget scorekeepers: the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Office of Management and Budget. ", "For the enforcement activities of the IRS, this convention means that even though the activities raise additional revenue, the additional receipts cannot be used under congressional pay-go rules to finance tax cuts or spending increases. For example, a proposed decrease in IRS funding of 50% from the amount enacted in FY2015 would be scored as a reduction in the baseline federal budget deficit of approximately $5.4 billion in FY2016; by contrast, a proposed 50% increase in FY2016 funding would be treated as an increase in the federal budget deficit of the same amount. In both cases, even if the proposed changes would affect IRS's enforcement activities only, the increase or decrease in receipts would not affect the projected federal budget deficit.", "This limitation also applies to the budgetary impact of other government compliance activities, such as measures to prevent improper Medicare payments or improper claims for federal student loans. In the view of some, a key justification for the limitation is that it deters federal agencies with enforcement budgets from shifting resources to collection functions to justify requests for larger budgets for their programs.", "By contrast, estimates of the revenue effects of legislative proposals to alter tax laws sometimes reflect both the indirect and dynamic revenue effects. H.Res. 5 (Adopting Rules for the 114 th Congress) requires the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of major legislation in their official estimates of the cost effect used to enforce the budget resolution and other House rules. Major legislation is defined as legislation with a \"gross budgetary effect\" equal to or greater than 0.25% of the projected GDP for the fiscal year to which the budget resolution applies. ", "Some argue that the current practice of disregarding the revenue effects of changes in IRS funding constitutes a bias that inclines Congress to appropriate less than it otherwise would, especially for collection activities. A change in IRS funding may affect taxpayer compliance in ways that generate an indirect revenue effect. But this effect is not scored. Yet the JCT does score the indirect revenue effects of proposed tax code changes.", "Congress may wish to consider the net contribution of IRS's administration of the federal tax code to the federal budget when deciding on the size of future IRS budgets.
