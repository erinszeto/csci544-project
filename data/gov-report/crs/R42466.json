Among the agencies represented is the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in the Department of the Interior. Many of its programs are among the more controversial of those funded in the bill. For FY2013, the House Committee on Appropriations approved H.R. 6091, a bill containing $1.16 billion for FWS, down 21.5% from the FY2012 level of $1.48 billion contained the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74, Division E, H.Rept. 112-331). The President requested $1.55 billion, an increase of 4.9% over the FY2012 level. Relative to the FY2012 level, reductions in the various accounts and most subaccounts ranged from 6.0% down to elimination, although four subaccounts were held at the FY2012 levels. No increases were approved. Other highlights of the bill include the following:", "$1.04 billion for Resource Management, by far the largest account in the FWS budget, and a reduction of 15.1% from the FY2012 level. Rejection of an Administration proposal to reduce funding for national fish hatcheries from $46.1 million to $43.2 million, despite a controversy over appropriate funding for hatcheries intended to mitigate other agencies' water projects. $3.0 million for Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science, a reduction of 90.7% from the FY2012 level of $32.2 million. Elimination of funding for general land acquisition for national wildlife refuges. A focus on reductions in programs whose authorizations have expired or are expiring in FY2012. Funding restrictions or directives regarding wolves in Wyoming; hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands; and management of certain captive-bred endangered game species.", "This report analyzes the FWS funding levels for the FY2013 appropriations bill.

For FY2013, on July 10, 2012, the House Committee reported H.R. 6091 ( H.Rept. 112-589 ), approving $1.16 billion, down 21.5% from the FY2012 level of $1.48 billion contained in P.L. 112-74 . The reductions continue a trend from the FY2012 appropriations cycle, when the House committee approved a 20.6% reduction in the FWS budget relative to FY2011. The President had requested $1.55 billion in annual appropriations, an increase of 4.9% over FY2012. The committee's proposed changes in accounts and subaccounts range from elimination (-100%) to a decrease of 6%. (See Table 1 .) This report analyzes FY2013 appropriations in a policy context, with reference to past appropriations.", "Among other things, the House committee report emphasized that at least 51 agencies or programs in the bill were operating with expired authorizations, and a few have no authorizing statute. The committee \"reserves the option to limit future funding for unauthorized programs or discontinue funding altogether.... [T]he Committee has exercised that option by decreasing or terminating funding for fish and wildlife conservation.\" Consequently, a number of FWS accounts were reduced by 50% or more. ", "By far the largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is the Resource Management account, for which the House Committee approved $1.04 billion, down 15.1% from FY2012. The Administration requested $1.25 billion, up 1.7% from the $1.23 billion for FY2012. Among the programs included in Resource Management are Endangered Species, the Refuge System, Law Enforcement, Fisheries, and Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Endangered Species Funding", "paragraphs": ["Funding for the endangered species program is part of the Resource Management account, and is a perennially controversial portion of the FWS budget. The House committee approved $134.0 million, down 23.8% from the FY2012 level of $176.0 million. The Administration had requested $179.7 million, up 2.1%. (See Table 2 .) The committee reduced most subaccounts significantly, with Critical Habitat Designation being most affected (down 39.7%). While the Administration proposed a modest increase in the listing program as a whole, it proposed no increase in funding to respond listing petitions. FWS has long argued that responding to listing petitions uses agency resources that would be better spent on listing species that the agency itself judges to be more in need of protection. In contrast, critics argue that FWS has proposed and listed very few domestic species on its own initiative and that without petitions many listings would not occur.", "The committee bill for FY2013 continued specific ceilings on the maximum spending for listing species in response to petitions, for listing foreign species, and for designation of critical habitat; identical limits were contained in FY2012 appropriations. The limitations on listing foreign species or responding to petitions were not found in the FY2011 appropriations bill; limitations on critical habitat designation have been a feature of appropriations bills for over 15 years. The President's proposal for FY2013 would also have continued the limits.", "The House committee approved $45.9 million (-23.5%) for consultation. The Administration request would increase funding for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by 4.9% over FY2012. Under Section 7, federal agencies are obliged to consult with FWS on their actions which may affect listed species, and to obtain a biological opinion (BiOp) from FWS on whether the action might jeopardize the species. If jeopardy is found, the BiOp may include reasonable and prudent alternatives for the agency action that would avoid jeopardy. FWS consultation may be critical to timely actions by federal agencies, which might otherwise hesitate to act in the face of potential citizen suits under the ESA. The committee also sought to insulate consultations regarding northern spotted owls (a species found primarily in old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest) from the effects of the reductions by directing FWS to \"devote sufficient funds from within Consultation to assure timely Biological Opinions on the northern spotted owl to other Federal land management agencies in addition to technical assistance review and 'no take letters' to small landowners seeking approval to implement harvest plans.\" A substantial reduction in consultation funding, plus directives to maintain funding for spotted owl consultation, would combine to decrease resources for consultation with other agencies for other species.", "Within the amounts for recovery, the committee directed that $1 million be used to restore a program to compensate ranchers for livestock losses due to wolf depredation; the committee also urged the Administration \"to fund this program through the Department of Agriculture in future years.\"", "The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF) also benefits species that are listed or proposed for listing under ESA, through grants to states and territories. The House committee approved $14.1 million for the CESCF, down 55.9% from the FY2012 level of $47.7 million. The Administration requested $60.0 million, up 25.8%. The program assists states with, among other things, the preparation of Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs). HCPs are developed for non-federal actions by state, local, business, or private entities as a requirement for obtaining an Incidental Take Permit for actions that may affect listed species. For HCPs involving many actors, states may use their funds from this program to coordinate the HCPs, to develop a single umbrella plan on behalf of a region, or to acquire land to mitigate effects of a project.

However, that does not mean that the agencies lack authority to conduct actions (\u00a7\u00a74, 6-8, 10, and 11; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71533, 1535-1537, 1539, and 1540), or that prohibitions within the act are no longer enforceable (\u00a79; 16 U.S.C. \u00a71538). Those statutory provisions continue to be law, even when money has not been appropriated. (Moreover, Congress may choose to continue to appropriate funds for programs whose authorization has expired.) The expiration of a provision authorizing appropriations does not end the statutory obligations created by that law. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that \"the mere failure of Congress to appropriate funds, without further words modifying or repealing, expressly or by clear implication, the substantive law, does not in and of itself defeat a Government obligation created by statute.\" Moreover, Section 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g)) \"allows any citizen to commence a civil suit on his own behalf\" on various broad, specified provisions of the act. This option would still be available, and because of this Supreme Court decision, an agency (here FWS, defended by the Department of Justice working with DOI) would have to respond, regardless of agency funding.

The President requested $494.8 million, up 1.9%. Costs of operations have increased on many refuges, partly due to special problems such as hurricane damage and more aggressive border enforcement, but also due to increased use, invasive species control, maintenance backlog, and other demands. According to FWS, refuge funding has not been keeping pace with these demands. Combined with the rising costs of rent, salaries, fuel, and utilities, the agency says these demands have led to cuts in funding for programs on refuge lands to aid endangered species, reduce infestation by invasive species, protect water supplies, address habitat restoration, and ensure staffing at the less popular refuges. While some increases were provided to address these problems in recent years, the FY2009 economic stimulus law ( P.L. 111-5 , American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) provided additional funding to address these concerns. One response to reduced funding has been the consolidation of refuges (called \"complexing\" by FWS) under a single refuge manager and staff, as a means of sharing staff and equipment. This program has met resistance from refuge supporters who argue that refuge units will lose resources and adequate supervision. Balanced against these concerns is congressional interest in general deficit reduction.", "Law Enforcement is part of the Subaccount for Migratory Birds, Law Enforcement, and International Affairs. Nationwide law enforcement covers wildlife inspections at international borders, investigations of violations of endangered species or waterfowl hunting laws, and other activities.

The Administration's FY2013 request for this activity was $131.6 million, down 2.7%. Within this account, the committee held funding for National Fish Hatchery Operations at $46.1 million, identical to the FY2012 level, and took a larger share out of aquatic habitat and species conservation. In contrast, most of the Administration's reduction ($2.9 million) was proposed to come from National Fish Hatchery Operations. FWS manages a number of hatcheries under the National Fish Hatchery System. In some cases the mandated role of a hatchery, in whole or in part, is to provide mitigation for activities by other agencies. However, the report states, \"The Committee will continue to reject proposals to reduce funding in the Service's budget for mitigation fish hatcheries until the Administration has secured offsetting reimbursable funds from the responsible Federal agencies.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science", "paragraphs": ["Part of this program supports work with partners at federal, state, tribal, and local levels to develop strategies to address climate impacts on wildlife at local and regional scales. The remainder is used to support cooperative scientific research on climate change as it relates to wildlife impacts and habitat. Both portions support and work through a network of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to ameliorate the effects of climate change. The LCCs are an amalgam of research institutions, federal resource managers and scientists, and lands managed by agencies at various levels of government. The House committee provided $3.0 million for this account, down 90.7% from the FY2012 level of $32.2 million; the accompanying report made no specific comments on the program, although the introduction to the accompanying report contained a discussion of the Administration's climate change programs generally, and criticized them for duplication and lack of coordination.

The Administration requested $106.9 million for land acquisition, an increase of 95.7% over the FY2012 level of $54.6 million. (See Table 1 .) These recommendations are consistent with the committee's overview of LWCF spending for all federal land-managing agencies. Within this program, the committee proposed that there be no new funding for general land acquisition, and that new acquisitions be directed only to inholdings, acquisition management, and overhead, as well as $4.0 million for the Highlands Conservation Act (HCA). According to the FY2012 Fish and Wildlife Service budget justification (p. LA-1), the HCA (16 U.S.C. \u00a73901) authorizes \"the Secretary of the Interior to work in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture to provide financial assistance to the Highlands States [CT, NJ, NY, and PA] to preserve and protect high priority conservation land in the Highlands region.\"", "The Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA) is a source of mandatory spending for FWS land acquisition (in contrast to the other three federal lands agencies, which rely entirely on annual appropriations). The MBCA does not receive funding in annual Interior appropriations bills. Rather, funds are derived from the sale of duck stamps to hunters and recreationists, and from import duties on certain arms and ammunition. For FY2013, available funds are estimated at $61.0 million. This estimate is $14.0 million above the previous year, and is based on the assumption that Congress would approve a proposed increase in the price of duck stamps from $15 to $25. No such increase has been introduced. Assuming that duck stamp prices will be unchanged, a more reliable estimate might be that $47.0 million would be available for FWS land acquisition from the account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Wildlife Refuge Fund", "paragraphs": ["The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF, also called the Refuge Revenue Sharing Fund) compensates counties for the presence of the non-taxable federal lands under the primary jurisdiction of FWS.

However, these receipts are sufficient for funding only a small fraction of the authorized formula, and county governments have long urged additional appropriations to make up the difference. The committee approved $12.0 million for the fund; if this level is approved, counties would receive 22.8% of the authorized level. The Administration requested no funding for NWRF in FY2013; based on receipts alone, counties would then receive 6.6% of the authorized level.

It benefits Asian and African elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, great apes, and marine turtles. The House committee reduced all of the MSCF programs by 50.0% relative to FY2012, emphasizing that all of the authorizations in this account have expired, or will expire in FY2012.

The largest portion of the program is for formula grants to states and territories.

The remainder of the state would be divided into zones of regulated hunting of wolves as a game species and unregulated take. The rule would end the wolf's protection as either a Distinct Population Segment or as an Experimental Population under ESA. The rule is contingent upon the Wyoming legislature's passing a wolf management plan that meets certain criteria specified in the proposed rule; the rule would not be finalized until the legislature's approval of the plan.
