{"id": "RS22351", "title": "Tax Incentives for Alternative Fuel and Advanced Technology Vehicles", "released_date": "2005-12-19T00:00:00", "summary": ["Alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles face significant market barriers, such as high purchase price and limited availability of refueling infrastructure. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) expands and establishes tax incentives that encourage the purchase of these vehicles and the development of infrastructure needed to support them. Among the new provisions are tax credits for the purchase of hybrid vehicles (replacing an existing tax deduction), tax credits for the purchase of advanced diesel vehicles (although it is unclear whether any current vehicles will qualify), and tax credits to expand refueling infrastructure. This report discusses current federal tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. It also outlines how the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changes those incentives. This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction1", "paragraphs": ["Alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles face significant barriers to wider acceptance as passenger and work vehicles. Alternative fuel vehicles include vehicles powered by nonpetroleum fuels such as natural gas, electricity, or alcohol fuels. Advanced technology vehicles include hybrid vehicles, which combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor system to boost efficiency. Often, these vehicles are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Further, fueling the vehicles is often inconvenient because the number of refueling stations for alternative vehicles is negligible compared with the number of gasoline stations nationwide; in some regions, the infrastructure is nonexistent. However, many of these vehicles perform more efficiently and are better for the environment than conventional vehicles. There has been significant interest in promoting these vehicles as a response to environmental and energy security concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Tax Incentives (Through 2005)4", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 , \u00a71913) established individual and business tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure.

To qualify for the credit, a hybrid vehicle must meet certain emissions standards and technical specifications. For heavy-duty vehicles (more than 8,500 pounds), the credit is based on the fuel economy relative to a comparable vehicle, as well as the incremental cost of the hybrid vehicle above the cost of the conventional vehicle.
