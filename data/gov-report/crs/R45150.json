The additional funding requested in the addendum followed enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2018 and FY2019. In April 2018, the Administration issued amendments to the President's request, including language needed to clarify the funds requested in the addendum. Agencies appear to have included this proposed funding in their budget justifications, and this funding is included in the agency analyses in this report.", "Final FY2018 funding had not been enacted at the time the President's FY2019 budget was prepared; therefore, the budget included the FY2017 actual funding levels, 2018 annualized continuing resolution (CR) levels, and the FY2019 request levels. Subsequent to the release of the President's budget, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), appropriating full-year funding for FY2018, rendering the CR levels identified in the budget no longer relevant. The analysis of government-wide R&D funding in this report preceding the individual agency analyses compares the President's request for FY2019 to the FY2017 level. As information about the agencies' FY2018 R&D levels becomes available, the agency sections of this report will be updated to reflect that information and to make comparisons to the President's FY2019 request; some agency sections have been updated. As of the date of this report, the House had completed action on 6 of the 12 regular appropriations bills; the Senate had completed action on 9; 5 had been enacted as law.

Under the new definition of R&D (applied to both FY2017 and FY2019 figures), and including the estimated $12.9 billion included in the budget addendum, President Trump is requesting approximately $131.0 billion for R&D for FY2019, an increase of $5.7 billion (4.5%) above the FY2017 level. OMB notes that under the previous definition, total federal R&D would be $38.7 billion higher, or approximately $170 billion.

Historically, over 50% of the NIH budget is used to support RPGs, which include salaries for investigators and research staff. The President's FY2019 budget proposal included two initiatives designed to \"stretch available grant dollars\" by placing limits on salaries for investigators. The FY2019 budget proposed to cap the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds to 90%. It also proposed to cap investigator salaries at $152,000, a 19% reduction from the current $187,000 limit.

Additionally, the FY2019 program level request proposed $741 million in funding transferred to NIH by the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside, also called the evaluation tap. Discretionary funding for certain programs at NIH and other HHS agencies that are authorized under the PHS Act can be subject to an assessment under Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7238j). This provision authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify improvements. Although the PHS Act limits the tap to no more than 1% of eligible appropriations, in recent years, annual LHHS appropriations acts have specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2018) and have also typically directed specific amounts of funding from the tap for transfer to a number of HHS programs. The assessment has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, has historically been the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds; until recently, it had been a relatively minor recipient. Provisions in recent LHHS appropriations acts have directed specific tap transfers to NIH, making NIH a net recipient of tap funds.

Established based on a provision of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act in 1993 ( P.L. 103-43 ), the IDeA program supports faculty development and institutional research infrastructure in states that have historically received lower levels of NIH funding. The program includes 23 eligible states along with Puerto Rico. The funding increases for Alzheimer's research, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and for the IDeA program match the funding recommendations from the earlier Senate committee report. The funding increase for the universal flu vaccines exceeds the recommendations from both the House committee report ($30 million) and the Senate committee report ($20 million). ", "Until recently, Congress has not usually specified amounts for particular diseases. Generally, specific amounts are appropriated to each IC; NIH and its scientific advisory panels allocate the funding to various research areas. This allows maximum flexibility for NIH to pursue scientific opportunities that are important to public health. Some bills may propose authorizations for designated research purposes, but previously funding generally remained subject to the NIH peer review process as well as the overall discretionary appropriation to the agency. This pattern has changed in recent years, most notably starting in FY2016 with Alzheimer's disease research, and in FY2017 with the NIH Innovation account established by the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 , see text box above).", "The report accompanying H.R. 6470 stated that the committee did not include the general provision in the budget request to limit the percentage of a researcher's salary that may be paid for using NIH grant funds, as the impact of such a change is unclear. The report stated, \"The Committee requests an analysis of the projected impact of such a policy change on the number and average cost of NIH grants, as well as on academic institutions, in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification.\" The Senate committee report and the conference report did not comment on this proposal from the president's budget request.", "The report accompanying S. 3158 , stated that \"The Committee rejects the budget's request to create 3 new Institutes at the NIH: (1) the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality; (2) the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; and (3) the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research.

With regard to NIOSH, it stated \"The Committee does not move NIOSH into NIH, as proposed in the budget request. The Committee believes NIOSH's mission does not align with NIH's focus on biomedical research and is better achieved within CDC.\" The House committee report made a similar statement about NIDILRR, but did not address AHRQ/NIRSQ. The conference report did not address any of the recommendations from the president's budget request to create three new institutes.", "The enacted law did not include the proposal in President Trump's budget request to shift the $150 million in type 1 diabetes authorized under the PHS Act \u00a7330B to discretionary funding within the budget of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Therefore Table 9 includes the type 1 diabetes research mandatory funding for all FY2019 budget columns including the budget request, as displayed in the conference reported NIH budget table.", "The President's FY2019 budget identified several research priorities for NIH in the coming year. The overview below outlines these priority themes in the budget request. Selected responses from congressional report language are also provided.", "1. Tackling Complex Challenges by Leveraging Partnerships. NIH partners with other government agencies and private entities to collaborate on research. The President's budget proposal stated that \"public-private partnerships can create efficiencies of scale and facilitate development of innovative technologies or treatments, thereby increasing the pace of biomedical research.\" For example, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership is a public-private partnership between NIH, FDA, and several biopharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations. With the goal of increasing the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, the Partnership aims to jointly identify promising biological targets for therapeutics. ", "Since 2014, the Partnership has been addressing Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and two autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus); a new Parkinson's disease initiative was also recently inaugurated. NIH will also enhance existing research efforts using a public-private partnership model to address the opioid crisis. The goal of this endeavor is to develop new formulations of medications to treat opioid misuse and accelerate the development of non-addictive pain therapies The FY2019 budget proposal also called for further dedicated investments in NIH research on opioids, serious mental illness, and pain. The FY2019 conference report ( H.Rept. 115-952 , p. 530) notes that the agreement includes $500 million for NIH research on opioid addiction, development of opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction treatment. The conference report also notes that this $500 million is in addition to $774 million that NIH is expected to spend in base funding for research on opioid misuse, addiction treatment, and pain research.", "2. Supporting Basic Research to Drive New Understanding of Health and Disease in Living Systems. NIH is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the United States. As mentioned previously, each year more than half of the NIH budget goes toward basic research, which provides \"a critical research foundation for both the public and private sectors to build upon.\" NIH funds a broad spectrum of basic science research. For example, addressing the opioid crisis requires understanding how pain is sensed and perceived, and how changes in neural circuits create a state of dependency. Basic research on neural pathways in the brain related to pain and substance use may provide an avenue for better treatments for pain, without the potential for addiction. The Senate committee report stated, \"The Committee recognizes that many revolutionary discoveries often come from unexpected, untargeted research. The Committee continues to support these basic advances through the general increase to all Institutes and Centers.\"", "3. Investing in Translational and Clinical Research to Improve Health. NIH builds on the foundation of basic research by supporting translational and clinical research that seeks to convert this basic science knowledge into interventions. Translational research aims to \"translate\" findings from basic science into medical practice to produce meaningful health outcomes. The Senate committee report noted that it \"targets investment towards clinical and translational research that moves basic discoveries from 'bench-to-bedside.'\" Clinical research, which uses human subjects, helps professionals find new and better ways to understand, detect, control, and treat illness. NIH is investing in large population studies to learn more about the similarities and differences among individuals and facilitate integrated understanding of health and disease at all levels, from the molecular to the social. For example, as previously mentioned, NIH would continue to establish a group of 1 million or more volunteers through the Precision Medicine Initiative's All of Us Research Program. This research project involves the collection of health, genetic, environmental, and other data from participants for use in research studies designed to identify novel therapeutics and prevention strategies. Additionally, the conference report directs the National Cancer Institute to design a study on providing navigation and patient expense reimbursement to improve participation of underrepresented and minority communities in clinical research for cancer, and to report its plans to Congress within 90 days of enactment.", "In addition to the above three priorities, the President's budget also identified the following as goals for FY2019:", "Updating the infrastructure of NIH facilities . An independent review is currently being conducted of the capital needs of the 281 facilities located on NIH's main campus, including its research hospital, laboratories, and offices. Fostering a diverse and talented research workforce . The FY2019 budget proposal includes $100 million in dedicated funding to the OD for the Next Generation Research Initiative to \"address longstanding challenges faced by researchers trying to embark upon and sustain independent research careers.\" The House committee report recommended the NIH use increases in available grants to target early-stage investigators and investigators seeking first time renewals. Advancing data science. The FY2019 budget would have continued to support the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative established in 2012. The FY2019 budget included $30 million for NIH to build on the progress of the BD2K as this initiative enters its final stages. Encouraging innovation through prize competitions .
