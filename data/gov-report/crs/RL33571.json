Under current law, the amount of disability retired pay is based on either disability rating or years of service, whichever produces the higher payment. Years of service is calculated in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1208. For regular component personnel, who are on duty every day of the year, this provision essentially awards a year of service for each year of duty. For reserve component personnel, who usually do not serve on duty every day of the year, years of service are calculated by a more complex formula. To simplify somewhat, the reserve formula totals up reserve training assemblies attended and days of active duty service performed and divides by 360, to produce the number of \"years of service.\" Given the less than full-time nature of normal reserve service, this means that an individual who has been serving in the reserves for 20 years may only have four or five \"years of service\" as calculated by 10 U.S.C.1208. As a result, the years of service calculation will almost always be less beneficial to a reservist than the disability rating calculation for disability retired pay.", "Discussion: Title 10 U.S.C. 12732 awards a \"year of service\" for any year in which a reserve component member earns 50 \"points.\" Reservists earn 15 points per year for being a member of the Selected Reserve, one point for each unit training assembly (UTA), and one point for each day of active duty (including annual training); points can also be earned by completing certain correspondence courses. As participating reservists typically earn more than 50 points each year, this provision would generally have the effect of awarding a \"year of service\" for retired pay calculations for each year of reserve service, provided the qualifying disability was incurred in such a manner that it merited the award of a Purple Heart (i.e., for injuries sustained in combat).", "Reference(s): CRS General Distribution Memo, Disability Benefits Provided by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs , February 18, 2005.", "CRS POCs: Charles Henning at [phone number scrubbed] or [author name scrubbed] [phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tricare Benefits for Non-Activated Members of the Selected Reserve", "paragraphs": ["Background: Until quite recently, non-activated reservists had limited access to Tricare for themselves and no access for their families.

This provision would reduce the age for receipt of retired pay for a specified population of reservists, while maintaining it at age 60 for others.

This conflict resurfaced over the past year with respect to several decisions that directly affected the Army and Air National Guard. In addition, the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has generated great interest in revamping the way in which the federal and state governments prepare for and respond to disasters or other catastrophic events. Modifying the role that the National Guard might play in future events has been an area of particular area of interest, given its unique status as both a state and federal force. The National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act ( H.R. 5200 / S. 2658 ), introduced in April 2006, is one approach to these issues. It would make major changes in the role of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and the authority of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB). Specifically, it would:", "(1) change the NGB from a \"joint bureau of the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force\" to a \"joint activity of the Department of Defense\";", "(2) modify current statutory language specifying that the NGB serve as the channel of communications between the (a) the Departments of the Army and Air Force and (b) the states on all matters pertaining to the National Guard, to specify that the NGB will serve as the channel of communications between (a) the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the commanders of the combatant commands for the United States, (b) the Departments of the Army and Air Force, and (c) the states on all matters pertaining to the National Guard;", "(3) modify current statutory language to specify that the CNGB serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on National Guard matters, in addition to the CNGB's current duties as principal advisor to the Secretary of the Army, Chief of Staff of the Army, Secretary of the Air Force, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force on these matters;", "(4) designate the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), with all the attendant duties designated in law for members of the JCS, including the ability to attend JCS meetings and to provide advice and opinions to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and the Congress as specified by 10 U.S.C. 151;", "(5) prescribe the grade of the CNGB as general (i.e., a four-star general), rather than the current grade of lieutenant general (i.e., a 3-star general);", "(6) modify the statutory authority which codifies the functions of the NGB so that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, is responsible for developing the NGB charter, rather than the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force as currently specified;", "(7) add a new function which the NGB charter must cover: \"facilitating and coordinating with other federal agencies, and with the several states, the use of National Guard personnel and resources for and in contingency operations, military operations other than war, natural disasters, support of civil authorities, and other circumstances\";", "(8) give the CNGB the responsibility of identifying gaps between federal and state capabilities to prepare for and respond to emergencies, and to make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on National Guard programs for military assistance to civil authorities (MACA) which can address these gaps. To fulfill these duties, the legislation would require the CNGB, in consultation with the various state Adjutants General, to assume the following responsibilities: validate requirements of the states and territories with respect to MACA; develop training and doctrine relating to the provision of MACA; acquire equipment and supplies for the provision of MACA; assist the Secretary of Defense in preparing budget materials for training and equipping the National Guard for purposes of MACA and other domestic operations; administer funds provided to the National Guard for MACA; and carry out other responsibilities related to the provision of MACA as specified by the Secretary of Defense.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England recently voiced opposition to this legislation during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee (June 13, 2006, hearing on National Guard Enhancement). One of his primary objections was that the Army National Guard is an integral part of the Army, and the Air National Guard is an integral part of the Air Force; this legislation, he argued, could damage that relationship and lead to these organizations becoming less integrated with the Army and Air Force. Additionally, he argued that the legislation has not been adequately studied and could have negative unforeseen consequences. The House version of the NDAA would have directed the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve to study H.R. 5200 and an alternative proposal which would have simply elevated the CNGB to the rank of four-star general. The Senate version of the NDAA contained a scaled-back version of S. 2658 which omitted some of the most controversial provisions of that bill (for example, the provision making the CNGB a member of the JCS). Nonetheless, the Senate provisions would still have made substantial changes in the role of the NGB and the authority of the CNGB. The Conference opted for additional study of these issues by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve with a final report to be submitted by early 2008.", "Reference(s): None.", "CRS POCs: Charles Henning at [phone number scrubbed] or [author name scrubbed] at [phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}}
