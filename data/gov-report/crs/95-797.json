Commerce Power", "paragraphs": ["A federal statute is constitutional if it is enacted pursuant to a power of Congress enumerated in the Constitution and if it does not contravene any provision of the Constitution. The enumerated power pursuant to which federal tort reform could be enacted is Congress's power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States\" (Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3). One might ask, however, whether tort law is \"commerce,\" and, if it is, whether federal tort reform legislation would be constitutional as applied to purely intrastate torts.", "The Supreme Court has held that Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce includes the power to regulate any activity that \"exerts a substantial effect on interstate commerce\" ( Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942)), or is within a \" class of activities ... within the reach of federal power\" ( Perez v. United States , 402 U.S. 146, 154 (1971) (emphasis in original)). Furthermore, \"when Congress has determined that an activity affects interstate commerce, the courts need inquire only whether the finding is rational.\" Hodel v.

Consequently, there seems little doubt that tort reform legislation, in general, would be within Congress's commerce power.", "However, it may be unconstitutional for tort reform legislation to be applied to particular intrastate torts that arguably do not substantially affect interstate commerce. An example might be an assault by one individual upon another where the assault has no connection with organized crime or any commercial activity. This is because, in United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 (1995), the Supreme Court, for the first time since 1936, declared a federal statute unconstitutional for exceeding Congress's Commerce Clause authority. In Lopez , it struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal offense \"for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\"", "The Court in Lopez", "identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e. , those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.", "Id . at 558-559 (citations omitted).", "The Court in Lopez then noted that, if the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was \"to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.\" Id . at 559. The act, however, had \"nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise ... [and] is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" Id . at 561. The same apparently could be said of some torts, such as the assault example suggested above. But it does not appear that it could be said with respect to torts that substantially affect commerce, such as the manufacture of defective products or medical malpractice.", "Since Lopez , the Supreme Court has decided two major cases on the reach of the Commerce Clause. In United States v. Morrison , 529 U.S. 598 (2000), the Court struck down a section of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 that created a federal cause of action against any person \"who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender,\" whether interstate or intrastate. In striking down the provision, the Court noted that \"a fair reading of Lopez shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case\" ( id . at 610), and \"[g]ender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity.\" Id . at 613.", "In Lopez , the Court noted that \"Congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce.\" 514 U.S. at 562. It added, however:", "But to the extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce, even though no substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they are lacking here.", "Id . at 563. In Morrison , the Court found Congress's findings \"substantially weakened\" by their reliance on a \"but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime ... to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce.\" 529 U.S. at 615.", "The second recent major Supreme Court case on the reach of the Commerce Clause was Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U.S. 1 (2005), which upheld the application of the federal statute prohibiting the manufacture and possession of marijuana to the intrastate cultivation and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The Court found that there was a rational basis for concluding that the local cultivation and use of marijuana, \"taken in the aggregate, substantially affect[s] interstate commerce.\" Id . at 22. The Court distinguished Lopez and Morrison on the ground that those two cases involved attempts to regulate activities that were not economic, whereas marijuana is a commodity \"for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market,\" and \"[p]rohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that product.\" Id . at 26.

There was no contention that Congress's commerce power was not broad enough to encompass this sort of regulation. The contention, rather, which the Court accepted, was that the Constitution contained an affirmative limitation on this exercise of the commerce power. The Court did not name any particular provision of the Constitution as imposing the limitation in this case, but did quote an earlier case that said that the Tenth Amendment \"expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.\"", "In any event, the Court held that the Commerce Clause did not authorize Congress \"to directly displace the States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.\" Id . at 852. The only example the Court gave of an integral governmental function was the structuring of \"employer-employee relationships in such areas as fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation.\" Id . at 851.

The Court found that it had \"no license to employ freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring congressional authority under the Commerce Clause.\" Id . at 550. The Court did, however, \"recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.\" Id . at 556.", "Subsequently, the Court took a step back in the direction of National League of Cities . In New York v. United States , 505 U.S. 144 (1992), the Court invalidated a provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 because it required states not participating in a regional waste disposal compact to \"take title\" to waste or accept liability for generators' damages. The Court readily acknowledged that Congress may regulate the interstate market in disposal of low-level radioactive waste, but noted that the Commerce Clause \"authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulate state governments' regulation of interstate commerce.\" Id . at 166.", "The Court discussed two methods", "by which Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislative program consistent with federal interests.... First, under Congress' spending power, \"Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds.\" ... Second, where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause, we have recognized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.", "Id . at 167.", "But if states decline to participate in a federal scheme, Congress may not force them to do so; to have its way, Congress must preempt state law and regulate directly. The \"take title\" provision, rather than presenting states with a choice between regulatory participation or accepting federal preemption, required states to choose \"between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatory techniques.... Either way, 'the Act commandeers the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.'\" Id . at 176.", "Under New York v. United States , the only significant federalism restraint on exercise of the commerce power is that state regulatory processes may not be \"commandeered\" for federal purposes; there is no federalism restraint on federal regulation of businesses and individuals in areas traditionally regulated by states. The fact that Congress has traditionally deferred in large measure to state regulation of the insurance industry, for example, does not mean that Congress must continue to do so; Congress does not invade areas reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment \"simply because it exercises its authority ... in a manner that displaces the States' exercise of their police powers.\" Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Association, Inc. , 452 U.S. 264, 291 (1981) (upholding \"steep slope\" and other federal regulations of surface mining in spite of traditional state role in regulating land use).", "In the case of federal tort reform proposals such as reducing awards by amounts recovered from collateral sources, Congress would not be commandeering state regulatory processes. Congress would merely be enacting federal law that preempted substantive state law, and requiring states to enforce the federal law. In New York v. United States , the Court cited four cases that discuss \"the well established power of Congress to pass laws enforceable in state courts.\" Id . at 178. The Court added:", "These cases involve no more than an application of the Supremacy Clause's provision that federal law \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land,\" enforceable in every State. More to the point, all involve congressional regulation of individuals, not congressional requirements that States regulate. Federal statutes enforceable in state courts do, in a sense, direct state judges to enforce them, but this sort of federal \"direction\" of state judges is mandated by the text of the Supremacy Clause.", "Id . at 178-179. One of the four cases the Supreme Court cited, Second Employers ' Liability Cases , 223 U.S. 1 (1912), involved what today would be called tort reform. The case was a challenge to the Employers' Liability Act of 1908, which regulated the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees; it was essentially a federal workers' compensation statute that preempted state tort law by, among other things, its \"abrogation of the fellow-servant rule, the extension of the carrier's liability to cases of death, and the restriction of the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk....\" Id . at 49. One question before the Supreme Court was \"whether rights arising under the congressional act may be enforced, as of right, in the courts of the States when their jurisdiction, as prescribed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion.\" Id . at 55. The Court answered the question as follows:", "When Congress, in the exertion of the power confided to it by the Constitution, adopted that act, it spoke for all the people and all the States, and thereby established policy for all.

Alternative Dispute Resolution", "paragraphs": ["One tort reform that may be considered by Congress is to require that tort claims\u2014particularly medical malpractice claims\u2014be decided by alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures, such as binding arbitration, rather than by traditional jury trials. When Congress creates a federal cause of action, it is generally free to prescribe any procedure for its enforcement, with or without a jury trial. Traditional tort actions, however, such as medical malpractice and products liability, are not federal causes of action; they are governed by state law, even when they are brought in federal court on diversity grounds. State laws generally provide for jury trials in tort cases brought in state courts, and the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution generally provides for jury trials of cases arising under state law that are brought in federal court.

Seventh Amendment", "paragraphs": ["If Congress were to require ADR procedures in lieu of jury trials, then the Seventh Amendment would become a consideration. The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury \"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars.\" Tort actions are suits at common law, so the Seventh Amendment applies to them. However, the Seventh Amendment, unlike most of the Bill of Rights, does not apply in state courts, where most tort actions are brought. It does apply, however, to cases arising under state law that are brought in federal court on diversity grounds.", "Because the Seventh Amendment applies to the federal courts, Congress may not eliminate the right to a jury trial in common law tort actions brought in federal court. It may, however, eliminate the right to bring common law tort actions in federal court. One way to do this would be to abolish diversity jurisdiction in tort suits; i.e., to prohibit tort suits arising under state law from being brought in federal courts. Another way would be to alter tort suits to the point that they could no longer be considered \"Suits at common law\" to which the Seventh Amendment would apply.", "Congress has done the latter with respect to torts inflicted upon federal workers in the workplace. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 et seq. , provides for compensation to federal employees for disability or death resulting from work-related injuries, whether the result of a tort or otherwise. Employees can recover without proof of fault on the part of the government or its employees, but are prohibited from bringing a tort action arising under state law against the government or its employees. An injured employee seeking recovery must file a claim with the Secretary of Labor, who determines whether the employee is entitled to an award. There is no right to a jury trial, nor to judicial review. The Supreme Court has held that such an arrangement does not violate the Seventh Amendment because it \"abolishes all right of recovery in ordinary cases, and therefore leaves nothing to be tried by jury.\"", "It appears, therefore, that Congress may prohibit common law tort suits from being brought in federal court, but may not take the less radical step of allowing them to be brought in federal court but prohibiting them from being heard by juries. If Congress is precluded from permitting common law tort suits to be heard by a federal court without a jury, then it also is precluded from permitting common law tort suits to be decided by a federally established arbitration panel or other federally established non-judicial forum. To do so would violate not only the Seventh Amendment; it would violate Article III of the Constitution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "B. Article III", "paragraphs": ["Article III, section 1, provides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may establish, and that the judges of both the supreme and inferior courts shall hold life tenure \"during good Behavior,\" at an irreducible compensation.

Marathon Pipeline Co. , the Supreme Court \"identified three situations in which Art. III does not bar the creation of legislative courts.\" These three situations are territorial courts, military courts, and courts created to adjudicate cases involving \"public rights.\" With respect to the third situation, Marathon elaborated:", "[A] matter of public rights must at a minimum arise \"between the government and others.\" In contrast, \"the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined,\" is a matter of private rights. Our precedents clearly establish that only controversies in the former category may be removed from Art. III courts and delegated to legislative courts or administrative agencies for their determination. Private-rights disputes, on the other hand, lie at the core of the historically recognized judicial power.", "Subsequently, the Court rejected the notion that public rights must at a minimum arise between the government and others. In Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , the Court wrote:", "The crucial question, in cases not involving the Federal Government, is whether \"Congress, acting for a valid legislative purpose pursuant to its constitutional powers under Article I, [has] create[d] a seemingly 'private' right that is so closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III judiciary.\" If a statutory right is not closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact, and if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the Federal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an Article III court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "C.

In certain situations, of course, Congress may fashion causes of action that are closely analogous to common-law claims and place them beyond the ambit of the Seventh Amendment by assigning their resolution to a forum in which jury trials are unavailable. Congress' power to do so is limited, however, just as its power to place adjudicative authority in non-Article III tribunals is circumscribed.", "That is, the situations in which Congress may deny the right to a jury trial are the same situations in which Congress may place a matter outside of an Article III court.

Applying Article III and the Seventh Amendment", "paragraphs": ["Whether a federal statute requiring tort claims to be decided by an Article I tribunal would violate Article III, and whether it would violate the Seventh Amendment, amount to the same question. But what is the answer? Before examining some Supreme Court decisions that may shed light on it, we should emphasize that the question arises only if Congress were to establish a federal non-Article III forum to hear traditional tort claims. If Congress instead were simply to prohibit states from using jury trials in tort cases, but did not establish an Article I forum for such cases, this would not raise an Article III/ Seventh Amendment issue. This is because state courts were created pursuant to state laws or constitutions and do not exercise federal judicial power, and because the Seventh Amendment does not apply to them. Yet, such an action by Congress raises a different constitutional issue of whether Congress may alter procedures that state courts use to adjudicate state causes of action. This is discussed below in \" F. Constitutionality of Prohibiting States from Using Jury Trials, Without Establishment of a Federal Non-Article III Forum .\"", "But to what extent may Congress require that tort claims be decided by an Article I tribunal? In Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. , the Supreme Court noted that Northern Pipeline had established \"that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\" The same undoubtedly applies to traditional tort actions arising under state law. However, this quotation suggests that Congress may vest tort claims in a non-Article III forum if it does at least one of two things: (1) alters tort claims so that they are no longer traditional common law actions, or (2) allows de novo review, with the right to a jury trial, of traditional common law tort actions, rather than allow merely traditional appellate review. In other words, Congress apparently may require that traditional common law tort actions initially be heard in a federal non-Article III forum, without a jury, provided it allows a dissatisfied party to then seek a jury trial. However, if Congress wishes to limit judicial review of tort claims, then it apparently must alter tort claims so that they are no longer traditional common law tort actions.", "To what extent must Congress alter tort claims in order to place them in a non-Article III forum and not provide de novo review? In Granfinanciera , the Court held that \"Congress may fashion causes of action that are closely analogous to common-law claims and place them beyond the gambit of the Seventh Amendment\" if, in cases not involving the federal government, the private right that Congress creates \"is so closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III judiciary.\" In Thomas , the Court indicated that such limited involvement may consist in judicial review that is something less than de novo review with the right to a jury trial.", "In Thomas , the Court rejected the notion that a matter of public rights must at a minimum arise between the government and others. Instead, it held \"that practical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III.\" Thomas involved a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 136 et seq . FIFRA requires manufacturers, as a precondition for registration of a pesticide, to submit research data to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the product's health, safety, and environmental effects. Congress wished to allow the EPA to consider data submitted by one registrant to support the registration of the same or a similar product by another registrant, and therefore \"provided statutory authority for the use of previously submitted data as well as a scheme for sharing the costs of data generation.\" In order to avoid a \"logjam of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation,\" Congress provided for \"a system of negotiation and binding arbitration to resolve compensation disputes among registrants.\" \"The arbitrator's decision is subject to judicial review only for 'fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.'\"", "The Court considered several factors in determining that an Article III tribunal was not required to resolve these disputes. It found mandatory binding arbitration permissible in part because the right to compensation for shared data \"does not depend on or replace a right to ... compensation under state law.\"", "The right created by FIFRA is not purely a \"private\" right, but bears many of the characteristics of a \"public\" right. Use of a registrant's data to support a follow-on [ i.e. , subsequent] registration serves a public purpose as an integral part of a program safeguarding the public health. Congress has the power, under Article I, to authorize an agency administering a complex regulatory scheme to allocate costs and benefits among voluntary participants in the program without providing an Article III adjudication.", "Thus, to use the words of the Court in Granfinanciera a few years later, Thomas involved a private right that was \"closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme.\" In addition, the Court in Thomas cited the fact that \"no unwilling defendant is subjected to judicial enforcement power as a result of the agency 'adjudication,'\" and that FIFRA, while it limits judicial review, it \"does not preclude review of the arbitration proceeding by an Article III court.\"", "In Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor , the Supreme Court again emphasized that, in determining whether an Article III tribunal is required, it", "has declined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules. Although such rules might lend a greater degree of coherence to this area of law, they might also unduly restrict Congress' ability to take needed and innovative action pursuant to its Article I powers. Thus, in reviewing Article III challenges, we have weighed a number of factors, none of which has been deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.", "The opinion in Schor reveals how nonformalistic the Court's approach is in this area:", "Among the factors upon which we have focused are the extent to which the \"essential attributes of judicial power\" are reserved to Article III courts, and, conversely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts, the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article III.", "The Court in Schor upheld a congressional grant of adjudicatory powers to a federal agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Court emphasized that the CFTC's", "adjudicatory powers depart from the traditional agency model in just one respect: the CFTC's jurisdiction over common law counterclaims.... Aside from its authorization of counterclaim jurisdiction, the [statute] leaves far more of the \"essential attributes of judicial power\" to Article III courts than did that portion of the Bankruptcy Act found unconstitutional in Northern Pipeline .", "Specifically, CFTC orders are reviewed under the \"weight of the evidence\" standard, \"rather than the more deferential standard found lacking in Northern Pipeline .\" Furthermore, \"[t]he legal rulings of the CFTC ... are subject to de novo review.\"", "In Northern Pipeline the Court found unconstitutional the delegation to an Article I tribunal\u2014the United States Bankruptcy Court\u2014of the adjudication of the right to recover contract damages. Although discharge in bankruptcy \"may well be a 'public right'\" and if it is may be delegated to an Article I court, the right to recover contract damages is a state-created private right and as such may not be delegated to an Article I court. In response to the argument that \"the bankruptcy court is merely an 'adjunct' to the district court, and that the delegation of certain adjudicative functions to the bankruptcy court is accordingly consistent with the principle that the judicial power of the United States must be vested in Art. III courts,\" the Supreme Court observed that \"the judgments of the bankruptcy courts are apparently subject to review only under the more deferential 'clearly erroneous' standard.\" Such limited review gave the bankruptcy courts more power than was permissible for an \"adjunct.\"", "In Granfinanciera , the Court held that the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial in a suit by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover an allegedly fraudulent monetary transfer. It reached this conclusion because", "a bankruptcy trustee's right to recover a fraudulent conveyance under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548(a)(2) seems to us more accurately characterized as a private right rather than a public right as we have used those terms in our Article III decisions. In Northern Pipeline Construction Co .... the plurality noted that ... state-law causes of action for breach of contract or warranty are paradigmatic private rights, even when asserted by an insolvent corporation in the midst of Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings.", "It was not sufficient that Congress had \"reclassified a pre-existing, common-law cause of action.... Congress cannot eliminate a party's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial merely by relabeling the cause of action to which it attaches and placing exclusive jurisdiction in an administrative agency or a specialized court of equity.\"", "\"Nor,\" the Court added, \"can Congress' assignment be justified on the ground that jury trials of fraudulent conveyance actions would 'go far to dismantle the statutory scheme,' or that bankruptcy proceedings have been placed in 'an administrative forum with which the jury would be incompatible.'\"", "Furthermore, \"[i]t may be that providing jury trials in some fraudulent conveyance actions ... would impede swift resolution of bankruptcy proceedings and increase the expense of Chapter 11 reorganizations. But 'these considerations are insufficient to overcome the clear command of the Seventh Amendment.'\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "E. Constitutionality of Establishing Federal Non-Article III Forums: Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In Thomas , the Court upheld the use of a non-Article III forum because, among other things, the right created was \"not purely a 'private' right,\" and limited judicial review by an Article III court was permitted. In Schor , the Court upheld the use of a non-Article III forum because, among other things, its adjudicatory powers over common law actions were limited, its orders were reviewed by an Article III court under a relatively non-deferential standard, and its legal rulings were subject to de novo review.", "In Northern Pipeline , the Court struck down the use of an Article I forum because it was allowed to decide state-created private rights, and its decisions were subject only to deferential judicial review. In Granfinanciera , the Court struck down the use of an Article I forum because the right that was adjudicated was a private right.", "These cases show that, as the Court wrote in Schor , \"in reviewing Article III challenges, we have weighed a number of factors, none of which has been deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.\" However, the major factors appear to be the extent to which the cause of action constitutes a private right, and the degree of review by an Article III tribunal that is provided. If a cause of action is a traditional common law cause of action, not closely integrated into a federal regulatory scheme, then de novo review by an Article III court, with a jury trial, would apparently be required. If the cause of action is altered somewhat, but still resembles a common law action, then something less than de novo review by an Article III court might be adequate, provided the Article III court is not required to be too deferential to the finding of the non-Article III forum. If the cause of action is altered to the point that it no longer resembles a common law tort, and is closely integrated into a federal regulatory scheme, then adjudication by an Article I forum, without judicial review, may be permissible. It does not seem possible to be more specific than this, as \"bright-line rules cannot effectively be employed to yield broad principles applicable to all Article III inquiries.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "F. Constitutionality of Prohibiting States from Using Jury Trials, Without Establishment of a Federal Non-Article III Forum", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, if Congress were to prohibit the states from using jury trials in tort cases, but did not establish a federal non-Article III forum to hear such cases, then it would raise no Article III\u00a0/ Seventh Amendment issue, but it would raise another constitutional issue. This issue is whether Congress, even where it would otherwise have the power to regulate under the Commerce Clause, may alter the procedures that state courts use to adjudicate state causes of action. In New York v. United States , discussed above, the Court prohibited Congress from using its commerce power to commandeer state regulatory processes. Although, as noted, this restriction would not seem to preclude Congress from preempting substantive state law, it might be argued that eliminating jury trials, constituting as it would an interference with state court procedure, might amount to commandeering state regulatory processes.", "This distinction between substance and procedure also finds support in the Supreme Court's approach to diversity cases, which are cases arising under state law which, because they are between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, may be heard in federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1937), the Supreme Court held that, in diversity cases, a federal court is bound by the substantive, as opposed to the procedural, law of the state in which it sits, \"whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision.\"", "In Guaranty Trust Co. v. New York , 326 U.S. 99 (1945), the Supreme Court held that statutes of limitations are substantive for this purpose, and that therefore federal courts must apply state statutes of limitations in diversity cases. By \"substantive,\" the Court meant that the statute could substantially affect the outcome of the litigation. A statute of limitations can substantially affect the outcome of litigation because it can preclude an action from even being brought. By contrast, the right to a jury trial does not have a comparably substantial effect, because in a non-jury trial a judge presumably applies the same law to the same facts as a jury would in a jury trial.", "In diversity cases, \"[i]t is now clear that federal law determines whether there is a right to a jury trial in a case in federal court and that state law is wholly irrelevant.\" Although the Seventh Amendment, rather than the substantive/procedural distinction, is the main factor here, one could nevertheless argue that, if federal courts may use the federal rule with respect to jury trials of state causes of action, then state courts may not be preempted from using their own rules with respect to jury trials of state causes of action.", "In addition, \"[t]he general rule, bottomed deeply in belief in the importance of state control of state judicial procedure, is that federal law takes the state courts as it finds them. For example, state rules about the ways in which claims for relief, or defenses, or counter-defenses, must be asserted may ordinarily be applied also to federal claims and defenses and counter-defenses, providing only that the rules are not so rigorous as, in effect, to nullify the asserted rights.\"", "This general rule seems to have operated in a 1950 case in which the Supreme Court held that a state may \"deny access to its courts to persons seeking recovery under the Federal Employers' Liability Act if in similar cases the State for reasons of local policy denies resort to its courts and enforces its policy impartially ... so as not to involve a discrimination against Employers' Liability Act suits....\"", "There is an apparently strong argument, however, in support of Congress's power to eliminate jury trials in state causes of action heard in state courts. The Supreme Court has held that section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, preempts conflicting state law. This statute provides that agreements to arbitrate \"shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\" and thus effectively eliminates the right to a jury trial in some state cases. In Southland Corp. v. Keating , 465 U.S. 1, 11 (1984), the Supreme Court found that \"[t]he Federal Arbitration Act rests on the authority of Congress to enact substantive rules under the Commerce Clause,\" and that it preempted a state statute that had been interpreted to require judicial consideration of claims brought under a state statute. In Perry v. Thomas , 482 U.S. 483 (1987), and in Doctor ' s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto , 517 U.S. 681 (1996), the Supreme Court again found the Federal Arbitration Act to preempt conflicting state law. If Congress can eliminate judicial consideration of a case, then arguably it can eliminate jury consideration while retaining judicial consideration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
