They are launched at the local, state, and national levels and respond to a variety of challenges such as violent crime, criminal gangs, terrorism, white-collar crime, public corruption, even intelligence sharing. This report focuses on those task forces and information sharing efforts that respond to federal counterdrug and counterterrorism priorities in the Southwest border region. More generally, the report also offers context for examining law enforcement coordination. It delineates how this coordination is vital to 21st century federal policing and traces some of the roots of recent cooperative police endeavors.", "Policy makers interested in federal law enforcement task force operations may confront a number of fundamental issues. Many of these can be captured under three simple questions:", "1. When should task forces be born? 2. When should they die? 3. What overarching metrics should be used to evaluate their lives?", "Task forces are born out of a number of realities that foster a need for increased coordination between federal law enforcement agencies and their state and local counterparts. These realities are particularly evident at the Southwest border. Namely, official boundaries often enhance criminal schemes but can constrain law enforcement efforts. Criminals use geography to their advantage, profiting from the movement of black market goods across state and national boundaries. At the same time, police have to stop at their own jurisdictional boundaries. Globalization may aggravate such geographical influences. In response, task forces ideally leverage expertise and resources\u2014including money and manpower to confront such challenges. Identifying instances where geography, globalization, and criminal threat come together to merit the creation of task forces is arguably a process best left to informed experts. Thus, police and policy makers can be involved in highlighting important law enforcement issues warranting the creation of task forces. Task forces, fusion centers, and other collaborative policing efforts can be initiated legislatively, administratively, or through a combination of the two, and they can die through these same channels.", "While some clarity exists regarding the circumstances governing the creation of task forces, it is less clear when they should die and how their performance should be measured. Two basic difficulties muddy any evaluation of the life cycles of law enforcement task forces.", "First, and in the simplest of terms, at the federal level no one officially and publicly tallies task force numbers. The lack of an interagency \"task force census\" creates a cascading set of conceptual problems.", "Without such information, it is challenging, if not impossible, to measure how much cooperation is occurring, let alone how much cooperation on a particular threat is necessary. Concurrently, it may be difficult to establish when specific task forces should be disbanded or when funding for a particular class of task forces (e.g., violent crime, drug trafficking, counterterrorism) should be scaled back. Additionally, how can policy makers ascertain whether task force programs run by different agencies duplicate each other's work, especially if they target the same class or category of criminals (such as drug traffickers or violent gangs)? For example, do the violent crime task forces led by one agency complement, compete with, or duplicate the work of another's?", "To give a very broad sense of federal task force activity in one geographic area, CRS compiled a list of task forces and fusion centers operating along the Southwest border, which are geographically depicted in this report. To be included in the list, a task force had to exhibit the possibility of either directly or indirectly combatting drug trafficking or terrorism. Thus, task forces devoted to fighting gangs, violent crime, public corruption, capturing fugitives, and money laundering may be included.", "Second, there is no general framework to understand the life trajectory of any given task force or class of task forces. What key milestones mark the development and decline of task forces? (Can such a set of milestones even be produced?) How many task forces outlive their supposed value because no thresholds regarding their productivity are established? Though federal law enforcement has embraced the task force concept, it has not agreed on the breadth or duration of such cooperation. Such lack of accord extends to measuring the work of task forces. This report suggests a way of conceptualizing these matters by framing task force efforts and federal strategies tied to them in terms of input, output, and outcome\u2014core ideas that can be used to study all sorts of organizations and programs, including those in law enforcement.", "An official task force census coupled with a conceptual framework for understanding and potentially measuring their operations across agencies could greatly assist policy making tied to federal policing throughout the country, and particularly along the Southwest border."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Task forces, and more broadly inter-agency cooperation, have become familiar law enforcement tools to combat innovative, aggressive, and far reaching criminal and homeland security adversaries in the last three decades.

Federal enforcement and security priorities geared toward stemming drug trafficking and terrorism surface in unique ways along the border.

These include the following:", "When and under what specific conditions should task forces be created? When and under what specific conditions should task forces be disbanded? How should the successes or failures of task forces be measured, and who should evaluate them?", "Notably, no one formally and publicly catalogs the creation or existence of task forces. As such, there is no official roster, or task force census, of federally led task forces operating around the country or even in a particular region, nor is there an inventory of those task forces targeting specific threats.

These partnerships will facilitate timely information and criminal intelligence sharing and decrease duplication of effort. Improved coordination through co-location and co-mingling of personnel and resources, formal planning meetings, data set sharing, and intelligence analyst conferences among the various agencies allows for a more synchronized effort. Indeed, Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies all play critical roles in border security efforts. Establishing full and genuine partnerships, designed to maximize the resources and capabilities of each group, will enable the Nation to more comprehensively address the threat posed by illicit activities along the Southwest border.", "While this report acknowledges that law enforcement coordination may be influenced by many mechanisms including task forces, fusion centers, memoranda of understanding, and interagency agreements, among other things, the bulk of the report focuses on the use of task forces and intelligence sharing entities such as fusion centers. Of note, the term \"fusion center\" lacks an exacting definition (see Task Forces and Fusion Centers textbox, below). The fusion centers described in this report (see Fusion Centers and Information Sharing , below) are part of a national network \"owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners.\" They are not federally led like the other task forces and intelligence sharing initiatives discussed in this report. Nonetheless, they are federally backed and important to national strategies and policing efforts.

For one, borders or boundaries often enhance criminal operations. Criminals exploit borders to their advantage, profiting from the movement of black market goods across state and national boundaries. Criminals also harness advanced technologies and the cyber domain to globalize their operations\u2014crossing a variety of borders. Thus, they expand their pool of potential victims and increase the speed with which they can carry out their operations over great distances. In the same realm, jurisdictional lines tend to limit the efforts of law enforcement agencies to fight these same criminals. Moreover, for one set of actors, boundaries provide opportunities; for the other, boundaries are impediments. In addition, criminal networks have become less hierarchical and more networked in their structures and operations. On top of all this, numerous federal agencies have come to play roles in addressing border security threats. Under such conditions, to keep pace with criminals, law enforcement has had to adopt more networked practices, combining resources and circumventing established hierarchical structures that may constrain individual policing entities in terms of jurisdiction, authority, and turf. ", "Federal law enforcement has used task forces and intelligence sharing entities such as fusion centers as tools to surmount these modern realities. Task forces and fusion centers may be developed for a number of reasons, including overcoming jurisdictional limitations and leveraging expertise and resources\u2014both money and manpower. Task forces, which mostly involve investigative operations, and intelligence-focused fusion centers have been viewed as serving complementary roles, particularly as 21 st century policing has evolved to become more intelligence-driven. While law enforcement coordination may be essential to today's policing, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General has noted that \"coordinating among law enforcement agencies\" has been among DOJ's top management challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Roots of Federally Led Counterdrug and Counterterrorism Task Forces", "paragraphs": ["The task force concept in federal law enforcement is not new. Current counterdrug and counterterrorism task forces led by federal agencies can trace their origins at least back to the 1970s and New York City. ", "The antecedents of counterdrug task forces involving state and local police led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) can be found in New York City in 1970. That year, the DEA's predecessor, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, developed a pilot program that fostered cooperation among federal, state, and local investigators. This first-ever federally led counterdrug task force \"was created in response to drug traffic that spilled beyond the municipal, county, and state boundaries in metropolitan New York.\" The task force covered a territory that included \"all levels of drug trafficking, from importing to street dealing, and numerous importation points.\" Its mission was to \"control illicit sale and distribution of narcotics and dangerous drugs through investigative and prosecutive action directed against the middle and upper echelon of the narcotic traffic within the city of New York.\" ", "The New York task force led to DEA's creation of a State and Local Task Force Program. One of the main \"inducements\" encouraging the participation of state and local police in DEA task forces was monetary. DEA paid investigative overtime for the state and local officers. DEA also provided funding for \"investigative expenses such as payments to informants, 'buy money' to purchase contraband, undercover vehicles, and surveillance equipment.\"", "The current version of DEA's State and Local Task Force Program includes task forces established by formalized agreements across the United States. In 2013, the program managed 259 state and local task forces \"staffed by over 2,190 DEA special agents and over 2,556 state and local officers. Participating state and local task force officers are deputized to perform the same functions as DEA special agents.\"", "Today, Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) led by the FBI play the chief role in coordinating federal counterterrorism investigations across the United States, bringing together federal, state, and local participants in the process. JTTFs have their roots in New York City in the late 1970s, which, during that decade, had experienced a wave of terrorist attacks from numerous organizations. As described by one author, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the FBI's New York City field office \"have always had a tense relationship\u2014each considers the other agency ineffectual\u2014but it was never worse than in the late 1970s.\" In the mid and late 1970s, the FBI and NYPD typically handled high-profile investigations separately. They competed to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and run forensic tests on recovered materials\u2014essentially vying for control over crime scenes. When it came to terrorism investigations, top officials in the FBI's New York office and the NYPD agreed at the time that the only people benefitting from such infighting were terrorists: ", "Both agencies readily acknowledged that there was a lack of cooperation between the NYPD Arson and Explosion Unit, responsible for bombing investigations, and the Terrorist Squad of the New York FBI Office. There were instances where evidence acquired by one agency was not promptly and appropriately shared with the other. There was open animosity between the Agents and police officers. Only members of the terrorist groups operating in New York profited from this dissension.", "The JTTF concept sprang from a project to combine NYPD and FBI resources targeting bank robbers. In 1979, the NYPD and FBI created a task force to handle bank robbery investigations (as these cases also spiked in the 1970s). This was the first task force the FBI had ever formed with local law enforcement. The construct was adapted to the counterterrorism arena in 1980 when the New York JTTF was created, initially bringing together 12 FBI agents and 12 NYPD officers. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) detailed many of the particulars of the task force. The MOU called for the task force to follow federal rules of criminal procedure and directed that its cases would be prosecuted in federal court. Additionally, it established that task force funding would come from the FBI. The Bureau would also provide a physical space for the JTTF, overtime costs for NYPD officers, and access to classified information (including FBI case files) to all detailed personnel cleared for such access. The NYPD and FBI would share all their information related to the cases the task force worked, and NYPD officers detailed to the task force would be federally deputized, allowing them to pursue leads outside of NYPD jurisdictions alongside their FBI counterparts. All of these policies have continued in more current iterations of the federal JTTF model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overcoming Jurisdictional Limitations", "paragraphs": ["As the preceding discussion suggests, rather than existing as a single police force, the U.S. police system consists of layers of law enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels.

Not only could there be overlapping jurisdiction between the layers of law enforcement\u2014as in cases of concurrent state and federal jurisdiction\u2014but there may be blurry lines within the layers\u2014between agencies with overlying missions and authorities. In addition, agencies' perceptions of operational turf may intersect or conflict.", "Some task forces have been structured as cross-cutting multijurisdictional efforts to bring together policing entities with similar missions and targets, but whose operational jurisdictions differ, at least in part. The Bureau of Justice Assistance, for instance, conceptualizes a multijurisdictional task force (MJTF) as ", "a cooperative law enforcement effort involving two or more criminal justice agencies, with jurisdiction over two or more areas, sharing the common goal of addressing drug control or violent crime problems. MJTFs allow law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions to work together as a single enforcement entity with the ability to improve communication, share intelligence, and coordinate activities. This allows for more efficient use of resources and targeting of offenders whose activities cross jurisdictional boundaries.", "While not all task forces are multijurisdictional (some may consist of law enforcement agencies within the same jurisdictional confines (e.g., city, county, state, etc.)), those collaborative efforts that cross boundaries of control or authority may enhance law enforcement's abilities to combat criminals that exploit these boundaries to their advantage. Further, these multijurisdictional task forces can be used to counter a wide array of threats posed by criminal networks, or they can be tailored to concentrate efforts on a particular criminal activity. ", "For instance, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) initiative, led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is a series of multi-agency investigative task forces that aim to identify, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations posing significant threats to border security along the northern border with Canada and Southwest border with Mexico as well as within Mexico. To focus efforts on criminal networks exploiting the U.S.-Mexican border via underground tunnels, ICE established the first tunnel task force in San Diego in 2003. The task force was created as a partnership between ICE, DEA, and the U.S. Border Patrol, along with state law enforcement and Mexican counterparts. The tunnel task force was incorporated into ICE's BEST initiative in 2006 in order to further enhance multilateral law enforcement intelligence and information sharing. Since 1990, over 150 tunneling attempts have been discovered along the U.S.-Mexican border.", "In October 2013, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force uncovered a sophisticated cross-border tunnel connecting a building in Otay Mesa, CA, with a warehouse in Tijuana, Mexico. The tunnel was \"nearly six football fields\" in length and was \"equipped with lighting, ventilation, and an electric rail system.\" Authorities seized 17,292 pounds of marijuana and 325 pounds of cocaine, collectively worth over $10 million on the streets. This was the largest tunnel uncovered in the San Diego area in two years.", "Overlapping jurisdiction and investigative authority, while potentially opening doors to interagency collaboration, can at times contribute to interagency turf battles. For instance, while the FBI is often seen as one of the primary agencies involved in investigating gangs, other agencies including the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), and ICE, also investigate cases involving illegal gang activities such as drug, weapons, and human trafficking. As such, a host of tools have been employed to mitigate investigative overlaps and to enhance information and data sharing between relevant agencies. These include MOUs on very specific matters, task forces, and fusion centers:", "The DEA and DOJ's Criminal Division signed an MOU to enhance the targeting of regional, national, and transnational gangs. The FBI established and administers Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces. These collaborations include federal, state, and local law enforcement entities that investigate crimes ranging from racketeering to drug conspiracy and firearms violations.

This creates at least a few problems. Without such information it is difficult to measure exactly how much cooperation is occurring. How much cooperation is enough? How can we ascertain whether task force programs in various agencies overlap each other's work, especially if they target the same class or category criminals (such as drug traffickers or violent gangs)? From a different point of view, how can we determine if particular areas need more task forces? ", "These issues appear to be unanswerable based solely on publicly available knowledge. Nevertheless, Executive Branch responses to such issues could greatly inform congressional policy making. Congressional policy makers may be interested in asking the Administration for a complete accounting of task forces countering drug trafficking and terrorism. ", "CRS has aimed to describe the extent of task force activity along the Southwest border. In doing so, CRS amassed a dataset of task forces and intelligence sharing bodies within the 150-mile belt of the Southwest border with Mexico. To build this dataset, CRS reviewed publicly available press releases, news reports, and other documents from 2010-2013. It is important to note that while every effort was made to be thorough in reviewing the sources used, the approximately 200 task forces identified by CRS as active at some point between 2010 and 2013 should not be considered as constituting an exhaustive list. To be included in the list, a task force had to exhibit the possibility of either directly or indirectly combatting drug trafficking or terrorism. Thus, task forces devoted to fighting gangs, violent crime, public corruption, capturing fugitives, and money laundering may be included. CRS has depicted these task forces and information sharing centers on the map in Figure 1 . ", " Figure 1 suggests what may already be intuitive\u2014task forces cluster around major urban areas. However, using open source information, it is impossible to ascertain the actual territories each task force is responsible for covering. So, while a task force may be based in a particular city, its responsibilities may stretch further afield. A geographical issue stems from this. Do task forces in the same locale headed by potentially rival federal agencies and covering similar threats divvy up their targets? Or do they go after the same targets, and the first to develop an inroad into a threat (such as an informant who has worked his or her way into a particular criminal organization) gets dibs on investigating it? If this is the case, how chaotic is this process of competitive investigation? Does it have inherent value? In other instances, task force primacy is well-defined. For example, FBI-led JTTFs are the core nodes managing most federal counterterrorism investigations at the local level, and the FBI is the lead federal agency covering counterterrorism. Presumably, each JTTF has its own geographic territory. It may be telling that the predominant law enforcement threat over the last dozen years\u2014terrorism\u2014has such clearly defined task force responsibilities.

Each of the HIDTA regions\u2014of which there are currently 28\u2014is governed by its own Executive Board. A main feature of the HIDTA program is the discretion granted to the Executive Boards to design and implement initiatives that confront the drug trafficking threat in each HIDTA region. This flexibility has ensured that each Executive Board can tailor its strategy to local conditions and respond quickly to changes in those conditions. The Executive Boards operate independently from one another and have the discretion to develop strategies and initiatives to confront the specific drug trafficking threats in each area. For instance, the Executive Board of the Southwest border HIDTA, which covers five regions across California, Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas, and South Texas, helps facilitate relevant counterdrug initiatives in the region. ", "As noted, criminal organizations have become increasingly networked, and some have also broadened their pool of criminal activities. For instance, some Mexican drug trafficking organizations that once focused on the production, distribution, and sale of illegal drugs have branched into other illegal money-generating activities including kidnapping and public corruption. As such, these diversified criminal entities may be investigated by an equally broad variety of law enforcement agencies, each with specific missions and authorities. Certain efforts, such as the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, aim to leverage the full range of relevant agencies to investigate these criminals. The OCDETF program targets\u2014with the intent to disrupt and dismantle\u2014major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. Federal agencies that participate in the OCDETF program include the DEA, FBI, ATF, U.S. Marshals, Internal Revenue Service, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Attorneys Offices, and DOJ's Criminal Division.

This suggests that U.S. Attorneys, and the task forces with which they may coordinate, may prioritize the investigation and prosecution of criminal enterprises involved in drug trafficking over individual users of marijuana, despite the fact that marijuana use remains a federal crime.

In the past three decades, the policing world has broadly incorporated proactive investigative strategies\u2014focused on preventing crime\u2014in addition to solving crimes that have already occurred. This has included a recognition of the utility of an intelligence-led approach to law enforcement. In this vein, fusion centers have been described as key components of a new proactive domestic policing structure that favors the use of intelligence to understand the threats that law enforcement has to combat. In 2012, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said that fusion centers \"bring agencies together to assess local implications of threat information in order to better understand the general threat picture.\" From a law enforcement perspective, it has been argued that state and regional intelligence fusion centers, particularly when networked nationally, represent a proactive tool to be used to fight a global terrorist adversary which has both centralized and decentralized elements. The National Network of Fusion Centers has been envisioned as a vital component in the process of sharing terrorism, homeland security, and law enforcement information with state, local, regional, and tribal law enforcement and security officials.", "Significance of State and Local Law Enforcement to Homeland Security . The rise of fusion centers since 9/11 is also representative of a broad recognition that state and local law enforcement and public safety agencies play significant roles in homeland security\u2014especially stopping terrorist plots. The Obama Administration's June 2011 National Strategy for Counterterrorism notes the importance of \"the capabilities and resources of state, local, and tribal entities ... as a powerful force multiplier for the Federal government's [counterterrorism] efforts.\" Investigative leads about terrorists active in the homeland may originate from foreign intelligence sources. But, for the most part, information about homegrown plots is available only through domestic policing activities. This has been of particular importance since 2009, when the homegrown violent jihadist threat became a prominent issue.", "Numerous national strategies have assessed terrorism as a significant threat to U.S. national security, both at home and abroad. The homeland featured prominently in the June 2011 National Strategy. It focuses on Al Qaeda, its affiliates (groups aligned with it), and its adherents (individuals linked to or inspired by the terrorist group). John Brennan, at the time President Obama's top counterterrorism advisor, publicly described the strategy as the first one, \"that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts.\" ", "In a February 2012 poll of individuals working in 72 fusion centers conducted by the Homeland Security Policy Institute, more than 65% stated that homegrown \"jihadi individuals or organizations\" posed the greatest terror threat. The means for combating the domestic terrorism threat are broad and encompass all elements of national power, to include non-traditional sectors. ", "Since their inception, many counterterrorism-focused fusion centers have expanded their missions to include all-crimes and/or all-hazards. Importantly, this shift toward an all-crimes and/or all-hazards focus has not abandoned the counterterrorism mission. By embracing a broader mission, fusion centers and their directors may be conforming to what they see as a national trend. The 2008 baseline capabilities issued for fusion centers by DOJ's Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative noted that while developing mission statements, fusion centers \"should consider using an all-crimes approach and/or an all-hazards approach ... recognizing that precursor crimes or incidents may have national security implications.\" By adopting an all-crimes and/or all-hazards approach, fusion centers may also hope to increase the relevance of their work among local police and non-law enforcement partners who may not have a singular focus on terrorism. In turn, this may also enable centers to claim more state and local resources. ", "Institutionalization of Information Sharing. Fusion centers emerged largely to improve interaction between the federal government's intelligence community and state and local law enforcement after 9/11. It can be argued that they have helped institutionalize the exchange of intelligence related to homeland security. For example, one study has noted that \"[f]usion centers have been important for centralizing information-sharing and for formalizing ... information-sharing networks among [law enforcement] within a region.

Along the Southwest border, over 150 tunnels have been discovered since the 1990s; notably, there has been an 80% uptick in tunnels detected since 2008. In direct response to the use of underground tunnels by transnational smugglers, ICE established the first tunnel task force in San Diego in 2003. An additional tunnel task force was subsequently established in Nogales, AZ. These two areas of the Southwest border have seen the highest rates of subterranean tunnel construction. Tunnels detected in California and Arizona differ in complexity\u2014the clay-like soil of San Diego and surrounding areas allows for the construction of more sophisticated tunnels and the existing underground infrastructure of Nogales facilitates the use of interconnecting tunnels; despite these differences, law enforcement has recognized the need for specified task forces in these areas and created relevant partnerships.", "In addition to establishing collaborative efforts to confront new threats, partnerships may arise or morph in response to an existing but changing threat. For instance, as noted, the HIDTA program was established in 1988 to provide assistance to law enforcement agencies operating in regions of the United States deemed as critical drug trafficking regions. At the time the program first received appropriations in 1990, five areas of the country were deemed \"the most critical high intensity drug trafficking area 'gateways' for drugs entering the nation.\" Since then, law enforcement and policy makers have acknowledged the evolving drug trafficking threat, and as of November 2013, there were 28 designated HIDTAs in the United States and its territories. As the number of HIDTAs (and the number of counties throughout the country) has increased over the years, the HIDTA program has continued to rely on an established regimen to assess the nature and evolution of specific threats in a given area, evaluate whether areas should be deemed parts of HIDTAs, and allocate resources to specific initiatives in a HIDTA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coordination Startup", "paragraphs": ["Task forces, fusion centers, and other collaborative efforts can be initiated legislatively, administratively, or through a combination of the two.

This was based on an acknowledgment that enhanced intelligence regarding drug production and trafficking could be valuable support for law enforcement operations. While it had not yet been formally established, the NDIC began receiving funding in FY1991 through earmarks in the Department of Defense appropriations acts. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1993 ( P.L. 102-396 ) officially created the NDIC, which was located in Johnstown, PA.

The initiative dedicates resources to combating violent street gangs and drug-related violence within the jurisdictions of the Bureau's field divisions. The task forces bring together federal, state, and local investigators. When specifically targeting gangs, the FBI notes that the task forces attempt to dismantle entire criminal enterprises \"from the street level thugs and dealers up through the crew leaders and ultimately the gang's command structure.\" In 2011, the FBI operated more than 220 Safe Street task forces\u2014most focused on gangs. As part of the program, the Bureau also has Safe Trails Task Forces that handle crime on Indian reservations.

For example, federal agencies regularly document the volumes of drugs seized at the Southwest border but are harder pressed to develop an outcome measure that relates these seizures to some larger sense of border security. This is not to say that drug seizures are unrelated to border security. Likewise it is disingenuous to suggest that law enforcement output is not tied to outcome.

Presumably, rising figures in all of these outputs indicates success.", "The first \"strategic objective\" of the Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, for instance, is to \"[e]nhance criminal intelligence and information sharing capabilities and processes associated with the Southwest border.\" Again, this may appear to be a measurement of outcome, especially if the notion of enhancement built into it includes more than a simple computation of output.

At one level, it is readily apparent how task forces relate to specific strategies. For example, a task force focusing on counternarcotics may appear inherently designed to support the Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy or the National Drug Control Strategy. At another level, what is less clear is exactly how effectively a task force supports a given strategy. Policy makers may consider, for instance, whether or not federal agencies involved in Southwest border task forces and intelligence sharing centers should establish metrics for success that can evaluate not only output but outcome as well. ", "While some metrics can be clearly delineated as output or outcome, others may be more difficult to categorize . Why, might one ask, is it necessary to determine whether a given metric is truly a measure of output or an outcome, particularly at the task force level?

ONDCP has detailed initiatives in five broad policy areas, including disrupting domestic drug trafficking and production, aimed at achieving these two goals. Moreover, ONDCP has developed a Performance Reporting System (PRS), \"a performance and assessment mechanism for gauging the effectiveness of this Strategy .\" The PRS is \"designed to appraise the performance of the large and complex interagency Federal effort set forth in the Strategy , as required by ONDCP's 2006 Reauthorization Act [P.L. 109-469].\" ", "Of note, while the National Drug Control Strategy and the PRS apply to the entire United States, certain aspects are particularly relevant to the Southwest border\u2014namely those aspects that involve countering drug trafficking.

These three measures may factor into a reduction in domestic drug trafficking and production; however, it is not clearly articulated how changes in a specific measure, such as the number of CPOT-linked organizations disrupted or dismantled, are indicative of changes in the drug trafficking and production threats. There appears to be an assumption that improved/enhanced output at the law enforcement level (i.e., an increase in CPOT-linked disruptions) is indicative of a reduction in the threat. This may or may not be true. Of note, ONDCP has indicated that there may be \"errors in the logic model linking program actions to desired results\" and that these may contribute to what can be seen as performance shortcomings. As ONDCP continues to improve measures used in the PRS, policy makers may question how these measures track to changes in the drug threat.", "Policy makers may also consider that, if an agency or task force gauges success by increases in its output, it may continue to request additional resources to enhance its input (and subsequent output).

Internal challenges also involve issues in uniting data collection procedures that may be inconsistent between participating agencies and measuring program successes which may be difficult to define and quantify.

The OIG indicated that despite sometimes overlapping missions of these task forces, DOJ did \"not require the components to coordinate operations or investigations, cooperate in joint investigations, or deconflict law enforcement events conducted by their violent crime task forces.\" The one area in which DOJ had established national-level procedures to coordinate counter-violent crime activities was in the establishment of new anti-gang task forces. In addition, there were uneven levels of coordination in different parts of the country as well as varying levels of coordination between DOJ component agencies. Because the DOJ OIG has not conducted a follow-up assessment and DOJ has not published additional information on violent crime task force coordination, it is unclear whether overall coordination has since improved.", "In 2011, DHS implemented an annual assessment of fusion centers, the cornerstone of its Fusion Center Performance Program.
