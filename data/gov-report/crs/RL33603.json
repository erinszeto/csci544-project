The 109th Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (P.L. 109-479), incorporating provisions recommended by both commissions, and authorized the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act (P.L. 109-449). Several bills encompassing a broad array of cross-cutting concerns such as ocean exploration; ocean and coastal observing systems; federal organization and administrative structure; and ocean and coastal mapping were considered, but not acted on during the 110th Congress.", "Identification of the need for a comprehensive national ocean policy can be traced back to 1966, when a presidential Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources was established (called the Stratton Commission). In 1969, the commission provided recommendations that led to reorganizing federal ocean programs and establishing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). By the late 1980s, a number of influential voices had concluded that U.S. ocean management remained fragmented and was characterized by a confusing array of laws, regulations, and practices. After repeated attempts, the 106th Congress enacted legislation to establish a U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy (P.L. 106-256). Earlier in 2000, the Pew Oceans Commission, an independent group, was established by the Pew Charitable Trusts to conduct a national dialogue on restoring and protecting living marine resources in U.S. waters.", "In June 2003, the Pew Commission released its final report, America's Living Oceans: Charting a Course for Sea Change, outlining a national agenda for protecting and restoring the oceans. In September 2004, the U.S. Commission published, An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century, its final report with 212 recommendations on a coordinated and comprehensive national ocean policy. On December 17, 2004, the Bush Administration submitted to Congress the U.S. Ocean Action Plan, its formal response to the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission established the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative in early 2005 to collaborate on a number of key recommendations of both reports. The Joint Ocean Commission has remained active in advancing these recommendations to Congress and the Administration.", "In June 2009, the Obama Administration established an Ocean Policy Task Force to develop a national ocean policy. On September 10, 2009, the task force released the Interim Report of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, which includes national ocean policy priorities, a governance structure for interagency coordination, and an implementation strategy. On December 9, 2009, the task force released the Interim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning, which recommends a regional approach to marine spatial planning.", "The 111th Congress is continuing to consider ocean policy and management recommendations of the two commission reports. Comprehensive changes in ocean governance and administrative structure are proposed in the Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 21) and the National Oceans Protection Act of 2009 (S. 858). However, most congressional activity has focused on specific topics. Title XII of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) included subtitles that address ocean exploration, ocean and coastal mapping, ocean and coastal integrated observation, ocean acidification research and monitoring, and coastal and estuarine land conservation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission have made numerous recommendations for changing U.S. ocean policy and management. To address the findings and recommendations of the ocean commissions and the President's response, Congress may consider comprehensive bills encompassing a broad array of cross-cutting concerns, including federal organization and administrative structure, regional approaches to ecosystem management, and funding strategies. On the other hand, Congress may continue to act on specific issues, as it has for fisheries, ocean exploration, ocean mapping, marine debris, ocean acidification, and others. ", "Congress has shown interest in ocean affairs in recent decades, examining components of the federal ocean programs, enacting legislation creating new ocean programs, and taking steps to define a national ocean policy. The Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-454) established a National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Development in the White House and initiated work by a presidential bipartisan Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources. Dr. Julius Stratton, then recently retired president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, at the time, Chairman of the Board of the Ford Foundation, was appointed commission chairman by President Lyndon Johnson. The commission, composed of 15 members, was often referred to as the Stratton Commission. In 1969, the commission completed its final report, Our Nation and the Sea: A Plan for National Action , and its more than 120 formal recommendations provided what many considered to be the most comprehensive statement of federal policy for exploration and development of ocean resources. The study was instrumental in defining the structure, if not all the substance, of what a national ocean policy could or should look like. Furthermore, new ocean-oriented programs were initiated and existing ones were strengthened in the years following the commission's report, through a number of laws enacted by Congress.", "Recommendations of the Stratton Commission led directly, within the following decade, to forming the National Sea Grant College Program, to creating the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere (NACOA), and to reorganizing federal ocean programs under the newly established National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Subsequent legislation on estuarine reserves, national marine sanctuaries, marine mammal protection, coastal zone management, fishery conservation and management, ocean pollution, and seabed mining also reflected commission recommendations. Efforts sprang up within the federal government and among various interagency and federal advisory committees to flesh out how best to implement a truly comprehensive and forward-looking national ocean policy, most notably articulated in the 1978 Department of Commerce report U.S. Ocean Policy in the 1970s: Status and Issues .", "Since 1980, with concerns about limiting federal expenditures and streamlining government, there have been fewer ocean initiatives, and a number of ocean programs, particularly those of NOAA, have been consolidated and reduced. However, the programs begun in the 1970s generally have been reauthorized and have matured. By the late 1980s, there appeared to be a broad consensus among those conversant in ocean affairs that a need existed to redefine or, at the very least, better define national ocean policy. Two stimuli for this renewed interest were the 1983 proclamation by President Reagan establishing a 200-nautical-mile U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the 1988 extension of the U.S. territorial sea from 3 to 12 nautical miles, both of which came in the aftermath of the President's decision that the United States would not sign the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.", "Legislation creating an oceans commission and/or a national ocean council to review U.S. ocean policy was introduced and hearings were held in the 98 th , 99 th , 100 th , and 105 th Congresses. Legislation did pass the House in October 1983, September 1987, and again in October 1988, but was not acted on by the Senate in any of those instances. In the 105 th Congress, legislation creating both a national ocean council and a commission on ocean policy passed the Senate in November 1997, and in 1998 the House passed a bill creating a commission on ocean policy. However, Congress adjourned in 1998 before differences between these two measures could be reconciled. It was not until the 106 th Congress in 2000 that legislation was enacted to establish a 16-member U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy ( P.L. 106-256 ). The commission's charge was to make recommendations for a coordinated and comprehensive national ocean policy for a broad range of ocean issues. The enactment rode a crest of interest generated largely by a National Ocean Conference convened by the White House in June 1998, in Monterey, CA, and attended by President Clinton and Vice President Gore, against a background of media and public attention surrounding the declaration by the United Nations of 1998 as the International Year of the Ocean. Momentum was added by the September 1999 release of a post-Monterey conference report, ordered by the President and prepared by members of his Cabinet, entitled Turning to the Sea: America ' s Ocean Future , in which recommendations were offered for a coordinated, disciplined, long-term federal ocean policy.", "Also in 2000, partially in response to that rekindled interest and partially in response to congressional legislation having failed final passage in 1998, the Pew Charitable Trusts established the Pew Oceans Commission, an independent group of 18 American experts in their respective fields. The Pew Commission's charge was to conduct a national dialogue on the policies needed to restore and protect living marine resources in U.S. waters. Pew proceeded with their effort after failing to persuade key Members of Congress to introduce legislation to establish a public/private, nongovernmental oceans commission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy", "paragraphs": ["The Oceans Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-256 ) mandated a U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.

The new policy was to address a broad range of issues, from the stewardship of marine resources and pollution prevention to enhancement and support of marine science, commerce, and transportation.", "The 16 members of the commission were appointed by President Bush on July 3, 2001. Those appointments were based on a process that included nominations by Congress and appointment by the President.", "The commission convened its inaugural meeting on September 17-18, 2001, in Washington, DC, and commissioners selected Admiral James D. Watkins, U.S. Navy (retired) as chair. Through several sessions, the commission established four working groups to address issues in the areas of (1) governance; (2) research, education, and marine operations; (3) stewardship; and (4) investment and implementation. The working groups were charged with reviewing and analyzing issues within their specific areas of focus and reporting their findings to the full commission.", "The Oceans Act of 2000 specifically directed the commission to establish a Science Advisory Panel to assist in preparing the report and to ensure that the scientific information considered by the commission and each of its working groups was the best available. The composition of the Science Advisory Panel was determined by the commissioners; members were recruited in consultation with the Ocean Studies Board of the National Research Council at the National Academy of Sciences and reflected the breadth of issues before the commission. The commission divided the members of the Science Advisory Panel into four working groups, consistent with the full commission's structure.", "The commission began its work by launching a series of public meetings to gather information about the most pressing issues that the Nation faced regarding the use and stewardship of the oceans. The working groups played an important role in determining the effectiveness of the regional public meetings and in identifying key issues to be addressed by the commission. In each region visited, the commission heard presentations on a wide-ranging set of topics judged to be necessary to ultimately address the requirements in the Oceans Act of 2000. Based on the information gathered at the public meetings, the working groups identified and reviewed key issues, outlined options for addressing those issues, and determined the need for white papers providing more detailed information on specific topics. The deliberations of each working group were shared with the other groups throughout the process to better coordinate development of the final commission report and recommendations.", "After hearing 440 presenters at 15 public meetings in 10 cities during 11 months and conducting 17 additional site visits around the country, the commission completed its information-gathering phase in October 2002.

Related issues considered whether to (1) provide additional funds for ocean-related research; (2) replace a fragmented administrative structure with a more coherent federal organization; or (3) adopt new approaches for managing marine resources, such as setting aside large reserves from some or all uses. Only one bill was enacted, the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act ( P.L. 109-449 ). This legislation established a program within NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard to help identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and its damage to the marine environment and navigation safety, in coordination with non-federal entities.", "A variety of legislation has been introduced during the 111 th Congress and bills related to specific topics have been enacted. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-11 ) included several ocean-related bills that were considered during previous Congresses. Title XII includes sections that address ocean exploration, ocean and coastal mapping, ocean and coastal integrated observation, ocean acidification research and monitoring, and coastal and estuarine land conservation.", "Early in the 111 th Congress, H.R. 21 , the Oceans, Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21 st Century Act, and a similar bill, S. 858 , the National Oceans Protection Act of 2009, were introduced. H.R. 21 , first introduced in the 108 th Congress, would implement many recommendations of the Pew and U.S. Commission reports, by establishing a comprehensive national ocean policy for the management of U.S. coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes. The legislation would:", "establish a national ocean policy with emphasis on conservation of marine ecosystems; authorize NOAA; strengthen and formalize regional coordination by promoting a regional governance structure; and create an Ocean and Great Lakes Trust Fund.", "On June 18, 2009, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee in Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held a hearing on H.R. 21 . Supporters of these bills have pointed to the need to improve ocean conservation because of damage to marine ecosystems caused by pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and overfishing. They believe that a defined ocean policy, better coordination among agencies, and more investment are needed to reflect the importance of oceans to our economy and well-being. However, others are concerned that H.R. 21 would increase the ocean-related bureaucracy by establishing numerous layers of additional laws, regulations, advisors, committees, and partnerships. At a hearing during the 110 th Congress, a coalition of Alaska fishing industry groups expressed concerns that H.R. 21 would duplicate efforts, lead to more bureaucracy, conflict with other legal mandates, and result in confusion and litigation. They would rather see greater focus on funding and implementation of current laws, such as the MSFCMA. ", "It remains an open question whether the 111 th Congress will act on this comprehensive approach to ocean policy or concentrate on specific subjects or issues. On November 4, 2009, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard held a hearing concerning the future of ocean governance that focused on IOPTF activities. In addition to comprehensive ocean approaches, over 70 bills related to ocean and Great Lakes management, climate change, fisheries, coastal conservation, marine animals, marine sanctuaries, research, education, and transportation have been introduced. For example, on September 24, 2009, the Ocean, Coastal, and Watershed Education Act ( H.R. 3644 ) was introduced, and on January 19, 2010, it was passed by the House. This bill would direct NOAA to further develop regional education and watershed programs and to establish a competitive national grant program to advance environmental literacy. Administration action, or inaction, is likely to continue to receive congressional oversight during the 111 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
