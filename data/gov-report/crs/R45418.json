Pell Grants, and their predecessor, Basic Education Opportunity Grants, have been awarded since 1973. The program provided approximately $29 billion in aid to approximately 7.2 million undergraduate students in FY2017. Pell Grants are need-based aid that is intended to be the foundation for all need-based federal student aid awarded to undergraduates.", "To be eligible for a Pell Grant, an undergraduate student must meet several requirements. One key requirement is that the student and his or her family demonstrate financial need. Financial need is determined through the calculation of an expected family contribution (EFC), which is based on applicable family financial information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Although there is no absolute income threshold that determines who is eligible or ineligible for Pell Grants, an estimated 95% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000 in academic year 2015-2016. Other requirements include, but are not limited to, the student not having earned a bachelor's degree and being enrolled in an eligible program at an HEA Title IV-participating institution of higher education for the purpose of earning a certificate or degree.", "The maximum annual award a student may receive during an academic year is calculated in accordance with the Pell Grant award rules. The student's scheduled award is the least of (1) the total maximum Pell Grant minus the student's EFC, or (2) Cost of Attendance (COA) minus EFC. For a student who enrolls on a less-than-full-time basis, the student's maximum annual award is the scheduled award ratably reduced. For FY2019 (academic year 2019-2020), the total maximum Pell Grant is $6,195. The COA is a measure of a student's educational expenses for the academic year. Qualified students who exhaust their scheduled award and remain enrolled beyond the academic year (e.g., enroll in a summer semester) during an award year receive a year-round or summer Pell Grant. With year-round Pell Grants, qualified students may receive up to 1\u00bd scheduled grants in each award year. Finally, a student may receive the value of no more than 12 full-time semesters (or the equivalent) of Pell Grant awards over a lifetime.", "The program is funded primarily through annual discretionary appropriations, although in recent years mandatory appropriations have played an increasing role in the program. The total maximum Pell Grant is the sum of two components: the discretionary maximum award and the mandatory add-on award. The discretionary maximum award amount is funded by discretionary appropriations enacted in annual appropriations acts, and augmented by permanent and definite mandatory appropriations provided for in the HEA. For FY2019, the discretionary appropriation is $22.475 billion and the augmenting mandatory funds total $1.370 billion. The mandatory add-on award amount is funded entirely by a permanent and indefinite mandatory appropriation of such sums as necessary, as authorized in the HEA. The mandatory add-on is estimated to require $6.077 billion in FY2019. Funding provided for the Pell Grant program is exempt from sequestration.", "The Pell Grant program is often referred to as a quasi-entitlement because for the most part eligible students receive the Pell Grant award level calculated for them without regard to available appropriations. In a given year, the discretionary appropriation level may be smaller or larger than the actual cost to fund the discretionary maximum award, despite the augmenting mandatory appropriation. When the discretionary appropriation is too small, the program carries a shortfall into the subsequent fiscal year. When the discretionary appropriation is too large, the program carries a surplus into the following fiscal year. Since FY2012, the program has maintained a surplus. The surplus has variably been used to increase Pell Grant awards, expand eligibility, and either fund other programs or reduce the national deficit."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by Title IV-A-1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, is the single largest source of federal grant aid supporting undergraduate students.

Students who demonstrate a level of need that falls between these two extremes are awarded Pell Grant aid on a sliding scale. Additionally, Pell Grant awards are prorated for students who attend on a less-than-full-time, full-year basis. An important feature of the Pell Grant award rules is that the grant is determined without consideration of any other financial assistance a student may be eligible to receive or may be receiving.

An appropriated entitlement is a program that receives mandatory funding in the annual appropriations acts, but the level of spending is not controlled through the annual appropriations process. Instead, the level of mandatory spending for appropriated entitlements, like other entitlements, is based on the benefit and eligibility criteria established in law, and the amount provided in appropriations acts is based on meeting this projected level. The Pell Grant program is not an entitlement because the program is primarily funded through discretionary appropriations. In addition in the past, statutory benefit and eligibility criteria were adjusted so that spending would not exceed appropriations. Finally, annual Pell Grant discretionary appropriations are determined on the basis of estimates of program costs and other policy considerations. ", "To the extent that the annual appropriation may be higher or lower than actual program costs, the program may operate at a surplus or shortfall. The surplus or shortfall may accumulate over more than one year. The HEA requires that the Secretary of Education, when she has determined that the appropriated funds are insufficient to satisfy all Pell Grant entitlements, notify each chamber of Congress of the funding shortfall, identifying how much more funding is needed to meet those entitlements. The Secretary can respond to a shortfall in Pell Grant funding by allocating funds from the most recently enacted appropriation to pay for obligations incurred in previous award years. For example, although the FY2019 appropriation is expected to fund award year 2019-2020 program costs, the appropriation may fund award year 2018-2019 costs since obligations for these costs occur in FY2019. This permits ED to use funds from multiple fiscal years' appropriations to meet one award year's cost. ", "The misalignment between estimated program costs (appropriations) and actual expenditures is often related to economic and statutory changes. When the general economy weakens, postsecondary enrollment often increases and thus Pell Grant participation and cost increases. ", " Table 6 provides a 10-year history of funding of estimated shortfall or surplus levels, funding for the discretionary award amounts, and estimated expenditures (Appendix D provides data from FY1973 to FY2018). Although discretionary award amounts are funded by discretionary and mandatory appropriations, the surplus or shortfall is accounted for using only discretionary funding. The annual funding shortfall or surplus differs from the cumulative shortfall or surplus, which may accumulate over multiple award years. It is also important to note that Congress may have provided a reduced appropriation level in a given year when a funding surplus was available for use from the previous year. Conversely, Congress may have provided additional appropriations in a given year to pay for an estimated funding shortfall from the previous year. ", " Table 6 shows a high cumulative shortfall of $9.569 billion at the end of FY2010 and high cumulative surplus of $11.082 billion at the end of FY2013. The FY2010 cumulative shortfall was transformed into a surplus by a complicated mix of increased funding levels that exceeded $30 billion annually and declining expenditures. The FY2013 cumulative surplus of $11.082 billion has decreased to an estimated $7.410 billion surplus at the end of FY2018. Since FY2014, the annual funding has hovered near $23 billion despite generally higher expenditures.

Persistent or high funding shortfalls, as in FY2010, may be viewed as fiscally irresponsible. In essence when there is a shortfall, the program is in debt, and eventually the debt must be paid. The higher the debt level, the more difficult it is to resolve. ", "Generally speaking, with input from the Administration and other stakeholders, Congress adopts legislation that controls spending across the federal government and for specific programs. Through the budget resolution process, a 302(b) allocation is established for each of the 12 appropriations bills. These allocations, referred to as 302(b) subdivisions, establish the maximum discretionary amount that can be spent through each bill. Therefore generally but with exceptions, individual program-level discretionary appropriations within the annual Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill must be balanced within its established 302(b) allocation. In other words, increased discretionary appropriations for one program may coincide with decreased discretionary appropriations for one or more other programs. Resolving a Pell Grant program shortfall may lead to a difficult decision about which program(s) to reduce discretionary funding. ", "Over the years, federal policymakers and Congress have taken a variety of measures to address the vexing issues associated with funding shortfalls in the Pell Grant program.

Reductions were made in awards in eight years using this authority (the last in AY1990-AY1991).

The rule provides that if the appropriation of new discretionary budget authority enacted for the program is insufficient to cover the full estimated costs in the upcoming year\u2014including any funding surplus or shortfall from prior years\u2014the budget authority counted against the bill for the program will be equal to the adjusted full cost (i.e., total need). The full estimated costs must be based on the maximum discretionary award amount and any changes to the eligibility criteria. For most discretionary programs, CBO equates the budget authority to the level provided in each appropriation bill. ", "As a result of the scoring rule, Congress cannot fund new programs or increase the funding of existing programs subject to discretionary appropriations while providing less funding than required for the Pell Grant program. The scoring rule, however, cannot fully account for the challenges of estimating the cost of the program. Discretionary program costs are estimated in advance of the award year they are intended to support, and based on the chosen discretionary base maximum award level and estimated program participation.
