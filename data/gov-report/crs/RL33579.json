Aid is provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) upon a presidential declaration. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) also has both standing and emergency authorities in the Public Health Service Act, by which he or she can provide assistance in response to public health and medical emergencies. At this time, however, the Secretary of HHS has limited means to finance activities that are ineligible, for whatever reason, for Stafford Act assistance.", "The flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, and preparedness efforts for an influenza (\"flu\") pandemic, have each raised concerns about federal response mechanisms for incidents that result in overwhelming public health and medical needs. These concerns include the delegation of responsibilities among different federal departments, and whether critical conflicts or gaps exist in these relationships. In particular, there are some concerns about federal leadership and delegations of responsibility as laid out in the National Response Framework (NRF), published by the Department of Homeland Security.", "There is no federal assistance program designed purposefully to cover the uninsured or uncompensated costs of individual health care that may be needed as a consequence of a disaster. While there is not consensus that this should be a federal responsibility, Congress has provided such assistance to victims of some specific disasters in the past. For example, following Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided short-term assistance to host states, through the Medicaid program, to cover a portion of the uninsured health care costs of eligible evacuees. Congress has provided funding\u2014and some have proposed establishing statutory authority\u2014to cover certain uninsured health care costs for responders and others who are having health problems related to exposures at the World Trade Center site in New York City after the 2001 terrorist attack.

First, preparedness and response are different. At each level of government, they involve different leadership roles, legal authorities, organizational structures, and funding mechanisms. Generally, during an incident, certain conditions must be met before a jurisdiction can implement response activities, or access funds reserved for that purpose. Second, states, rather than the federal government, are the seats of authority and responsibility for the oversight of both health care and emergency management. For example, state laws generally authorize governors to order and enforce the evacuation of residents in emergency situations. Except under extraordinary circumstances, the federal government generally does not dictate the conduct of health care or emergency management activities to state or local officials, or to health care providers. Finally, while most public health functions are inherently governmental, the nation's health care system is, in contrast, primarily private and for-profit. Providers and facilities operate in an increasingly competitive marketplace in which emergency planning is not always seen as a necessary expense.", "When there is a catastrophe in the United States, state and local governments take the lead in response activities. State and local legal authorities are the principal means to support these activities. When the resources of states and localities are overwhelmed, the President can provide certain additional assets and personnel to aid stricken communities, and can provide funding to individuals and to government and not-for-profit entities to assist them in response and recovery. This assistance is provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act), upon a presidential declaration of an emergency (a lower level of assistance) or a major disaster (a higher level of assistance).", "Recent incidents\u2014the September 11 and anthrax attacks of 2001, and several major hurricanes\u2014have shown the limitations of existing funding mechanisms in supporting public health and medical incident response. First, it is not clear that Stafford Act major disaster assistance is available for the response to infectious disease threats, whether intentional (i.e., bioterrorism) or natural (e.g., pandemic influenza, or \"flu\"). Second, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has authority under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to draw upon a special fund to support departmental activities in response to unanticipated public health emergencies, but there is at present no money in the fund. Finally, there is no existing comprehensive mechanism to provide federal assistance for uninsured or uncompensated individual health care costs that may be incurred as a result of a natural disaster or terrorist incident, though there is not general agreement that such assistance should be a federal responsibility.", "This report focuses on incident response activities (versus preparedness activities) and examines (1) the statutory authorities and coordinating mechanisms of the President (acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security) and the Secretary of HHS in providing routine assistance, and in providing assistance pursuant to emergency or major disaster declarations and/or public health emergency determinations; (2) mechanisms to assure a coordinated federal response to public health and medical emergencies, and overlaps or gaps in agency responsibilities; and (3) existing mechanisms, potential gaps, and proposals to fund the costs of a response to public health and medical emergencies.

Also, of importance to a flu pandemic or other public health threat, the protection of public health is to be considered by the President, as seen in the following:", "\"Emergency\" means any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.", "As with the major disaster authority, an emergency declaration must meet tests pertaining to need and action . However, as with the definition of \"emergency,\" the President is granted a wider degree of discretion. While governors requesting assistance must take certain required actions, they do not have to identify that state and local resources have been committed. They must, however, identify the type and extent of federal aid required.

As with catastrophes in general, the federal government may provide various forms of assistance to state and local governments, non-profit entities, families, and others, in response to public health threats.", "In response to public health threats, the Secretary of HHS can provide a considerable degree of assistance to states, upon their request, through the Secretary's standing (i.e., non-emergency) authorities. There is neither a defined threshold, nor a requirement to demonstrate need, as with the Stafford Act. For example, simply upon the request of a State Health Official, and without the involvement of the President, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can provide financial and technical assistance to states for outbreak investigation and disease control activities. These activities are carried out under the Secretary's general authority to assist states, pursuant to Sections 311 and 317 of the PHS Act, among others.", "There are a number of authorities in the PHS Act that allow the Secretary of HHS to take certain actions in the face of a \"public health emergency.\" That term is defined in different ways, or in some cases is not defined. The principal such authority is in Section 319 of the PHS Act, which grants the Secretary of HHS broad authority to determine that a public health emergency exists. Pursuant to such a determination, the Secretary may waive certain administrative requirements, provide additional forms of assistance, and take certain other actions to expand federal aid to state and local governments, not-for-profit entities, and others. The Secretary must provide written notice of such determinations to the Congress within 48 hours, but is not required to publish notice of such determinations in the Federal Register . The Secretary's authority to determine that a public health emergency exists is as follows:", "If the Secretary determines, after consultation with such public health officials as may be necessary, that\u2014(1) a disease or disorder presents a public health emergency; or (2) a public health emergency, including significant outbreaks of infectious diseases or bioterrorist attacks, otherwise exists, the Secretary may take such action as may be appropriate to respond to the public health emergency, including making grants, providing awards for expenses, and entering into contracts and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of a disease or disorder as described in paragraphs (1) and (2).", "Making such a determination enables the Secretary to take three types of actions that can be especially useful for incident response. First, such a determination authorizes the Secretary to draw from a special emergency fund. (The fund does not currently have any monies available, however. See the subsequent section \" The Public Health Emergency Fund .\") Second, it enables the Secretary to implement an authority in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\u2014the so-called Emergency Use Authorization\u2014allowing for the use of unapproved medical treatments and tests, under specified conditions, if needed during an incident. Third, if there is a concurrent declaration pursuant to the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act, the Secretary is authorized to waive a number of administrative requirements, principally involving reimbursement through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, that can be useful if patients must be relocated due to damage to or inaccessibility of health care facilities. Among other things, these waivers allow beneficiaries to receive services despite having lost their documentation of eligibility, and allow providers to provide services in alternate temporary facilities. A listing of these and other federal public health emergency authorities is provided in the Appendix .", "Although the waivers described above can streamline access to care for individuals who have health insurance, they do not provide coverage for individuals who do not. Bills introduced in the 110 th Congress ( H.R. 6569 / S. 3312 ) would authorize the Secretary of HHS, pursuant to a Section 319 public health emergency determination, to use the PHEF to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals affected by the emergency. The proposals would require the Secretary to consider, in making such a determination, the extent to which the situation has or is likely to overwhelm health care providers in the affected area, and the potential financial burdens those providers may face as a result. A concurrent declaration under the Stafford Act would not be required to enable this authority.", "The emergency authorities of the Secretary of HHS are not strictly comparable to authorities in the Stafford Act. Stafford Act major disaster assistance is intended to assist states and individuals with needs that exceed the scope of assistance routinely provided by federal agencies, and is often triggered by large-scale infrastructure damage. In contrast, the response to public health emergencies (such as infectious disease outbreaks) often involves extensions of routine program activities, such as technical assistance for epidemiologic and laboratory investigation, workforce assistance, or the provision of special drugs or tests.", " Table 1 lists public health emergency determination made pursuant to Section 319 of the PHS Act since 2000. These determinations are less common than are disaster or emergency declarations made pursuant to the Stafford Act. Two factors may explain this. First, as noted above, the Secretary of HHS has standing (non-emergency) authority to render many forms of aid to state and local governments and others, without the need to make such a determination. Second, although making such a determination authorizes the Secretary to draw from a Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF), the fund has not had a balance in it for many years. Consequently, none of the determinations issued since 2000 had the effect of mobilizing any additional funds beyond what would otherwise have been available. It is possible that if funds were available to the Secretary of HHS in the PHEF, it could influence the Secretary's decision to make a public health emergency determination, or the pressures put upon the Secretary to do so. Given that, Congress may consider whether the degree of discretion afforded to the HHS Secretary in making such a determination, and the accompanying reporting requirements, are appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intersection of Stafford Act and Public Health Emergency Authority", "paragraphs": ["Disaster and emergency authorities pursuant to the Stafford Act are generally independent of public health emergency authorities.

The NRF is under the overall coordination of the Secretary of Homeland Security, and its implementation is delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It sets forth the responsibilities and roles of federal agencies; identifies tasks to be performed by specified federal officials; and includes annexes with details on support resources and mechanisms that are integral to its implementation.

The NRF, which was published subsequently, similarly notes that it could serve as the blueprint for a coordinated national response to this incident.", "As noted earlier, the NRF serves as a coordinating mechanism, but does not confer additional authorities or serve as a source of funding for response activities. When a Stafford Act emergency or major disaster is declared, the Disaster Relief Fund may be used to pay for authorized response activities and assistance. There is precedent for a Stafford emergency declaration in response to an infectious disease threat: as noted earlier, emergency declarations pursuant to the Stafford Act were made in response to West Nile virus in 2000. However, there is no relevant precedent regarding whether Stafford Act major disaster assistance could be provided in response to a flu pandemic. FEMA has in the past, in the context of the national TOPOFF exercises, interpreted intentional biological incidents as ineligible for major disaster assistance pursuant to the Stafford Act. However, the view of the George W. Bush Administration was that the President's authority to declare a major disaster pursuant to the Stafford Act could be applied to a flu pandemic, and in 2007, FEMA issued a Disaster Assistance Policy regarding major disaster assistance that may be provided in response to this threat.", "The matter of the applicability of a Stafford Act declaration to a flu pandemic is important for two reasons. First, the level of funding that may be available to support federal activities, and provide assistance to state and local governments and individuals, is substantially greater following a major disaster declaration than it is following an emergency declaration. Second, the federal leadership structure for incident response may be different depending on whether the incident results in a Stafford Act declaration (of either type), or is a \"non-Stafford\" incident. The Stafford Act requires the President, upon making an emergency or major disaster declaration, to appoint a Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to operate in the affected region. This individual has historically reported to the head of FEMA, who in turn reports to the President and assumes overall operational control of the federal government's incident response. The NRF, and the NRP before it, also established the role of Principal Federal Official (PFO), a different individual who reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security during an incident response. Confusion about the respective roles and authorities of these individuals was identified following Hurricane Katrina, and has remained a matter of concern to Congress. It is reported that in December 2006, the Secretary of Homeland Security predesignated, in the event of a response to a flu pandemic, one national and five regional FCOs, and one national and five regional PFOs. The respective roles of these individuals\u2014all of whom would presumably be involved in response activities if a Stafford Act declaration were made\u2014have not been clarified in any publicly available pandemic planning documents.", "It is widely agreed that emergency assistance under the Stafford Act could be provided by the President in the event of a flu pandemic, although questions remain as to whether major disaster assistance would be available. A legal analysis of the question, conducted by CRS, suggests that this issue was not addressed by Congress when it drafted the current definition of a major disaster, and that neither inclusion nor exclusion of a flu pandemic from major disaster assistance is explicitly required by the current statutory language. In the 109 th Congress, Section 210 of S. 3721 would have made any outbreak of infectious disease explicitly eligible for major disaster assistance, but it was not enacted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRF Emergency Support Function 8:Roles and Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The Hurricane Katrina response, and planning for a flu pandemic, each demonstrate the scope of public health and medical activities needed in response to a large-scale catastrophe.

A successful medical response would perhaps be more complicated, requiring the coordination of numerous activities and services, and involving federal, state or local government agencies, and private for-profit and not-for-profit entities. These elements are (1) patients, who may require rescue or medical evacuation; (2) a treatment facility, which may be an existing hospital, or a field tent with cots; (3) a competent health care workforce; (4) appropriate medical equipment and non-perishable medical supplies; (5) appropriate drugs, vaccines, tests and other perishable medical supplies; (6) a system of medical records; and (7) a health care financing mechanism.", "According to the NRF (and the earlier NRP), the Secretary of HHS is tasked with coordinating Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF-8), the NRF annex that addresses the public health and medical response to incidents. (ESF-8 is one of 15 ESFs in the NRF. Other annexes include public safety, energy supplies, and transportation, for example.) ESFs are coordinating mechanisms, not funding mechanisms.", "The response to a flu pandemic is likely to involve ESF-8 primarily, and public health and medical needs could be substantial. A flu pandemic would not likely impose the mass dislocations and destruction of health care infrastructure that can result from major hurricanes. But, as a pandemic would affect all areas of the nation nearly simultaneously, responders could not necessarily count on the state-to-state mutual aid that is often critical in disaster response. And planners note that a severe pandemic could still constitute a multi-sector incident. Staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions could disrupt services, and possibly affect the integrity of infrastructure, in the transportation, public works, and energy sectors, among others, engaging ESFs for those sectors in the response as well.", "The Secretary of HHS is responsible for coordinating the following response activities under ESF-8, and may request assistance from 14 designated support agencies and the American Red Cross as needed:", "assessment of public health and medical needs; health surveillance; medical care personnel; health/medical/veterinary equipment and supplies; patient evacuation; patient care; safety and security of human and veterinary drugs and medical devices, and human biologics; blood and blood products; food safety and security; agriculture safety and security; all-hazard public health and medical consultation, technical assistance and support; behavioral health care; public health and medical information; vector control (e.g., control of disease-carrying insects and rodents); potable water, wastewater and solid waste disposal; mass fatality management, victim identification and decontaminating remains; and veterinary medical support.", "Depending on the incident, HHS may need other agencies to carry out certain of their ESF activities (e.g., public safety, road clearing, and power restoration) before some ESF-8 activities could begin.

The NRF has addressed some of these concerns, left others unclear, and possibly raised some new concerns.", "Some had questioned whether the NRP clearly defined federal ESF-8 leadership, or whether the respective roles of the Secretaries of Homeland Security and HHS could conflict during a response. Some, including congressional investigators, felt this conflict was evidenced during the response to Hurricane Katrina. Others were concerned that the respective roles were insufficiently clear to guide a coordinated response to a flu pandemic. In October 2006, the President signed P.L. 109 - 295 , the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (called the Post-Katrina Act or PKA, in DHS appropriations for FY2007), which reauthorized and reorganized programs in FEMA. Among other things, the law also codified the position of Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at DHS, the individual who coordinates all departmental activities regarding medical and public health aspects of disasters. The Post-Katrina Act provided that the CMO \"shall have the primary responsibility within the Department for medical issues related to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters.\" (Emphasis added.) Subsequently, in December 2006, the President signed P.L. 109 - 417 , the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which provided that \"The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall lead all Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan.... \" (Emphasis added.) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended, in the context of pandemic flu planning, that the two departments (DHS and HHS) conduct rigorous testing, training and exercises to ensure that these roles are clearly defined.", "Responsibility for the health and safety of disaster response workers was a matter of concern in the NRP, and remains so in the NRF. GAO found that OSHA's efforts during the response to Hurricane Katrina were hampered by confusion about the agency's role, and noted in particular that disagreements between FEMA and OSHA regarding OSHA's role delayed FEMA's authorization of mission assignments to fund OSHA's response activities. Some Members of Congress and others sought to have worker health and safety elevated to an Emergency Support Function in the NRF, which would give OSHA more autonomy in commencing its response activities. Instead, the NRF contains a revised Worker Safety and Health Support Annex.", "Following Hurricane Katrina, the 109 th Congress enacted the SAFE Port Act ( P.L. 109 - 347 ). One of its provisions authorizes the President, acting through the Secretary of HHS and pursuant to a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act, to establish medical monitoring programs, if needed, to track the health status of individuals (not limited to responders) who may experience hazardous exposures as a result of the disaster. The authority has not yet been implemented. According to GAO, as of May 2008, HHS had not articulated a plan for doing so. Federal agency responsibilities and funding mechanisms are not clear without such a plan. For example, within HHS, at least three components\u2014the ASPR, as well as the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, both in CDC\u2014have relevant authorities and responsibilities that overlap. Also, as noted above, a major disaster typically triggers federal coordinating mechanisms laid out in the NRF, which places OSHA in the lead in assuring responder health and safety. In 2008, GAO recommended that HHS develop plans to register all responders during a disaster, as part of a comprehensive departmental plan to assure responder health during and after disasters. GAO said that such a plan should also include a means to implement medical monitoring programs, or to assist states and localities in doing so. To meet the intent of the SAFE Port Act, such a plan must also address affected individuals who are not responders.", "Although both the NRP and the NRF address mass fatality management, the NRP did not, and the NRF does not, clearly delegate responsibility for the retrieval of human remains in mass fatality events. HHS is responsible for the ESF-8 function of coordinating federal assistance to identify victims and determine causes of death. Federal Disaster Mortuary Assistance Teams (DMORTs) comprise medical examiners, pathologists, dental technicians and other medical personnel. These teams are not skilled in the safe retrieval of remains from hazardous sites such as waterways or collapsed buildings. Other responders, including Urban Search and Rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard, are trained to work safely in such dangerous conditions, but their mission is to rescue the living, not recover the dead. The matter of mass fatality management is of considerable concern in planning for a flu pandemic, and this gap could be problematic during such an incident.", "At times the distinction between ESF-6 and ESF-8 may be blurred. Emergency Support Function 6 (ESF-6), Mass Care , under the leadership of FEMA, lays out the coordination of emergency shelter, feeding, and related activities for affected populations. As was evident in the response to Hurricane Katrina, the ESF functions overlapped when evacuees in Red Cross shelters required medical care, or when large numbers of hospital patients evacuated to ESF-8 field hospitals required food and water. The revised ESF-6 and ESF-8 annexes accompanying the NRF provide substantially more detail regarding the coordination of these functions than did the corresponding NRP annexes. Also, this problem was reportedly considered by FEMA, HHS, and the American Red Cross in their reviews of the hurricane response, and in their subsequent preparedness planning. HHS assets and personnel were deployed extensively for the evacuation and care of individuals with special needs before and during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the fall of 2008.", "In the NRF, as with the NRP, leadership for the federal coordination of mental and behavioral health services following a disaster appears to be split between ESF-6 and ESF-8. \"Crisis counseling\" is among the responsibilities delegated in ESF-6, while federal coordination of \"behavioral health care\"\u2014including assessing mental health and substance abuse needs, and providing disaster mental health training for workers\u2014is delegated in ESF-8. Hence, federal leadership for disaster mental health in the NRF is delegated to both FEMA and to HHS. (When the disaster involves terrorism or other forms of violence, the Department of Justice may also be a key federal partner. )", "Finally, the NRF resolves a gap in the NRP regarding federal responsibility for pets during disasters. Often people are reluctant or unwilling to abandon pets, and will remain at home in contravention to an evacuation order if they cannot take pets with them. In the Post-Katrina Act and the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109 - 308 ), the 109 th Congress required DHS, in developing standards for state and local emergency plans, to account for the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals before, during, and after a major disaster or emergency, in particular with regard to evacuation planning and planning for the needs of individuals with disabilities. In addition, the President is authorized to make Stafford Act assistance available to states and localities to carry out pet rescue and sheltering activities in the immediate response to a major disaster. Neither act addressed federal leadership for the needs of pets in disasters, but this is addressed in the NRF. FEMA, when coordinating federal efforts to provide human sheltering services per ESF-6 (Mass Care), is to ensure that the needs of pets can also be accommodated. (This is often referred to as \"co-sheltering.\") USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, per ESF-11 (Agriculture and Natural Resources), is to ensure that the sheltering needs of the pets are met. In 2007, FEMA issued a policy directive regarding eligible costs related to pet evacuations and sheltering, for which state and local governments would be reimbursed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Funding to Support an ESF-8 Response", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane Katrina was the greatest test of ESF-8 since the establishment of DHS and the publication of the NRP.

Given that some U.S. uninsured health care needs go unmet under normal circumstances, there is not consensus that the costs of health care for these disaster victims should be a federal responsibility. However, policy debates following two recent disasters, and concerns about pandemic flu, suggest that some Members of Congress and others are interested in exploring possible mechanisms to provide such assistance, at least in certain situations.", "Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided $2.1 billion through the Medicaid program to assist states in providing for the health care needs of Katrina evacuees for five months following the storm.

Assistance may be provided under both major disaster and emergency declarations that involve the provision of health and safety measures and the reduction of threats to public health and safety. The FEMA Individuals and Households Program (IHP) provides, pursuant to a Stafford Act declaration and reimbursed from the DRF, cash assistance that may be used for uninsured medical expenses. Recipients might have to use the funds to meet other needs concurrently, such as rent and other costs of living. The amount available is the same for an individual or a household, and is capped in statute, with an annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index. The maximum amount available for Hurricane Katrina relief was $26,200, and the current ceiling (for FY2009) is $30,300. Certain medications and supplies may be provided to patients from pre-paid stockpiles for which reimbursement is not expected. Examples include supplies used in first aid stations or distributed to states from the CDC's Strategic National Stockpile. Agencies' costs may be reimbursed from the DRF if the incident resulted in a Stafford Act declaration. The Stafford Act authorizes the President, pursuant to a major disaster declaration, to provide financial assistance to state and qualified tribal mental health agencies for professional counseling services, or training of disaster workers, to relieve disaster victims' mental health problems caused or aggravated by the disaster or its aftermath. FEMA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in HHS jointly administer the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP). Costs are reimbursed from the DRF. Public Health Service agencies in HHS may provide support to states and other entities through existing non-emergency mechanisms to assist in managing surges in health care needs for specific populations. In some cases, agencies have received supplemental appropriations to support these activities. Examples include SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants (SERG) to states, territories, and federally recognized tribal authorities for crisis mental health and substance abuse services, and expanded federal support, including personnel, for health centers in disaster-affected areas. Certain federal compensation programs may cover some or all health care costs for certain disaster victims, although these programs generally flow from the individual's employment status rather than from their status as disaster victims. Such programs include workers' compensation programs for federal workers whose injuries are related to employment, and benefits for federal, state, and local public safety officers (including police officers and firefighters) who are killed or permanently disabled while performing their duties.
