In producing countries, natural gas is extracted from gas fields and transported bypipeline to central liquefaction plants where it is converted to LNG and stored. Liquefaction plantsare built at marine terminals so the LNG can be loaded onto special tanker ships for transportoverseas. Tankers deliver their LNG cargo to import terminals in other countries where the LNGcan again be stored or regasified and injected into pipeline systems for delivery to end users. ThisLNG infrastructure requires large capital investments. In addition to gas field development costs,a new liquefaction plant costs approximately $2-$3 billion, and an import terminal costs $500million to $1 billion. One LNG tanker costs $150-$200 million.

As noted earlier in this report, federal agencies haveapproved the siting of ten new terminals in the Gulf of Mexico as well as two new Florida pipelinesfor proposed terminals in the Bahamas. But many developers have sought to build terminals nearerto major consuming markets in California and the Northeast, as Figure 4 shows. Developers haveproposed terminals near consuming markets to avoid pipeline bottlenecks and to minimizetransportation costs. In 2003, soon after LNG deliveries to the Cove Point resumed, natural gas forthe local Maryland market was priced well below conventional gas supplies transported by pipelinefrom the Gulf of Mexico. (37) If new terminals are built far from key consumer markets,delivered gas might cost more than if LNG terminals were built locally.", "As of January, 2006, federal agencies have approved only one new LNG import terminaloutside the Gulf of Mexico, in Massachusetts. Such near-to-market terminal proposals havestruggled for approval due to community concerns about LNG safety, effects on local commerce, andother potential negative impacts. LNG terminal opposition is not unlike that experienced by someother types of industrial and utility facilities. Due to local community opposition, LNG developershave already withdrawn terminal projects recently proposed in California, Maine, North Carolina,Florida, and Mexico. Other terminal proposals in Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Canadaare facing stiff community opposition. In Alabama, a state assumed by many to be friendly to LNGdevelopment, community groups have effectively blocked two onshore terminal proposals and havecalled for LNG import terminals to be built only offshore.

For example, Delaware's environmental secretary has blocked the development ofan LNG terminal on the Delaware-New Jersey border ruling that part of the terminal would extendinto Delaware's waters and violate Delaware's Coastal Zone Act. (39) The United StatesSupreme Court has appointed a special master to resolve the dispute. (40) In January, 2005,Massachusetts and Rhode Island filed petitions in federal court to reverse FERC's approval of anLNG import terminal to be sited in Fall River, Massachusetts. (41) In 2004, the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission (CPUC) sued FERC in federal court over FERC's assertion of solejurisdiction over the siting of an LNG terminal in Long Beach. The CPUC dropped its suit, however,after the passage of P.L. 109-58 mooted its arguments.", "Local opposition for LNG terminals has been strong in the Northeast, which has aconstrained gas transmission infrastructure. Northeast gas prices are higher than in other parts of thecountry. In Maine, for example, the monthly average wholesale price of gas delivered betweenOctober, 2004 and October, 2005 was $12.09/Mcf, compared to $8.27/Mcf in Louisiana. (42) Were the same pricedifferential to hold in the future, Maine consumers would have to pay $3.81/Mcf, or 46 percent, morefor LNG delivered to Louisiana rather than the Maine coast. Many factors like weather, pipelinetariffs, and new natural gas supplies from Canada could significantly change relative prices. Nonetheless, if recent regional pricing patterns persist, displacing a handful of proposed LNGterminals from consumer markets to the Gulf of Mexico could cost regional gas consumers billionsof dollars in extra pipeline transportation charges. On the other hand, siting new terminals in morereceptive locations could help bring them into service more quickly, and could still exert downwardpressure on gas prices while alleviating community safety concerns.", "Pipeline Infrastructure. LNG supplies to theUnited States have been such a small share of the total market that they have had little discernibleinfluence on the development of North America's gas pipeline network. If projections of U.S. LNGgrowth prove correct, however, LNG terminals may have more impact on pipeline infrastructure inthe future. As additional LNG import capacity is approved, how new terminals will be physicallyintegrated into the existing pipeline network becomes a consideration.", "LNG terminals may affect pipeline infrastructure in two ways. First, new terminals andterminal expansions must be connected to the interstate pipeline network through sufficient\"takeaway\" pipeline capacity to handle the large volumes of imported natural gas. Depending uponthe size, location and proximity of a new terminal to existing pipelines, ensuring adequate takeawaycapacity may require new pipeline construction. For example, the owner of the Elba Island, GAterminal intends to build a 191-mile pipeline to transport additional gas volume from the terminal'splanned expansion. (43) Energy experts have expressed concern, however, that interstate pipeline capacity may not besufficient to handle future LNG supplies without substantial new pipeline additions. (44) The availability of pipelinecapacity directly affects pipeline transportation costs, so it is an important consideration in evaluatingthe economics of LNG versus traditional pipeline supplies in specific markets.", "Second, if gas imported as LNG cannot move freely through interstate pipeline systems,consumers may not realize the lower prices that result from additional gas availability. One industryobserver remarked, \"without more infrastructure, gas may face the kind of glut plaguing the electricutility industry, with too much generating capacity and too few connections.\" (45) For this reason, some LNGdevelopers advocate building LNG terminals in traditional gas producing regions, where pipelinenodes are located. According to one industry executive, \"it doesn't make a lot of sense to build aterminal and then have to build a huge pipeline.\" (46) Others argue that the most costly constraints in the gas pipelinenetwork are at the ends of the pipelines, not the beginnings. Gas is expensive in Boston, forexample, because there are few pipelines supplying the region -- a transportation constraint thatwould not be alleviated by pumping more gas into pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico. As one seniorFERC official has reportedly remarked, \"putting more and more LNG plants in the Gulf, while itmay be good for the overall gas supply situation in this country, won't do a whole lot for the regionalgas needs of New England.\" (47) It is not clear, therefore, whether adding LNG supplies totraditional producing regions would be less costly for consumers than building in-market terminalsand adding to regional pipeline capacity.", "In addition to requiring sufficient takeaway capacity, LNG terminals likely will influencepipeline network flows. Major U.S. pipeline systems were designed primarily to move gas fromtraditional producing regions (e.g., Gulf Coast, Appalachia, Western Canada) to consuming regions(e.g, Northeast, Midwest). If most new LNG capacity is built in the Gulf of Mexico, then traditionalgas flows would be maintained. If a number of new terminals are built in consuming regions,however, they may change historical gas transportation patterns, potentially displacing traditionalproduction and changing infrastructure constraints. Among other potential impacts, some analystshave suggested that new LNG terminals will result in \"less market leverage and probably lower cashflows\" for some existing pipelines because new LNG supplies may be able to reach consumermarkets by alternate routes. (48) Predicting the overall effects of long term changes in gas flowsis a complex problem, although such changes may have important implications for current pipelineutilization and for future pipeline investments.", "Interchangeability. LNG consists primarily ofmethane, but it may also contain significant quantities of other hydrocarbon fuels, such as ethane,propane and butane. The quantity of these other fuels in LNG affects the overall heat content in theLNG and varies depending upon its source. In markets outside the United States, LNG containsmore non-methane fuels and, therefore, has a higher heat content than traditional U.S. natural gassupplies. LNG with a high heat content can cause problems when imported into the United Statesbecause it may damage pipelines and natural gas-fired equipment (e.g., electric power turbines)which are designed for a lower heat content. There are a number of potential technical solutions toLNG interchangeability problems, such as stripping out the non-methane fuels, blending the LNGwith domestic natural gas, and \"diluting\" the LNG with nitrogen. (49) These solutions mayinvolve significant added expense to LNG processing, however, which could be reflected in highernatural gas prices. The FERC has been working with natural gas trade associations to establishappropriate national policies for natural gas interchangeability and quality. The FERC has addressedsome interchangeability issues on a case by case basis, and has proposed more general regulationson natural gas quality and interchangeability, but the commission's expressed preference is that thegas industry and gas quality stakeholders reach their own consensus on interchangeability. (50) ", "Safety and Physical Security. To protect thepublic from an LNG accident or terrorist attack, the federal government imposes numerous safetyand security requirements on LNG infrastructure. The nature and level of risk associated with LNGis the subject of ongoing debate among industry, government agencies, researchers and localcommunities. (51) Whatever the specific risk levels are determined to be, they could multiply as the number of LNGterminals and associated tanker shipments grows. Likewise, the costs associated with mitigatingthese risks are also likely to increase. To the extent these costs are not borne by the LNG industry,they may represent an ongoing burden to public agencies such as the Coast Guard, law enforcement,and emergency response agencies.", "Securing tanker shipments against terrorist attacks may be the most significant publicexpense associated with LNG. CRS has estimated the public cost of security for an LNG deliveryto the Everett terminal to be on the order of $80,000, excluding costs incurred by the terminalowner. (52) Marinesecurity costs at other LNG terminals could be lower than for Everett because they are farther fromdense populations and may face fewer vulnerabilities, but could still be on the order of $20,000 to$40,000 per shipment. If LNG imports increase as projected, the number of vessels calling at LNGterminals serving the United States would increase from 99 (0.17 Tcf) in 2002 to over 2300 (4.13Tcf) in 2025. (53) Atcurrent levels of protection, marine security costs would then be in the range of $46 million to $92million annually. (54) Recognizing the added security needs associated with the LNG trade, the Coast Guard's FY2006budget includes an additional $11 million in general maritime security funding over FY2005 levels. These resources are for new small response boats and associated crew to increase the Coast Guard'soperational presence and response posture, enforce security zones, and escort LNG tankers and otherhigh interest vessels.

Thepublic costs of LNG security also may decline as federally mandated security systems and plans areimplemented. Nonetheless, because the accounting of security costs is ambiguous and may be tiedto uncertain sources of federal funding, such as Department of Homeland Security grants, somepolicy makers remain concerned about LNG security costs and the potential diversion of CoastGuard and safety agency resources from other activities.", "Supply Bottlenecks. Because U.S. LNG terminalsprocess large volumes of LNG, the potential for one facility to bottleneck supply might not berecognized.

Although the strike endedquickly and U.S. gas demand at the time was moderate, one gas trader stated that if the strike hadoccurred during the heart of winter it might have exacerbated already high Northeast gas prices.

Others view these kinds of events as ordinary supply uncertainties readily managed in other fuelmarkets.

The belief that LNG canserve as a \"price-pressure safety valve\" by setting a price ceiling on natural gas assumes thatsufficient LNG would be available at that price to satisfy all incremental gas demand. Otherwise, gas prices would be capped by potentially more costly North American production alternatives. Thequestion, then, is whether there will be sufficient LNG production abroad to supply incremental U.S.demand and sufficient global infrastructure to distribute it.", "Table 1 summarizes basic characteristics of existing or potential LNG exporters. As thetable shows, 2005 global LNG production capacity currently operating totaled approximately 9.1 Tcfper year.

Some gas market analystsbelieve that a robust short-term or \"spot\" market for LNG is essential for U.S. importers to manageprice and supply risk, and to do business cost-effectively. An LNG spot market could allow forshort-term balancing of physical supply and demand. It could also offer greater LNG price discoveryand transparency, benefitting companies negotiating long-term LNG contracts and potentially servingas a more relevant index for LNG contract price escalators than traditional petroleum indexes. (62) A spot market might alsosupport financial trading and derivatives, important tools for managing price risk, especially duringperiods of volatile prices. (63) ", "In recent years, the global LNG market has seen limited, but increasing short-term trade.Short-term contracts accounted for 11% of global LNG transactions in 2005, up from less than 2%in 1998, and have already enabled physical market balancing. In 2005, for example, just afterHurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf of Mexico, Suez Energy (owner of the Everett LNGterminal) purchased a spot LNG cargo to meet its obligations to its New England customers. (64) In 2003-2004, SouthKorea purchased 36 spot cargoes of LNG to meet extra residential heating demand duringwinter. (65) In December, 2003, Indonesia sought four LNG cargoes from rival producers to meet delivery contractsfollowing production problems at its Bontang plant. (66) ", "Unlike petroleum markets where all prices are essentially short-term, analysts believe LNGtrade will stabilize with some mix of long and short-term contracts since infrastructure costs are sohigh. No new LNG liquefaction project yet has been launched without a long term contract. Thelikely size of an LNG spot market is difficult to predict, however at least one major exporter expects30% of global LNG capacity will ultimately trade on the spot market. (67) Coupled with projectionsof overall LNG demand growth, a 30% spot market share implies a tripling in spot market volumesby 2020. It is an open question, however, whether this volume of spot trade in LNG will materializeand if it will offer the full range of benefits realized in comparable commodity markets.", "A concern related to LNG spot market development is the potential role of marketintermediaries. In the late 1990's, independent marketers like Enron and Dynegy emerged toparticipate in trading of natural gas, electricity, and other energy commodities. These marketparticipants increased market liquidity, selling risk management services to both producers andconsumers. Many marketers fell into bankruptcy, however, following the California electricity crisisin 2001 and subsequent scandals. A handful of major banks are beginning to pursue newpartnerships with LNG terminal companies (e.g., Morgan Stanley - Cheniere Energy) to facilitateLNG trading and marketing, but such partnerships have yet to fully develop. (68) It is unclear, therefore,which entities may ultimately succeed in providing the LNG industry with the capabilities neededfor a fully functioning market. ", "Market Concentration. Some industry analystsbelieve the future LNG market may be susceptible to concentration-related inefficiencies. They notethat only a limited number of buyers and sellers can effectively participate in LNG trade because thecapital requirements are so great. (69) Many analysts also believe that a relatively small number ofexporting countries are likely to account for the majority of LNG trade in the foreseeable future.", "Based on LNG's similarity to the world oil trade, some observers are concerned about thepossible emergence of a natural gas export cartel analogous to the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC). One analyst remarked:", "Might a few countries come to dominate the supply ofLNG and adopt policies harking back to the confrontational OPEC of the 1970's? An association ofsome kind among LNG exporters is likely. Many of them are also oil exporters, and the desire tocompare fiscal terms will be irresistible. (70)", "In March, 2004, at the Fourth Annual Gas Exporting Countries Forum, 15 major natural gasexporters established an \"executive bureau\" to develop common policies and joint initiativesregarding natural gas exports. According to press accounts, some forum members viewed the bureauas \"a major step toward creating an OPEC-like organization to regulate gas production.\" (71) Some analysts have alsopointed to apparent efforts by Russian gas company, Gazprom, \"to sketch out the basic terms forbroad cooperation in the gas sector between Russia and Iran\" the two countries controlling the largestnatural gas reserves in the world. (72) Other analysts are more skeptical of a potential natural gas cartel,citing the predominance of long-term contracts for LNG trade, divergent national interests, and otherfactors as barriers to collaboration. (73) ", "The ability of a cartel to play a similar role in gas as OPEC does in oil is debatable. OPECmember countries currently control over 75% of the world's proven oil reserves and approximately40% of global oil supply. (74) By comparison, OPEC members control approximately 50% ofproven world gas reserves and approximately 59% of global LNG production capacity projected for2015 (Table 1 ). When non-LNG sources are accounted for, however, OPEC countries' share ofglobal gas supply would be approximately 5% in 2015. Based on these figures alone, it is difficultto draw conclusions about the potential market power of an association of LNG exporters. It ispossible, however, that the diversity of LNG suppliers, and the competitive relationship betweenLNG and traditional pipeline gas could make the world LNG market somewhat different than thatof oil.", "Global Trade and Politics. Continued growth ofUnited States demand in an integrated global LNG market may affect trading and politicalrelationships with key market participants. According to one estimate, by 2015 the United Statesmay be the world's largest LNG importer, accounting for 22% of global volumes ( Figure 5 ).

Accordingto the EIA: ", "the result was a significant increase in Japan's demandfor LNG, so that the majority of world spot cargoes were delivered to the Japanese market. Japan'sincreased reliance on LNG probably contributed to the reduction in short-term deliveries of LNG tothe United States...

With LNG supplies in Asia suddenly scarce, South Koreahad to pay a substantial premium to attract spot cargoes originally destined for Spain. (76) In 2004-2005, Spainattracted numerous LNG spot cargoes \"at the expense of the US\" in response to record cold weatherand inadequate hydroelectric power supplies. (77) Despite record cold temperatures and record high natural gasprices after the Gulf hurricanes, U.S. LNG terminals were operating at less than 50% capacity inDecember, 2005.

According to one analyst, \"question remains on the merits of increasing reliance onimported energy ... if supply sources are from a region perceived as politically unstable orinhospitable to U.S. interests.\" (79) In part to mitigate such risks, the DOE has been encouraging thedevelopment of LNG supplies in South America and West Africa rather than the Middle East. According to the former DOE Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs, \"DOE istrying to make countries like Equatorial Guinea as attractive as possible to investors while aimingto limit the countries' potential political instability through contract and regulatory reform.\" (80) ", "LNG trade may also be linked to broader trading and political relationships among key LNGpartners.

(82) Russia's brief withholding of natural gas supplies to Ukraine andparts of the European Union in January, 2006 in what was widely perceived as both an economic andpolitical dispute have raised additional concerns about political linkages among future natural gasmarket participants. (83) It is interesting to note that several European countries, including Italy, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary,Croatia, have since proposed the construction of new LNG imports terminals to reduce theirdependence on Russian pipeline natural gas supplies. Russia's plans to become a major LNGexporter may further complicate the global natural gas trade.

Such an increase would pose a number of practical, immediate challenges, such as ensuringadequate production and import capacity, integrating LNG efficiently into the existing natural gassupply network, and securing LNG infrastructure against accident or terrorist attack. Publicopposition to LNG-related facilities and new trading relationships in an increasingly integratedglobal gas market will also bear upon the expansion of the industry.", "As the practical challenges to LNG import expansion are addressed, the policy discussionturns to the long-term implications of increased LNG imports in the nation's energy supply. Intentionally or not, the United States may be starting down a path of dependency on LNG importssimilar to its current dependency on foreign oil. Such a dependency would represent a major shiftin the nation's energy policy, and may have far-reaching economic impact. Because U.S. naturalgas markets are regional, major consuming areas such as California and the Northeast might beparticularly affected.", "Some energy analysts believe that U.S. dependency on imported LNG is inevitable; the onlyuncertainty is how quickly it will occur. Others disagree, promoting instead familiar alternativessuch as greater domestic gas production, switching to oil or other energy sources, and conservation. Recent measures before Congress affect LNG imports by providing incentives for domestic gasproduction and for new LNG terminal construction. If Congress considers the relative merits of LNGand other energy supply alternatives, three overarching policy questions may emerge.", "Is expanding LNG imports the best option for meeting long-term natural gasdemand in the United States?", "What future role, if any, should the federal government play in facilitating theongoing development of LNG infrastructure in the United States and abroad?", "How might Congress mitigate the risks of the global LNG trade within thecontext of national energy policy?", "The answers to these questions may flow from enhanced understanding of the infrastructure andmarket structure issues discussed in this report. With incomplete information and limited policyanalysis, LNG imports may look unrealistically attractive to some, but unreasonably risky to others. The reality probably lies somewhere in between.
