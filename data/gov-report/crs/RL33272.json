If a state has determined that probable liability exists at the time a claim for reimbursement is filed, it generally must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of third-party liability (referred to as \"cost avoidance\"). If probable liability has not been established or the third party is not available to pay the individual's medical expenses, the state must pay the claim and then attempt to recover the amount paid (referred to as \"pay and chase\").", "States are generally required to cost avoid claims unless they have an approved waiver that allows them to use the pay-and-chase method. However, there are two statutory exceptions to this rule. In the case of prenatal and preventive pediatric care, states are required to use pay and chase. In the case of a Medicaid beneficiary whose parent provides medical support (e.g., health insurance coverage via an employer) as part of a child support order being enforced by the state, the state must use pay and chase if a provider has not been paid under the medical support arrangement within 30 days.", "In some cases, a Medicaid beneficiary may be required to reimburse the state for Medicaid expenses paid on his or her behalf. To facilitate such reimbursement, the state may place a lien on the Medicaid beneficiary's property. With certain exceptions, federal law generally prohibits states from imposing Medicaid liens on the property of living beneficiaries. In contrast, federal law permits Medicaid liens on the estates of deceased beneficiaries in a wider variety of situations.", "Proposal. The President's budget seeks three legislative changes. The first would require providers to bill third parties for prenatal and preventive pediatric care services and wait at least 90 days before billing Medicaid. The second would require providers to bill third parties in the case of medical support provided via a child support order and wait at least 90 days before billing Medicaid. The third would explicitly permit states to use liens against liability settlements to recover Medicaid amounts paid on behalf of beneficiaries.

Since case management is not an administrative activity, the federal government matches payments for such services at the rate applicable to Medicaid benefits.

Under Medicaid, drug manufacturers that wish to have their drugs available for Medicaid enrollees are required to enter into rebate agreements with the Secretary of HHS, on behalf of the states. Under the agreements, pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide state Medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. The formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that Medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs. Rebate calculations depend on the type of drug. For single source and innovator multiple source drugs, basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price (AMP) for a drug (the average price paid by wholesalers) to the \"best price,\" which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler, retailer, nonprofit, or public entity. The basic rebate is the greater of 15.1% of the AMP or the difference between the AMP and the best price. Additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of a given manufacturer's single source and innovator multiple source drugs rise faster than inflation. For non-innovator multiple source drugs, basic rebates are equal to 11% of the AMP.", "Proposal. The President's budget seeks legislation to eliminate the \"best price\" from the rebate formula for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, changing the best price-based formula to a flat rebate.

The upper limit that applies to brand-name and other drugs is equal to the acquisition cost as estimated by the states. Recently, the President signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA 2005) which will change the FUL formula for multiple source drugs.

Federal statute allows state Medicaid programs to establish formularies, or lists of preferred pharmaceuticals to be made available to Medicaid beneficiaries. When health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others, the list is referred to as a \"closed formulary.\" Medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the private market for insurance because of two requirements: (1) states are required to provide any non-formulary drug (with the exception of drugs in specific categories, described below) that is specifically requested and approved through a prior authorization process, and (2) states are required to cover all drugs offered by manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the Secretary of HHS.", "States, on the other hand, are permitted to exclude certain categories of drug products from Medicaid coverage.

Because of the overlap in eligible populations, states often undertake administrative activities that benefit more than one program. Under the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cash welfare program, AFDC and Medicaid program eligibility were linked, and many AFDC families also qualified for food stamps. As a result, states often collected necessary information for all three programs during a single eligibility interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full amount of the cost to AFDC as a matter of convenience. Since the federal government reimbursed states for 50% of administrative expenditures for all three programs, total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs' common administrative costs.", "When Congress replaced AFDC with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program in 1996, the 50% federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and Medicaid eligibility was severed. Later, HHS clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for TANF, Medicaid, and food stamps based on the relative benefits derived by each program. A remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that TANF block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre-1996 federal welfare spending, including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common administrative costs. As a result, TANF block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to Medicaid and food stamps were excluded from block grant calculations. To compensate, Congress has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by a flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative costs attributable to food stamps that are included in each state's TANF block grant (the annual reductions total nearly $200 million). Congress has not reduced federal reimbursement for Medicaid administrative costs in a similar manner.", "Proposal.

However, if the taxes returned to a provider are less than 6% of the provider's revenues (a ceiling created in regulation by HHS), the prohibition on guaranteeing the return of tax funds is not violated. As a result, a state could impose a provider tax of 6% of revenues, return those revenues to the provider in the form of a Medicaid \"payment,\" and receive a federal match for those amounts.

Aggregate Medicaid payments to specific groups of institutional providers (e.g., hospitals and nursing facilities) cannot exceed a reasonable estimate of what would have been paid under Medicare payment principles. This is called the Medicaid upper payment limit (UPL) rule. In many states, Medicare payment rates for hospital and nursing home care are higher than corresponding Medicaid payment rates. The UPL based on Medicare payment principles has enabled some states to draw down additional federal dollars that exceed what they would have received based on Medicaid payment rates. These additional funds are paid to government providers which are sometimes required by states to transfer all or a portion of the extra payments received (i.e., some or all of the difference between the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates) back to the state through an intergovernmental transfer (IGT). Instead of financing more or improved Medicaid services, in some cases states have used the additional federal dollars for non-health services, or to make up part of the state share of Medicaid costs to draw down another round of federal dollars.", "During 2000-2002, Congress and the Clinton and Bush Administrations revised UPL rules by changing permissible accounting methods used to claim federal matching payments. These changes significantly reduced the excess federal dollars states received under approved UPL plans that involved IGTs. However, these reforms did not eliminate all such excess payments because no changes were made to the Medicaid UPL standard which remains tied to the Medicare payment rate, nor to federal statute or regulations governing IGTs. Administration officials have taken additional steps to curb what they have identified as improper state financing mechanisms, especially certain intergovernmental transfers. In late 2003, CMS began requesting detailed information regarding the sources of the state share of Medicaid costs from states applying for Medicaid waivers and submitting Medicaid state plan amendments. In some cases, these proposals were modified to minimize the use of improper IGTs (i.e., IGTs that use \"recycling mechanisms\" under which payments to providers are returned to the state, artificially inflating the federal matching rate).", "Proposal.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established SCHIP. In general, this program allows states to cover targeted low-income children with no health insurance in families with income that is above Medicaid eligibility levels. States may choose among three benefit options when designing their SCHIP programs. They may enroll targeted low-income children in Medicaid, create a separate state program, or devise a combination of both approaches. All states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have SCHIP programs. Nearly $40 billion has been appropriated for SCHIP for FY1998-FY2007. The authorized appropriation for FY2007 is $5.0 billion. Annual allotments among the states are determined by a formula that is based on a combination of the number of low-income children, and low-income uninsured children in the state, and includes a cost factor that represents the average health service industry wages in the state compared to the national average.", "States have three years to spend each annual allotment (e.g., states have until the end of FY2007 to spend their FY2005 allotments). At the end of the applicable three-year period, unspent funds are reallocated among states based on year-specific rules. In the early years of the SCHIP, both states that did and did not fully exhaust their original allotments received unspent funds. For more recent years, only those states that fully exhaust their original allotments receive unspent funds. Some states have experienced shortfalls in SCHIP funds, meaning at the end of a given fiscal year, they have spent all federal SCHIP funds available to them at that point in time, including original allotments and reallocations of unspent funds from other states.", "Proposal.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-191 ) established a number of rules for employer-based health insurance plans to improve access to and portability of plans for people enrolled or enrolling into those plans. One of those provisions requires employer-based health plans to allow for new enrollment into the plan during periods outside of the typical annual open enrollment period for certain special reasons. Examples of those reasons include when an eligible employee (or their dependent) exhausts COBRA continuation coverage, or when an employee gains a new dependent through birth or adoption. Another HIPAA provision limits the ability of private health insurance plans to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions during what are known as \"pre-existing condition exclusion periods.\" The allowable length of such pre-existing condition exclusion periods depends on the amount of time the new enrollee had been covered by prior \"creditable\" health insurance coverage. A beneficiary can prove they have had prior creditable coverage by providing certificates issued by insurers at the end of each year. Because HIPAA was created in law before SCHIP was established, SCHIP was not included on the list of types of health insurance that can be considered as prior creditable coverage.", "Proposal. The President's budget seeks two legislative changes relating to HIPAA. The first would define a determination of Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility as a qualifying event allowing for a special enrollment period into employer-based health insurance plans. This provision is intended to improve Medicaid and SCHIP programs' ability to coordinate coverage with private employer-offered coverage. The second proposal would require SCHIP programs to issue certificates of creditable coverage. This provision is intended to improve the reach of HIPAA's portability provisions by recognizing SCHIP coverage as prior creditable coverage. Both of these interpretations have previously been promulgated in a final regulation implementing HIPAA's portability for group health plan provisions.

There have been ongoing concerns about take-up rates among children who meet eligibility standards but are not covered by these two programs. Estimates of the number of children eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP have varied considerably over time. By 2002, national survey data showed that 2.8 million children under age 19 were uninsured but eligible for SCHIP, and an additional 3.4 million were uninsured but eligible for Medicaid.", "Outreach can be financed under the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Under Medicaid, the federal matching rate for administrative expenses which include outreach activities is set at 50% for all states. There is a limit on federal spending for SCHIP administrative expenses, which also include outreach. For federal matching purposes, a 10% cap applies to state administrative expenses. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual SCHIP allotment to cover benefits, as opposed to 10% of a state's total annual allotment.", "Proposal. The Cover the Kids outreach program would provide annual grants to states, working with schools and community organizations to enroll eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP.
