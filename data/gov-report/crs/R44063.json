That is about $22 billion (31%) more than was provided in FY2015. The budget request for DOT reflected the Administration's call for significant increases in funding for highway, transit, and rail programs. Neither the surface transportation reauthorization legislation (H.R. 22) that the House and Senate are currently negotiating nor the DOT appropriations bill as passed by the House or reported out by the Senate Committee on Appropriations (H.R. 2577) would increase transportation funding on the scale requested by the Administration.", "The annual appropriations for DOT are combined with those for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) appropriations bill.

The House-passed version of H.R. 2577 would provide $70.6 billion for DOT, $1 billion less than DOT received in FY2015 (after rescissions are subtracted from the FY2015 total, the difference is reduced to $646 million) and $23 billion less than the Administration request.", "The House-passed bill cuts funding for Amtrak by $242 million (17%) from its FY2015 level, to $1.148 billion, less than half the amount requested by the Administration. The House Appropriations Committee marked up the bill one day after an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia, which raised the profile of the cuts to Amtrak funding. The House-passed bill also includes significant cuts to the TIGER discretionary grant program and the transit New Starts program. For TIGER, the bill would provide $100 million, an 80% reduction from the $500 million provided in FY2015 and $1.15 billion below the Administration request. For New Starts, it would provide $1.9 billion, a 9% reduction from the $2.1 billion provided in FY2015 and $1.3 billion below the Administration request. These three programs account for most of the bill's cut in transportation funding from the FY2015 level.", "The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a version of H.R. 2577 providing $71.3 billion for DOT, a reduction of $368 million from the FY2015 level (after rescissions are subtracted from the FY2015 total, the difference is reduced to $17 million) and $22 billion less than the Administration request. The committee recommended funding the TIGER grant program and Amtrak at their FY2015 levels.

Congress transferred more than $62 billion, mostly from the general fund of the Treasury, to the Highway Trust Fund during the period FY2008-FY2015 to keep the trust fund solvent. ", "One reason for the shortfall in the fund is that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993. The tax is a fixed amount assessed per gallon of fuel sold, not a percentage of the cost of the fuel sold: whether a gallon of gas costs $1 or $4, the highway trust fund receives 18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel. Meanwhile, the value of the gas tax has been diminished by inflation (which has reduced the purchasing power of the revenue raised by the tax) and increasing automobile fuel efficiency (which reduces growth in gas sales as more efficient vehicles are able to travel farther on a gallon of fuel). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has forecast that gasoline consumption will be relatively flat through 2024, as continued increases in the fuel efficiency of the U.S. passenger fleet are projected to offset increases in the number of miles driven.

Thus a driver was able to work the maximum permitted time per day (14 hours) and take the 34-hour restart after five days, and then, after a rest period of as little as one night and two daytime periods, work 14 hours a day for another five consecutive days. FMCSA asserted that this schedule allowed a driver to work up to 82 hours over a seven-day period, which it judged to be insufficient to prevent the driver being fatigued while driving.", "By limiting the use of the 34-hour restart to once in a seven-day (168-hour) period, FMCSA sought to limit drivers to a maximum of 70 hours of work in any seven-day span. And by requiring that the 34-hour restart period cover two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods, the current rule allows drivers to get more sleep during the 1 a.m.-5 a.m. period, when studies indicate that sleep is most restorative (compared to sleeping during other times of the day).", "The provision in Section 132 of the House bill prohibits enforcement of the new requirement, returning the requirement to what it was prior to June 2013, unless the study required by Section 133 of Division K of P.L. 113-235 (the FY2015 THUD act) finds that commercial drivers operating under the new restart provisions showed \"statistically significant improvement in all outcomes related to safety, operator fatigue, driver health and longevity, and work schedules.\" This is slightly different than the original standard in P.L. 113-235 , which looked for whether the study showed a \"greater net benefit for the operational, safety, health and fatigue impacts of the restart provisions.\" The provision in the Senate-reported bill (\u00a7134) is similar to this original standard, looking for \"statistically significant net safety benefits.\" FMCSA published a cost-benefit analysis in the final rule that implemented the change, which found that the change was cost-beneficial, but critics of the change said that the impacts were greater than FMCSA had estimated."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
