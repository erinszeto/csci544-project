As directed by Congress, there are now seven appropriations accounts rather than the previous three. In addition, a change in how NASA accounts for overhead expenses complicates comparisons between FY2009 and previous years. In the new system, overhead costs formerly included in program budgets are instead budgeted in the Cross-Agency Support account. This change reduces the stated cost of most programs without affecting actual program content. As a result, amounts expressed in the new system are not directly comparable with amounts expressed in the previous system.

The Vision included returning the space shuttle to flight status (already accomplished) then retiring it by 2010; completing the International Space Station (ISS), but discontinuing U.S. use of it by 2017; returning humans to the moon by 2020; and then sending humans to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" President Bush did not propose significantly increased funding for NASA to accomplish the Vision. Instead, most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other NASA activities. Moreover, subsequent NASA funding overall was less than projected at the time of the Vision announcement. The funding requirements of the Vision thus constrain other NASA programs. It is not yet clear whether or how President Obama will seek to modify the Vision.", "The requested $4.442 billion for Science in FY2009 was a 6% decrease. Within this total, increases for Earth Science and Planetary Science would be offset by decreases for Heliophysics and Astrophysics. The request for Earth Science would fund two new missions recommended by the National Research Council, while the request for Planetary Science would initiate a new program in lunar robotic science. The decrease for Heliophysics reflected a transfer of the Deep Space and Near Earth Networks to the Space Operations account and corresponded to almost the entire decrease in the Science account overall. In Astrophysics, two programs have been of particular congressional interest: the NASA/Department of Energy Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) and the Space Interferometer mission (SIM). The request included funds for JDEM, as directed by Congress in the FY2008 explanatory statement, but not for SIM. NASA explained that a new exoplanet exploration initiative could include a smaller, medium-class version of SIM, as recommended by the FY2008 Senate report ( S.Rept. 110-124 ).

Within this amount, Constellation Systems would receive $3.048 billion, a 23% increase, while Advanced Capabilities would receive $452.0 million, a 33% decrease. Constellation Systems is responsible for development of the Orion crew vehicle and Ares\u00a0I launch vehicle, successors to the space shuttle. The proposed 23% increase was consistent with NASA's previous projections as the program moves toward a planned initial operating capability for Orion and Ares I (i.e., a first crewed flight) in March 2015. NASA describes the current level of budget reserves within Constellation Systems as \"minimal\" and is seeking to compensate for it through \"rigorous risk management.\" The FY2009 request for Constellation Systems also restored full funding for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS), which seeks to help private-sector companies develop space transportation systems that could service the ISS after the shuttle is retired. The House committee recommended $3.506 billion, including an increase of $25.0 million for research on the space station and a decrease of $20.0 million for COTS. The Senate committee recommended $3.530 billion, including an increase of $30.0 million to accelerate development of the Ares V heavy lift rocket. The final appropriation was $3.505 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided an additional $400 million to accelerate the availability of Orion and Ares I.", "The FY2009 request for Space Operations, which funds the space shuttle, the ISS, and the Space and Flight Support program, was $5.775 billion. A requested decrease of $285.0 million for the space shuttle was largely offset by a requested increase of $247.0 million for the ISS. Both changes were consistent with NASA's previous projections: they reflected the trend toward the shuttle program's completion in 2010 and the planned construction schedule of the ISS. A requested increase for Space and Flight Support resulted mostly from transferring the Deep Space and Near Earth Networks from the Science account. The gap between the end of shuttle flights in 2010 and the expected availability of Orion and Ares I in 2015 raises several issues. Some analysts are concerned that placing a fixed termination date on the shuttle may create schedule pressure similar to that identified as a contributing factor in the Columbia disaster. Some question whether the United States should be dependent on Russia to launch U.S. astronauts to the ISS during the gap period. A major concern is how NASA will retain its skilled workforce during the transition from shuttle to Orion, especially if Orion's schedule slips and the gap lengthens. The House committee recommended $5.765 billion for Space Operations, including $10.0 million less than the request for Space and Flight Support, and directed NASA to consider two final shuttle logistics flights to the ISS, currently manifested as \"contingency\" flights, as baseline flights.

In FY2006, responsibility for funding the costs of three icebreakers that support scientific research in the polar regions was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the NSF. While the NSF does not own the ships, it is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and staffing of the vessels. Since 2004, back-up icebreaking support has been needed because of maintenance problems with the polar icebreakers and with the heavy ice conditions in certain polar regions. It was determined that there is still a need for back-up icebreaking services, and as a result, the FY2009 request included an additional $9.0 million for contracting of back-up vessels.", "The FY2009 appropriation for the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) was $845.3 million, $119.7 million (16.5%) above the FY2008 level. The EHR portfolio is focused on, among other things, increasing the technological literacy of all citizens, preparing the next generation of science, engineering, and mathematics professionals, and closing the achievement gap in all scientific fields.

In FY2009, tighter standards and requirements for receiving funding in MREFC were instituted. Included in the more stringent procedures was the implementation of a \"no cost overrun\" policy for major projects. The cost estimates for projects developed at the preliminary design phase must include adequate contingencies. In the absence of such contingencies, any cost increases would result in reduction in scope for the project.
