Temporary closure of NPS units (part of a federal government-wideshutdown during the budget debates of late 1995 and early 1996) helped galvanizepublic support for expanding NPS funding. Congress heeded the expressed desireof the public to more adequately care for the National Parks System and funding hasincreased annually since FY1996. Once again the Administration requestedsubstantial increases in spending for Park Service - managed programs in its FY2001budget request.", "The Administration's FY2001 request for the NPS was $2.04 billion, to operate and protect parks and preserve their natural and cultural (historic) resources.

TheHouse-passed bill proposed a total FY2001 appropriation for the NPS of $1.81billion, $234 million less than the Administration's request, or $4.6 million morethan FY2000 enacted. The Senate-passed bill also proposed $1.81 billion, up $8.7million from FY2000 enacted and $230 million below the budget request.

It covers resource protection, visitor services and major park programs. The $25.4million proposed increase emphasized park operating needs and resourcemanagement. This increase included $24 million to address specific needs at 77 parksystem units. These funds would be directed to parks experiencing severe threats tonatural and cultural resources, with new responsibilities, and with high priorityfacility operation and maintenance needs. The House agreed with theAdministration's request with respect to specific needs; however, the Senate-passedbill proposed an increase above base operations of $25.5 million, or $1.5 millionmore than the budget request.

The Park System has a formidable maintenance burden, with an infrastructure that includesthousands of miles of roads and thousands of permanent structures (many of thesehistoric), bridges, tunnels, employee housing units, water and waste systems, etc . Itis argued that park assets should all be maintained at an operational level that ensurescontinued serviceability and use by the public. The NPS has valued its assets at over$35 billion, but without adequate care and maintenance they are subject todeterioration. Mounting concerns about the build-up of a multibillion dollar backlogof unmet maintenance needs in the first half of the last decade prompted Congressto seek new funding sources and to attack the maintenance backlog. In response tocongressional appropriation leaders, the FY2000 budget proposal highlighted anInterior Department-wide campaign to prioritize maintenance over a five year period. Proposed funding for Construction and Major Maintenance programs for FY2001was $180 million, with an emphasis on projects that address the most critical healthand safety needs of parks, a key goal of the Interior Department's Safe Visits toPublic Lands program. The proposed funding represents a $46.2 million decreasecompared to FY2000. This decrease is in a area that has received special priority inrecent years, however, there was more than $450 million for maintenance in theOperations component of the NPS request, and the anticipation of revenues ofapproximately $148 million in FY2001 from the Congressionally authorizedRecreational Fee Demonstration Program (see below) which is to be used to reducethe Agency's backlog of health and safety deficiencies as well as resource protectionand programs in existing park facilities. In addition, the Congress has historicallyincreased construction appropriations as member projects have been added near theend of the appropriations process. ", "In hearings before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations for the Department of Interior and Related Agencies (March 29, 2000) members warned theNational Park Service Director not to \"lowball\" maintenance needs requests with theexpectation that \"Fee-Demo\" revenues will make up the shortfall. The membersreiterated their desire that Fee-Demo monies be used to supplement, not replace,appropriated maintenance monies so that major reductions in the backlog could beaccomplished. Also at issue is the size of the current NPS maintenance backlog. ParkService officials agreed to provide the Subcommittee with an updated estimate withintwo weeks of the Hearing. The Park Service subsequently provided theSubcommittee with a current NPS maintenance backlog figure of $4.3 billion. Theconference agreement requires the NPS to report (by April 2001) on how and whenit will provide a park-by-park comprehensive listing, with cost estimates, of deferredmaintenance affecting all facilities in the NPS.", "The House-passed bill proposed $141 million for Construction and major maintenance, $39 million less than the Administration's $180 million request, or $80million less than FY2000 enacted.

As expected, the conference agreementgreatly expanded the NPS Construction account as member \"earmarks\" were added. The agreement provided $242.2 million or $20.9 million above FY2000 enacted. Of local interest, $2.2 million to rehabilitate Glen Echo (MD) park facilities wasprovided. ", "Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (Fee-Demo). The NPS coordinated Fee-Demo program,being tested by the NPS and three other federal land management agencies, began inFY1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees, with most of the addedfees being retained by the unit where the money is collected, e.g. 80% of Fee-Demogoes back to the collecting unit and 20% goes to the agency. Previously all Park feerevenue went to the Treasury Department general fund. Under the existing programeach agency is allowed to test up to 100 fee projects each year. It was hoped that theadditional fees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive inpursuing \"self-financing\" for operating and maintaining their units. The programparticipants, in addition to the Park Service, include: BLM, FWS, and the ForestService. Supporters of a federal system of recreation lakes would also like the Corpsof Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation included. The Interior Departmentagencies and the Forest Service combined, collected $88 million in fees in FY1996,which are projected to increase to $185.65 million in FY2001. In FY2001 the ParkService is projected to bring in the most fee money by far, $148.4 million. TheAdministration again (the same request was made the last two years) asked Congressto make the Fee-Demo program permanent for the four federal land managementagencies. The program is authorized through FY2002 and the Administration wantedto lock it in place this year. However, the conference managers once again decidedto defer action on \"fee-demo\" until perceived problems in the program could befixed, but did extend the program for one additional year. In a related development\"interest groups\" are reportedly circulating draft legislation that would extend FeeDemo through September 30, 2004, while substantially altering and expanding theprogram.", "Urban Park and Recreation Recovery (UPARR). This cost-sharing Park Service managed programreceived a FY2000 appropriation of $2 million, the first new funding in five years. Prior to FY1994, appropriations were about $5 million annually.

An amendment to restore the requested $4 million for theUPARR program was agreed to by voice vote during House floor action and theSenate voted $1.5 million. These funds were included as a part of a major line item,National Recreation and Preservation, instead of as previously as a free-standingprogram.

In this activity, major increases were proposed for hydrologic networksand for analysis of real-time hazards and of Interior science priorities. Thoseincreases were sought to enhance USGS ability to provide streamflow data for floodforecasting and information for flood hazard mitigation by adding streamgages,upgrading instruments, and adding telemetry. Scientific support for each of theInterior bureaus also would have been augmented. Modest increases were requestedto facilitate data sharing in support of water information delivery for decision supportand resources management.

", "In the Biological Research activity, the Administration requested $158.78 million - an increase of $21.89 million above the FY2000 enacted level of $136.90million. A sizable portion of that increase would have been applied to biologicalresearch and monitoring for Interior science priorities in support of each of theDepartment's bureaus. An increase for fish and wildlife disease was sought toexpand research on the West Nile encephalitis virus. A large increase was intendedto fund matching grants and other cooperative activities for States, localcommunities, academic institutions, and other user groups to integrate and overlay more easily spatial and biological data sets (e.g., invasive species distributions) withdata from the holdings of the USGS and other agencies.

ThatSenate-approved amount included increases of $8.0 million for Science Centers and$700,000 for the Cooperative Research Units. The increase for the Science Centerswas proposed in response to concerns expressed that insufficient base funding haderoded the centers' core capabilities and reduced their ability to address importantlong-term strategic research. With the additional amount provided for core sciencesupport, those centers would begin to stabilize their bases of operations.

This pilotbegan in 1998 with oil lease bids offered in Wyoming and is expected to take severalyears to complete. The House supported the Committee amendment that wouldallow the MMS to use a portion of its revenues to administer the RIK pilot programnow underway. However, a floor amendment limited the use of MMS revenues topay for transportation to wholesale market centers and for processing rather than theCommittee recommendation to pay for gathering and any contractor costs as well.This would allow MMS to receive greater value for its RIK product at the marketcenter.

During FY1996, as the 104th Congress revisited many regulatory programs, the OCS moratorium onleasing activity was debated in some depth but was extended in several areas. Theextension was continued through FY1999. It was supported by the House and theSenate for FY2000, and was continued in the FY2000 appropriations law. In theFY2001 spending bill, the moratoria is supported by the House and the Senate. Inprevious appropriations since the early 1980s, the moratoria had been approvedannually, without extensive discussion. Each year, Congress banned the expenditureof appropriated funds for any leasing activity in environmentally sensitive areas ofthe OCS. In 1990, President Bush issued a directive which parallels the moratoria,essentially banning OCS leasing activity in places other than the Texas, Louisiana,and Alabama offshore. The executive branch ban remains in effect. The moratoriaapply only to environmentally sensitive areas.

Greater tribal control over federal Indian programs has been the goal of Indian policy since the 1970s. Inthe BIA this policy has taken three forms: tribal contracting to run individual BIAprograms under the Indian Self-Determination Act ( P.L. 93-638 , as amended); tribal compacting with the BIA to manage all or most of a tribe's BIA programs, under theSelf-Governance program ( P.L. 103-413 ); and shifting programs into a portion of theBIA budget called Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA), in which tribes have moreinfluence in BIA budget planning and within which each tribe has authority toreprogram all its TPA funds.

Issues raised by contract support costs include theconsistent shortfall in contract support cost appropriations, tribes' claim ofentitlement to full support cost funding, identity of programs included in tribes'funding base, and rate-setting methods. A 1997 court decision ( Ramah NavajoChapter v.

Congress forbade use ofFY1994-FY2000 BIA funds to pay these costs, so the $82 million was paid from thefederal Judgment Fund, but the BIA and IHS may be required to reimburse the Fund.

TheHouse restored the moratorium for FY2001, but the Senate and the conferencecommittee again dropped the moratorium.", "Reorganization. The BIA has been under pressure from tribes, the administration, and Congress to reorganize, butproposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement. Under theClinton Administration's National Performance Review Reinventing Governmentinitiative, the BIA had planned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the\"tribal shares\" process (in which tribes and the BIA determine, first, which BIAfunctions are inherently federal and which are available for tribal management, and,second, what each tribe's share of funds is for the latter functions), but the BIA hasindicated that the Interior solicitor has advised against such a procedure. Congress,through appropriations committee reports, pressed the BIA to develop reorganizationand consolidation plans. In response the BIA has reduced the number of both itsagencies and employees. Congress also approved the BIA's commissioning of a1999 study of BIA administration and management by the National Academy ofPublic Administration (NAPA), entitled A Study of Management and Administration:The Bureau of Indian Affairs . The study concluded that the AssistantSecretary--Indian Affairs lacked necessary staff support and that the BIA neededimprovements in planning, budgeting, human resources management, andinformation resource management. For FY2000, Congress directed the Secretary ofthe Interior to reorganize the BIA based on the NAPA recommendations andprovided $5.2 million for this purpose. For FY2001, the Administration requested$9.2 million for continued implementation of the NAPA recommendations; theHouse agreed to this sum, as did the Senate and the conference committee.", "Funding Distribution. The issue of the equitable distribution of BIA funding--often referred to as \"means-testing\"--has twoaspects, one relating to how funds are distributed, the other relating to whether atribe's other financial resources are taken into account. First, much if not most BIAfunding, even while serving tribal needs, is not required to be distributed on anational per capita or other formula basis. Second, tribes' own non-BIA resources,especially business revenues, are not always required to be taken into account. A1998 GAO study of TPA distribution found that two-thirds of FY1998 TPA fundswere distributed based on historical levels and one-third was distributed based onformulas, that TPA distribution per capita varied widely across BIA areas, and thattribal governments' reporting of their revenues were inconsistent in including orexcluding non-federal revenues.", "Supporters of TPA funding redistribution based on \"means-testing\" of tribes claim that BIA funding is inequitably distributed, that poorer tribes do not receiveadequate funding, that tribal TPA funds received per capita do not correspond withindicators of tribal need, that only 30 percent of TPA funding is based on formulas,and that some rich tribes got more TPA funds in FY1998 than tribes with no outsiderevenues. Opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty, that BIA fundingis insufficient to meet tribal needs, and that means-testing TPA funding wouldpenalize tribes who still have severe needs, would violate the federal trustresponsibility to tribes, and would be unfair since it is not required of state or localgovernments receiving federal assistance.", "Congress debated several proposals for reallocating TPA funding during its consideration of the FY1998-FY2001 appropriation bills. For FY1998-FY1999,Congress authorized a tribal-federal workgroup on TPA allocations and tribal needsassessment, required that each tribe receive a certain minimum amount of funding,and directed the BIA to develop TPA reallocation proposals. The BIA/tribalworkgroup's report, in July 1999, concluded that variation in tribes' circumstancesmade formula distribution problematic; that TPA funding resulted from history,geography, and policies; that current funding did not meet identified needs; and thatmeasures of tribal need and revenue were not fully available. The workgrouprecommended that base TPA funding should not be redistributed. For FY2000,Congress authorized (but did not direct) the Secretary of the Interior to redistributeTPA funds to alleviate tribal funding inequities-without reducing any tribe's TPAshare more than 10%, except in certain situations-and directed the BIA to distributefunds to its two post-secondary institutions based on a formula. The House retainedthese provisions for FY2001, while the Senate kept only the post-secondaryeducation provision. The conference committee retained both of these provisions. In addition, the Senate approved a new provision prohibiting Alaska Native tribeswith fewer than 25 members from receiving TPA funds in FY2001; the funds wouldbe transferred to each tribe's regional Native non-profit corporation. The conferencecommittee also approved this provision.", "Trust Asset Management. The BIA has, historically, mismanaged Indian trust funds and trust assets. Reform of trustfund management is now the responsibility of the Office of the Special Trustee forAmerican Indians (see below). The BIA and the Office of Special Trustee aretogether implementing the Secretary of the Interior's High Level ImplementationPlan for the Trust Management Improvement Project. The project includesimprovements in trust asset systems, policies, and procedures, reduction of backlogs,and maintenance of the improved system. Trust asset management includes realestate services, processing of transaction (sales, leases, etc.), surveys, appraisals,probate functions, land title records, and other functions. The BIA has contractedwith a private developer for a new trust asset and accounting management system(TAAMS). In the FY2000 Interior appropriations bill, Congress prohibited theSecretary from deploying TAAMS, except at a test site, until the Secretary certifiesthat the system meets contract requirements and users' needs. The test site is theBIA's Billings region. Neither the House, the Senate, nor the conference committeeincluded the TAAMS prohibition in the FY2001 Interior appropriations bill.", "Law Enforcement. Because of reports of greatly increased crime rates and inadequate law enforcement in Indian country,the Administration proposed for FY1999 an initiative on law enforcement in Indiancountry. Under the initiative, funds for Indian country would flow through both theBIA and the Department of Justice. The funds would provide additional law officers,police facilities and equipment, and jails and detention centers. BIA funding goeschiefly to ongoing operation and improvement of reservation law enforcementfunctions, while the Justice funds go to one-time improvement grants under its COPSprogram and to construction of detention facilities.", "School Construction. The BIA funds or operates 185 elementary and secondary schools with over 2,000 educationfacilities. Many school facilities are old and dilapidated, with health and safetydeficiencies. The BIA estimates the backlog in education facility repairs is $802million. Education construction funding was historically low and Congress had notaccepted various proposals for alternate funding mechanisms. For FY2000, theAdministration proposed, and Congress funded, a 74% increase in education facilityconstruction (before internal transfers). For FY2001, the Administration alsoproposes another large increase in education construction funding. Within theFY2001 BIA education construction budget is a proposed school construction bondinitiative, where $30 million of the proposed appropriations would help tribesparticipate in the president's school construction modernization initiative. Under thisinitiative, tribal bonds can be issued to help meet the large backlog in schoolconstruction. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding forthe school bonding initiative until enactment of tax credit provisions needed to givetribes the authority to issue such bonds. The Senate Appropriations Committee didnot discuss the tribal bonding initiative, but the Senate more than doubled BIAeducation construction funding, and the conference committee recommended aneven higher figure. The conference committee also recommended funding of $7million for a new tribal school construction demonstration project, under which atribe and the BIA would pay 50% of the cost of replacing the tribe'stribally-controlled school.", "Other Issues. A number of additional Indian issues have arisen in congressional consideration of recent Interiorappropriations bills and may be proposed this year. Among the major issues havebeen state taxation of retail sales in Indian country to non-members, tribal sovereignimmunity from suit, and regulations regarding state-tribal gaming compacts. Congress has in past years defeated proposals to restrict the taking of land into trustfor Indian tribes unless the tribe agreed to state taxes, and to waive tribal sovereignimmunity if the tribe accepted TPA funds. Controversial Indian gaming regulations- proposed by the Secretary in 1998, for considering and approving gaming compactswhere states had invoked immunity from tribal suit over compact negotiations - weredelayed by Congress until the second half of FY1999. When the regulations werethen promulgated, in April 1999, they were immediately challenged in court byseveral states. Congress considered prohibiting FY2000 funds to implement theregulations, but dropped the provision when the Interior Secretary assured Congressthat he would not implement the regulations until federal courts ruled on theirlegality. For FY2001,the House defeated a proposed amendment that would haveprohibited implementation of the regulations until final adjudication of their legality,but the Senate approved a prohibition on funding for publication of proceduresnecessary to implement the regulations.

On June 11, 1996, a class-action suit was filed in federal court against thefederal government on behalf of all IIM account owners. The suit sought anaccounting of the IIM funds, establishment of adequate management systems, andfull restitution of any money lost from the IIM accounts. The case was certified asa class action in February 1997.

The federal departmentsapologized and promised to meet the judge's concerns. The part of the IIM suitdealing with the failures of the trust-fund system went to trial in June 1999 in theU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the judge on December 21,1999, found that the government mismanaged the IIM accounts and ordered that thesystem be fixed and that the government provide quarterly reports on systemimprovements. The Department of Justice appealed this ruling in January 2000. Trial on the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs, previously expected to begin in2000, is not currently scheduled. The conference committee provided $16.9 millionin emergency supplemental appropriations to address breaches of trust identified inthe 1999 decision, to do further trial preparation, and to begin IIM accounting for thetrial; the conference report directs DOI to develop a sampling methodology for IIMaccounting but requires submission of the plan to Congress prior to implementation.", "In April 1997 the OST submitted its Strategic Plan for improving the management of Indian trust funds and trust assets.

While considering FY1998 Interior appropriations, Congressnoted departmental and some tribal opposition to the Strategic Plan, especially to theproposed new agency. Congress directed the OST not to implement the proposednew agency but to pursue trust funds systems improvements and OST responsibilitiesrelating to the settlement of financial claims made by tribal and individualbeneficiaries, before Congress and in court, because of BIA trust-fundsmismanagement. In August 1997 the Secretary of the Interior agreed to implementaspects of the Strategic Plan dealing with trust management systems, data cleanup,and trust asset processing backlogs, and in July 1998 he issued a \"High-LevelImplementation Plan\" for this Trust Management Improvement Project.

Pursuant to the 1974 act, lands were partitioned betweenthe two tribes. Members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribe's land were tobe relocated. ONHIR classifies families as relocated when they occupy theirreplacement home. Most relocatees are Navajo. A large majority of the estimated3,477 Navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the Hopi have alreadyrelocated under the Act, but the House Appropriations Committee estimates that 410families (almost all Navajo) have yet to complete relocation, including about 71Navajo families still on Hopi partitioned land (some of whom refuse to relocate). The remaining 339 families are not on Hopi partitioned land but are in various stagesof acquiring replacement housing.", "Negotiations had gone forward among the two tribes, the Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land, and the federal government, especially regarding Hopi Tribeclaims against the United States.

Attached to the settlementagreement was a separate accommodation agreement between the Hopi Tribe and theNavajo families, which provided for 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopipartitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 ( P.L.104-301 ) approved the settlement agreement between the United States and the HopiTribe. Not all issues have been resolved by these agreements, however, andopposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the Navajofamilies. Navajo families with homesites on Hopi partitioned land faced a March 31,1997, deadline for signing the leases (accommodation agreements). According toONHIR, 70 of the 73 families on Hopi-partitioned land had signed accommodationagreements by the end of September 1999.", "The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases. Like the FY1997-FY2000 Interior appropriations acts, the FY2001Interior appropriations bill proposed by the President contained a proviso forbiddingONHIR from evicting any Navajo family from Hopi partitioned lands unless areplacement home is provided. This language appears to prevent ONHIR fromforcibly relocating Navajo families, since ONHIR has a large backlog of otherfamilies that need homes. The settlement agreement approved by P.L. 104-301 ,however, allows the Hopi Tribe under certain circumstances to beginquiet-possession actions against the United States after Feb. 1, 2000, if Navajofamilies on Hopi partitioned land have not either relocated or entered into leases withthe Hopi Tribe.", "Congress has in the past been concerned by the slow pace of relocation, and by relocatees' apparent low level of interest in moving to the \"new lands\" acquired forthe Navajo reservation for relocatee use.

The Clinton Administration reintroduced its Lands Legacy as a part of the FY2001 budgetproposal. This initiative would provide funding totaling $1.4 billion to 21 resourceprotection programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), inthe Departments of the Interior, Commerce, and Agriculture. FY2000 funding forthese programs was $727 million. A majority of the FY2001 request would befunded through Interior Appropriations legislation, including the Department of theInterior portion ($735 million) and the Department of Agriculture portion, all ofwhich would support U.S. Forest Service activities that are funded under Title II ofthe Interior Appropriations ($236 million). ", "This initiative was initially announced on January 12, 1999, and proposed in theFY2000 budget submission. The Administration had sought just over $1 billion forthe component programs, an increase of $571 million from the preceding year, butCongress provided $727 million. For both FY2000 and FY2001, the Administrationdid not suggest any legislative language to authorize new programs, redirect existingprograms, or increase authorization ceilings for existing programs. The FY2001proposal adds 3 programs and deletes 3 programs, when compared with the initialproposal. ", "Numerous related bills to increase and provide more certain funding for a wide range of resource protection activities have been introduced in both chambers. In theHouse, H.R. 701 , often referred to as CARA, passed after two days ofdebate, by a vote of 315-102. In the Senate, the Committee on Energy and NaturalResources completed action on a substitute to H.R. 701 , whichcombines parts of House-passed H.R. 701 with provisions in S. 2181 , introduced by Senator Bingaman, on July 25, and reported thebill on September 14, 2000 ( S.Rept. 106-413 ). Further action on these bills is widelyreported to be highly unlikely during the 106th Congress.", "One component of this legislation, addressed entirely in Interior Appropriations, is to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at $900 million. TheLWCF is the principal source of federal land acquisition funding and provides grantsto states. In its FY2001 budget request, the Administration had sought a total of$600 million for LWCF The House and the Senate both approved smaller amountsfor land acquisition for each of the four agencies than the President had requested. The House and Senate responses, the Administration requests, and the levelsprovided by the conference committee were as follows:", "$19 million and $11 million for BLM instead of $61 million, the conference committee provided $31 million;", "$30 million and $46 million for FWS instead of $112 million, the conference committee provided $63 million;", "$104 million and $87 million for NPS (including state grants) instead of $297 million, the conference committee provided $111 million,and;", "$52 million and $76 million for FS instead of $130 million, the conference committee provided $102 million.", "Other components of the Lands Legacy Initiative, which would fall under the jurisdiction of Interior Appropriations, include: (1) providing grants to states andlocalities to acquire land and plan for open space; (2) expanding funding for otherresource protection efforts on forest land and range land, and in urban areas; (3)funding land and resource restoration; and (4) funding smart growth partnerships. Funding for federal land acquisition is shown as the first four lines in Table 4 andother components are combined in the next three lines. ", " Table 4. Land Acquisition and Overall Lands Legacy Funding (in millions of dollars)", "a Does not include state-side grant programs; the request forFY2001 is $150 million.", "b Includes $20 million for land acquisition which was notallocated to a specificagency.", "c May not add up exactly due to rounding.", "The conference committee added a new Title VIII, titled Land Conservation, Preservation, and Infrastructure Improvement, to fund the Lands Legacy proposal. The new title would appropriate $1.6 billion for various programs in FY2001. Itwould also provide increasing funding, growing to $2.4 billion in FY2006. Of theFY2001 total, $1.2 billion would be funded through the Interior Appropriations andthe remainder would be funded through Commerce appropriations. All fundingwould be subject to the appropriations process each year; none of the funding ismandatory. The Interior funding categories and totals would be:", "$540 million for federal and state LWCF;", "$300 million for state and other conservationprograms;", "$160 million for urban and historic preservationprograms;", "$150 million for public land maintenance; and", "$50 million for the payment in lieu of taxesprogram.", "Three of these categories are also funded in other titles of the bill. For example, the LWCF would receive $311 million in Title I (for BLM, FWS, and NPS) and TitleII (for FS) and $229 million under this title. The final two categories - maintenancefunding and payment in lieu of taxes - would be funded only under this title. Unlikethe CARA proposals, none of the funding for this initiative is linked directly tofederal revenues from offshore oil and gas development. The legislation uses whatits proponents characterize as a \"fencing structure\" to limit any efforts to shift fundsamong categories at the level of the first year, $1.6 billion, and also to set these fundsapart from all other funds allocated for Interior appropriations. Any appropriatedamounts above this level in future years would not be subject to the fences. Also, anyfunds not appropriated in one year, could be appropriated in a subsequent year. ", "Prior to the conference committee, the FY2001 Lands Legacy Initiative proposal received little recognition or support from Congress. The House AppropriationsCommittee did not comment on it directly, and provided less or no funding forprograms in it. No amendments referenced to any of the Lands Legacy proposalswere adopted on the House floor. The Senate Appropriations Committee reportincluded a lengthy discussion of the initiative. As in the House, no amendmentsreferenced to any of the Lands Legacy proposals were adopted on the Senate floor. ", "This process is similar to how Congress responded to the initiative in FY2000, when both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee generally opposed theseproposals. But when the Interior Appropriations bill became part of the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act for FY2000, a new Title VI was added to Interior Appropriationsto provide additional funding of $197.5 million for Lands Legacy programs. Most,but not all, of these funds were dedicated for land acquisitions.
