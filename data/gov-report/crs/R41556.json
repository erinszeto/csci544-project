Hezbollah and Hamas are both U.S. State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and have refused to renounce the use of violence against Israel. It is widely believed that Iran continues to seek nuclear weapons capability, a goal that, if achieved, would have serious balance of power and proliferation consequences throughout the region and globally.

Iran also continues its strong ties to Syria, complicating U.S. efforts to peel that Arab state away from its predominantly Persian ally and advance a more comprehensive Israeli-Arab peace process.", "Although most observers agree that the image of the United States in the Middle East has improved under the Obama Administration, widespread dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in the region remains. Muslim world outreach and the Administration's decision to try to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo have done little to limit the influence of state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests (Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas). The ongoing war in Afghanistan and the perceived failure of the United States in bringing Israel and Palestinian leadership together to advance the peace process have curbed U.S. influence in the broader Middle East. Regional actors themselves, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, have taken more responsibility for resolving disputes rather than reflexively deferring to U.S. diplomacy.

U.S. efforts to curb international investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), a U.S. law that mandates penalties against foreign companies that conduct certain business with Iran's energy sector.

Congressional aid appropriations have reinforced Israel's peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and have helped to enable the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians to proceed, albeit with interruptions. On taking office in 2009, President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace to be a U.S. national security interest because the lack of peace has affected U.S. relations with countries in the Middle East and elsewhere and provided extremists with a cause. However, his early call for a halt to all Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Mahmud Abbas to echo that demand and tie it to his participation in direct talks with Israel. A limited 10-month Israeli moratorium on settlement activity in the West Bank enabled the Administration to bring about only very short-lived proximity talks between the parties. As the settlement freeze expired in September 2010, settlements persisted as an obstacle to talks. Israel has proceeded with settlement activity in the West Bank as well as in East Jerusalem, which it views as part of its indivisible capital of Jerusalem and which the Palestinians regard as their future capital. The Administration reportedly offered a generous package of incentives to Israel in order to obtain an additional three-months settlement freeze, during which time it hoped to achieve a breakthrough on a few issues in order to create momentum for more comprehensive final status talks.

The Hariri government's legitimacy depends in part on the STL's success, but Hezbollah and the opposition might make it impossible for Hariri to stay in power if the STL proceeds with indictments.

Although other countries, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, play a more formidable role in regional affairs, Egypt is still the Arab world's largest country by far, and a key partner of the United States both militarily and diplomatically in its support for the Arab-Israeli peace process. Its domestic politics are therefore of keen interest to U.S. policymakers and lawmakers. Some believe that political liberalization in Egypt would spread across the Middle East and possibly beyond. On the other hand, others assert that a stable, though autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel is in the U.S. interest, believing that gradual, long-term change is more desired, lest a sudden takeover by Egypt's largest opposition movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, usher in a government inimical to U.S. interests in the region. In November and December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, just one Muslim Brotherhood independent won a seat, and the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats (as opposed to slightly less than 80% in the last parliament).", "In the State Department press release on the parliamentary elections, the Administration stated that ", "Reports from domestic civil society monitors, candidate representatives, and government officials on the conduct of yesterday's elections give us cause for concern. We are disappointed by reports in the pre-election period of disruption of campaign activities of opposition candidates and arrests of their supporters, as well as denial of access to the media for some opposition voices.

Although funding for democracy promotion is not the only way to promote reform abroad, its use in Egypt has been controversial over the last six years. The Egyptian government has staunchly opposed foreign support to independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are working on political reform, transparency, and government accountability, including civic groups that have not received government approval. During the Bush Administration, policymakers and members of Congress directed some Economic Support Funds (ESF) toward USAID programming in the democracy and governance (D&G) sector and toward direct support to Egyptian NGOs.

P.L. 111-117 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010, provided $25 million in economic aid for democracy promotion (or 10% of total economic aid). Some analysts believe the Obama Administration would like to ease tensions with the Egyptian government by de-emphasizing democracy assistance. Others assert that U.S. funding has been largely ineffective anyway and that assistance should be channeled into areas that make a more immediate impact on the daily lives of average Egyptians.

Nevertheless, Al Qaeda's continued survival, the strength of its regional affiliates, and the apparent persistence of its appeal among some Muslims overseas and in the United States remain vexing problems. By all accounts, Al Qaeda operatives remain determined to attack the United States and its citizens and appear poised to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Recent events suggest that Al Qaeda supporters are conducting more sophisticated ideological outreach via the Internet and promoting independent, low-cost operations by individuals with limited linkages to established terrorist networks. These trends may complicate U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts by amplifying the spread of Al Qaeda's ideology and making terrorism threats more diffuse, less predictable, and less vulnerable to disruption.", "In the Middle East, a series of overlapping dilemmas now confront U.S. policy makers as they pursue counterterrorism goals along with other strategic priorities, such as securing global access to energy supplies, preventing nuclear proliferation, pursuing Israeli-Palestinian peace, and protecting regional allies. Ten years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated the costs, benefits, and limits of sustained U.S. military operations to target Al Qaeda operatives abroad and to stabilize countries where Al Qaeda seeks to establish safe havens. The continued presence of U.S. military forces in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia remains the subject of Al Qaeda rhetoric about U.S. occupation and imperialism, in spite of the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. More limited operations against Al Qaeda figures and counterterrorism assistance programs for allied governments at times have been criticized as violations of sovereignty or as examples of counterproductive U.S. support for undemocratic regimes. At the same time, U.S. support for democratic reform in places such as Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza has risked alienating allied governments and empowering Islamist parties who may oppose U.S. policies. The U.S. government's outreach to Muslims has expanded and changed in tone over time, but public opinion polls suggest that Muslims in many countries remain skeptical of U.S. intentions and critical of U.S. policies despite more U.S. outreach.

Others suggest that the United States should adopt a containment strategy based on the assumption that Al Qaeda's agenda is self-defeating, that the negative consequences of direct U.S. intervention may outweigh its benefits, and that a lasting victory over Al Qaeda and other violent extremists can only be won by Muslims rejecting extremism in their own mosques, communities, and societies.
