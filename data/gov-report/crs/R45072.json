Underpinning Venezuela's political crisis is an economic crisis. Venezuela is a major oil producer and exporter, and the 2014 crash in oil prices, combined with years of economic mismanagement, hit Venezuela's economy hard. Venezuela's economy has contracted by 35% since 2013, a larger contraction than the United States experienced during the Great Depression. Venezuela is struggling with inflation, shortages of food and medicine, substantial budget deficits, and deteriorating living conditions with significant humanitarian consequences.", "In response to the Maduro regime's increasingly undemocratic actions, the Trump Administration imposed sanctions restricting Venezuela's access to U.S. financial markets in August 2017, increasing fiscal pressure on the government. In November 2017, the Venezuelan government announced it would seek to restructure its debt. The government and the state-oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), subsequently missed key bond payments, leading credit rating agencies to issue default notices. Debt restructuring is expected to be a long and complex process, and it is unclear whether Venezuela will make coming debt repayments. The outlook for the economy is bleak; the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts the Venezuelan economy will contract by 11.9% in 2018.", "Implications for U.S. Economic Interests", "The political crisis in Venezuela and low oil prices have contributed to a contraction in U.S.-Venezuela trade. Venezuela is a relatively minor trading partner of the United States; the contraction in bilateral trade is more consequential for Venezuela, for which the United States is its largest trading partner. In response to the political and economic instability, several large U.S. companies have left Venezuela or curtailed operations there.", "U.S. investors holding Venezuelan and PdVSA bonds could face substantial losses if Venezuela suspends payment or seeks an aggressive restructuring of its debt. Bondholders are in the early stages of organizing to enter restructuring negotiations and/or pursue legal challenges against the Venezuelan government. Venezuelan dollar-denominated bonds were issued under New York law, and bondholder lawsuits seeking repayment would take place in U.S. courts. Legal challenges could result in the seizure of Venezuela's assets in the United States, such as CITGO (whose parent company is PdVSA), oil exports, and cash payments for oil exports.", "Venezuela's precarious fiscal position also raises concerns for U.S. energy security. In 2016, Venezuela's state oil company PdVSA secured a loan from the Russian state-oil company Rosneft. PdVSA used 49.9% of its shares in CITGO as collateral. If PdVSA defaults on its Rosneft loan, it is not clear whether Venezuela's portion of CITGO ownership would be transferred to Rosneft. Reportedly, Rosneft is negotiating to swap its collateral in CITGO for other PdVSA assets.", "Looking Ahead", "Congress is considering providing humanitarian aid to Venezuela through nongovernmental organizations. If the Maduro government or a new government in Venezuela engages in a significant reorientation of policy, U.S. policymakers may be interested in providing broader economic support to rebuild Venezuela's economy. Policymakers might explore how the international community, particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF), could provide an international financial assistance package, and whether debt incurred by the National Constituent Assembly, widely viewed as an illegitimate legislature, should be enforced. If the Maduro regime stays in power and does not reorient its policies, the United States may revisit its policies and potentially pursue harsher sanctions.", "For additional information on Venezuela from CRS, see CRS Report R44841, Venezuela: Background and U.S. Policy; CRS In Focus IF10230, Venezuela: Political and Economic Crisis and U.S. Policy; and CRS In Focus IF10715, Venezuela: Overview of U.S. Sanctions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Venezuela continues to be in the throes of a deep political crisis under the authoritarian rule of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Narrowly elected to a six-year term in 2013 following the death of longtime populist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (1999-2013), Maduro is unpopular. Despite serious economic challenges and recurring protests, Maduro has various policies, including use of the courts and security forces, to repress and divide the political opposition. The Maduro regime has been accused of committing serious human rights abuses; creating a deepening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; establishing an illegitimate legislature, the National Constituent Assembly, which has usurped power from the democratically elected National Assembly; engaging in rampant corruption; and persecuting the political opposition. ", "Underpinning the political crisis is an acute and increasingly unstable economic crisis. Venezuela's economy is built on oil, which accounts for more than 90% of the country's exports. The 2014 collapse in oil prices hit Venezuela's economy hard. Venezuela's economy has contracted by 35% since 2013, a larger contraction than the United States experienced during the Great Depression in the 1930s. In addition, the crisis is marked by inflation, shortages of consumer goods, default on the government's debt obligations, and deteriorating living conditions with significant humanitarian consequences.", "Congress has long-standing interests in both U.S.-Venezuela relations and foreign economic crises that affect U.S. economic interests.

The report also examines how the crisis affects U.S. economic interests, including U.S. investors' holdings of Venezuelan bonds, Venezuelan assets in the United States, U.S.-Venezuelan trade and direct investment, and possible future involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the crisis.

Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves of oil in the world, and its economy is built on oil. Oil accounts for more than 90% of Venezuelan exports and oil sales fund the government budget. Oil exports also provide the country with the foreign exchange it needs to import consumer goods. After years of economic mismanagement under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela was not well equipped to withstand the sharp fall in oil prices in 2014. Economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly under President Maduro. In November 2017, the government's increasingly dire fiscal situation came to a head, as the government announced it would seek to restructure its debt. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Mismanagement during the Oil Boom", "paragraphs": ["Venezuela benefited from the boom in oil prices during the 2000s. When Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took office in 1999, oil was $10 a barrel. Oil prices steadily rose over the following several years, reaching a peak of $133 a barrel in July 2008. Between 1999 and 2015, the Venezuelan government earned nearly $900 billion from petroleum exports, with about half ($450 billion) earned between 2007 and 2012 (Ch\u00e1vez's second term). ", "President Ch\u00e1vez used the oil windfall to spend heavily on social programs and expand subsidies for food and energy. Social spending as a share of GDP rose from 28% to 40% between 2000 and 2013, a much bigger rise than in Latin America's other large economies. Ch\u00e1vez borrowed against future oil exports, running budget deficits in nine of the years when he was in office (1999-2013). Venezuela's public debt more than doubled between 2000 and 2012, from 28% of GDP to 58% of GDP. Additionally, Ch\u00e1vez used oil to expand influence abroad, for example through Petro C aribe , a program that allowed Caribbean countries to purchase oil at below-market prices. The Ch\u00e1vez government also engaged in widespread expropriations and nationalizations, with the number of private companies dropping from 14,000 in 1998 to 9,000 in 2011. It also adopted currency and price controls. ", "Substantial government outlays on social programs helped Ch\u00e1vez gain political favor and drive down poverty rates in Venezuela, from 37% in 2005 to 25% in 2012. However, widespread economic mismanagement had long-term consequences. Government spending was not directed toward investment that could have helped increase economic productivity and reduce its reliance on oil. Expropriations and nationalizations discouraged foreign investment that could have provided the country with increased expertise and capital. Price controls created market distortions and stifled the private sector. Economic growth and poverty reduction in Venezuela lagged behind the rest of South America. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crash in Oil Prices and Economic Crisis", "paragraphs": ["When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was elected President in April 2013, he inherited economic policies that were broadly viewed as unsustainable and overly reliant on proceeds from oil exports. When oil prices crashed in 2014, the Maduro government was ill-equipped to soften the blow to the Venezuelan economy. While many other major commodity producers used the boom years to build foreign exchange reserves or sovereign wealth funds to mitigate risks from big swings in commodity prices, the Ch\u00e1vez government created no such stabilization fund to guard against a potential future fall in oil prices. Instead, Ch\u00e1vez had borrowed on the expectation that oil prices would remain high. ", "The crash in oil prices led to a sharp decline in government revenue and, combined with the government's policy choices, triggered a broad economic crisis. Venezuela's economy is estimated to have contracted by nearly 35% between 2012 and 2017. The fall in oil prices strained public finances; instead of adjusting fiscal policies through tax increases and spending cuts, the Maduro government tried to address its growing budget deficit by printing money, which led to inflation. Inflation, about 20% in 2012, was projected to exceed 1,100% by the end of 2017. The government has tried to curb inflation through price controls, although these controls have been largely ineffective in restricting prices, as supplies have dried up and transactions have moved to the black market. Unemployment in Venezuela is forecast to reach 26% in 2017, more than triple the level of unemployment in 2012. Table 1 provides a snapshot of changes in key economic indicators for Venezuela since 2013.", "Until recently, the Maduro government had committed to repaying its debts despite tight resources, fearing the legal challenges from creditors that plagued Argentina for more than a decade after its default in 2001. Such legal challenges against the Venezuelan government could result in the seizure of Venezuela's overseas assets, such as CITGO, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA); oil shipments; and cash payments for oil exports. Maduro's commitment to debt service came at a high cost: to meet its international payments, the government tightened restrictions on access to foreign currency, imposed price controls, and cut imports. Venezuela's imports of goods fell from $62.9 billion in 2013 to $21.4 billion in 2016. Venezuela relies heavily on imports for most consumer goods, and cuts to imports led to severe shortages of food and medicine, creating a humanitarian crisis. ", "The Venezuelan government pursued a variety of policies to fill its funding gaps and avoid default. The government approached allies China and Russia for financing, securing loans to be repaid through future oil exports (\"oil-for-loan\" deals), although it fell behind on these deals. In May 2017, the Venezuelan central bank raised funds through the sale of $2.8 billion in PdVSA bonds to Goldman Sachs Asset Management at a steep discount (Goldman paid $865 million). The deal was controversial, and the government had difficulty finding buyers for a similar transaction in subsequent months. The Venezuelan government was running out of foreign exchange reserves to make debt payments, with official reserves down from $21.5 billion at the end of 2013 to $10 billion in the third quarter of 2017. In August 2017, new U.S. sanctions exacerbated the government's precarious fiscal position. Specifically, the August 2017 sanctions restrict Venezuela's ability to borrow from U.S. investors or access U.S. financial markets. The Maduro government is pursing the creation of a new currency, \"petros\" backed by oil, gas, gold, and diamonds, as a way to circumvent sanctions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Default and Debt Restructuring", "paragraphs": ["After months of speculation about if and when Venezuela would default, on November 2, 2017, President Maduro announced in a televised address that the country would seek to restructure and refinance its debt. The announcement signaled a significant shift in policy and highlighted the government's dire fiscal situation, but Maduro provided few details about how the restructuring would proceed. While it is difficult to find reliable data on the composition of Venezuelan debt, it is estimated that Venezuela owes about $64 billion to bondholders, $20 billion to China and Russia, $5 billion to multilateral lenders (such as the Inter-American Development Bank), and tens of billions to importers and service companies in the oil industry. Maduro blamed U.S. sanctions for Venezuela's need to restructure, arguing that U.S. sanctions made it impossible for the government to find new financing.", "Any comprehensive restructuring of Venezuelan debt is expected to be a long and complex process, due to the following factors: ", "the number of parties involved, including hundreds or even thousands of bondholders who are in the early stages of organizing, as well as China and Russia, whose lending to Venezuela may be driven in part by geopolitical considerations; legal challenges likely to be initiated by bondholders, which could take years to resolve and could result in the seizure of Venezuelan assets in the United States, including CITGO (owned by PdVSA), oil shipments, and cash payments for oil; differences in legal provisions in different bonds, including differences between the sovereign and PdVSA bonds; U.S. sanctions, which prohibit U.S. investors from accepting any new debt issued in a debt restructuring or from engaging with Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa, who are leading the debt negotiations and subject to U.S. sanctions for drug-trafficking and corruption charges; and lack of any economic reform agenda in Venezuela to accompany the restructuring, such as an IMF program. ", "Maduro stressed his promise to continue debt service during negotiations with creditors, likely an effort to evade legal challenges from bondholders. However, the government and PdVSA missed some bond interest payments in mid-November, leading credit rating agencies and a New York-based derivatives group (the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, ISDA) to issue default notices. ", "To advance its goal of debt restructuring, the Venezuelan government organized a bondholders meeting in Caracas on November 13, 2017. The meeting, while touted by the government as a sign of good faith in negotiations with creditors, provided little insight into how negotiations would proceed. Reportedly the bondholder meeting was sparsely attended, no bondholders were allowed to ask any questions publicly, and the meeting concluded after 30 minutes. Critics have also questioned why the government appointed two sanctioned individuals to lead its negotiating team.", "Some analysts have tried to parse Maduro's strategy, if any exists, for dealing with private bondholders. Maduro's stated goal of restructuring and subsequent default notices drove down the value of Venezuelan debt trading in secondary markets. Some analysts have argued that this was Maduro's intent, and strengthens the government's hand in restructuring negotiations. There is also some speculation that the Venezuela government will strategically default on its government bonds, but not the PdVSA bonds. The reasoning is that it may be harder to seize the government's assets rather than a company's assets, but it is unclear how the strategy would play out in courts given the tight linkages between the government and PdVSA. ", "Although China and Russia have both provided financial support to Venezuela, the two creditor governments are increasingly taking divergent approaches to Venezuela's mounting fiscal problems. In mid-November, Russia agreed to restructure $3.15 billion in debt owed by Venezuela on favorable terms, despite Russia's own fiscal pressures. This eased the fiscal pressures facing the Venezuelan government, and demonstrates the geopolitical significance of Venezuela to Russia. In contrast, China seems to give priority to the economic value of its investments in Venezuela over geopolitical concerns. In late November, a U.S. subsidiary of Sinopec, one of China's biggest state-owned oil companies, sued PdVSA in a U.S. court for late payments. PdVSA settled with the subsidiary in December, perhaps showing the importance to Venezuela of maintaining good relations with the Chinese government. It appears to be the first legal challenge to Venezuela relating to its debt payment obligations. ", "In addition to restructuring debt owed to Russia, the Venezuelan government is seeking sources of cash to keep its finances afloat. In December, the government secured a $400 million credit line from the Latin American Development Bank ( Corporacion Andina de Fomento , CAF), of which the United States is not a member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Outlook", "paragraphs": ["In October 2017, the IMF projected Venezuela's economy to contract by 6% in 2018 and 2% in 2019. These projections have been substantially revised since the government announced plans to restructure its debt and was declared in default by several credit rating agencies. In December 2017, the Economist Intelligence Unit projected that Venezuela's economy will contract by 11.9% in 2018 and 5.4% in 2019, a more significant contraction in economic growth than it or the IMF envisioned just two months prior.", "Venezuela is running a relatively large budget deficit, estimated at 18.5% of GDP in 2017. It is unclear how restructuring and/or default will impact Venezuela's finances, in part because it is unclear whether the government intends, or will be able, to continue repaying debts during the negotiations. If the government does suspend debt repayments, it could in the short term redirect funds to domestic objectives such as increasing imports of food and medicine, which could help bolster domestic political support for the Maduro regime. In the longer term, however, suspending payments to creditors could result in a substantial loss of government revenue, if creditors are able to seize oil exports or funds tied to oil exports.

The United States also does not have a bilateral investment treaty or free trade agreement with Venezuela that could provide investors protection.

The dispute between the Argentine government and creditors took 15 years to resolve. Venezuela's restructuring and likely legal challenges are widely expected to be more complex, largely due to Venezuela's significant overseas assets that could be seized by creditors.
