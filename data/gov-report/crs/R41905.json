After a period of general decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, funding for State Department operations, international broadcasting, and foreign aid rose steadily from FY2002 to FY2010, largely because of ongoing assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, new global health programs, and increasing assistance to Pakistan.

The next step identified by the BCA is sequestration (a trigger of defense and nondefense automatic budget cuts). Sequestration is to take effect January 2013. Congress passed and the President signed two continuing resolutions: H.J.Res. 94 ( P.L. 112-67 , signed December 16, 2011) continued funding through December 17, and H.J.Res. 95 ( P.L. 112-68 , signed December 17, 2011) continued funding through December 23.

Congress approved and the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( S. 365 / P.L. 112-25 ) on August 2, 2011, legislation to raise the debt ceiling. The measure requires specific funding reductions in security and nonsecurity discretionary spending through FY2013.

The form of assistance (which in recent years has been primarily military aid) is a key issue, with some lawmakers calling for debt cancellation, others for direct democracy promotion assistance, and still others suggesting that focusing aid on economic growth is the best way to foster a democratic future for Egypt. Similar considerations apply to Tunisia, for which the United States pledged $20 million in March through the Middle East Partnership Initiative for transition support, and legislation has been introduced in the Senate ( S. 618 ) to authorize Tunisia-United States and Egypt-United States enterprise funds. In Libya, the United States has suspended previously approved aid programs, approved $25 million in non-lethal assistance for Libyan opposition groups, and provided humanitarian assistance for refugees fleeing the country.

Congress, however, has not demonstrated support for Administration efforts to carry out such transitions.

While these reforms are intended to address aspects of USAID operations that Congress has often criticized, implementation will require additional funding at a time when Congress seeks to reduce spending.

Most of the funds requested represent just one of several annual installments toward a larger total GCI commitment. Multiple simultaneous GCIs are unusual but necessary, according to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, because of high lending rates at the institutions, with U.S. encouragement, in response to the global financial crisis. Congressional appropriators, however, have suggested reluctance to appropriate such funds without prior consideration of authorization legislation stipulating reforms on which disbursement of the funds would be contingent. The Administration asserts that failure to provide the requested funding would diminish U.S. influence globally and potentially create an opportunity for other countries, such as China, to expand their global influence.

During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs had a primarily anti-communist focus, while concurrently pursuing other U.S. policy interests, such as promoting economic development, advancing U.S. trade, expanding access to basic education and health care, promoting human rights, and protecting the environment. After the early 1990s, with the Cold War ended, distinct policy objectives\u2014including stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons\u2014replaced the Cold War-influenced foreign policy objectives.", "A defining change in focus came following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, many U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have emphasized national security objectives, frequently cast in terms of contributing to efforts to counter terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released a National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's 2006 and 2010 National Security Strategy.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperated with the United States in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq exemplified the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism.

The Obama Administration has also largely sustained Bush Administration investments in global health and HIV/AIDS treatment, though its Global Health Initiative shifts the emphasis away from a focus on discrete diseases and toward comprehensive health systems. In the FY2011 and FY2012 requests, the Administration further defined its international priorities, with an emphasis on building State Department and USAID capacity, supporting multilateral food security and global climate change initiatives, and shifting responsibility for assistance programs in Iraq and elsewhere from military to civilian authorities.

The Near East region continues to be dominated by assistance to Israel ($3.0 billion), Iraq ($2.4 billion), Egypt ($1.6 billion), and Jordan ($0.7 billion). The Western Hemisphere's projected relative decline in FY2012 is attributable mostly to the $1.4 billion in supplemental funds for Haiti's humanitarian crisis in 2010.
