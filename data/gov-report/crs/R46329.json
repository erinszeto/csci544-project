The programs are the following:", "Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The CPFF purchases newly-issued commercial paper from all types of U.S. issuers who cannot find private sector buyers. Commercial paper is short-term debt issued by financial firms (including banks), nonfinancial firms, and \"asset backed\" pass-through entities that purchase loans. Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF ). The MMLF makes nonrecourse loans to financial institutions to purchase assets that money market funds are selling to meet redemptions. This reduces the probability of runs on money market funds caused by a fund's inability to liquidate assets. Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF ) and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) . The Fed created two new facilities to support corporate bond markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094the PMCCF to purchase newly-issued corporate debt from issuers and the SMCCF to purchase existing corporate debt or corporate debt exchange-traded funds on secondary markets. The issuer must have material operations in the United States and cannot receive direct federal financial assistance related to COVID-19. Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The TALF makes nonrecourse, three-year loans to private investors to purchase newly-issued, highly-rated asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by various nonmortgage loans. Eligible ABS include those backed by certain auto loans, student loans, credit card receivables, equipment loans, floorplan loans, insurance premium finance loans, small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), or servicing advance receivables. Main Street Lending Program (MSLP). The MSLP buys loans from depository institutions that are four-year loans to businesses with up to 10,000 employees or up to $2.5 billion in revenues. The loans to businesses would defer principal and interest repayment for one year, and the businesses would have to make a \"reasonable effort\" to retain employees. This program may be particularly attractive to businesses too large to qualify for SBA assistance. Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF). The MLF purchases shorter-term state and municipal debt in response to higher yields and reduced liquidity in that market. The facility purchases only debt of states, larger counties (with at least 500,000 residents), and larger cities (with at least 250,000 residents).", "Some programs were announced with an overall size limit (see Table 1 ).

To extend its traditional role, the Fed has used its Section 13(3) emergency lending authority. The Fed also used this authority to assist nonbank financial firms and markets in the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 facilities go beyond the scope of the 2008 facilities by purchasing loans of nonfinancial businesses and debt of states and municipalities. In some programs, the Fed purchases securities in affected markets directly. In other programs, the Fed makes loans to financial institutions or investors to intervene in affected markets; these loans are typically made on attractive terms to incentivize activity, including by shifting the credit risk to the Fed.", "By law, the Fed must structure these facilities to avoid expected losses, and the facilities charge users interest and/or fees as compensation.

Comparisons to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)58", "paragraphs": ["Over a decade ago, in the financial crisis and recession of 2007-2009, businesses and individuals in the United States and across the globe faced financial uncertainty unparalleled for a generation. Although the cause of the financial uncertainty differed greatly between the current circumstances as a consequence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the financial crisis of 2007-2009, in each instance Congress has chosen to proactively assist in economic recovery. ", "As the financial crisis reached near panic proportions in fall 2008, Congress created the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) through the enactment in October 2008 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ). Subsequently, Congress passed the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ), which provided relief to certain parts of the economy. The CARES Act combines elements of both aforementioned acts. Title IV of the CARES Act, with its assistance for firms and support of Federal Reserve financial sector facilities, more closely resembles TARP; a summary of aspects of TARP that parallel Title IV will be the focus of this appendix.", "For a broader overview of the financial sector and industry assistance during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, please see CRS Report R43413, Costs of Government Interventions in Response to the Financial Crisis: A Retrospective , by Baird Webel and Marc Labonte. For a comparison of TARP and Title IV of the CARES Act, see Table A-1 .", "Implementation", "The EESA authorized the Treasury Secretary to either purchase or insure up to $700 billion in troubled assets owned by financial firms. The general concept was that by removing such assets from the financial system, confidence in counterparties would be restored, and the system could resume functioning. This authority granted in the EESA was broad. In particular, the definitions of both troubled assets and financial institutions allowed the Secretary wide latitude in deciding what assets might be purchased or guaranteed and what might qualify as a financial institution. In practice, most TARP funding was not used to purchase troubled assets, instead being dedicated to capital injections for financial institutions, loans to the auto industry, and assistance for homeowners at risk of foreclosure. In a limited number of cases, TARP and Federal Reserve funds were used together. The EESA was later amended to reduce the authorized amount to $475 billion, when it became clear that the amount used would not exceed this amount.", "Equity Compensation for Treasury", "Equity warrants in return for government assistance were specifically provided for in the TARP statute. The warrants were expected to provide a positive financial upside to the taxpayer if the private companies' fortunes improved as a result of the government assistance. Although resulting in positive returns for the government, the amount recouped through warrants ($9.58 billion) was less than through interest and dividends ($24.38 billion). The act did not specifically call for the government to receive large holdings of common stock. In several cases, however, the government ended up with large, sometimes controlling, equity positions in private companies. The government generally exercised little of the ownership control inherent in these large stakes. Common equity in companies was typically accepted in return for TARP assistance in order to strengthen the companies' capital positions. Such equity also provided a financial upside to the taxpayers when firms recovered, but it also had a potential downside when firms did not recover strongly. ", "Termination Date", "The EESA granted the purchase authority for a maximum of two years from the date of enactment, meaning it expired on October 3, 2010. Commitments made under this authorization, however, could continue after this date, with no limit on how long assets purchased under TARP could be held by the government. At present, there continues to be funding disbursed under the housing assistance program and a small amount ($0.04 billion) of bank capital assistance outstanding.", "Limits on Compensation and Labor Reduction", "The EESA included limits on executive bonuses and golden parachutes and provided for possible compensation clawbacks. The EESA was later amended by ARRA to expand these limits and add additional corporate governance reforms, thus placing additional restrictions on participating banks in existing Capital Purchase Program contracts. The act amending the EESA also allowed for early repayment and withdrawal from the program without financial penalty. With the advent of more stringent requirements for TARP recipients, many banks began to repay, or attempt to repay, TARP funds. There was no employee retention requirement with TARP. ", "Congressional Oversight", "The EESA included a number of oversight mechanisms and reporting requirements. Similar to the CARES Act, it created a TARP Congressional Oversight Panel. The TARP Oversight Panel was a five-member, independent entity established in the legislative branch, appointed by congressional leadership, and directed to submit regular reports to Congress. In exercising its duties, the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel issued 30 reports and held 26 hearings between December 2008 and March 2011, according to its final report. The panel employed a total of 46 staff, utilized 3 detailees, and expended approximately $10.7 million through April 3, 2011. The five-member panel was appointed by the House and Senate leadership. ", "The EESA also required the Treasury Secretary to provide periodic updates to Congress, with both monthly overall reports and individual reports detailing \"all transactions\" made under TARP. The Comptroller General was specifically tasked with oversight responsibilities and regular audits, with the Secretary directed to provide appropriate facilities, funding, and access to records to facilitate this oversight. ", "Special Inspector General ", "The EESA created the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP) position with an initial $50 million in funding, which has been continued in annual appropriations since. The SIGTARP was provided similar powers and authorities as other inspectors general to conduct audits and investigations of TARP and issue quarterly reports until all assets held or insured by Treasury under TARP were disposed of. The SIGTARP issued its first report in 2010, with its latest report covering the last quarter of 2019. Congress appropriated $22 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-93 ) for the SIGTARP position in FY2020. ", "Conflicts of Interest", "The EESA required the Secretary to issue regulations or guidelines to \"address, manage or prohibit\" conflicts of interest arising in TARP, including the purchase and management of assets and the selection of asset managers and post-employment restrictions.", "Minimizing Costs to Taxpayers", "The EESA directed the Secretary to minimize the negative impact on taxpayers, including both direct and long-term costs and benefits. Market mechanism and private sector participation in operating the program were encouraged. The terms and conditions of Treasury asset purchases were to be designed to provide recompense to the taxpayer, including participation in the equity appreciation of a firm following Treasury asset purchases."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
