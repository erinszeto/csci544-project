{"id": "RL33805", "title": "Early Childhood Care and Education Programs in the 110th Congress: Background and Funding", "released_date": "2008-02-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["Federal support for child care and education comes in many forms, ranging from grant programs to tax provisions. Some programs serve as specifically dedicated funding sources for child care services (e.g., the Child Care and Development Block Grant, or CCDBG) or education programs (e.g., Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I, Part A; Early Reading First; Even Start; the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program; the Early Childhood Educator Professional Development program; and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u2014Preschool Grants program and Infants and Toddlers program), while for others (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used. In many cases, federal programs target low-income families in need of child care, but in the case of certain tax provisions, the benefits reach middle- and upper-income families as well. This report provides an overview of federal child care, early education, and related programs, and their funding status.", "Funding for many child care, early education, and related programs is provided each year as part of the annual appropriations process for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education (ED). Fiscal year (FY) 2007 appropriations bills for those departments did not receive floor action in the House or Senate during the 109th Congress, despite the 2007 fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2006. After three continuing resolutions (CRs) provided temporary funding for government operations, a fourth CR, providing funding through the end of FY2007, was ultimately signed into law (P.L. 110-5) on February 15, 2007, shortly after the President's budget request for FY2008 was released. For several but not all of the programs covered by this report, the FY2007 funding levels mirrored those included in the FY2006 appropriations (P.L. 109-149). Funding for Head Start was increased, as was that for Early Reading First. Even Start funding was cut, but not eliminated as had been proposed by the President.", "The FY2008 appropriations process, which included a series of continuing resolutions that provided temporary funding (at FY2007 levels) and a vetoed conference agreement (H.Rept. 110-424), ultimately culminated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2764) being signed into law (P.L. 110-161) by the President on December 26, 2007. The legislation includes an across-the-board cut (1.747%) to the program funding level amounts contained in the act's language. (The levels included in this report reflect the across-the-board reduction.) On February 4, 2008, the President released his budget request for FY2009.", "The 110th Congress has not addressed all of the expired (or soon expiring) reauthorizations in the area of early childhood education and care. The CCDBG (expired with FY2002) remains funded without authorization. No Child Left Behind was granted an automatic one-year extension (through FY2008) under the General Education Provisions Act. Head Start reauthorization legislation (H.R. 1429) was approved by this Congress in November 2007, and signed into law (P.L. 110-134) by the President on December 12, 2007."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Child Care and Early Education Programs and Tax Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Several federal programs support child care, education, or related services, primarily for low-income working families.

Programs for young children contained in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), such as the Preschool Grants program and the Infants and Toddlers program, are not up for reauthorization in the 110 th Congress.

The CCDBG is overdue for reauthorization, and the 110 th Congress has inherited this unfinished task. (Although the 109 th Congress completed legislation to provide the mandatory funding portion for the CCDBG through FY2010, the CCDBG Act itself, which outlines the rules of program, and includes the authorization level for discretionary funding, awaits reauthorization. In the meantime, discretionary funding has been provided via the appropriations process.)", "The CCDBG is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and provides formula block grants to states, which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13, if the parents are working or in school, and family income is less than 85% of the state median. (In practice, many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold.) Child care services are provided on a sliding fee scale basis, and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates, which can be used with a provider of the parents' choice, including religious providers and relatives.", "States receiving CCDBG funds must establish child care licensing standards, although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered. In addition, states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving CCDBG subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseases, building and physical premises safety, and health and safety training for care givers. However, federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements.", "The CCDBG is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement (mandatory) grants (referred to in combination as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)), and state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds. States must use at least 4% of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care, and according to statute, must target 70% of entitlement funds on welfare recipients working toward self-sufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency. However, because all families falling below the 85% of state median income requirement can be categorized as \"at risk,\" the 70% targeting of the welfare or at-risk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served. In theory, all funds may be used for low-income, non-welfare, working families. However, state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families. No more than 5% of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs.", "The FY2006 Appropriations Act for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education ( P.L. 109-149 ) included roughly $2.1 billion in discretionary funding for the CCDBG. (An across-the-board rescission of 1% brought the precise total to $2.062 billion.) The fourth and final CR ( P.L. 110-5 ) covering FY2007 maintained discretionary funding at the $2.1 billion level. Mandatory (or \"entitlement\") CCDBG funding beginning in FY2003 through FY2005 was provided at the FY2002 rate ($2.717 billion for the year), under a series of funding extensions. Ultimately, as alluded to earlier, funding for a longer, five-year period (FY2006-FY2010) was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a budget spending reconciliation bill ( S. 1932 ), which was signed into law ( P.L. 109-171 ) on February 8, 2006.

The law maintains the TANF block grant at $16.5 billion for FY2006-2010. Child care is one of many services for which states may use TANF funding. In FY2006 (the most recent year for which data are available), HHS reports that states spent $1.24 billion in federal TANF funds for child care within the TANF program, and $2.23 billion in state TANF and separate state program (SSP) MOE funds. In addition, states may transfer up to 30% of their TANF allotments to CCDF, to be spent according to the rules of the child care program (as opposed to TANF rules).

Title XX is a capped entitlement, and state allocations are based on relative population size. It should be noted that although the SSBG has an entitlement ceiling, appropriations may not always abide by it. For example, the ceiling in FY2001 was $1.7 billion; however, Congress appropriated $1.725 billion for that year, despite the ceiling. Funding for the SSBG has been held steady at $1.7 billion for the past seven years (most recently, for FY2008), with states retaining authority to transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to the SSBG.
