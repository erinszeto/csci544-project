The students are seeking to be represented by the College Athletes Players Association (CAPA), a newly created labor organization. CAPA contends that college football and basketball players, particularly those who compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), are essentially employees given the amount of time they commit to athletics, the revenue they generate for their schools, and their receipt of compensation in the form of scholarships. If the Northwestern players are found to be employees for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), they will be permitted to engage in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of their employment.", "This report provides an overview of the NLRA, and reviews the March 2014 decision by the NLRB's regional director, which concluded that the Northwestern players are employees under the act. The report examines the concerns raised by both the university and CAPA. The report also discusses other developments that could affect unionization efforts by athletes at private colleges and universities. In August 2014, the NCAA Division I Board of Directors gave new authority to five conferences\u2014consisting of 65 public and private colleges and universities\u2014to provide greater financial support to student-athletes.

Although the full five-member NLRB agreed to review the regional director's decision, an election was held on April 25, 2014, with the ballots impounded until after a final decision is issued in the case.

It has been reported that the organizing effort is supported by a majority of Northwestern's football players. The NCAA has maintained, however, that the players are \"student-athletes\" and not employees, and that their participation in college sports is voluntary.", "Whether the Northwestern players may be considered employees for purposes of the NLRA is a threshold question that will likely determine their collective bargaining rights. In general, the NLRB has been guided by common law principles to evaluate an individual's employment status. The Board has considered, for example, the degree of control exercised by an employer over an alleged employee. The NLRB has also examined the economic realities of a situation, that is, the degree to which an alleged employee is dependent on an employer.", "In 2004, the Board also considered congressional intent to determine whether graduate student assistants should be considered employees for purposes of the NLRA. In Brown University , the Board noted that \"[t]he issue of employee status under the Act turns on whether Congress intended to cover the individual in question. The issue is not to be decided purely on the basis of older common law concepts.\" Ultimately, the NLRB concluded that \"it simply does not effectuate the national labor policy\" to recognize collective bargaining rights for graduate student assistants because they are primarily students.", "Northwestern cited the NLRB's decision in Brown University to support its position that the football players are not employees. On March 26, 2014, however, the regional director of the NLRB's Region 13 in Chicago concluded that the players are employees for purposes of the NLRA. Citing the common law definition for the term employee, the regional director maintained that an individual is an employee if he \"performs services for another under a contract for hire, subject to the other's control or right of control, and in return for payment.\"", "After reviewing how the Northwestern players were recruited and treated by the school and its coaches, the regional director found that the players met the common law definition. In this case, the \"tender\" that must be signed by the players before each scholarship period was found to serve as an employment contract, providing \"detailed information concerning the duration and conditions under which the compensation will be provided to [the players].\" With regard to the control exercised by the school and its coaches, the regional director cited the daily itineraries that are provided to the players \"which set forth, hour by hour, what football related activities the players are to engage in from as early as 5:45 a.m. until 10:30 p.m., when they are expected to be in bed.\" As for payment, the regional director stated simply: \"[I]t is clear that the scholarships that players receive are in exchange for the athletic services being performed.\"", "The regional director declined to view the Northwestern players as similar to the graduate assistants in Brown University . The regional director explained that the players' football-related duties \"are unrelated to their academic studies unlike the graduate assistants whose teaching and research duties were inextricably related to their graduate degree requirements [.]\"", "On April 9, 2014, Northwestern requested a review of the regional director's decision. Northwestern argued that the decision should be reviewed because the players' petition presents a unique and novel issue, because the regional director misapplied and departed from Board precedent, and because the regional director's findings on substantial factual issues are clearly erroneous on the record and prejudicially affect the university's rights. On April 24, 2014, the Board agreed to review the regional director's decision.", "If CAPA becomes the players' exclusive representative, the union has indicated that it will bargain over health and safety issues, additional financial support for the players, and health insurance. CAPA has said that it will bargain with the university within the existing NCAA rules and will not bargain for terms that are prohibited by the NCAA. CAPA has also said that it will \"speak for the Players as the NCAA landscape continues to evolve.\"", "Northwestern believes that CAPA would bargain over pay and other economic benefits, if it is certified as the players' exclusive representative. If CAPA does attempt such negotiations, and the university declines to bargain over these mandatory subjects of bargaining, it could be subject to an unfair labor practice charge. At the same time, however, the negotiation of economic benefits could lead to possible NCAA sanctions. Northwestern has explained that it cannot offer scholarships greater than the amount allowed by the NCAA. According to the university, if it did, the NCAA could prevent it from playing football. The university also argues that, because they are subject to NCAA rules, it could not bargain over the sale by players of their images or likenesses, the types of leases allowed for players living off-campus, the types of outside employment, or random player drug testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Developments that May Affect Unionization Efforts by College Athletes", "paragraphs": ["If the Board and federal courts determine that Northwestern University football players are employees for purposes of collective bargaining, other developments may affect unionization efforts by athletes at private colleges and universities.

The cost of attendance may, however, include other costs that are not included in a full grant-in-aid (e.g., the cost of supplies, transportation, or other expenses).
