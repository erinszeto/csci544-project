P.L. 108-189 , the\"Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA),\" was enacted on December 19, 2003 and overhauls theSSCRA. This report summarizes the rights granted to persons serving on active duty in the U.S.Armed Forces under the newly enacted SCRA.", "SCRA is a comprehensive rewrite of the SSCRA which clarifies language that has been subject to differing interpretations by courts, and modifies or expands certain benefits. The SCRA providesprotections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meetfinancial obligations incurred before their entry into active military service. The SCRA does notrequire forgiving any debts or the extinguishment of contractual obligations on behalf ofservicemembers who have been called up for active duty, nor does it provide absolute immunityfrom civil lawsuits. Instead, it suspends claims against servicemembers and protects them fromdefault judgments. The SCRA also protects military members and their families from eviction,protects against cancellation of life insurance policies or non-reinstatement of health insurancepolicies, allows some professionals to suspend malpractice or liability insurance while on activeduty, and protects from taxation in multiple jurisdictions as well as forced property sales to payoverdue taxes.", "The SCRA provides for a cap on interest at an annual rate of 6% on debts incurred prior to a person's entry into active duty military service, sets forth procedures for requesting such a reduction,and clarifies that the balance of interest for the servicemember's period of military service is to beforgiven by the lender. Other measures protect military families from being evicted from rentalproperty or from mortgaged property, from cancellation of life insurance, from taxation in multiplejurisdictions and from foreclosure of property to pay taxes that are due, and from losing certain rightsto public land.

(9)", "'Period of military service'.", "A servicemember's \"period of military service\" begins when he or she enters military service and ends on the date of release from military service or upon death during military service. This newmeaning differs from the previous meaning only in the use of the word \"release\" rather than\"discharge\" from military service. In military terminology, a \"discharge\" can mean a completeseverance from all military status with respect to enlisted personnel, while \"release from active duty\"means termination of active-duty status and transfer or reversion to reserve status.

These subsections extend some protection to persons who share a debt with one or more covered servicemembers or have secondary liability asa \"surety, guarantor, endorser, accommodation maker, co-maker, or other person who is or may beprimarily or secondarily subject to the obligation or liability\" at issue. If the SCRA provisions areinvoked as to the servicemember, the court has discretion to grant a stay, postponement, orsuspension of the proceedings against such persons, or to set aside or vacate a judgment. Whethera court grants such relief appears to be influenced by equitable considerations, including whether theservicemember is able to appear in court, whether the servicemember's presence is necessary for thedefense, and whether an unjust forfeiture could otherwise result. If the servicemember is onlynominally a party to the suit, as in cases of negligence where the insurance company might beconsidered the \"true defendant,\" the modern trend is to deny a stay. (15) The right to open a defaultjudgment taken against a person in the military service is reserved to that person only and is notavailable to a judgment co-debtor. ", "The Act added the term \"co-maker\" (16) to the list of persons who may be entitled to a stay in anaction which has been stayed with respect to a servicemember.

In such a case,the court hearing the charge may not enforce the bond during the period of military service of theaccused, and has the discretion to return the bail in its entirety to the bail bondsman in the interestof equity and justice. While some courts have interpreted this subsection to allow for no discretion, (18) others have required sureties to make a further showing that the appearance of the principal was infact prevented due to military service and that the surety made an effort to secure the appearance ofthe principal in court.

In a civil lawsuit, the failure of the defendant to appear in court may result in the award of a default judgment on behalf of the plaintiff. This section protectsservicemembers from default judgments in civil actions while they are unable to appear in court dueto military service. Before a court can grant a default judgment, the plaintiff must file an affidavitstating that the defendant is not on active duty in military service showing necessary facts to supportthe affidavit (20) or that the plaintiff was unable todetermine whether or not the defendant is in militaryservice. A false affidavit to that effect is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, a fine ofup to $1,000, or both. The court, before entering a judgment, must also appoint an attorney torepresent the person on active duty in order to protect his or her legal rights and interests. However,if the attorney appointed to the case cannot locate the servicemember, actions by the attorney wouldnot waive any defenses of or otherwise bind the servicemember. Additionally, if the court is unableto determine if a defendant is in military service, the court may require a bond which may later beused to indemnify the defendant if it is determined that he or she was in military service and thejudgment against the defendant is set aside or vacated in part. Moreover, if a court enters a defaultjudgment against a servicemember, the court may set aside its judgment if the servicemember filesa motion within 60 days after leaving active military service and can demonstrate that militaryservice prejudiced his or her availability to appear in court (unless the default was based on a falseaffidavit by the plaintiff regarding military service of the defendant, in which case such a showingis unnecessary) and that there are meritorious or legal defenses to the suit. This is a change from theprevious SSCRA where the motion had to be filed within 30 days after leaving military service.", "This section does not provide a means to challenge judgments resulting from cases in which the servicemember made an appearance before the court. Some courts have found that acommunication to the court regarding the servicemember's military status, and the resultingapplicability of the SCRA to the suit, constitutes an appearance and bars the servicemember fromasserting certain defenses, (21) such as a lack ofjurisdiction of the court over the servicemember, andnegates the servicemember's right to petition to have the judgment overturned. An informalcommunication, such as a letter or a telegram to the court asking for protection under the SCRAshould not be counted as an appearance, (22) butsome courts have found that a letter from a legalassistance attorney constitutes an appearance, waiving the servicemember's protection against adefault judgment. An appearance by defendant's counsel may also waive protection, unless thecounsel was appointed pursuant to this section.", "Subsection (h) contains a provision to protect the rights of a bona fide purchaser by stating that vacating, setting aside, or reversing any judgment under the Act will not impair any right or titleacquired by any bona fide purchaser for value under the judgment.

Courts have been divided as to how to allocate the burden of proofregarding the issue of whether the servicemember's ability to appear in court is \"materially affected\"by military duty. Courts must also take into account the interests of the opposing party. While a stayis a reasonable imposition upon an individual citizen on behalf of those discharging their obligationsto the common defense, it is not available to shield wrongdoing or lack of diligence or to postponerelief indefinitely, or to be used to stay proceedings in matters where the interests or safety of thegeneral public may be at stake. Courts may deny a stay in cases involving purely legal issues orwhere the servicemember is not the true party in interest, in which the servicemember's presence isnot essential.

Therefore, a servicemember mayapply for relief without waiving the right, for example, to assert that the court has no jurisdiction inthe case. Moreover, additional stays may be granted based on continuing material effect of militaryduty on the servicemember. If additional stays are denied, the court must appoint counsel to representthe servicemember.

Even if no stayis in effect, the court has the discretion to relieve an active duty servicemember of the obligationsto pay any fines or penalties for failing to carry out the terms of a contract if that person's ability topay the fines and penalties or to carry out the terms of the contract is impaired by active militaryservice.", "Stay of enforcement.", "Sec. 204 (50 U.S.C. app. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 524).
