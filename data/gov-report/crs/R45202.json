The federal budget recorded a deficit of 9.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2009, the largest value since World War II. Subsequent improvement of the economy and implementation of policies designed to lower spending have improved the short-term budget outlook, though federal deficits remain at relatively high levels.

They are not meant to predict future budget outcomes. Baseline projections are included in both the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution. It is important to understand the assumptions and components included in budget baselines. In some cases, slight changes in the underlying models or assumptions can lead to large effects on projected deficits, receipts, or expenditures. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes current-law baseline projections using assumptions set out in budget enforcement legislation. On the revenue side of the budget, the 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ; see additional discussion below) enacted several changes to individual and corporate income tax rates and to other tax policy provisions that are set to expire before the end of the 10-year budget baseline window. On the spending side, baseline discretionary spending levels are largely constrained by the caps and automatic spending reductions enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and further modified on several occasions, most recently with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ). ", "Since the CBO baseline assumes that current law continues as scheduled, it incorporates policy provisions in current law that have historically been revised before taking effect. Specifically, the CBO baseline assumes that discretionary budget authority from FY2019 through FY2021 will be restricted by the caps as created by the BCA as amended, and that certain tax policy changes enacted in the 2017 tax revision and in other laws will expire as scheduled under current law. This leads to baseline projections of lower spending and higher revenue levels relative to a baseline that would reflect policy changes some would consider likely given past actions (sometimes referred to as a \"current policy\" baseline). ", "In addition to these elements of current law, macroeconomic assumptions, including those related to GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, will also affect the baseline estimates and projections. Minor changes in the economic or technical assumptions that are used to project the baseline also could result in significant changes in future deficit levels.", "A summary of budget outcomes in the latest CBO baseline is provided in Table 1 . CBO's current baseline projections, released in April 2018, show rising budget deficits over the next several years. This represents a reversal from the significant declines in inflation-adjusted deficits experienced in the past few fiscal years. Those declines were primarily due to continued increases in employment (which increased revenues collected from income and payroll taxes) and reductions in discretionary spending. While the baseline projections include continued declines in discretionary outlays, those reductions are more than offset by increases in mandatory spending. Mandatory spending increases are largely due to the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare programs, and declines in federal revenues.", "Baseline projections also include increases in debt held by the public (or debt held by all entities other than the federal government) throughout the 10-year budget window. Debt held by the public finances budget deficits and federal loan activity, and is a function of three things: (1) the size of existing debt, (2) economic growth, and (3) interest rates. Debt held by the public was 76.5% of GDP at the end of FY2017, and is projected to be 96.2% of GDP at the end of FY2028.", "CBO also provides projections based on alternative policy assumptions, which illustrate levels of spending and revenue if current policies continue rather than expire as scheduled under current law. If discretionary spending increased with inflation after FY2018 instead of proceeding in accordance with the limits instituted by the BCA and tax reductions in the 2017 tax revision are extended, CBO projects an increase in the budget deficit of almost $2,400 billion relative to the current-law baseline, exclusive of debt servicing costs, over the FY2019 to FY2028 period. Beyond the 10-year forecast window, federal deficits are expected to grow unless major policy changes are made.

Between FY2009 and FY2012, spending and revenue deviated significantly from historical averages, primarily as a result of the economic downturn and policies enacted in response to financial turmoil. In FY2017, the U.S. government spent $3,982 billion and collected $3,316 billion in revenue.

In the ensuing decades discretionary spending as a share of the economy underwent a gradual decline, and totaled 6.1% of GDP in FY2000. Discretionary spending increased in most years between FY2000 and FY2010, largely due to increases in security spending and federal interventions designed to stimulate the economy, and peaked in FY2010 at 9.1% of GDP. Discretionary spending fell from FY2010 through FY2017, due to both the wind down of stimulus programs and the implementation of restrictions established by the BCA. In FY2017, discretionary spending totaled 6.4% of GDP. CBO's most recent forecast projects short-term increases in discretionary spending, largely due to enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ). BBA 2018 allowed for large increases in discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019. Baseline forecasts subsequently include projections of lowered discretionary spending levels in FY2020 (the first year with spending caps unaffected by BBA 2018) and beyond. By FY2021, discretionary spending is projected to fall to 5.9% of GDP, which would be its lowest level ever; discretionary spending is projected to total 5.4% of GDP by FY2028.

Mandatory spending was a much smaller source of outlays than discretionary spending in earlier years, totaling just 4.7% of GDP in FY1962. Over time the share of mandatory spending has consistently grown, initially due to the increase in subscription in large mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare and then due to demographic and economic shifts that further increased the sizes of those programs. Mandatory spending totaled 13.2% of GDP in FY2016, up from 9.4% of GDP in FY2000. Mandatory spending peaked in FY2009 at 14.5% of GDP. Mandatory spending levels during the FY2009-FY2012 period were elevated mainly because of increases in outlays for income security programs as a result of the recession. The continuing economic recovery has resulted in lower mandatory spending on certain programs. Mandatory spending is projected to increase beginning in FY2019 due to growth in certain entitlement programs.

Under this scenario, the FY2019 deficit is projected to total $0.969 trillion (4.6% of GDP), the FY2028 deficit is projected to be $1,378 billion (4.3% of GDP), and cumulative deficits are projected to be $11,540 billion over the FY2019-FY2028 period.", "The other deficit projection, the proposed budget, illustrates the effect on the budget outlook if all of the policies proposed in the budget are implemented. In FY2019, the Administration projects that the deficit will reach $984 billion (4.7% of GDP). Under the proposed budget, deficits would steadily decrease from FY2021 through FY2028, producing a budget deficit of $363 billion (1.1% of GDP) in FY2028. The net budget deficit from FY2019 through FY2028 totals $7,095 billion in the proposed budget. Neither projection incorporates the budgetary effects of BBA 2018, which was enacted just prior to the budget release. CBO estimated that BBA 2018 would increase FY2018-FY2027 deficits by a combined $252 billion relative to current law, exclusive of debt servicing costs. Figure 4 illustrates how federal deficits in the President's pre-policy and proposed budgets compare to current law (CBO baseline) over the next decade.

In FY2019, the President's budget would leave the defense cap unchanged while decreasing the nondefense cap by $57 billion; both caps were recently modified by BBA 2018.

The debt limit is currently suspended through March 2019, at which time it is to be reinstated to accommodate federal borrowing levels. If faced with a nearly binding debt limit, Treasury may choose to enact extraordinary measures to postpone when the debt limit binds. Short-run budget surpluses in March and April of that year (primarily from the receipt of annual income tax returns) mean that extraordinary measures enacted in March will likely postpone a binding debt limit by several months. The latest CBO budget forecast projects a larger nominal budget deficit in FY2019 ($981 billion) than the federal deficit in FY2017 ($665 billion), which was the last year extraordinary measures were enacted in March. Such an increase may reduce the length of time extraordinary measures would postpone a binding debt limit relative to what was experienced in 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Considerations", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces long-term budget challenges. Occasional budget deficits are not necessarily problematic. Deficit spending can allow governments to smooth outlays and revenues to shield taxpayers and program beneficiaries from abrupt economic shocks in the short term, while also temporarily boosting GDP when the economy is underperforming. Persistent deficits, however, lead to growing levels of federal debt that may lead to higher interest payments and may also have adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term, including slowing investment and lowering economic growth. Indefinite growth of real debt will eventually lead to a borrowing crisis, though the timing of such an event is subject to great uncertainty. Reducing large deficits will require increases in taxes, reductions in spending, or both. ", "Some measures of fiscal solvency in the long term indicate that, under current policy, the United State faces major future imbalance, specifically as it relates to rising retirement and health care costs and the likely impact on government-financed health care spending. Existing deficit reduction policies like the BCA had improved recent and near-term deficits but do not make significant changes to the parts of the budget that are projected to grow the fastest in the long run. Therefore, many budget analysts believe that additional deficit reduction is required to put the budget on a sustainable path over the long term. CBO's current law baseline projects inflation-adjusted deficits (equal to 4.9% of GDP) from FY2019 through FY2028 despite a real economic growth rate averaging 1.8% per year over the same period: that combination of sustained economic growth and large federal deficits would be unprecedented in the postwar era. ", "CBO, GAO, and the Trump Administration agree that the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term. The nation's aging population, combined with rising health care costs per beneficiary, may keep federal health costs rising faster than per capita GDP. CBO projected in March 2017 that under current policy, federal spending on health programs (including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies) would grow from 5.5% of GDP in FY2017 to 8.8% of GDP in FY2047. A 2017 GAO report on fiscal health also cited health spending as a source of concern. Though these forecasts are highly uncertain, it seems probable that spending on these programs will rise as a share of GDP over time. ", "In addition, growing debt and rising interest rates are projected to cause interest payments to consume a greater share of future federal spending. CBO projects that under current law, spending to service the federal debt (net interest payments) will grow rapidly, from 1.4% of GDP in FY2017 to 5.2% of GDP in FY2047. GAO's recent long-term fiscal simulations, under an alternative policy scenario, projected that debt held by the public as a share of GDP would exceed the post-World War II historical high in the next 15 to 25 years.", "Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, or approximately at their historical average, and leaving fiscal policies unchanged, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, or reining in the costs of these programs. Under CBO's extended baseline, maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at today's level (77%) in FY2047 would require an immediate and permanent cut in non interest spending, increase in revenues, or some combination of the two in the amount of 1.9% of GDP (or about $380 billion in FY2018 alone) in each year. Maintaining this debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2047 would require additional deficit reduction. If policymakers wanted to lower future debt levels relative to today, the annual spending reductions or revenue increases would have to be larger. For example, in order to bring debt as a percentage of GDP in FY2047 down to its historical average over the past 50 years (40% of GDP), spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to generate net savings of roughly 3.1% of GDP (or $620 billion in FY2018) in each year.", "The alternative to decreased spending as a means of deficit reduction is to increase revenues through modifications to the federal tax system. The 2017 tax revision represented the latest major change to the federal tax code, and was estimated by CBO and JCT to reduce revenues over the FY2018-FY2027 period. CBO's latest budget and economic forecast projects that revenues as a percentage of GDP will be at or below their postwar average (17.2% of GDP) from FY2018 through FY2023 before reaching 18.5% of GDP in FY2028. Federal revenue levels toward the end of the 10-year baseline window will depend in part on whether the temporary tax provisions enacted as part of the 2017 tax revision expire as scheduled. ", "In the long run, increases in federal debt are constrained by the amount of remaining \"fiscal space,\" which is the amount of government borrowing that creditors are willing to finance. The amount of fiscal space available depends on the current size of the debt, how fast it is increasing relative to GDP, and the attractiveness of federal debt to investors relative to other market instruments. Changes in debt relative to GDP depend on the size of deficits, the government's borrowing rate, and how quickly the economy is growing. With continuously increasing debt levels, at some point debt would become so large that investors would no longer be willing to finance deficits and fiscal space would be exhausted. Exactly when investors would stop financing federal borrowing is uncertain. Because interest rates are presently lower than their historical averages, there is little current concern that the federal government is in danger of running out of fiscal space in the short run."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
