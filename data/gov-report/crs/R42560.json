Mexicans are the largest group of U.S. migrants across most types of immigration statuses\u2014a fact that may have important implications for how Congress makes U.S. immigration policy. This report reviews the history of immigration policy and migration flows between the countries and the demographics of Mexicans within the United States. It also analyzes contemporary issues in U.S. immigration policy and the impact Mexico may have on U.S. immigration outcomes.", "The U.S.-Mexican migration system has passed through four main phases since the early 20th century. Migration flows were limited and mainly short-term prior to the 1920s, and Mexicans were exempted from certain immigration restrictions and admitted as the first U.S. guest workers during World War I. The bilateral \"Bracero\" temporary worker program marked a second phase, with 4.6 million temporary visas issued to Mexican workers between 1942 and 1964. With the end of the Bracero program and other immigration reforms in 1965, along with social and economic changes in the United States and Mexico, the third stage was marked by growing illegal inflows, eventually leading Congress to pass the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Finally, despite a series of additional enforcement measures, the Mexican population in the United States doubled during each decade since 1970, with unauthorized migrants accounting for a majority of the growth, followed by legal family-based immigration.", "Today, the Mexico-born population in the United States stands at about 11.7 million people. Compared to other migrants, the Mexican born in the United States are more likely to be unauthorized, be younger, have lower education levels, work in lower-skilled occupations, and have lower measures of economic well-being. In contrast with earlier periods and virtually all other migrants, Mexicans are now dispersed throughout all 50 U.S. states.", "Given the size of the Mexico-born population in the United States and the 2,000-mile border shared between the two countries, Mexicans and Mexico are uniquely affected by U.S. immigration policies. Mexicans are the largest group of aliens subject to U.S. immigration control and border security policies, the largest group of lawful immigrants within permanent and temporary visa categories, and the majority of unauthorized migrants within the United States.", "On one hand, Mexico's prominence in the U.S. migration system means that U.S. immigration policy, to varying degrees, primarily affects Mexicans and Mexico. Today's Mexico-U.S. migration flows and the Mexico-born population in the United States are the product of previous immigration policy decisions, as well as of the long and complex history of the U.S. and Mexican economies, labor markets, and demographics. On the other hand, Mexico also remains at the center of today's immigration debate, though often only implicitly. Recognizing Mexico's status within the U.S. migration system focuses attention on how the U.S. immigration debate affects Mexico, and on how Mexico may affect certain migration outcomes.", "Mexico's role in the U.S. immigration system, along with the importance of the bilateral relationship to both countries, creates a number of opportunities, and challenges, as Congress weighs changes to U.S. immigration policy. First, Mexico already plays a key role in U.S. immigration enforcement and border security. The United States and Mexico share information about transnational threats, Mexico combats illegal migration by third country nationals, and Mexico supports certain U.S. enforcement efforts related to the repatriation of Mexican nationals. This report explores possibilities for additional bilateralism in these areas, including strategies to reduce recidivism among illegal migrants and to better manage U.S.-Mexican ports of entry.", "Second, with respect to lawful permanent immigration, Mexico benefits from rules that favor family-based flows, but still dominates the waiting lists of people with approved immigration petitions for whom visas have not yet been made available. The analysis here focuses attention on recent proposals to reduce visa backlogs and on other reforms that could affect the number of immigrant visas for Mexico.", "Third, Mexico dominates temporary visa categories for low-skilled workers, and an increasing number of Mexicans could also qualify for high-skilled worker visas. The report reviews previous experience with Mexico-specific temporary worker programs, which offer mixed lessons about managing flows this way.", "Additional policy considerations concern potential legalization proposals and efforts to reduce unauthorized emigration from Mexico. Given the large number of unauthorized Mexican migrants in the United States, Mexico could play a role in a potential legalization program, including by providing information to verify migrants' identities and by facilitating proposed \"touch-back\" requirements. Finally, in the long run, economic development and employment creation in Mexico are widely viewed as being among the best tools to reduce unauthorized emigration. While demographic and economic trends in Mexico likely have already contributed to reduced illegal outflows, the relationship between international trade and financial flows, U.S. economic assistance, and economic opportunities in Mexico may represent promising areas for policies to reduce illegal migration in the future.", "This report supplements other CRS research on Mexico (such as CRS Report RL32724, Mexico: Issues for Congress; and CRS Report R41349, U.S.-Mexican Security Cooperation: The M\u00e9rida Initiative and Beyond ) and on immigration (such as CRS Report R42036, Immigration Legislation and Issues in the 112th Congress; and CRS Report R42138, Border Security: Immigration Enforcement Between Ports of Entry)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Immigration policy has been an ongoing subject of congressional attention in recent years and a topic of concern for the U.S. public at large.

The INA does not set aside LPR visas for Mexico, but Mexicans are especially likely to take advantage of the law's family-friendly rules, with 122,686 Mexicans becoming LPRs as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or family-sponsored immigrants in FY2010 (see Figure 1 ). Overall, 88% of Mexicans were admitted in one of the family categories in 2010, compared to 67% of all LPRs.

Congress has considered a number of CIR bills and related proposals during this period, but none have been signed into law. Thus, legislative and administrative action during the last decade mainly has focused on new enforcement measures at the U.S.-Mexican border and within the United States; and a record number of unauthorized aliens have been removed in each year since 2003, with Mexicans accounting for almost three-quarters of all removals (see \" Immigration Enforcement and Border Security \")."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "History of Mexico-U.S. Migration and Policies", "paragraphs": ["This section describes how social, economic, and demographic factors in Mexico and the United States along with migration-related policies in both countries have produced four phases in the regional migration system: limited seasonal flows prior to World War II, the Bracero temporary worker program from 1942 to 1964, the emergence of a predominantly illegal system from 1965 through the 1980s, and the consolidation of that system along with increased family-based immigration since the 1990s.", "While seasonal migration by Mexican agricultural workers dates back to the 19 th century\u2014and while most of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah once belonged to Spain and later Mexico\u2014large-scale permanent immigration from Mexico to the United States is a recent phenomenon, as Figure 3 illustrates. Mexican LPR immigrants exceeded 1 million in a decade for the first time in the 1980s (the darker bars in Figure 3 ) and Mexicans accounted for more than 15% of total LPR inflows for the first time in the 1990s (the line in Figure 3 ). The lighter bars in Figure 3 depict U.S. census data on the total Mexican-born population living in the United States, which include legal immigrants, temporary nonimmigrants, and unauthorized migrants. As the figure illustrates, fewer than 1 million Mexicans lived in the United States as recently as 1970. ", "All of these Mexican migration and population trends increased markedly beginning around the 1970s, however, with legal immigration (LPR inflows) and the total Mexico-born population living in the United States both roughly doubling during each decade beginning in 1970. Even as growth rates slowed after 2000, the Mexico-born population in the United States climbed to 11.5 million people by 2009. In contrast with earlier periods, in which the migration system was dominated by short-term, seasonal, migration for agricultural work in the U.S. Southwest, Mexican migrants in the United States today are equally divided by gender; most live permanently in the United States; they work overwhelmingly in non-agricultural occupations (see Table 3 ); and they are dispersed throughout the entire country (see Figure 6 ). ", "What explains the shift from relatively low immigration levels for the first two-thirds of the 20 th century to the rapid growth of Mexican migration since 1970? International migration is primarily a function of structural demographic, economic, and social forces. High birth rates and limited economic opportunities have been \"push factors\" that encouraged emigration from Mexico for most of this period; and plentiful employment opportunities, connections to family networks, and an aging population have been \"pulls factors\" within the United States\u2014though all of these push and pull factors are in flux. How these structural forces translate into migration outcomes also depends on migration-related policies in both countries that encourage or discourage international migration and that afford aliens different legal statuses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pre-World War II: Limited Seasonal Flows", "paragraphs": ["Push and pull factors propelling Mexico-U.S. migration were relatively limited in the early 20 th century. Transportation and social networks linking Mexicans to the United States were poorly developed, and migrant farm workers had limited access to labor markets beyond the four southwest border states. Violence and economic dislocation during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) resulted in additional migration, but also created opportunities within Mexico during the 1920s. U.S. demand for migrant workers plunged during the Great Depression as unemployment rates climbed to 25% in 1933, and remained above 15% until 1940. ", "With limited push-pull factors, agricultural employers lobbied to exempt Mexicans from tough overall immigration restrictions passed in 1917. Over the objection of labor advocates, Congress created the first U.S. guest worker program, allowing Mexican nonimmigrant admissions between 1917 and 1920, and then exempted Mexicans and other Western Hemisphere migrants from per-country immigration limits imposed on the rest of the world beginning in 1921.", "U.S. migration policy swung the other way in 1929, when tighter screening criteria for Mexican visa applicants produced a 75% reduction in LPR admissions. Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans and their U.S.-born children returned to Mexico during the Great Depression, including many who were deported. Mexico also discouraged emigration (i.e., migration to the United States) during this period, with a 1926 law requiring exiting workers to obtain permission from municipal authorities, and a series of public relations campaigns to discourage outflows and support return migration. As a result, the 1930s were the only decade in which net migration in the region flowed north to south."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1942-1964: The Bracero Program", "paragraphs": ["As the United States mobilized for World War II, agricultural employers demanded increased labor; but after a decade of limited inflows they struggled to recruit Mexican workers. Mexican officials continued to oppose new emigration, which they viewed as a drain on Mexican resources and\u2014based on the experiences of earlier migrants\u2014as a threat to workers' rights. U.S. officials viewed immigration through the lens of the war effort, including the need to strengthen U.S.-Mexican relations, and were deferential to Mexican concerns.", "Thus, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration initiated negotiations with Mexico for a bilateral guest worker program, which became known as the Bracero program (from the Spanish term for laborer). Under the resulting treaty, Mexican workers were guaranteed a minimum wage (unlike U.S. farm workers), health benefits, housing, and transportation expenses. The United States suspended the bilateral program in 1948, partly over objections to its labor-friendly provisions, but resumed it in 1951 when the Korean War prompted new fears of labor shortages. After the war, the United States demanded changes that weakened the program's labor protections.", "The Bracero program had a lasting impact on the Mexico-U.S. migration system. With nearly 50,000 farms employing more than 400,000 Mexicans a year at the program's peak in the late 1950s, strong constituencies on both sides of the border grew to favor labor flows. Both governments supported the program, including by developing a transportation infrastructure to move agricultural workers from the Mexican interior to the border region and beyond.

The Bracero program had issued 4.6 million visas by 1964, and so helped spark the transformation by fostering a new generation of migration-oriented Mexican workers, U.S. employers, and transnational labor recruiters. In its aftermath, a variety of national and global forces combined to hold down wages and to expand low-skilled employment opportunities in the United States, factors which created increased migration pulls. At the same time, high fertility rates in Mexico combined with an agricultural privatization program produced high levels of agricultural dislocation, rural-urban migration, and new job seekers in Mexico\u2014factors which together resulted in stronger migration pushes as well.", "With the end of the Bracero program, these stronger migration pushes and pulls coincided with fewer legal pathways for Mexican workers to enter the United States. Although Mexicans were eligible for H-2 temporary worker visas, the Department of Labor rejected many H-2 petitions in an effort to protect U.S. workers, and few employers used the program. The watershed 1965 amendments to the INA (P.L. 89-236) imposed the first numeric limits on Western Hemisphere immigration and prohibited unskilled seasonal/temporary workers from receiving employment-based LPR visas, a provision that mainly affected migrants from Mexico. The 1965 amendments also increased the priority of visas for family-based LPRs, which became the main pathway for legal immigration from Mexico (see Figure 4 ). ", "The convergence of growing migration push and pull factors and shrinking opportunities for legal low-skilled migration increased illegal migration from Mexico. The number of unauthorized aliens apprehended grew three-fold between 1965 and 1970, and the proportion of such aliens from Mexico increased from 50% to 80%. The imposition of numeric limits on permanent immigration produced a backlog of roughly 300,000 Mexican visa applicants by 1976, resulting in a two-and-a-half year wait for visas for qualified applicants. By 1979, an estimated 1.7 million unauthorized aliens resided in the United States, including 1.4 million from Mexico. ", "The House Committee on the Judiciary held a series of hearings on illegal migration beginning in 1971, and both chambers considered bills during the 1970s to discourage illegal immigration by penalizing employers of illegal aliens, among other proposals. Congress examined the issue for 15 years and then passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA, P.L. 99-603 ), which combined employer sanctions with a pair of legalization programs for certain unauthorized aliens and a 50% increase in border patrol staffing, among other provisions. A total of about 2.6 million people eventually were legalized through IRCA, including about 2.1 million Mexican migrants (81%, see Figure 4 ). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1990s-Present: Heightened Push-Pull Factors and Immigration Control", "paragraphs": ["Push and pull factors on both sides of the border remained strong in the quarter-century after IRCA. Globalization exerted downward pressure on U.S. wages and the continued shift to lower-skilled production, driving up demand for foreign workers in new types of occupations and in regions far away from the U.S.-Mexican border. Mexico enjoyed periods of rapid economic development, but employment creation did not keep pace with population growth as children born during Mexico's baby boom of the 1960s and 1970s entered the workforce during the 1980s and 1990s; and many Mexicans continued to see emigration as the most viable path to higher wages. By the 1990s, social scientists described U.S. employers and Mexican workers as \"structurally dependent\" on migration, meaning that migration had become a core feature of the regional labor market, regardless of cyclical wage and employment trends. ", "Congress responded to these trends by passing four additional laws focused on illegal migration in the decade after the 1986 IRCA, authorizing additional investments in border security, restricting migrants' access to welfare and other public benefits, and streamlining procedures to remove unauthorized aliens. Border enforcement and migration control received additional attention after the 9/11 attacks, with Congress passing five more laws related to immigration control in 2002-2006. Overall, U.S. spending on migration control and related activities increased from about $1.2 billion in 1986 to about $17.4 billion in FY2012.", "At the same time, immigration reforms sought to reduce low-skilled employment-based inflows. The Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 ) and the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( P.L. 105-100 , Title II) reduced the total number of low-skilled LPR visas from 29,000 to 5,000 per year. IRCA provided for an unlimited number of temporary agricultural workers through the H-2A visa program, but many employers considered the program too cumbersome to use, and fewer than 10,000 H-2A workers were admitted per year prior to the mid-1990s. ", "The 1990 Immigration Act also reaffirmed the commitment to family reunification as the chief goal of U.S. immigration policy, and immigrants from Mexico have been the top beneficiaries of this policy. Section 101 of P.L. 101-649 raised the numerical limits on family-sponsored immigration by establishing an annual floor of at least 226,000 immigrants to be admitted within these categories. Section 102 exempted the spouses and children of LPRs (\"second preference immigrants\") from the INA's 7% per-country ceiling, a provision that mainly benefits Mexicans since few other countries approach the 7% limit, and Mexico is the only such country with a large number of second preference immigrants. And Section 112 set a special allotment of 55,000 visas each year from FY1992 through FY1994 for spouses and children of LPRs who had legalized through IRCA. Thus, during the first decade the 1990 act was in effect, Mexicans made up 37% of all second preference spouses and children and 70.5% of all spouses and minor children of LPRs who had legalized through IRCA. Overall, 52% of all second preference spouses and children of LPRs admitted during FY2000-FY2009 came from Mexico.

Beginning in the late 1990s, however, increasing migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border, the precarious situation of unauthorized Mexican migrants in the United States, and attention to human rights abuses of Central Americans in Mexico led the Mexican government to take a more active approach to migration issues, including by reforming its own migration policy and by engaging with the United States about U.S. immigration policy. ", "The Administration of Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n and the Mexican Congress have taken significant steps to overhaul Mexico's migration policies. Previously, Mexico's immigration law, the General Population Act (GPA) of 1974, limited legal immigration and restricted the rights of foreigners in Mexico, with unauthorized migrants subject to criminal penalties. In 2008, the Mexican Congress reformed the GPA to decriminalize simple migration offenses, making unauthorized migrants subject to fines and deportation, but no longer subject to imprisonment. That year the Calder\u00f3n government also announced a new strategy and authorized more than $200 million in new investments to improve security conditions, modernize customs and immigration facilities, and promote development in Mexico's southern border region (also see \" Reducing Unauthorized Emigration from Mexico \"). In 2010, Mexico passed a law increasing penalties for alien smuggling, particularly abuses committed by public officials. ", "Mexico's recent migratory reform efforts likely hinge on how well the government implements a new version of the GPA that was unanimously approved by the Mexican Congress and signed by President Calder\u00f3n in May 2011. Some of the main objectives of the law are (1) to guarantee the rights and protection of all migrants in Mexico; (2) to simplify Mexican immigration law in order to facilitate legal immigration; (3) to establish the principles of family reunification and humanitarian protection as key elements of the country's immigration policy; and (4) to concentrate immigration enforcement authority within the federal Interior Ministry in order to improve migration management and reduce abuses of migrants by public officials. The law guarantees that all migrants have access to education, justice, and healthcare services, and limits the time that unauthorized migrants may be held in detention centers to 15 working days. The law also gives legal status to special government \"Beta Groups\" that assist migrants in distress and establishes special procedures for how children and other vulnerable groups should be treated.

Unauthorized migrants accounted for about 60% of the increase. Yet Mexican migration flows have declined since 2006, and recent data from multiple sources show a net rate of unauthorized migration fluctuating near zero, with some evidence that more Mexicans are leaving the United States than arriving, particularly unauthorized Mexicans. Researchers attribute this decline to the U.S. recession, stepped-up U.S. border security and interior enforcement, increasing abuses of migrants by smugglers and transnational criminal organizations, and expanding job opportunities in Mexico, among other factors. Some researchers also have found evidence that the high cost of crossing the border has encouraged some unauthorized migrants to remain in the United States for longer periods of time rather than returning to Mexico on a seasonal basis.", "In addition to these short-term factors, lower Mexican emigration rates also may be a function of long-term demographic trends, as Mexico's fertility rate has fallen from an average of 7.2 children per woman in 1960 to about 2.2 today. Thus, while emigration from Mexico may increase with U.S. economic growth, some analysts doubt that future flows will reach the high levels observed in recent years because many fewer Mexicans will enter the workforce and because Mexico is becoming an increasingly middle-class country.

One study in December 2010 estimated that 230,000 Mexicans had been displaced by violence, and that roughly half of them had moved to the United States. Media reports indicate that some Mexicans who feared that they could be victims of the violence have sought asylum in the United States.", "CRS analyzed several data sources that could reflect increased flows by people fleeing violence in Mexico and found ambiguous results. U.S. asylum and nonimmigrant visa data do not show increasing Mexican inflows in these categories between FY2005 (the year before the recent surge in trafficking-related violence) and FY2010. Yet there is some evidence of a growing number of \"credible fear\" claims during this period and of a higher approval rate for such claims, with most of the increase occurring in FY2010. Some middle and upper class Mexicans also may be entering through other legal channels not reflected in these data, including as LPRs.

Subsistence farmers and indigenous communities in northern Mexico have been particularly hard hit, with 200,000 people reportedly fleeing their homes for feeding centers.

Although the migration talks fell off the bilateral agenda after the 9/11 attacks, the pillars of the framework agreement remained at the center of the U.S. immigration debate.", "At the same time, migration has also been a source of bilateral tension. Some people are concerned about the impact of low-skilled immigration on the U.S. economy and about illegal migration, and many Mexican migrants fall into these categories (see \" Mexicans in the United States \").

The border patrol's strategy has been designed to discourage aliens from entering the United States at traditional illegal crossing points and to funnel illegal crossers to ports of entry (POEs), where they are subject to inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, or to remote areas, where difficult terrain and the absence of a transportation infrastructure give border patrol agents a tactical advantage in apprehending illegal crossers.", "This approach has resulted in substantial enforcement resources at the U.S.-Mexican border. Since the strategy was initiated beginning in FY1994 through FY2011, the number of border patrol agents posted on the Southwest border has increased from 3,747 to 18,506; the United States has installed fencing along 651 miles of the border; and over $1 billion has been spent to develop an integrated border surveillance system, with mixed results. In addition, Presidents George W. Bush and Obama both ordered National Guard troops to be deployed to the U.S.-Mexican border, and six unmanned aircraft systems now operate there.", "Since 2005, a second key feature of border enforcement has been a policy CBP describes as its \"consequence delivery system.\" Whereas immigration agents historically returned most aliens apprehended at the U.S.-Mexican border to Mexico with minimal processing, an increasing proportion of such aliens now are subject to formal removal, face immigration-related criminal charges, or are repatriated to Mexico at a remote location rather than the nearest POE (also see \" Efforts to Reduce Illegal Migrant Recidivism \"). The goal of these enhanced consequences is to raise the costs to aliens of being apprehended and to make it more difficult for them to reconnect with smugglers in Mexico following a failed entry attempt.", "The United States also conducts interior immigration enforcement, with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) taking the lead on efforts to identify, detain, and remove unauthorized migrants and certain other aliens from within the United States.

From the time of its inception in 2005 through the end of FY2011, OASISS referred 2,617 cases to Mexican authorities.

Since that time, all of Mexico's states have enacted code reforms that criminalize at least some forms of human trafficking. Since 2007, the State Department has removed Mexico from its human trafficking watch list and ranked Mexico as a \"Tier 2\" country (i.e., the second-best out of four categories) in its annual Trafficking in Person s (TIP) reports, reflecting this progress. In 2011, President Calder\u00f3n proposed a series of constitutional reforms that would require those accused of trafficking to be held in prison during their trials and guarantee the anonymity of victims involved in TIP cases. The Mexican Congress recently approved a new law against trafficking that amends the 2007 federal anti-TIP law and includes prison sentences of up to 40 years for people convicted of sexual exploitation. Yet the Mexican Congress also cut funding for anti-TIP efforts and for the Attorney General's Office in the 2012 budget, which could weaken Mexico's ability to prosecute TIP cases.

The United States also could include migration control as an explicit priority within other existing programs, such as the M\u00e9rida Initiative, which focuses on combating drug trafficking-related organized crime. On the other hand, Mexico is already among the largest recipients of U.S. anti-TIP assistance in the Western Hemisphere, and some Members of Congress may be reluctant to invest more resources in such programs.

The Mexican Interior Repatriation Program (MIRP) is a voluntary program established in 2003 to allow certain unauthorized aliens apprehended in Arizona during the summer months to fly to Mexico City and take a bus to their communities of origin, rather than being returned to the border. The MIRP is designed to prevent migrant deaths in the desert, to remove deportees from precarious conditions in northern border cities, and to reduce recidivism. About 125,000 individuals participated in the Interior Repatriation Program between 2004 and 2011, with the United States covering most program expenses. The countries announced plans in February 2012 to expand the interior repatriation program to other regions of the border beginning in 2012.

Under ATEP, certain Mexicans are removed to locations hundreds of miles away from the point of apprehension\u2014typically involving the movement of people apprehended in Arizona to POEs in Texas or California. CBP sees the program as a way to disrupt migrant smuggling networks and discourage recidivism, but the program is controversial in Mexico because persons repatriated through ATEP may find themselves effectively stranded in border communities without resources to find employment or to return home. In cases involving serious criminal aliens, ICE has responded to a request from Mexico to remove certain people apprehended near El Paso, TX, to locations other than Mexico's Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in order to avoid exacerbating high levels of violence there. As security conditions in other border cities have deteriorated, however, it has become increasingly difficult for U.S. and Mexican officials to find places to send criminals, particularly those with felony convictions. In addition, whereas ICE historically provided limited biographical information to INM officials regarding criminal (and non-criminal) aliens removed to Mexico, under a 2010 agreement DHS shares criminal histories with Mexico about Mexicans who have been convicted of certain serious felonies in the United States and are being removed to Mexico.

The experience of IRCA has cast a shadow on these debates: while some people view the 1986 law as a partial success for having helped weave millions of previously unauthorized aliens into the fabric of the United States, others oppose legalization, and IRCA ultimately failed to fulfill one of its primary goals: to stop the flow of illegal migration.

Whether such a program would provide unauthorized aliens the opportunity for LPR status or for a temporary visa would have an impact on Mexico's demography and economy.", "The handling of those aliens deemed ineligible for legalization could also benefit from a bilateral agreement. For example, Mexico could assist with the identification of unauthorized Mexicans within the United States, many of whom lack up-to-date travel documents. Some previous legalization proposals contained a requirement that foreign nationals return home to obtain return visas (i.e., a \"touch back\" provision), and coordination and cooperation with Mexico could facilitate an orderly \"touch back\" process. ", "On the other hand, the United States alone would determine who among millions of unauthorized aliens may be eligible for legalization. While Mexico would be a large stakeholder in any legalization program, such a program would not require an agreement with Mexico; and some may argue that a bilateral legalization program would not be in the national interest.

IRCA established a Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development charged with \"consult[ing] with the governments of Mexico and other sending countries in the Western Hemisphere\" and \"examin[ing] the conditions in Mexico and such other sending countries which contribute to unauthorized migration to the United States.\" The commission concluded that economic development stimulates migration in the short term by raising expectations and providing people with the resources to emigrate, but that economic development and job creation are \"the only way to diminish migratory pressures over time.\"", "As part of its poverty-alleviation efforts, Mexico has supported cash remittances from migrants in the United States to migrant communities of origin in Mexico. Such remittances exceed $20 billion annually, and have become a key source of income for many households. In particular, Mexico has helped migrants gain access to banks and other formal remittance channels rather than using informal money transfer systems, which are less reliable and which typically charge high fees to transfer funds. Since 2002, the Mexican government also has supported the \"3 X 1 Citizen's Initiative.\" Under this program, remittances sent from Mexican home town associations (HTAs) in the United States are matched dollar for dollar by each level of the Mexican government (municipal, state, and federal). In 2005, Western Union began to contribute its own matching funds for a \"4+1\" matching program to support micro-enterprise initiatives funded by HTAs. The 3 X 1 program remains limited in scope, however, with a federal budget of about $38 million in 2010, compared to total remittance flows of about $22.6 billion that year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Economic Assistance and Mexican Emigration", "paragraphs": ["The United States provided about $178 million in foreign assistance to Mexico in FY2011, including about $25 million in development aid and $143 million under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Should foreign assistance to Mexico be focused on creating alternatives to emigration? ", "Some people have suggested that the United States should support development projects in Mexico to discourage unauthorized emigration. One suggestion is to have the U.S. Agency for International Development support farmer-to-farmer exchange programs to connect rural farmers' cooperatives in Mexico with Mexican farmers in the United States. Another possibility would be to expand the mandate of the North American Development Bank from environmental infrastructure projects to also include broader development goals. Yet as an upper middle-income developing country by World Bank standards, Mexico does not receive large amounts of U.S. development aid. Moreover, using economic assistance as a tool to reduce emigration may be challenging because even if economic development creates jobs and reduces emigration in the long run, development may be associated with increased migration flows in the short run as a result of rising expectations and market dislocations. ", "The United States also supports Mexican counter-narcotics efforts through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Given evidence that drug trafficking-related violence may contribute to unauthorized emigration, strengthening the social fabric in violence-prone communities could help reduce such flows. Whereas U.S. assistance under the M\u00e9rida Initiative initially focused on training and equipping Mexican counterdrug forces, it now targets the weak law enforcement institutions and underlying societal problems that have allowed the drug trade to flourish in Mexico. Pillar four of the \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" framework aims to build strong and resilient communities that can withstand the pressures of crime and violence, thereby mitigating citizens' needs to emigrate for safety. Congress could consider migration dynamics in the design of such programs in the future. ", "On the other hand, some people may object as a matter of principle to any effort to target U.S. funding to Mexican emigration communities.

This history directs attention to policy choices being made today. Many of the core issues in the U.S. immigration debate\u2014including efforts to strengthen migration control and border security, possible reforms to the lawful permanent resident and nonimmigrant visa systems, and proposals to legalize certain unauthorized migrants\u2014have important implications for both countries. The United States and Mexico also may share common interests around some of these issues, such as combating smuggling and other transnational crime, encouraging circularity among temporary workers, promoting the orderly repatriation of unauthorized Mexicans and criminal aliens, and generally reducing unauthorized migration.", "Thus, as in the past, some people in the United States may see reasons to treat Mexico as a \"special case\" on certain immigration questions. From this perspective, previous Mexico-U.S. migration policies not only help explain the scope of contemporary flows, but also set a precedent for those who may favor taking a bilateral approach. These factors also get at the practical argument for Mexico-specific policies: the sheer size of the bilateral flow and Mexico's status as America's continental neighbor mean that bilateral policies may offer promising opportunities for more effective migration enforcement and more efficient management of flows.", "These potential advantages underlay the 2001 framework agreement between George W. Bush and Vicente Fox that would have included a Mexico-specific temporary worker program, collaborative border enforcement, legalization for certain unauthorized Mexicans in the United States, and new investments in Mexican communities of origin aimed at reducing illegal outflows. The United States and Mexico may continue to see opportunities to better manage migration flows and control unauthorized migration through collaborative approaches to these issues, as discussed above.", "On the other hand, a truly collaborative approach to bilateral migration issues along these lines would require a high level of mutual trust. Some people may question whether Mexico would be a reliable partner in a bilateral visa program, border enforcement, or port security\u2014nor is it clear that Mexico would be willing to take on such a role in all of these cases. At a minimum, any major changes in the U.S.-Mexican migration relationship likely would require that the countries first achieve greater success in combating illicit drugs and reducing the violence associated with the drug trade.", "In the long run, the future of the U.S.-Mexican migration relationship depends in great part on economic and demographic trends in both countries, and their impact on regional migration flows. What will be the shape of the U.S. economic recovery, and will U.S. employers continue to demand high levels of low-skilled migration? Will emigration from Mexico pick back up with the U.S. economic recovery, perhaps including more higher-skilled migrants, or have economic and demographic changes in both countries ushered in a new period of lower regional flows? As in the past, it will be a combination of these structural factors and of policy decisions in both countries that influences Mexico-U.S. migration flows.", "Appendix A.
