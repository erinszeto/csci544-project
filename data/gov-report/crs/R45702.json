Unlike the Administration's FY2019 budget, which proposed a new account structure for NASA, the FY2020 budget proposal does not appear to include a realignment of items that would be funded from these accounts. ", "The annual CJS appropriations act traditionally includes an obligation cap of funds expended from the Crime Victims Fund (CVF). The Administration's FY2020 budget does not include a proposed obligation cap for the CVF.

Within this amount, $492.5 million would be for the OVW, $10.0 million would be for oversight of OVC programs by the OIG, $12.0 million would be for developing innovative crime victims services initiatives, and a set-aside of up to $115.0 million would be for tribal victims assistance grants. From the remaining amount, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) would provide formula and non-formula grants to the states to support crime victim compensation and victims services programs.", "Also, the Administration's budget includes a proposal to transfer all of the ATF's responsibilities related to alcohol and tobacco enforcement to the Department of the Treasury's Tax and Trade Bureau.

The data show that nominal funding for CJS reached a 10-year high in FY2019, though in inflation-adjusted terms, funding for FY2019 was lower than it was in FY2010.", "There is a cyclical nature to total nominal funding for CJS because of appropriations for the Census Bureau. Overall funding for CJS traditionally starts to increase a few years before the decennial census, peaks in the fiscal year in which the census is conducted, and then declines immediately thereafter. This is discussed in more detail below.", "Increased funding for CJS also coincides with increases to the discretionary budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ). The BCA put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. Under the act, discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until FY2021. However, legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for FY2014 to FY2019. A sequestration of discretionary funding, ordered pursuant to the BCA, cut $2.973 billion out of the total amount Congress and the President provided for CJS for FY2013. Since then, funding for CJS has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the BCA. ", " Figure 2 shows total CJS funding for FY2010-FY2019 by major component (i.e., the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, NASA, and the NSF). Although decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce (a 47.4% reduction) mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations from FY2010 to FY2013, cuts in funding for DOJ (-8.7%) and NASA (-9.8%) also contributed. Funding for NSF held relatively steady from FY2010 to FY2013.", "Overall CJS funding has increased since FY2014, and this is partially explained by more funding for the Department of Commerce to help the Census Bureau prepare for the 2020 decennial census. While funding for the Department of Commerce decreased from FY2018 to FY2019, it is partly the result of the department receiving $1.000 billion in emergency supplemental funding for FY2018. If supplemental funding is excluded, appropriations for the Department of Commerce increased 2.5% from FY2018 to FY2019. ", "While increased funding for the Department of Commerce partially explains the overall increase in funding for CJS since FY2014, there have also been steady increases in funding for DOJ (+11.5%), NASA (+21.8%), and NSF (+12.6%), as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies. Also, increased funding for the Department of Commerce is not only the result of more funding for the Census Bureau. Funding for NOAA increased by 41.0% from FY2014 to FY2018 and funding for NIST increased by 15.9% over the same time period. However, funding for both of these agencies decreased from FY2018 to FY2019, meaning that the increase in the Department of Commerce's funding during this time period was almost solely attributable to increased funding for the Census Bureau."], "subsections": []}]}}
