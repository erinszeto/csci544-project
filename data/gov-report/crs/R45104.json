", "In the late 1960s, Congress considered further revisions to the committee system. This internal congressional examination culminated in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. Pursuant to this act, the \"continuous watchfulness\" function of committees was transformed to one providing for \"legislative review.\" The act called for each standing committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives to ", "review and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration, and execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of that committee. ", "The 1970 act also formalized the requirement for periodic activity reports. A report accompanying the legislation summarized the linkage between the new role for committees and the reporting requirement, stating that ", "the intent of this requirement of a report every two years is to provide the House with an additional means of appraising the results of the legislation which it has approved and to emphasize the importance of the legislative review function of the House standing committees.", "The requirement for these reports, which appears at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7190d, was subsequently incorporated into the House and Senate Rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Required Contents of the Reports", "paragraphs": ["House Rules for the 115 th Congress state that the committee activity reports are to include", "separate sections summarizing the committee's legislative and oversight activities conducted pursuant to House Rule X and House Rule XI; a summary of the committee's oversight and authorization plans, which are required by House Rule X, clause 2(d); a summary of the actions taken and recommendations made with respect to these authorization and oversight plans; a summary of any additional oversight activities undertaken by a committee and any recommendations made or related actions; and a delineation of any hearings held on the topics of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement. Pursuant to clause 2 of House Rule XI, committees are required \"to hold at least one hearing during each 120-day period\" on these topics.
