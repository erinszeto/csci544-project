In FY2015, Mexico was the primary country of origin for foreign trafficking victims certified as eligible to receive U.S. assistance.

In 2012, the International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that there were some 20.9 million victims of forced labor, which includes trafficking in persons. Of these, the ILO estimates that some 1.8 million victims are in Latin America. In 2014, the ILO analyzed the financial value of forced labor and estimated that it results in roughly $12 billion in illegal profits annually in Latin America (out of a global estimate of $150 billion). The accuracy of these and other estimates, however, is difficult to assess given the clandestine nature of human trafficking.", "Internal trafficking generally flows from rural to urban or tourist centers within a given country, and trafficking across international borders generally flows toward more developed nations. Countries are generally described as source, transit, and/or destination countries for TIP victims. Research indicates that countries are more vulnerable to human trafficking if they have experienced political upheaval, armed conflict, economic crisis, or a natural disaster. For example, the hundreds of thousands of Haitian children who were orphaned after a catastrophic earthquake hit that country in January 2010 proved vulnerable to trafficking. Some assert that hosting major international events can exacerbate preexisting human trafficking problems, whereas others maintain that those fears may be overblown.", "This report describes the nature and scope of the problem of trafficking in persons in Latin America and the Caribbean. It then describes U.S. efforts to deal with trafficking in persons in the region and discusses recent country and regional anti-trafficking efforts.

Examples include sex trafficking, forced labor (including domestic servitude), and the use of child soldiers. Severe forms of TIP have been defined in U.S. law as \"sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or ... the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.\" Most members of the international community agree that the trafficking term applies to all cases of this nature involving minors, whether a child was taken forcibly or voluntarily. TIP does not require the movement of victims from one place to another, a concept that is still misunderstood by officials in some Latin American countries.

Trafficking in persons is often confused with human smuggling. Human smuggling involves the provision of a service, generally procurement of transport, to people who knowingly consent to that service to gain illegal entry into a foreign country. It ends with the arrival of the migrant at his or her destination. The Smuggling Protocol considers people who have been smuggled as willing participants in a criminal activity who should be given \"humane treatment and full protection of their rights\" while being returned to their country of origin.", "Many observers contend that smuggling is a \"crime against the state\" and that smuggled migrants should be deported, whereas trafficking is a \"crime against a person\" whose victims deserve to be given government assistance, protection, and immigration relief. The State Department asserts that the existence of \"force, fraud, or coercion\" is what distinguishes trafficking from human smuggling. Under U.S. immigration law, a trafficked migrant is a victim, whereas an illegal alien who consents to be smuggled is complicit in a criminal activity and may therefore be subject to prosecution and removal (deportation). ", "Distinguishing the difference between a trafficking victim and a smuggled migrant can be difficult, particularly in cases involving unaccompanied children. Since June 2014, the annual State Department Trafficking in Persons Report has identified migrants from Central America as vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico. A 2016 report by Polaris asserts that 34% of cases it recorded of Latin American women trafficked into sex slavery in the United States since 2007 involved smuggling-related recruitment methods. As those victims were in the process of being smuggled into the United States, they were either abducted and sold to human traffickers or told that they must labor against their will to pay back their smuggling debts.

In recent years, several factors have influenced emigration flows from Latin America and the Caribbean. Factors that have fueled Latin American migration to the United States include family ties, poverty and unemployment, political and economic instability, natural disasters, proximity, and crime and violence. Aside from proximity, those factors have also driven smaller emigration flows to Europe and Canada.", "Primary destination countries for Latin American immigrants have included the United States, Spain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and Britain. These countries, many with low birth rates and aging populations, came to rely on migrant laborers from Latin America in recent decades to fill low-paying jobs in agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and domestic service. At the same time, concerns about security, competition for jobs, and other issues related to absorbing large numbers of foreign-born populations have led many developed countries to tighten their immigration policies. These factors have led to a global rise in illegal immigration.", "In the Western Hemisphere, illegal migration flows have been most evident in Mexico, particularly along its 1,951-mile northern border with the United States and its southern border with Guatemala (596 miles) and Belize (155 miles). Whereas unauthorized migration flows from Mexico to the United States have decreased significantly since the mid-2000s, flows from Central America have increased. In FY2014, apprehensions of unauthorized Central American migrants along the southwestern border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) exceeded apprehensions of Mexicans for the first time. After declining in FY2015, by August 2016 apprehensions of family units from Central America had exceeded the record total reported in FY2014.", "As U.S. border security has tightened, illegal immigrants increasingly have turned to smugglers to lead them through Mexico and across the U.S.-Mexican border. U.S. officials estimate that 75%-80% of unaccompanied minors now travel with smugglers. To avoid detection by Mexican immigration agents, smuggling routes have become more dangerous and therefore more costly. Some smugglers have sold undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution to recover their costs. Illegal immigrants transiting Mexico often fail to report abuses committed against them by criminals or officials in their home countries or along their journey because of fears of deportation. There is also a lack of legal and psychological support provided to foreign trafficking victims in Mexico who likely would qualify for asylum.

According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the share of victims trafficked for forced labor outside the commercial sex industry in Latin America (44%) is higher than in Europe and Central Asia.

The State Department also has highlighted the vulnerability of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people to human trafficking. The factors that may \"push\" an individual toward accepting a risky job proposition in another country have been compounded by \"pull\" factors, such as the hope of finding economic opportunity abroad, which is fueled by television, Internet, and social media images of wealth in the United States and Europe.", "Outside factors contributing to human trafficking include the following: (1) the high global demand for domestic servants, agricultural laborers, sex workers, and factory labor; (2) political, social, or economic crises, as well as natural disasters occurring in particular countries, such as the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti; (3) lingering machismo (chauvinistic attitudes and practices) that tends to lead to discrimination against women and girls; (4) existence of established trafficking networks with sophisticated recruitment methods; (5) public corruption, especially complicity between law enforcement and border agents with traffickers and alien smugglers; (6) restrictive immigration policies in some destination countries that have limited the opportunities for legal migration flows to occur; (7) government disinterest in the issue of human trafficking; and (8) limited economic opportunities for women in Latin America. Although women have achieved the same (or higher) educational levels as men in many countries, women's employment continues to be concentrated in low-wage, informal-sector jobs.

Most of the research that does exist has focused, at least until recently, on trafficking in children for sexual exploitation. Trafficking of children for sexual exploitation is most common in countries that are both popular tourist destinations and centers of sex tourism. Street and orphaned children are particularly vulnerable to trafficking into the sex industry, although some children who have been trafficked live with their families and engage in commercial sex activity to contribute to household income. Other factors associated with children at risk of trafficking include poverty, infrequent school attendance, physical or sexual abuse, drug or alcohol addiction, and involvement in a criminal youth gang. ", "Children are also trafficked both internally and across international borders. State Department officials have estimated that as many as 1 million children may work as domestic servants in Latin America, many of whom are vulnerable to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Human trafficking of Haitian restavesks (domestic servants) has been of particular concern for many years. Latin American children also have been trafficked for illegal adoptions, for use as soldiers in armed conflict, and to work for organized criminal groups, sometimes as sex slaves. Forced recruitment into Central American gangs is a major problem in many communities.", "Finally, the ILO and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) have documented instances from across the region of children forced to work under dangerous circumstances in agricultural or mining industries. For example, a 2014 DOL report found continued evidence of the use of child labor in the production of a wide range of goods in many countries in Latin America. Examples of some of the goods cited in that report include bricks, gold, coffee, sugarcane, and other agro-export crops, as well as illicit crops such as coca. Although a 2013 ILO global report estimated that the number of child laborers had declined slightly in Latin America as compared to 2008, the report still estimated that 12.5 million children in the region worked, 9.6 million in hazardous conditions.

Children tend to be trafficked within their own countries, while young women may be trafficked internally or internationally, sometimes with the consent of their husbands or other family members. One study estimated that some 10,000 women from southern and central Mexico are trafficked for sexual exploitation to the northern border region of Mexico each year. State Department officials have estimated that tens of thousands of Latin Americans are trafficked internationally each year, with large numbers of victims coming from Colombia and the Dominican Republic, among others. According to a 2016 report by the United Nation's Children's Fund, a combination of gangs, crime families, and drug trafficking organizations run sex trafficking rings in Guatemala that may involve some 48,500 victims.", "There are also intraregional trafficking problems. Argentina and Brazil are destination countries for women trafficked from the Andes and from Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic. Panama has been a destination for women from Colombia and Central America, trafficked to work in the sex industry.

", "Until recently, more forced labor victims had been identified in South America and some parts of the Caribbean than in Central America. In Brazil, forced labor is most common in rural areas on cattle ranches; in logging and mining camps; and on plantations, where soybeans, corn, and cotton are produced. Indigenous peoples in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are particularly at risk of being trafficked for forced labor. Forced labor is used in the mahogany, brick-making, and gold-mining industries in the Amazonian regions of Peru and Ecuador. Illegal gold mines in Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and other countries have become hotspots for human trafficking. Migrants from Haiti who lack proper documentation in the Dominican Republic have been vulnerable to trafficking and other abuses.

Although the majority of these cases have involved trafficking for prostitution, a significant number have involved the agricultural sector. Annually some 1.5 million seasonal farm workers, mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean, plant and harvest produce in the United States.

With Barbados's signature, every country in the region is now a party to the U.N. TIP convention. Six countries passed new or amended anti-trafficking legislation in 2015, and several others created national TIP coordinators, task forces, or plans to guide anti-TIP programs and initiatives. ", "According to some, the general problem with the new international commitments, legal reforms, and human trafficking initiatives that have emerged in Latin America is that many countries appear to lack the resources and perhaps the political will to fund and implement their anti-trafficking programs. Many governments are facing other crime challenges (such as drug trafficking and gang violence) that they perceive as larger problems than human trafficking. Sometimes country efforts are thwarted by other factors, such as political instability, as in the cases of Haiti and Venezuela. Many countries have few, if any, shelters for trafficking victims and no follow-up plans to help victims after they return from overseas to their former residences. Mexico, a large, middle-income country, funds one federal government shelter for TIP victims. Public corruption is also a major obstacle to effective anti-trafficking programming, as there is often complicity between traffickers and corrupt border officials, customs agents, law enforcement personnel, and politicians. Finally, conviction and prosecution rates for TIP offenders are low compared to other regions, particularly for forced labor and domestic servitude."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues for Policy Consideration", "paragraphs": ["U.S. interests in Latin America are multiple and, at times, conflicting. These interests include strengthening democracy, promoting economic growth through free trade, stemming the flow of illegal narcotics and migrants, and cooperating on border security and antiterrorism measures. These broad interests either directly or indirectly affect all U.S. policy in the region and may at times conflict with specific human rights goals, such as fighting human trafficking. As is the case with many human rights issues, ethical concerns about human trafficking must be balanced against broader U.S. geopolitical goals and interests in each country. ", "Broader U.S. foreign policy goals may influence the TIP report and sanctions process in several ways. Some observers maintain that certain U.S. allies in the region could never be sanctioned for political reasons. Others contend that the repeated inclusion of Cuba on the Tier 3 list until 2014 constituted \"selective indignation\" on the part of the U.S. government. U.S. officials working in the region have noted that it is sometimes difficult to produce an unbiased account of government efforts against trafficking without being swayed by underlying foreign policy concerns. Others say that it is difficult to deal with trafficking in persons when a country is undergoing extreme political instability and that were TIP sanctions actually enforced, they might undermine the broader U.S. goals of preventing democratic breakdown in the hemisphere. Issues that may be considered when evaluating the implementation of U.S. anti-trafficking policies are discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aid Restrictions: Are They Useful?", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, no governments in Latin America except Cuba and Venezuela have been subject to partial or full restrictions on U.S. assistance for failing to meet the minimum standards of TVPA. Ecuador appeared on the Tier 3 list in both 2004 and 2005 but did not lose assistance. Some argue that restrictions will probably only be applied to countries already subject to sanctions\u2014such as North Korea\u2014and that threatening other countries aid cuts may actually encourage them to become less open to working with the United States. Others argue that this may be the case with China or Saudi Arabia, but most Latin American countries depend on good political and economic relations with the United States, as well as U.S. tourism, and fear the negative press that comes with a Tier 3 designation nearly as much as reduced U.S. assistance. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How to Measure Success", "paragraphs": ["It is often difficult to measure success in the fight against human trafficking. Many countries in Latin America have reported increases in the number of training courses provided, conferences held, and workshops convened as evidence of their commitment to combat human trafficking. However, as stated in the 2009 TIP report, the State Department prefers countries to focus on \"concrete actions\" when determining the adequacy of a particular country's anti-TIP efforts. Concrete actions include enacting new or amended TIP legislation; expanding victim assistance and prevention programs; and, perhaps most importantly, securing prosecutions, convictions, and prison sentences for TIP offenders. ", "Although many countries in Latin America have passed or amended their existing TIP laws, until very recently, the number of TIP-related arrests, prosecutions, and convictions remained low in comparison to other regions. Some have questioned the adequacy of the State Department's indicators. They maintain that more credit should be given to countries that are seeking to address the underlying factors that put people at risk for trafficking, such as gender and racial discrimination, violence against women and children, and economic inequality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, there were 1,744 prosecutions of suspected traffickers, up from 944 prosecutions last year. Convictions also increased, from 470 in 2014 to 663 in 2015. Although prosecutions and convictions are higher than five years ago, they still pale in comparison to Europe, which recorded 4,990 prosecutions and 1,692 convictions in 2015, and to South and Central Asia, which secured 6,915 prosecutions and 1,462 convictions. They also pale in comparison to the number of victims that have been identified in Latin America (9,661 in 2015 alone). ", "To continue improving enforcement of TIP legislation in Latin America, some observers have urged U.S. officials and other donors not to encourage countries to pass laws modeled entirely after those from other countries (such as the TVPA). Instead, countries should develop trafficking laws that respond to their particular TIP problems and law enforcement capacities. Once legislation is in place, more attention and resources may be needed to help countries implement that legislation, and that assistance may need to go beyond training for law enforcement and legal professionals. According to the State Department, some of the current laws in Latin America are insufficient. For example, Mexico's federal anti-TIP law defines human trafficking too broadly, thereby diluting the crime of trafficking. Costa Rica defines trafficking only as a movement-based crime. ", "Attention also may be needed to address broader weaknesses in criminal justice systems that hinder TIP investigations and prosecutions. Corruption could be addressed by stiffening penalties for police, border guards, or other officials caught assisting traffickers. Handling of victims could be improved by training and mentoring provided by external entities, such as UNODC or U.S. law enforcement, aimed at changing misperceptions that victims are complicit in crimes such as prostitution and reinforcing victims' need for specialized services and, if applicable, immigration relief. As previously mentioned, DOJ's OPDAT regularly mentors Mexican prosecutors who are now operating in an accusatorial justice system in which securing a victim's testimony may be crucial for obtaining a trafficking conviction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debates About Prostitution and Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["The current U.N. definition of TIP assumes that there are at least two different types of prostitution, one of which is the result of free choice to participate in the prostitution business and one that is the result of coercion, vulnerability, deception, or other pressures. Of these, only the latter type is considered TIP. Based on the TVPA, as amended, sex trafficking is not considered a \"severe form of TIP\" unless it is associated with commercial sex acts induced by force, fraud, or coercion or in which the person induced to perform such acts is a minor.", "Several groups in the United States have sought to redefine TIP to include all prostitution, but many countries have rejected those attempts. Proponents of this broader definition of TIP argue that prostitution is \"not 'sex work;' it is violence against women [that] exists because ... men are given social, moral and legal permission to buy women on demand.\" Several European and Latin American countries, which have legal or government-regulated prostitution, reject such a definitional change and argue that this broader definition would impede the capacity of the international community to achieve consensus and work together to combat trafficking.", "Some policymakers and researchers assert that prostitution and TIP are inextricably linked, with countries where prostitution is legal experiencing greater inflows of human trafficking. Others, including Amnesty International, maintain that legalizing prostitution and improving working conditions for sex workers reduces the pool of potential TIP victims and helps those workers gain access to police protection in the event they are victimized. Regardless of whether prostitution is legal or illegal, the State Department has reiterated the importance of not punishing victims of TIP who have been forced into prostitution for their actions, even in places where prostitution is illegal. The European Union and the Council of Europe have adopted that principle as part of their directives on combating human trafficking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forced Labor: Adequacy of Country Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Research suggests that although TIP for sexual exploitation is both a highly prevalent and particularly visible form of human trafficking, TIP for forced labor exploitation may account for a large, often unreported, and possibly growing share of TIP globally. Recent interest in forced labor as a form of TIP has sparked calls for greater research in analyzing the prevalence of forced labor, increased international efforts to combat this form of TIP, and more awareness to prevent and educate potential victims. The State Department's TIP reports since 2005 have placed an added emphasis on evaluating country efforts to combat trafficking for forced labor, and several other programmatic efforts to combat TIP for forced labor are under way at the State Department. Other international groups, particularly the ILO, also play a large role in efforts to combat forced labor. According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation, Brazil has been one of the countries recognized for its efforts to address forced labor despite not having as many resources as wealthier countries. It has done so by investigating businesses allegedly using slave labor and publicly holding those businesses accountable for their actions. ", "At a regional level, labor trafficking prosecutions and convictions went from one prosecution and one conviction in the 2007 reporting period to 369 prosecutions and 107 convictions in 2012, before falling back to 83 prosecutions and 26 convictions in 2015. Some Latin American countries have yet to broaden their anti-TIP efforts out from focusing largely on the commercial sexual exploitation of women and children. Even in countries with well-established efforts against forced labor, like Brazil, many perpetrators have been able to avoid jail time by paying fines to settle cases. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
