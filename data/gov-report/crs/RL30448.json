Even Start services include basic academic instruction and parenting skills training for the adults, and early childhood education for their children, along with necessary supplementary services such as child care or transportation. Generally, Even Start programs do not directly provide all of these services; rather, they establish networks of service providers, including Head Start programs and grantees under the Adult Education Act (AEA). Even Start is the only federal program specifically dedicated to providing services to both disadvantaged young children and their parents.", "The families served by Even Start programs are highly disadvantaged, with very low levels of education and income, and increasing proportions of them have limited English language skills.", "The Even Start program was reauthorized in the 106th Congress, in P.L. 106-554, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2001. ESEA Title I, Part B was renamed the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs and was reauthorized for five years beginning with an authorization of $250 million for FY2001. The reauthorizing language is largely the same as language contained in the Literacy Involves Families Together Act, H.R. 3222 (Goodling), which was passed by the full House on September 12, 2000. However, language in H.R. 3222 specifying that religious organizations should be treated the same as other nongovernmental organizations in the awarding of subgrants was not included in the final reauthorization language.", "P.L. 107-110 (the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001), the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization legislation, which was signed into law on January 8, 2002, moved the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs from Title I Part B of the ESEA to Subpart 3 of Title I Part B of the No Child Left Behind Act and extended the authorization period through FY2007. The only change to the program was an amendment allowing states to use funds for state-level activities to improve the quality of family literacy services provided (in addition to other previously authorized uses).", "The Even Start program's funding was reduced to $99 million for FY2006 (including the FY2006 across-the-board reduction). For FY2007, the Administration has requested no funding for the program, the House Committee on Appropriations has recommended $70 million in funding for the program, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations has recommended no funding for the program."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Provisions of Even Start", "paragraphs": ["The Even Start Family Literacy program, authorized by ESEA Title I, Part B, provides education and related services jointly to disadvantaged parents and their young children. The purpose of the program is to integrate early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills education into a \"unified family literacy program\" (ESEA Section 1201). An assumption underlying Even Start is that children whose parents have low literacy or basic education levels are more likely to be educationally successful if, in addition to receiving early childhood instruction themselves, their parents receive educational services plus instruction in how to help their children learn. Further, parents may be more motivated to participate in adult basic education programs if one of the purposes of such education is to support their children's educational development. While some other federal education programs\u2014such as ESEA Title I, Part A programs\u2014also provide services to both disadvantaged young children and their parents, Even Start is the only federal program specifically dedicated to this purpose.", "Under the Even Start legislation, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) is authorized to make grants to states for assistance to eligible entities\u2014consisting of a local educational agency (LEA) in collaboration with a community based organization, institution of higher education, or other agency or nonprofit organization\u2014for joint programs of education for children aged 0-7 years and their parents. In each participating family, at least one parent must be eligible to be served under the Adult Education Act (AEA)\u2014i.e., not enrolled in school and not a high school graduate (or equivalent)\u2014or, if a LEA provides the basic education component of the program, services may be provided to parents who are within the compulsory school age range for their state.", "Even Start program services must include adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, instruction to help parents support their child's education, recruitment, screening of parents, staff training, and home-based instruction. In addition, child care and transportation services may be provided, if these services are necessary and other funding sources are not available. Typically, Even Start programs do not directly provide all of these services, rather they establish networks of service providers, including Head Start programs and grantees under the AEA. Even Start programs must be coordinated with other programs with similar purposes, operate year-round, and be independently evaluated.", "Five percent of Even Start funds is reserved for programs serving migrant children plus the outlying areas and Indian tribes; and up to 3% is reserved for a national evaluation, technical assistance, and program improvement. Remaining appropriations provide Even Start grants to the states in proportion to ESEA Title I, Part A grants, with a state minimum of the greater of 0.5% of all grants, or $250,000.", "Up to 6% of state grants may be used for state administration and technical assistance. Local grants are made by state educational agencies (SEAs) based on recommendations by a review panel, consisting of an early childhood education specialist, an adult education specialist, and at least one additional member. Programs are to be in areas with high rates of poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, limited English proficiency, or disadvantaged children. Even Start grants are to be made for a period of up to four years, and may be renewed for up to four additional years. States receiving Even Start grants are required to develop \"indicators of program quality,\" to be used to monitor and improve Even Start programs in the state, and to determine whether to continue funding local programs. P.L. 106-554 , Title XVI, requires states to submit to ED their quality indicators for Even Start programs to be eligible for continued funding under the program. The federal share is generally limited to 90% for the first year, declining to 50% for the fifth, sixth and seventh years, and 35% for subsequent years. The federal share limitation may be waived if an entity would not otherwise be able to participate.", "Funding for the Even Start program grew from $14,820,000 in FY1989, the program's initial year, to $225,094,720 for FY2005 (including the FY2005 across-the-board reduction). The program's funding was significantly reduced to $99,000,000 in FY2006. See Table 1 for the program's complete funding history. This decrease in funding is likely to continue in FY2007.

The most recent available data (2000-2001) are based on program data for a period prior to changes required in the 2000 reauthorization of Even Start. These data indicate that Even Start programs tend to target families with children under age 5; 40% of participating children were 0-2 years old and 28% were 3-4 years old. The parents in the families served generally have low levels of education; for example in 2000-2001, 44% of parents had a 9 th grade or less level of education upon entering the program. Further, the income of participating families is typically quite low\u201484% of families had income below the federal poverty level. Only 23% of participating parents in 2000-2001 were employed. The share of participants who are Hispanic was 46% in 2000-2001, while 30% were white, 19% were African American, and the remaining 7% were Asian, Native American, Hawaiian, or Multi-Racial. The percentage of participants from non-English-language backgrounds is high\u201445% of new Even Start enrollees speak English as a second language. The top four reasons given by parents for enrolling in Even Start were a desire to improve their educational status (get a GED), their parenting skills, their ability to be a better teacher of their child, and their children's chance of future school success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Provided", "paragraphs": ["In most cases, Even Start programs do not directly provide all of the required services; rather they coordinate and integrate services provided by other agencies, especially early childhood education provided by Head Start or state preschool programs, or adult basic education provided by AEA grantees. The services most often provided directly by Even Start programs are early childhood education and parenting skills education. In addition to the core services that all Even Start programs must provide, the support services most often provided are child care, meals, transportation, and social services.", "The average federal budget for Even Start programs surveyed in 2000-2001 was $175,439. The average federal Even Start program expenditures per participating family was $4,708 in 2000-2001. The rates of actual participation in various Even Start activities by the families being served in 2000-2001 were 84% for adult education, 89% for parenting education and parent-child joint activities, and 95% for early childhood education; with 82% of families participating in all core services. Maintaining the intensity of services and rates of participation continue to be an issue\u2014about half of the Even Start families who joined Even Start between 1997-1998 and 2000-2001 left the program within 10 months. In 2000-2001, 17% of families who left Even Start did so because they had completed their education goals under the program. The majority of participants who left did so because of job conflicts, relocation, motivational issues, and other concerns (such as poor health, homelessness, etc.).", "Evidence from the research literature has indicated that children who participate in intensive high-quality services score higher on literacy measures. And, evidence from national Even Start evaluations has indicated that families participate more when more intensive services are offered. As a consequence Even Start projects have increased the amount of early childhood education and adult education services offered. However, most Even Start parents do not use all the hours of services available for themselves and their children. For example, in 2000-2001, on average, children birth to two received 30% of the service hours made available. For children aged 3 and 4, 5, and school-aged, the averages were 37%, 44%, and 62%, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The most recent national Even Start evaluation, for 2000-2001, was based on two data sources\u2014an experimental design study (EDS) that tracked 18 projects that agreed to randomly assign new families to Even start or a control group; and, the Even Start Performance Information Reporting System (ESPIRS) which tracks annual data from the universe of Even Start projects. Although families participating in the EDS were randomly assigned to control and Even Start groups, the 18 projects participating were not randomly selected. The EDS families were more likely than Even Start families as a whole to be Hispanic (75% versus 46%), and to be participating in Even Start projects in urban areas (83% versus 55%).", "The national evaluation collected data on 41 different outcome measures for the families participating in the EDS.
