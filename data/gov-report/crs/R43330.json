The federal government considers its provision of these health services to be based on its trust responsibility for Indian tribes, a responsibility derived from federal statutes, treaties, court decisions, executive actions, and the Constitution (which assigns authority over Indian relations to Congress). Congress is seen to have a moral obligation, not a legal one, to provide Indian health care. Congress has reaffirmed its obligation to provide care to American Indians and Alaska Natives in the reauthorization of Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), which is the major legislation authorizing most of IHS's activities. IHCIA stated that \"it is the policy of the Nation, in fulfillment of its special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to Indians to ensure the highest possible health status for Indians and urban Indians and to provide all the resources necessary to effect that policy....\" ", "IHS provides health services to approximately 2.2 million American Indians or Alaska Natives who are members of 566 federally recognized tribes. The agency provides services directly or through contracts or compacts with Indian Tribes (ITs) or Tribal Organizations (TOs) under the authority of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). IHS also provides grants to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), under the authority of IHCIA Title V, to operate health service programs. More than half of all federally recognized tribes operate facilities or health programs, and nearly 40% of IHS's budget appropriation is administered by tribes. IHS's FY2016 appropriation is $4.8 billion. IHS also receives a separate direct appropriation to support special diabetes programs and supplements its appropriation with funds from collections for care provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in insurance programs. In total, IHS's FY2016 estimated program level funding (its appropriation, plus diabetes funding, and funds from collections) is $6.1 billion.", "IHS does not offer a standard set of medical benefits or services at all its facilities; rather available services vary by facility. These services are provided free to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (also called IHS beneficiaries ) regardless of their ability to pay. In general, IHS facilities provide health and health education services that focus on primary and preventive care. These services are available through a system of facilities operated by the IHS, an IT, a TO, or a UIO. These facilities are also referred to collectively as \"I/T/U.\" (IHS/Tribal/Urban). They are referred to collectively as IHS-funded facilities in this report.

Specifically, the report describes the IHS's service population, the agency's organization, the type of facilities that IHS operates and funds, and some specific IHS programs that focus on reducing rates of common health conditions among IHS beneficiaries. The report also describes some other IHS supported activities such as those to construct new facilities, increase the IHS workforce, and support contracts with ITs and TOs entered into under ISDEAA authority.

This number is smaller than the projected IHS service population of 2.2 million, which represents the total number of American Indians and Alaska Natives who live within IHS service areas (i.e., American Indians and Alaska Natives who live on or near a reservation). The service population is an estimate of IHS's potential user population (i.e., it includes individuals who do use IHS facilities as well as individuals who live near facilities and could use IHS, but have not done so in the prior three years). IHS estimates the service population using data from the decennial census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. In non-census years, it adjusts the decennial census data for population changes using birth and death data from the National Center for Health Statistics, a center within HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The 170 service units and specific health facilities may be managed either by the IHS directly, or by ITs, TOs, and consortia through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts negotiated with the IHS under the authority of the ISDEAA. ITs and TOs have taken over from IHS the responsibility for operating many service units and health facilities. More than half of all federally recognized tribes operate facilities or health programs and approximately 40% of IHS's total appropriation is administered by tribes.", "There are some geographic patterns in the location of tribally-operated programs, with certain areas having all or almost all facilities and programs operated by tribes. For example, the Alaska, California, and Nashville areas have few IHS-operated programs. Accordingly, these area offices are smaller because more funds have been provided to ITs or TOs to operate facilities and programs. In contrast, the Great Plains and Billings areas have more facilities operated by the IHS. In these areas there are relatively few tribally-operated programs, and area offices are larger than those in areas with more tribally-operated programs.

Hospitals (46 total) : are generally small and services available vary by hospital. Some hospitals provide surgical services and specialty care services such as ophthalmology and orthopedics. Of the 46 hospitals operated by IHS or ITs, only one has an average daily census (a measure of usage) of more than 45 patients. Nearly all of these hospitals; however, have emergency departments and eight are designated trauma centers. 2. Youth regional treatment centers (10 total) : are inpatient facilities that provide substance abuse and mental health treatment services to American Indian and Alaska Native youth. Congress has authorized these treatment centers in each of the 12 areas (with California counted as two areas); however, two IHS areas\u2014Bemidji and Billings\u2014have opted to contract with outside providers for these services. There are 10 facilities in total; 5 are operated by the IHS and the remaining 5 are operated by ITs or TOs. In addition to these facilities, a new tribally operated treatment center in California was recently built to provide services to American Indian youth in the California Area. 3. Health centers (344 total): generally provide outpatient services and provide primary and preventive care. Some health centers will provide health education and some laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology services. Health centers operated by ITs and TOs may also receive federal health center grants authorized under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. ITs and TOs that receive these grants are required to provide certain services to non-IHS beneficiaries using non-IHS funds. ITs and TOs may also operate school health centers that provide services similar to those provided in health centers to children during school hours. 4. Health stations (105 total) : are generally smaller than health centers; these facilities provide some of the same services that health centers provide such as primary care. One distinction from health centers is that these facilities are generally open less than 40 hours per week. 5. Alaska village clinics (150 total): are unique to Alaska and may provide services using paraprofessionals assisted by health professionals via telehealth technologies. For example, Alaska village clinics operate the dental health assistant program whereby routine preventive dental care and certain less complicated dental procedures are performed by paraprofessionals at village clinics. These procedures are overseen by dentists who are available remotely.

For example, IHS provides some behavioral health services via telehealth (e.g., counseling). Some facilities also use telehealth technologies to consult with specialists such as dermatologists or ophthalmologists when an on-site specialist is not available. The agency also uses these technologies to disseminate best practices developed in one IHS area to other IHS areas through training and technical assistance.

The eligibility criteria differ in three specific ways: ", "1. To be eligible for PRC, IHS beneficiaries must live in specific geographic areas called \"contract health service delivery areas\" (CHSDAs). CHSDAs are narrower than IHS service areas; therefore, it is possible to be eligible for IHS direct services, but not live in a CHSDA. CHSDAs are determined by each tribe, which could also mean that some tribal members may not live in the tribe's CHSDA, making them ineligible for PRC. 2. An IHS beneficiary may only receive authorization for PRC when the IHS beneficiary has exhausted all other health care resources available, such as private insurance, state health programs, and Medicaid. This differs from direct services, where IHS can encourage, but not require, a beneficiary to apply for alternate resources. For PRC, such applications and proof of denials are required. 3. IHS uses a medical priority system to determine when a PRC referral will be authorized. In general, PRC is only authorized for what is termed priority one services or \"life or limb\" services, meaning health services that are required to prevent the immediate death or a serious impairment of the individual. ", "In addition to specific eligibility criteria, the PRC program has specific rules for patient and provider participants. For a patient to receive PRC services, an IHS beneficiary must be preapproved to receive the specific service. In case of emergencies, applicants must inform the PRC program within 72 hours. For providers to participate in the PRC program, they must accept payment from IHS as full payment for services and may not bill an IHS beneficiary for authorized PRC services. In the case of inpatient services, the hospital providing the service may only charge the PRC program what it would charge the Medicare program for the same service. This is called \"Medicare Like Rates,\" but these rates do not apply to outpatient services; therefore, individual PRC programs must negotiate contracts with private providers to set rates for outpatient services.

As a result of the decision, IHS is balancing the competing priorities of ITs' and TOs' desires to administer their own programs with the amount of CSC funds available. IHS says it must ensure that adequate CSC funds are available for existing contracts and that new contracts the agency enters into do not offset funding available for direct health care services. P.L. 114-113 , which provided appropriations for FY2016, included language about CSC funds specifying that funds are available indefinitely and that IHS may allocate additional funds to CSCs, but is prohibited from using funds appropriated for CSCs for other purposes.

It also gave IHS authority to grant funding to UIOs to provide health care services to urban Indians and established substance abuse treatment programs, and Indian health professions recruitment programs, among others. The IHCIA was reauthorized by the Indian Health Amendments of 1992, which extended authorizations of its appropriations through FY2000. The authorizations for all IHCIA programs were later extended through FY2001.

The 1992 amendment paralleled a 1988 change whereby the BIA allowed, under a demonstration, its programs to be compacted.

Although IHS services are available free of charge to all eligible beneficiaries, not all eligible individuals choose to receive care at an IHS-funded facility. This may occur because facilities are geographically inconvenient or because needed services are unavailable. IHS focuses on primary and preventive services, so some services may not be available. Despite this, IHS has attempted to expand services by partnering with local providers, by using technology and paraprofessionals to expand the services that the agency can provide at its facilities, and by preventing disease and encouraging healthy behaviors to reduce the need for expensive health services. ", "The American Indian and Alaska Native Population", "There is no uniform definition of the American Indian and Alaska Native population. Rather, federal agencies use different definitions of this population. The Indian Health Service (IHS) service population data are based on U.S. Census Bureau data, which use self-identification as American Indian/Alaska Native by race, not tribal membership. Beginning with the 2000 Census, respondents were permitted to identify as members of more than one race or ethnic group. Consequently, some individuals who might have previously self-identified as another race, beginning in 2000, were allowed to also identify as American Indian or Alaska Natives. As such, the number of American Indians and Alaska Natives identified increased between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses beyond what would have been expected due to population growth alone. The population also increased between 2000 and 2010 Censuses. Census 2010 found that 3.7 million people identified themselves as being American Indian/Alaska Native alone and 1.5 million identified as being American Indian/Alaska Native and another race, for a total of 5.2 million people, or a 21% increase from Census 2000. ", "Tribes vary on their definitions of membership; some tribes may reserve membership for those whose parents were both members, while other tribes may trace membership to a grandparent or parent who is a member. Thus, in some cases, tribal members could be counted by the Census as American Indian or Alaska Native and a member of another race. Conversely, some individuals identifying as multiple races in the Census may not be tribal members. Given this and the fact that not all tribes are federally recognized, not all American Indian/Alaska Natives (either alone or in combination with another race) counted by the Census are eligible for IHS services. Despite the limitations of the Census data, IHS uses Census data to estimate its eligible population. In addition to imprecise estimates of the eligible population, IHS also estimates its \"user population,\" based on registered American Indian/Alaska Native patients who used IHS-funded services at least once in the most recent three years. This figure, estimated at 1.6 million in 2014 is lower than the eligible population because not all eligible American Indian/Alaska Natives received IHS services during the reference period.", "The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Department of the Interior also collects data on its service population, but uses a different definition than both IHS and the Census Bureau. BIA data are based on estimates received from BIA agencies and federally recognized tribes, but these estimates are not based on actual censuses and cover only persons on or near reservations. The BIA also lists tribes' reports of their enrollment totals, but the BIA conducts no census to confirm these figures, and its publication does not show whether the enrollees enumerated live on or near reservations or inside or outside IHS service areas. In addition to these limitations, available BIA data are dated because the agency has not published data since 2013. Table A-1 compares recent IHS, BIA, and Census population figures.", "Measuring the Urban Indian Population", "Determining the urban Indian population eligible for Urban Indian Health Program services is equally inexact. Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) serve a wider range of eligible persons, including members of terminated or state-recognized tribes and their children and grandchildren (see report section \" Urban Indian Health Programs \"). They are not, however, authorized to serve anyone who merely identifies themselves as racially American Indian or Alaska Native. BIA figures for service population and tribal enrollment do not help determine the urban UIO population, because the BIA data are not broken down by urban or metropolitan residence, nor do they cover terminated or state-recognized tribes. Nor is an answer provided by Census Bureau data on American Indians/Alaska Natives, since, although the data are broken down by urban, metropolitan, city, and other types of residence, they are still, as noted above, based on self-identification by race, not on tribal membership, whether in federal, state, or terminated tribes. IHS figures for urban Indian populations are based on these Census data.", "While IHS, Census, and BIA figures for Indians, whether resident in urban areas or not, may not be definitive for the IHS-eligible population, they provide useful approximations of the population that IHS serves. Census data suggest that most American Indians/Alaska Natives live outside reservations and other census-identified Indian areas, that the movement out of these areas is many decades old, and that a majority of census-identified Indians live in census-identified urban areas. Many urban areas are within IHS service delivery areas, so further analysis may be needed to determine what proportion of census-identified urban Indians are eligible for general IHS services.", "Brief History of Federal Involvement in Indian Health ", "The following timeline (see Figure B-1 and Figure B-2 ) presents a brief overview of federal involvement in Indian health. Federal involvement began as infectious disease control (e.g., smallpox vaccines), but grew over time to encompass more services and eventually evolved into the modern day IHS. Federal involvement in Indian health is rooted in treaties between Indian Tribes and the federal government. Over time, federal involvement has been formalized in legislation.
