There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories. These visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); for example, B-2 tourists, E-2 treaty investors, F-1 foreign students, H-1B temporary professional workers, J-1 cultural exchange participants, or S-4 terrorist informants.", "The U.S. Department of State (DOS) consular officer, at the time of application for a visa, as well as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspectors, at the time of application for admission, must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to nonimmigrant status.

Both DOS consular officers (when the alien is petitioning abroad) and DHS inspectors (when the alien is entering the United States) must confirm that the alien is not ineligible for a visa under the so-called \"grounds for inadmissibility\" of the INA, which include criminal, terrorist, and public health grounds for exclusion.", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors in DHS tallied 163 million temporary admissions of foreign nationals to the United States during 2009.

The remaining categories and countries of the world contributed 36.2 million admissions in FY2009. Since many types of visas allow people to depart and re-enter the United States, the CBP data record multiple admissions during the same year.", "In FY2009, DOS's consular officers issued 5.8 million nonimmigrant visas. Nonimmigrant visas issued abroad had dipped to 5.0 million in FY2004 after peaking at 7.6 million in FY2001.

Second, the I-94 data record the admissions rather than the persons. Since many types of visas allow people to depart and re-enter the United States, the CBP data record multiple admissions during the same year.", "During 2009, CBP inspectors tallied 163 million nonimmigrant admissions to the United States. Mexican nationals with border crossing cards and Canadian nationals traveling for business or tourist purposes accounted for the vast majority of admissions to the United States in FY2009, with approximately 126.8 million entries. The remaining categories and countries of the world contributed the 36.2 million I-94 admissions in FY2009. ", "As with the visa issuance data, temporary visitors dominate the admissions data depicted in Figure 4 . Over three-quarters of all I-94 admissions were tourists in FY2009 and another 12.1% were business visitors. Similar to the visa issuance data, the other substantial categories are students (2.6%) and the employment based (e.g., workers (2.6%), executives and investors (2.0%), and cultural exchange (1.3%)).", "To more clearly observe the trends in temporary visitors, Figure 5 analyzes them separately. The FY2002-FY2009 trend data reveal that a large majority of such nonimmigrants are admitted for tourism (or \"pleasure\") purposes. The number of tourist entries on B-2 visas increased by 44.5% from FY2002 to FY2009, and the number of VWP tourists rose by 31.7% over this same period. The number of visitors for business, whether it was on B-1 visas or through the VWP, remained stable over the decade. The Guam Visa Waiver Program covers foreign nationals who were solely entering and staying in Guam for a period not to exceed 15 days.", "As expected, the FY2000-FY2009 trends in \"other than visitor\" nonimmigrant admissions depicted in Figure 6 are similar to FY2000-FY2009 trends in \"other than visitor\" visas issued depicted in Figure 3 . The admissions data, however, fluctuated less frequently and exhibited smoother trends. Overall, the I-94 admissions increased by 7.6%, from 33.7 million in FY2000 to 36.2 million in FY2009. Admissions peaked at 39.4 million in FY2008.", "The employment-based admissions mirrored the employment-based visas by tracking the economic recession.

In addition, foreign visitors from 36 countries have VWP privileges, enabling visitors for business or for pleasure from these countries to seek admission to the United States without obtaining a visa in advance.", "One method of analyzing the relationship between visas issued and I-94 admissions is to calculate the ratio of the two data points. The overall ratio of visas issued by DOS to I-94 admissions recorded by CBP has fallen slightly from a 10-year high of 0.23 in FY2001 to 0.16 in FY2009. In other words, there were a total of 7.6 million visas issued and 32.8 million admissions in FY2001, in contrast to a total of 5.8 million visas issued and 36.2 million admissions in FY2009. This trend of ratios is depicted as the black line in Figure 11 .", " Figure 11 illustrates further that the ratio of visas to I-94 admissions is lowest for regions of the world that include most of the VWP countries: Europe and Oceania. The ratio of visas to I-94 admissions is highest for foreign nationals coming from Africa, and South America and Asia follow as a distant second and third, respectively. All three of the regions have ratios higher than the overall total.

Africans may also be less likely to make frequent return visits given the distance and cost of travel. ", "Perhaps most interesting is the downward trend in the ratio of visas to I-94 admissions for foreign nationals from North America. Visas issued to foreign nationals from North America have fallen from a high of 2.8 million in FY2001 to a 10-year low of 1.3 million in FY2009. Meanwhile, the number of I-94 admissions rose from a 10-year low of 7.8 million in FY2000 to a high of 11.6 million in FY2007, and it stood at 10.6 million in FY2009. This change over time was due in large part to the issuance of biometric B-1 and B-2 border crossing cards to visitors from Mexico, which are good for 10 years. In FY2000 and FY2001, DOS issued 1.5 million B-1 and 2.0 million B-2 border crossing cards to Mexicans.

The term \"resident nonimmigrant\" refers to those foreign nationals admitted on nonimmigrant visas whose classes of admission are associated with stays long enough to establish a residence (e.g., diplomats, students, and workers). ", "In 2010, the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) published a report that estimated the size and characteristics of the resident nonimmigrant population in the United States in 2008. OIS demographer Bryan Baker estimated the average daily population of resident nonimmigrants in the United States to have been 1.8 million in 2008. Of the 1.8 million nonimmigrants, 50.8% (0.93 million) were temporary workers and their families, 32.2% (0.59 million) were students and their families, 13.1% (0.24 million) were exchange visitors and their families, and 3.8% (0.07 million) were diplomats, other representatives, and their families.

More than half (55.7%) of resident nonimmigrants were male.", "As Figure 13 shows, slightly more than half (53%) of resident nonimmigrants were foreign nationals from Asian countries. Europe and North America comprised another 17.6% and 17.0%, respectively. The top six countries accounted for 56.8% of the total, and these countries are depicted in Figure 14 . As a major source country for both students and professional workers, India led with 21.9% of resident nonimmigrants in 2008. The other major sending countries were Canada (8.2%), South Korea (7.7%), China (6.6%), Mexico (6.6%), and Japan (6.0%).", "In addition to the estimates of the resident nonimmigrant population , OIS also reports on annual admissions of resident nonimmigrants. The latest report indicated that the number of resident nonimmigrant admissions decreased from 3.7 million in 2008 to 3.4 million in 2009, a 6.8% drop.

Only three nonimmigrant visas permit the visa holder to simultaneously seek legal permanent residence (LPR) status: H-1 professional workers, L intracompany transfers, and V accompanying family members. Nonetheless, USCIS adjusted 667,776 foreign nationals to LPR status in 2009, which was 59.0% of all LPRs that year. Presumably, many of these foreign nationals had originally entered the United States as nonimmigrants. As Figure 15 illustrates, most of these adjustments are family members of citizens or persons who are in the United States legally. ", "The H-1B visa often provides the link for foreign students (F, M) to become employment-based LPRs. Many anecdotal accounts tell of foreign students who are hired by U.S. firms as they are completing their programs. The employers obtain H-1B visas for the recent graduates, and if the employees meet expectations, the employers may also petition for the nonimmigrants to become LPRs through one of the employment-based immigration categories. Some policy makers consider this a natural and positive chain of events, arguing that it would be foolish to educate these talented young people only to make them leave to work for foreign competitors. Others consider this \"F-1 to H-1B to LPR\" pathway an abuse of the temporary element of nonimmigrant status and a way to circumvent the laws and procedures that protect U.S. workers from being displaced by immigrants.", "Research conducted in 2005 by B. Lindsay Lowell of the Institute for the Study of International Migration estimated that approximately 7% of foreign students adjusted to LPR status directly, and that an additional 7% to 8% of students adjusted to LPR status following a stint as an H nonimmigrant worker. In 2000, Lowell also published an analysis of all H-1Bs who ultimately became LPRs and estimated that about half of them did so at that time.", "Although the USCIS asks those who are adjusting to LPR status what their last nonimmigrant status was, there has been a data quality problem for many years. According to the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, the data collected on last nonimmigrant status are missing on more than 40% of the adjustment of status records. Nonetheless, Jeanne Batalova of the Migration Policy Institute published analysis of the limited data that were available from FY1998 through FY2002. Batalova's analysis found that the percentage of foreign students adjusting remained rather flat, and may have diminished, but that the percentage of adjustments who were H nonimmigrant workers grew notably from FY1998 through FY2002.", "More recently, the conventional route has become Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student's major area of study. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that there were 23,000 F-1 foreign students engaged in OPT in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields. To qualify for the 17-month extension, F-1 students must have received STEM degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List, be employed by employers enrolled in E-Verify, and have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT related to such a degree. According to DHS, \"This extension of the OPT period for STEM degree holders gives U.S. employers two chances to recruit these highly desirable graduates through the H-1B process, as the extension is long enough to allow for H-1B petitions to be filed in two successive fiscal years.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonimmigrant Visa Overstays", "paragraphs": ["It is estimated that each year, hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas and, as a consequence, become unauthorized aliens.
