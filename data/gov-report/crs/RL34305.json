But the number of motorcycle fatalities has more than doubled over the past decade, to 4,810 in 2006\u00e2\u0080\u0094representing 14% of all passenger vehicle occupant deaths. Annual motorcycle fatalities are now more that double the number of annual deaths from aviation, rail, marine, and pipeline accidents combined. While part of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the number of motorcyclists, the number of fatalities is increasing at a greater rate than the overall increase in ridership\u00e2\u0080\u0094the number of fatalities has increased by 116% in the past decade, while the number of registered motorcycles increased by 63%. The increase in fatalities has continued in spite of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)'s publication in 2000 of the National Agenda for Motorcycle Safety, a plan for reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities. The motorcycle industry expects the growth in motorcycle sales to continue, so the total number of motorcycle fatalities may continue to increase, barring new safety measures.", "A clear understanding of the factors involved in motorcycle crashes is needed in order to develop effective safety measures to reduce the rate of motorcycle crashes. NHTSA has detailed information about the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes, but not about causes of the crashes. The last major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes in the United States was published in 1981. Since that time, the motorcycle rider population and the characteristics of both the motorcycle and passenger vehicle fleet have changed. Congress has authorized another major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes; the results of this study are expected in 2010. Congress has also authorized a motorcycle safety grant program promoting rider education and training and motorist awareness of motorcyclists, and established a Motorcycle Advisory Commission to advise DOT on infrastructure issues of concern to motorcyclists.", "According to NHTSA, the single most effective safety measure to reduce motorcycle fatalities is to wear a helmet that meets DOT standards; such helmets are estimated to reduce fatalities by 37%. Helmets also reduce the severity and cost of injuries received in motorcycle crashes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia currently have universal helmet laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets; most other states only require minors to wear helmets. The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that all states adopt universal helmet laws. Universal helmet laws have been controversial. Congress has twice adopted and then repealed incentives promoting universal helmet laws, most recently repealing the incentives in 1995. These incentives were effective in getting states to adopt universal helmet laws, and the laws proved effective in promoting helmet use. After each repeal, the number of states with universal helmet laws declined. Surveys indicate that 58% of motorcycle riders wore a helmet in 2007, up from 51% in 2006, but down from 64% in 1996.

After 1980, sales declined, reaching a low point of less than 300,000 annually in the early 1990s. Sales began rising after 1992; sales of on-highway motorcycles rose from 186,000 in 1992 to 662,000 in 2003. The number of motorcycles in use, as measured by motorcycle registration data, has increased by at least 63% since 1997 (from 3.8 million in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2005). According to the motorcycle industry, factors influencing the increase in motorcycle ownership include affluent baby boomers returning to motorcycling after many years of not riding, and rising fuel costs.", "This report presents and analyzes crash data, which show that motorcycle fatalities are an increasing share of all motor vehicle fatalities in the United States. It examines the risk characteristics of motorcycles and motorcyclists, and the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes. The report then examines what the federal government is doing to try to reduce the rate of motorcycle fatalities.

Part of this increase can be attributed to a significant growth in the number of motorcyclists. According to the motorcycle industry, annual sales of on-highway motorcycles have tripled in the past decade. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) reports that the number of registered motorcycles increased by over 2 million (63%) during that period. But as Table 1 shows, the rate of increase in fatal motorcycle crashes (116%) and rider fatalities (115%) is almost double the rate of increase in the number of motorcycles registered (63%). By contrast, as Table 1 also shows, the number of passenger vehicle crashes and fatalities has declined (by 2% and 3% respectively) over the past decade, even though the number of vehicles registered has increased by 5%.", "In 2006 motorcycles represented less than 3% of all passenger vehicles registered and less than 1% of all VMT, while motorcyclist fatalities represented 14% of all fatalities suffered by operators or passengers in passenger vehicles. Among the factors that contribute to the higher rate of fatal crashes of motorcycles compared to passenger vehicles are the characteristics of both motorcycles and the motorcycle operator population.", "Motorcycles are inherently riskier than passenger vehicles. They are more complex to steer and less stable in braking and maneuvering. They also tend to be less noticed by other motorists compared to other passenger vehicles. In a crash motorcycles offer little protection to their occupants compared to a passenger vehicle occupant, who is enclosed in a metal frame, is required by law to be wearing a seat belt, and whose vehicle (if manufactured after 1996) is required by law to have airbags to protect the occupants of the front seat. Virtually the only protection available to a motorcyclist in a crash is a helmet and protective clothing, neither of which is required in most states. Also, an estimated 90% of motorcycle operators are male, compared to the passenger vehicle driver population, which is 50% female. Males are involved in motor vehicle accidents at a higher rate than females. As a result of both vehicle characteristics and operator characteristics, the rate of motorcycle involvement in fatal crashes, both by the number of registered vehicles and by VMT, is several times that of passenger vehicles (see Table 2 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Fatal Motorcycle Crashes9", "paragraphs": ["There were 4,489 fatal motorcycle crashes in 2005, which resulted in the deaths of 4,553 motorcyclists.

Speeding was judged to be a contributing factor for 37% of the fatalities. In 25% of the crashes, the motorcyclist either did not have a drivers license or lacked a motorcycle endorsement on their license. Over a quarter (27%) of the motorcyclists killed in crashes in 2005 were legally intoxicated (i.e., had an amount of alcohol in their blood (blood alcohol content, or BAC), at or above 0.08 ).", "Approximately half (45%) of the fatal motorcycle crashes in 2005 were single-vehicle crashes; in most of these, the motorcyclist ran off the road. Forty-one percent of the 1,878 motorcyclists who died in single-vehicle crashes were legally intoxicated. In the 56% of crashes involving two or more vehicles, the other vehicle(s) was typically a passenger car or light truck. Of two-vehicle crashes involving a passenger vehicle, 74% of the crashes involved the motorcycle striking the passenger vehicle. In more than one-third of the two-vehicle crashes, the motorist was making a left turn across the path of a motorcyclist.", "In looking at the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes during the decade 1995 to 2004, changing trends can be ascertained. The percentage of motorcycle operators in fatal crashes who had been drinking (i.e., had any alcohol in their system) declined from 42% to 34%, and the percentage who were legally impaired (BAC of 0.08 or more) declined from 34% to 28%. ", "Likewise, the share of fatal crashes in which speeding was a factor declined from 43% to 37%. The percentage of motorcycle operator fatalities who were properly licensed increased from 63% to 75%. However, while these rates showed improvement, the actual number of fatal crashes in which alcohol or speeding played a role, and in which the driver was not properly licensed, increased.", "Other factors showed little or no change. For example, the rate of helmet use observed in motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes was virtually unchanged from 1995 (56%) to 2004 (57%).", "Other trends observed in the 1995-2004 crash data were that motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes were becoming older and riding more powerful motorcycles.

Part of the reason given for the repeal was that the penalty was about to be enforced against the three states then lacking such laws (California, Illinois, and Utah). By 1979, 27 states had repealed their mandatory helmet laws in the face of opposition to those laws. The nation's fatality rate per 10,000 motorcycles rose from 6.7 (1976) to 9.1 (1979).

They contend that helmets actually pose a danger to the motorcyclist, by restricting the cyclist's peripheral vision and hearing, and by increasing the risk of a neck injury (due to the added weight of the helmet) in a crash. But common to both groups of opponents is the framing of motorcycle helmet laws as primarily an issue of personal liberty and free choice rather than an issue of safety.", "In 1991, the General Accounting Office (GAO; now the Government Accountability Office) reviewed dozens of studies of helmet use and found no evidence to support the contentions of helmet opponents that helmets significantly impair motorcyclist vision or hearing, or contributed to neck injuries.

Moreover, they contend that universal helmet laws are necessary, because voluntary helmet usage promotion efforts have not proven to be effective. Conversely, universal helmet laws are easy to enforce and result in relatively high rates of helmet usage.", "Opponents of universal helmet laws take issue with the \"social burden\" argument. They contend that motorcyclists have medical insurance at rates similar to the general population, and that the share of the nation's medical burden that is due to medical costs incurred by motorcycle crashes is insignificant. They further contend that the most effective way to reduce motorcyclist fatalities and injuries is to prevent crashes from occurring, through education of motorcyclists and motorists and through crackdowns on illegal behavior by motorcyclists, such as riding while impaired and riding without proper licensure.", "In response to the framing of universal helmet laws as an infringement on personal rights, proponents of universal helmet laws contend that when personal choices impose costs on society and on survivors, personal freedoms must be balanced with protecting individuals from preventable injuries and fatalities. They note that when it comes to transportation safety, Congress has chosen to require adults to take actions to protect themselves. For example, opponents of seat belt use laws also contended that such laws infringed on their personal freedom to drive without a seat belt. However, Congress chose to penalize states that do not have, and enforce, laws requiring motorists to wear seat belts, even though all cars manufactured since 1996 are required to have airbags to protect front seat occupants.
