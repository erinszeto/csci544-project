According to a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, Reclamation became involved in such projects because communities proposed projects directly to Congress and, in response, Congress created specific authorizations for these rural water supply projects, with Reclamation overseeing funding and construction. In addition to projects authorized only in Reclamation states, Congress specifically authorized Reclamation's involvement in the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Supply Project located in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota.", "Reclamation reported that, prior to authorization, some rural water projects did not go through the level of analysis and review that is consistent with Reclamation's other projects and did not meet the economic, environmental, and design standards that are required to determine the feasibility of federal water resources development projects. In these instances, following authorization, Reclamation was to complete the analysis that was necessary to execute the project while adhering to the project configuration and designs specified by the authorizing statutes and in accordance with other laws (e.g., Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a71251-1387], National Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a74321 et seq.]).

The result of these indexing requirements is that the overall cost of authorized rural water projects has risen and continues to rise due in part to actual federal appropriations for projects falling short of the optimal funding scenarios that were assumed under planning projections. As of early 2020, Reclamation reported that $1.2 billion was needed to construct authorized, ongoing rural water projects.", "For FY2021, the Administration's budget proposal requested $30.3 million: $8.1 million for ongoing construction at four authorized rural water projects and $22.2 million for O&M of tribal systems (e.g., $14.5 million for the Mni Wiconi Project, $7.7 million for the Garrison Diversion Unit M&I, and $20,000 for the Mid-Dakota Rural Water System). The FY2021 request is $114.8 million less than FY2020 enacted funding of $145.1 million. The FY2021 request continues a trend since FY2014 in which the President's budget requested reduced funding for rural water projects from prior-year enacted levels. Reclamation also has emphasized its authority to accept nonfederal contributions in excess of cost-sharing requirements as one way to expedite projects in the absence of increased federal funding.
