Section 205 of the FPA provides that all rates and charges for the transmission of electric energy subject to FERC's jurisdiction, as well as rules and regulations affecting those rates, must be \"just and reasonable,\" and that no public utility's rates may \"unduly discriminate\" against any customers. FERC's section 205 authority has been characterized as \"an essentially passive and reactive\" role.", "However, Section 206 of the FPA gives FERC a broader and more proactive rate authority:", "Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged or collected by any public utility for any transmission ... subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order. ", "Section 206 thus permits FERC to make changes to existing utility rates, including transmission charges, either on its own initiative or at the request of an interested party. In order to make such changes, FERC must (1) find that the existing rates or practices are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential; and (2) show that its proposed changes are just and reasonable. Section 206 also allows FERC to establish a just and reasonable rule, regulation, or practice \"to be thereafter observed and in force,\" and to \"fix the same by order.\"", "The statutory authority found in Section 206 of the FPA gives FERC broad authority to establish a set of general principles to be applied in setting just and reasonable rates upon a finding of unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential rates or practices in the industry. FERC has cited its Section 206 authority in promulgating other significant rulemakings related to interstate electricity transmission facilities, including Order No. 2000 (providing for the creation of Regional Transmission Organizations to manage electricity transmission grids) and Orders 888 and 890 (requiring utilities to provide open access to transmission facilities and creating a pro forma tariff for utilities to adopt for their transmission services). Most recently, FERC cited its Section 206 authority when it issued Order No. 1000, the order that altered Commission policy on transmission planning and cost allocation.

May have multiple owners. May provide benefits to many and diverse beneficiaries. These beneficiaries may be difficult to accurately identify, and it may be even more difficult to quantify the benefits.", "However, cost allocation for these and other transmission lines was less contentious\u2014or at least less visible and pressing at the national level\u2014in the past because of the nature of the industry itself and federal/state regulation of the industry prior to the mid-1990s. Transmission lines were historically constructed primarily by investor-owned utilities subject to traditional cost of service regulation by state utility commissions. These utilities sold a \"bundle\" of electric power transmission, generation, and distribution services to ratepayers as a single price. Customers in the utility's service area generally paid a share of the costs of transmission investments, whether or not a particular transmission investment was of value to the customer; this universal sharing of expenses is referred to as the \"socialization\" of costs.", "Under this regulatory regime, cost allocation was therefore generally not a complex issue, since the beneficiaries of the transmission service and the customers paying for the services were, in effect, assumed to be the same\u2014the utility's entire set of captive ratepayers. As one analysis points out, the bundling of costs made it possible and acceptable for cost allocation issues to be \"swept under the rug.\" ", "Cost allocations, and related transmission planning issues, were also less contentious and visible because of the historical development of the electric power grid. Transmission lines were first built in the early 20 th century by single utilities to move electricity to population centers from relatively nearby power plants. As generation and transmission technology advanced, the distances increased, but the model of a single entity building lines within its own service territory to supply its own load still predominated. Over time, these local grids began to interconnect, due to utilities building jointly owned power plants and because power companies began to grasp the economic and reliability benefits of being able to exchange power. Nonetheless, this pattern of development did not emphasize the construction of very long-distance inter-regional lines involving multiple owners and jurisdictions, the kinds of projects likely to have difficult cost allocation issues.", "Cost allocation issues have become pressing in part because of the restructuring of the electric power generation and transmission industries that began in the late 1970s. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 had as one of their aims the introduction of competition into generation service. In order to facilitate the ability of non-utility generators to access the transmission grid, in 1996 FERC issued Orders 888 and 889, to establish an open access regulatory regime for the transmission grid. These orders directed transmission owners and operators to open their system to any connected generator or load on a \"non-discriminatory\" basis (that is, without giving preference to their own generation or load). Rates are to be cost or market based, and rates and conditions of service are to be embodied in an open access transmission tariff (OATT) approved by FERC.", "By allowing non-utility generators and loads to use the transmission system, open access broke the formerly rigid link between the entities that built transmission and their captive ratepayers. Now a new transmission line could be used by multiple entities to transmit or receive power. The operational links between utilities and transmission were further weakened by FERC's policy of promoting regional transmission organizations (RTOs) in the 1990s and 2000s. In RTOs, utilities retain ownership of the transmission grid but operational control is exercised by the RTO. The object is to further ensure that the transmission grid is operated in a non-discriminatory fashion to the benefit of all market participants.", "The restructuring of the transmission market had several consequences for transmission cost allocation and planning:", "Cost allocation became more complex and contentious because the clear links that existed under traditional regulation between the parties that built, operated, and benefited from new transmission lines were broken. Under the traditional regulatory regime, distinctions between transmission additions aimed at improving system reliability and those aimed at reducing the costs of operating the power system (i.e., \"economic\" projects) had little meaning. In the open access regime the distinction between reliability projects and economic projects became an important one, since each type of project could benefit different groups of customers to different degrees. In the open access regime, much of the responsibility for transmission planning shifted from utilities to either RTOs or, in the markets without RTOs, a plethora of other planning organizations built around utilities, generators, and other stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FERC Order No. 890", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the adoption of Order No. 1000 in the summer of 2011, FERC's most significant articulation of the principles applicable to transmission cost allocation was Order No. 890, issued by FERC in February 2007.

Transmission providers and customers cannot be expected to support the construction of new transmission unless they understand who will pay the associated costs.\"", "A particular concern of FERC was cost allocation for long-distance transmission projects that would cross multiple utility service areas and state jurisdictions. Another concern was the treatment of projects that would yield economic benefits to multiple parties. According to FERC:", "\u2026 we are not modifying the existing mechanisms to allocate costs for projects that are constructed by a single transmission owner and billed under existing rate structures.

On the one hand, FERC stated that it \"will not impose a particular allocation method for such projects, but rather will permit transmission providers and stakeholders to determine their own specific criteria which best fit their own experience and regional needs.\" On the other hand, FERC did conclude that \"some overall guidance [on cost allocation] is appropriate.\" FERC's overriding premise was that \"'[a]llocation of costs is not a matter for the slide-rule. It involves judgment on a myriad of facts. It has no claim to an exact science.'\" FERC would therefore \"allow regional flexibility in cost allocation and, when considering a dispute over cost allocation, exercise our judgment by weighing several factors.\" Three factors were listed by FERC:", "First, we consider whether a cost allocation proposal fairly assigns costs among participants, including those who cause them to be incurred and those who otherwise benefit from them. Second, we consider whether a cost allocation proposal provides adequate incentives to construct new transmission. Third, we consider whether the proposal is generally supported by state authorities and participants across the region. ", "These three factors are interrelated. For example, a cost allocation proposal that has broad support across a region is more likely to provide adequate incentives to construct new infrastructure than one that does not. The states, which have primary transmission siting authority, may be reluctant to site regional transmission projects if they believe the costs are not being allocated fairly. Similarly, a proposal that allocates costs fairly to participants who benefit from them is more likely to support new investment than one that does not.

In Illinois Commerce Commission v. FERC , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit heard a challenge to FERC's approval of a cost allocation proposal for certain new transmission facilities in the PJM Interconnection. Two state utility commissions in Midwestern states protested a FERC-approved allocation of transmission costs for the PJM interconnection that required pro rata contributions from all utilities in the region; that is, the utilities in the PJM region would increase their rates by a uniform amount sufficient to cover the cost of the new facilities. According to the court, FERC's rationale for this pro rata increase was that (1) some of the PJM members entered into similar pro rata cost sharing agreements in the past and would like to continue to allocate costs in that manner; (2) the burden of determining which parties would benefit from the new transmission (and to what degree they would benefit) would be onerous and would likely result in litigation; and (3) that every member of the PJM Interconnection would benefit from the new transmission facilities because the reliability of the entire network would improve.", "The court held that the FERC-approved pro rata rate increase for recovery of transmission costs was not supported by substantial evidence. The court quickly dispatched FERC's two arguments in favor of the reasonableness of the pro rata rates. According to the court, the fact that previous arrangements among the PJM members had pro rata cost sharing arrangements in the past carried no weight. The court rejected FERC's argument regarding the difficulty of measuring benefits and the likelihood of litigation, because of an absence of evidence of the relative difficulty of assessing the benefits. The court did not dismiss the possibility of such a finding, noting that feasibility concerns can play a role in rate determinations. However, in this instance, the court found that FERC had not offered a sufficient explanation for this factor and the role it played in the rate decision.", "The court spent more time addressing FERC's third line of reasoning: that the new transmission facilities would benefit every PJM member, and therefore that the costs should be allocated among all of them. As the court acknowledged, even though the purpose of the new facilities was to satisfy demand for eastern customers in the PJM system, the entire PJM system would benefit from greater reliability as a result. However, the court found that it was possible that such secondary benefits could be minor in relation to the costs to customers not in the eastern region expected to benefit directly from the new transmission capacity, and that FERC had not provided any information by which these benefits could be assessed. According to the court:", "[i]f FERC cannot quantify the benefits to the midwestern utilities from new ... lines in the East, but it has an articulable and plausible reason to believe that the benefits are at least roughly commensurate with those utilities' share of the total electricity sales in PJM's region, then ... the Commission can approve PJM's proposed pricing scheme on that basis. But it cannot use the presumption to avoid the duty of \"comparing the costs assessed against a party to the burdens imposed or benefits drawn by that party.\"", "The impact of this decision on cost allocation going forward is not entirely clear. On the one hand, as several observers have noted, the case appears to create a new obligation for FERC to reconsider and potentially discard pro rata allocation of transmission costs. However, the ruling seems to be directed more at FERC's procedural failure to justify the ratemaking than a substantive failure in the application of the law. The court repeatedly mentioned that FERC's arguments in favor of the pro rata allocation were dismissed not because such a cost allocation method was unreasonable on its face, but rather because FERC had failed to demonstrate the reasonableness of the rates.

The bill contained an amendment proposed by Senator Corker that would direct FERC to issue a new electricity transmission cost allocation rule that could allow for \"allocation of the costs of high-priority national transmission projects to load-serving entities within all or a part of a region, except that costs shall not be allocated to a region, or sub-region, unless the costs are reasonably proportionate to measurable economic and reliability benefits.\" ", "When the amendment to S. 1462 was proposed during the 111 th Congress, some advocates of new electricity transmission construction expressed concern that it would limit FERC's ability to spread costs widely among all users in a given region.

Three former FERC chairmen also voiced their disapproval of the amendment, noting in a letter that the amendment could \"hamstring\" FERC and that the language could jeopardize planned infrastructure investment due to uncertainty about cost recovery.", "However, others voiced support for the amendment.

In relation to cost allocation, the Commission found that:", "Determining the costs and benefits of adding transmission infrastructure to the grid is a complex process, particularly for projects that affect multiple systems and therefore may have multiple beneficiaries.

The unstated but concomitant question is how should the level of benefits, and therefore the cost responsibility of different customer groups, be determined? This goes to the heart of the issue raised by the Seventh Circuit's rejection of the PJM Interconnection cost allocation process. Should cost allocation processes be designed to cover larger geographic regions? This would seem to raise the contentious issue of whether costs should be allocated over large areas and perhaps interconnection-wide. Should cost allocations be static or change over time? This question was posed by FERC as a general issue, and specifically in respect to transmission lines which are initially built with overcapacity in anticipation of demand growth. How, if at all, should non-quantifiable costs and benefits be incorporated into cost allocations?", "By the end of November 2009 FERC had received 103 sets of comments.

Southern concluded that: ", "A significant misconception being promoted by certain aspects of the industry in the name of promoting renewable resources is that the current transmission planning processes and cost allocation methodologies are obstacles to the expansion of the transmission grid. This is not the case. The reason that more inter-regional transmission projects are not being built, at least in the Southeast, is that they have not proven to be economic as compared to other options.

State renewable energy portfolio standards are seen as a major driver of this new capacity. However, with most of the best regions for wind and solar resources located in the western United States, and many of the load centers and many states with RPS requirements in the eastern part of the country, some observers have discussed the potential for long, interstate transmission lines to carry renewable energy to markets in the east. Order No. 1000 allows for neighboring transmission planning regions to work out interregional plans for state public policies such as RPS requirements. In the absence of a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard, an imperative for a west-to-east, multistate renewable energy transmission line is unlikely, but a segmented build-out of transmission facilities could accomplish a similar goal if benefits to local regions can be shown.
