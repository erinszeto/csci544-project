Of these, 39.9% were proprietary (for-profit) institutions, with the rest almost equally divided between public and private non-profit institutions.

To avoid generating concerns about federal interference in educational decision-making, the federal government (ED specifically) relies on accrediting agencies and state licensing to determine standards of program quality. The federal government's only direct involvement in determining institutional eligibility for Title IV programs is through the third arm of the triad, which focuses on protecting the administrative capacity and fiscal integrity of its funding programs through certification by ED.", "In the 1992 reauthorization of the HEA, a central goal of the Congress was to reform the triad structure to address reported problems of fraud and abuse. Growing default costs in the guaranteed student loan program, as well as media and other reports of exploitation of the student aid programs, especially by proprietary institutions, focused attention on the need to improve the triad structure used to approve institutions for program participation. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 ( P.L. 102-325 ) made numerous changes to the HEA intended to strengthen program integrity, including revision of the definitions of eligible institutions and inclusion of provisions to reform the process by which institutions become eligible to participate in Title IV student aid programs. Instead of singling out the proprietary school sector for special screening and oversight, the 1992 amendments reformed the institutional eligibility rules for all postsecondary institutions. The amendments, however, have had the greatest impact on proprietary schools.", "The Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ) were signed into law by President Clinton on October 7, 1998. Among the key provisions affecting institutional eligibility were:", "Modification of the requirement that proprietary institutions of higher education derive at least 15% of their revenues from non-Title IV sources to require proprietary institutions to derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV sources, Elimination of the requirement for accrediting agencies to conduct unannounced site visits at institutions, Modification of refund policy requirements to apply only to Title IV funds and to require pro-rata refunds for all Title IV recipients who withdraw before the completion of 60% of the payment period or period of enrollment, Establishment of a distance learning demonstration program, and Addition of the requirement that any IHE with a teacher preparation program that has lost state approval or financial support because it has been designated as low-performing by the state is no longer eligible to accept or enroll any students in its teacher preparation program who are receiving Title IV aid.", "On February 8, 2006, President George W.

Second, they do not have to derive at least 10% of their revenue from non-Title IV funds.", "All Title IV eligible institutions must also meet requirements with respect to the course of study offered and student enrollment. The first set of requirements focus on courses offered by correspondence or telecommunications. Federal regulations define a correspondence course as a home study course offered by an IHE in which the IHE provides the student with instructional materials. Upon completing a section of the instructional materials, the student takes a correspondent examination provided by the IHE and returns it to the IHE for grading. In contrast, a telecommunications course is defined as a course that is offered via the application of technology, including via the Internet. In general, institutions offering over 50% of their courses by correspondence, excluding courses offered by telecommunications, are not Title IV eligible (Section 102(a)(3)(A)). An institution is also not considered eligible for the purposes of Title IV if 50% or more of its students are enrolled in correspondence courses, excluding courses offered by telecommunications (Section 102(a)(3)(B)).

According to the statute, an academic year must contain at least 30 weeks of instructional time. This 30-week requirement may be met through standard terms (i.e., quarters, semesters, and trimesters), non-standard terms (i.e., the term has a beginning and end date but does not meet the definition of a standard term), or a non-term program (i.e., the program is not organized in terms and may or may not have pre-established beginning and end dates).", "ED addressed the implementation of the statutory requirement that the academic year contain at least 30 weeks of instruction through regulatory action. Initially, this involved defining what constituted a \"week of instructional time.\" In the April 1994 interim final regulations, for programs using standard terms or clock hours, a week of instructional time was defined as any week that included at least one day of \"regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination ...\" For programs measured in credit hours without standard terms, a week of instructional time was defined \"as any week in which at least five days of regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination occurs.\" The former was known as the \"one day rule.\"", "The November 1994 final regulations retained the one day rule, but modified the requirement for programs measured in credit hours without standard terms to provide greater flexibility to these institutions. There were concerns, however, that programs without standard terms may alter their program structures to meet the 30-week requirement without providing an adequate level of instruction to a full-time student. Under these circumstances, a student could be receiving more financial aid than was merited (e.g., receiving full-time student aid when part-time student aid was appropriate). ED was also concerned that the workload in these programs \"was not properly distributed through the period.\" Thus programs without standard terms were required to provide 12 hours, instead of five days, of regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination in order for it to be considered a week of instructional time. This became known as the \"12-hour rule.\"", "Implementation of the 12-hour rule, however, resulted in several unintended consequences. For example, many programs offer rolling starting times and overlapping terms, which provide students with increased flexibility and access to higher education. These non-standard or non-term educational programs were experiencing difficulty complying with the 12-hour rule. The 12-hour rule was also difficult for distance education programs to implement for several reasons, including the difficulty in determining the number of hours of instruction in which students were participating weekly. In addition, the 12-hour rule resulted in inequities in Title IV funding received by students completing the same amount of academic credit, based on whether an individual student was enrolled in an institution using standard or non-standard academic terms. In recognition of the difficulties created by the 12-hour rule, ED revised its regulatory guidance and stated that all Title IV program eligibility will be determined using the one-day rule regardless of whether standard terms are used or not.

In addition, Congress may consider adding safeguards to ensure that a student who registers for a distance education course is the same student who completes the coursework and receives the credit. The Congress may consider adding a specific definition of a telecommunications course to replace the existing definition of telecommunications included in Section 484(l)(4). ED has suggested that the definition should \"specify that there be regular and substantive interaction between students and the instructor.\" The current definition does not address this interaction. An increasing number of institutions are offering multiple start dates for courses, shorter courses, and overlapping terms. This makes student aid calculation and disbursement complicated. The Congress may consider switching to an alternative model for aid calculation and disbursement based on an individual student's program of instruction, which could potentially alleviate some of this difficulty."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
