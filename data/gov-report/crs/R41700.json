{"id": "R41700", "title": "Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): FY2012 Appropriations", "released_date": "2011-12-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["The President's FY2012 budget was released on February 14, 2011. It included a request for nearly $47.9 billion in gross new appropriations for HUD in FY2012. After accounting for rescissions of prior-year unobligated balances and offsets available from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs, the President's request for net new budget authority for HUD in FY2012 totaled just over $42 billion. The President's budget, which was released prior to enactment of a final FY2011 appropriations law, included proposals for some funding increases relative to FY2010 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and Project-Based Rental Assistance), and some funding decreases relative to FY2010 (public housing operating fund, Community Development Block Grant program, HOME, and Section 202 and 811). However, in the case of almost all of the programs proposed for funding decreases relative to FY2010, the President's requested amount was higher than what was ultimately provided in the FY2011 appropriations law. In total, the President's funding request for HUD would have resulted in a nearly $2.5 billion increase in gross new appropriations in FY2012 relative to FY2011. However, because the President's budget estimated a substantial increase (nearly $2 billion) in the amount of offsetting receipts available from FHA in FY2012 relative to FY2011, the net budget authority requested in the President's budget would have represented an increase of only about $600 million in FY2012 relative to FY2011.", "While the House Appropriations Committee did not formally report an FY2012 Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies (THUD) bill, on September 7, 2011, the THUD subcommittee released a draft version, including about $3 billion less in net funding for HUD than was provided in FY2011 (about $1.4 billion less in gross appropriations). It was approved by the subcommittee the next day.", "On September 21, 2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its FY2012 THUD funding bill (S. 1596). It included about $4 billion less in net funding for HUD than was provided in FY2011 (about $1.3 billion less in gross regular appropriations). On November 1, 2011, the full Senate approved S.Amdt. 738 to H.R. 2112, the so-called Senate \"Minibus.\" It included FY2012 appropriations for those agencies under the jurisdiction of the THUD subcommittee (reflecting S. 1596) as well as two other subcommittees (Agriculture and Commerce-Justice-Science). Several HUD-related amendments were considered and adopted.", "In mid-November, the House and Senate reported a conference agreement on the Minibus (H.R. 2112, H.Rept. 112-284), which was subsequently enacted by Congress and then signed into law by the President on November 18, 2011 (P.L. 112-55). The final FY2012 appropriations law provided about $37.3 billion in net funding for HUD, which is about 9% less than was provided in FY2011. However, part of the decrease in net funding is attributable to increases in offsetting receipts and rescission. Looking only at gross appropriations, total funding for HUD's programs was decreased by about 2%.", "While not directly affecting HUD funding, the provisions in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) relating to statutory discretionary budget caps and their enforcement through sequestration could have implications for the amount of funding available for HUD in FY2012 and the future (see the Appendix for more information)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)", "paragraphs": ["Most of the funding for the activities of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in the annual appropriations acts enacted by Congress. HUD's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's non-emergency funding (about three-quarters of total funding in FY2010). Two flexible block grant programs\u2014HOME and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)\u2014help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Other, more specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to home buyers with low downpayments and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers, which are used to sustain the insurance fund and offset its administrative costs. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset the cost of the HUD budget.", "In recent years the HUD budget has also received significant amounts of emergency supplemental funding. Almost $20 billion was provided through HUD's budget for recovery assistance to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina and the other hurricanes of 2005. The economic stimulus legislation enacted in 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs.", " Table 1 presents total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years, including emergency appropriations. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview and Trends in HUD Funding", "paragraphs": ["HUD's budget authority (not including emergency supplemental funding, discussed later) has increased by about 40% since 2002. As demonstrated by the line in Figure 1 , the rate of growth had increased in recent years. In FY2004 and FY2005, year-over-year growth was relatively flat (under 2%), but, beginning in FY2006, HUD's budget had year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, with growth of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010. The FY2011 appropriations act reversed the recent trend of increasing budget authority by decreasing HUD's budget authority by nearly 11% compared to FY2010.", "Adjusting for inflation, the growth in \"real\" funding (shown by the gray bars in Figure 1 ) has been less robust. Over the 10-year period, adjusting for inflation, HUD's budget grew by about 15%. Through FY2008, the year-over-year growth never exceeded about 3.5%, and in two years there were declines. Most of the growth over the previous 10 years came in two years: FY2009 and FY2010, although about half of that growth was eliminated with the reductions in FY2011.", "As shown in Figure 2 , HUD's funding is made up of several components. The components of HUD's annual funding, or budget authority, include regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets.", "HUD's programs and activities are funded almost entirely through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. The amount provided in the annual appropriations acts each year generally determines how much funding will be obligated and eventually spent for each of HUD's programs and activities.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters, through one or more of HUD's programs. These funds are generally provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular annual appropriations.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to provide less in regular annual appropriations. Another way is to find offsets. A portion of the cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees paid by HUD partners or clients.", "The interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections determines HUD's total net budget authority. Net budget authority is also the \"cost\" of the HUD budget, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in its scorekeeping process. The total amount of net budget authority provided to HUD each year, while important for federal budgeting purposes, is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding that is being provided for HUD's programs and activities. Because of the role of offsets, declining or increasing net budget authority does not necessarily mean declining or increasing regular appropriations.", "As shown by the line in Figure 2 , which repeats the data shown by the line in Figure 1 , net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 40% between FY2002 and FY2011, from over $29 billion to over $41 billion. However, the overall increase in net new non-emergency budget authority masks several important trends.", "As noted earlier, between FY2002 and FY2010, HUD's net non-emergency budget authority increased by 57%. During that period, regular annual appropriations, which is the amount provided by Congress to fund HUD's programs and activities, grew by only 37% (shown by the dark green bars in Figure 2 ). During the same period, the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections and the amount rescinded, which Congress uses to reduce the cost of providing new appropriations, declined by more than 70% and 96%, respectively (shown by the dark and light red bars in Figure 2 ). In summary, from FY2002-FY2010, appropriations were increasing, but the amount of offsets and rescissions available to offset the cost of those appropriations was decreasing.", "That trend was reversed in FY2011, when Congress cut the amount of appropriations relative to FY2010 and, at the same time, the amount of available offsets increased. In terms of net budget authority, HUD's funding was cut by 11% in FY2011 compared to FY2010. However, regular appropriations in FY2011 were only cut by about 4%. The difference between the cut in net budget authority and appropriations is attributable to a 43% increase in offsets (discussed later in this section).", "The growth in regular appropriations during this period (shown by the dark green bars in Figure 2 ) is largely attributable to growth in HUD's Section 8 tenant-based voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which combined are the largest component of the HUD budget. As can be seen in Figure 3 , from FY2002 to FY2011 appropriations for the combined Section 8 programs grew by 77%, while combined funding for all other HUD programs and activities declined by about 6%. During this period, the Section 8 programs went from accounting for about 46% of HUD's regular appropriations to accounting for over 60% of HUD's regular appropriations. As can be seen in the chart, for a number of years Section 8 funding grew while combined funding for all other HUD programs declined. In FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010, combined funding for other HUD programs began to grow, but it declined sharply in FY2011.", "As noted earlier, there are two Section 8 programs: tenant-based rental assistance (vouchers) and project-based rental assistance. They were funded in the same account for many years, but since FY2005 they have been funded separately. As is shown in Figure 3 , appropriations for the Section 8 programs combined have grown by nearly 80% from FY2002 to FY2011. However, it is important to note that the rates of growth have not been the same across the two Section 8 programs. As shown in Figure 4 , appropriations for the Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) program grew by 75% from FY2005 to FY2011; appropriations for the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) program, or Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, grew only about one-third as much during that period, by about 24%. The growth in appropriations for PBRA is largely attributable to the renewal of old project-based Section 8 contracts when they expire. Those contracts were originally funded in the 1970s and 1980s with long-term appropriations. The contracts typically require new annual appropriations in order to be renewed. The vast majority of contracts are now funded with annual appropriations, but some expirations continue to occur and require new appropriations each year.", "As discussed earlier and shown in Figure 2 , between FY2002 and FY2010 the amount of offsetting receipts declined by about 70%. That decline was largely attributable to declines in offsetting receipts available from the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The amount available from FHA to offset the cost of new HUD appropriations had declined from a high of over $3.5 billion in FY2004 to well under $0.5 billion in FY2010. That trend completely reversed in FY2011 when the amount of offsetting receipts from FHA increased to over $4 billion, the highest level in a decade. The increase is attributable to FHA's increasing market share following the downturn in the economy, as well as to policy changes made by FHA that increased the fees charged to new FHA-insured borrowers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2011", "paragraphs": ["When no FY2011 appropriations legislation was enacted before the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1, 2010), the 111 th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) that continued funding at the FY2010 level for most accounts in the federal budget (including all of the accounts in HUD's budget). The final CR of the 111 th Congress, P.L. 111-322 , was slated to expire at the earlier of March 4, 2011, or enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation.

In order to offset the impact of the lower funding level attributable to the rescission, the law directs the Secretary of HUD to reduce the funding allocation to those PHAs with excess balances in their reserve accounts (referred to as net restricted assets, or NRA). The intent of this offset is to require PHAs to spend down their reserves equivalent to the rescission so that total funding for the program in CY2012 is equivalent to the pre-rescission funding level.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA Loan Limits", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 112-55 included a provision reinstating recently expired higher loan limits for FHA in some areas. By statute, FHA can only insure mortgages up to a certain principal amount. These loan limits are based on area median home prices, and therefore vary by area. There is also a national floor and a national ceiling that affect loan limits in low-cost and high-cost areas, respectively, and these are calculated as percentages of the national conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "In early 2008, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (ESA) temporarily raised the FHA loan limits in high-cost areas and some other areas in response to the housing downturn and tighter credit availability. Specifically, ESA specified that the FHA loan limit would be 125% of area median home prices in most areas, with a high-cost area limit of 175% of the GSE conforming loan limit (a ceiling of $729,750). The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) established new statutory limits at 115% of area median home prices in most areas, with a high-cost area limit of 150% of the GSE conforming loan limit (a ceiling of $625,500). These limits were intended to go into effect beginning in 2009; however, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) specified that the loan limits in a given area would be set at the higher of the ESA or the HERA limits through 2009. ", "The provision setting the FHA loan limits at the higher of the ESA limits or the HERA limits in a given area was extended a number of times until the last extension expired at the end of FY2011, at which time the loan limits fell to HERA levels. However, P.L. 112-55 reinstated the higher FHA loan limits through December 31, 2013.", "Not all areas are affected by a change in the FHA loan limits from those specified in HERA to those specified in ESA. The change affects high-cost areas, since the high-cost area ceiling is lower under HERA than under ESA. The change also affects some areas that are not high-cost, depending on the trajectory of home prices in those areas, since the loan limit under ESA is 125% of 2007 area median home prices while the loan limit under HERA is 115% of more recent area median home prices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Related Legislation", "paragraphs": ["The Budget Control Act of 2011", "On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) into law following lengthy negotiations surrounding the national debt limit. The act included provisions authorizing increases in the debt limit, as well as provisions designed to reduce the federal deficit. One way the act attempts to reduce deficits is by establishing discretionary spending caps, which limit the amount of money that can be spent through the annual appropriations process over the next 10 years. These statutory budget caps are enforceable via a process known as sequestration. If the caps are exceeded in any year, under sequestration the executive branch is required to proportionally reduce funding for all agencies, accounts, programs, projects, and activities by the amount necessary to reduce total budget authority to the level authorized under the caps. Some programs are exempted from sequestration or receive special treatment; none of HUD's discretionary programs are exempted or receive special treatment.", "The total amount of discretionary funding available under the caps in FY2012, as established under the BCA, is less than the amount that was available in FY2011, but is more than the amount that was approved under the House budget resolution (discussed in the next section of this Appendix).", "The BCA included several other deficit reduction provisions that do not directly affect HUD but could have implications for the department. The BCA created a deficit reduction \"super committee,\" which was charged with finding at least an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit savings over a 10-year period. Since the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to complete its mandate, under the terms of the BCA, an automatic sequestration will take place in FY2013 and the discretionary budget caps for FY2014-FY2021 will be reduced in order to achieve the desired $1.2 trillion in savings, barring additional action by Congress. ", "FY2012 Budget Resolutions", "The annual budget resolution acts as an agreement between the House and Senate establishing parameters within which Congress can consider legislation dealing with spending and revenue. In addition to setting forth enforceable levels of spending, revenue, and public debt, the budget resolution provides spending allocations to House and Senate committees. Once the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees receive a committee allocation in the budget resolution, they divide their allocation of discretionary budget authority among their 12 subcommittees. Each subcommittee is responsible for one of the 12 regular appropriations bills. The allocations to each of the subcommittees are generally referred to as 302(b) allocations. While a budget resolution and subcommittee allocations alone cannot be used to determine how much funding any individual account or program will receive, they do set the parameters within which decisions about funding for individual accounts and programs can be made. ", "The House and the Senate budget committees began their consideration of the FY2012 budget resolution when they received the President's budget. As part of the formulation process, the committees receive information from executive branch officials, Members of Congress, and the public, as well as \"views and estimates\" statements from authorizing committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenues. The target date for completion of the budget resolution is April 15.", "On April 6, 2011, the House Budget Committee reported its FY2012 budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 34 ). It was agreed to by the House on April 15, 2011. On May 10, 2011, the House Appropriations Committee released draft subcommittee allocations. The THUD subcommittee received an allocation of $47.7 billion in FY2012, which was $8.7 billion (or 15%) lower than the allocation it received in FY2011 ($56.4 billion). ", "In addition to setting overall spending levels, H.Con.Res. 34 contains another provision that could have implications for the THUD subcommittee and potentially for HUD's budget. Section 408 directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), at the direction of the chairman of the Budget Committee, to use a different method when scoring FHA receipts. According to CBO, if this alternate scoring mechanism was used in FY2012, the FHA account would not produce the $5 billion in offsetting receipts estimated in the President's budget, but would instead require appropriations. ", "While the Senate Budget Committee did not consider an FY2012 budget resolution, the FY2012 discretionary spending cap, combined with specific Senate procedural provisions enacted under the BCA, serve as an alternate to a formal Senate budget resolution for FY2012. Specifically, the procedural provisions of the BCA required the chair of the Senate Budget Committee to establish committee spending allocations, subject to the discretionary spending limit, and these levels are to have the same force and effect as if they were included and associated with a budget resolution for FY2012 adopted by Congress. Under these terms, the Senate established an allocation of $57.3 billion for THUD for FY2012, which is nearly $1 billion higher than the House allocation under H.Con.Res. 34 .", "Since the FY2012 discretionary spending cap enacted under the BCA (discussed in the prior section of this Appendix) is higher than those adopted under H.Con.Res. 34 , for the purposes of conferencing on the final FY2012 THUD appropriations law ( P.L. 112-55 ), the higher Senate allocation for THUD was used."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
