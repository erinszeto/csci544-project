P.L. 113-76 also provides a total of $2.77 billion for Worldwide Security Protection (of which $900.3 million are OCO funds), specifying that the $585 million above the requested amount should be applied to the normalization of Iraq operations.

OCP advocates argue that the discrepancy affects morale and retention of FSOs and acts as a financial disincentive to serve overseas, including by its cumulative impact on retirement pay.

Together with $300 million of International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDA) funds for cash-based food security programs, total emergency food aid would have been $1.4 billion in FY2014. The Administration's budget also proposed to shift $250 million to the Development Assistance (DA) account for a Community Development and Resilience Fund (CDRF). Feed the Future funding of $80 million would have been used to augment the CRDF, making its total $330 million. The CDRF would have effectively replaced the current $400 million \"safe box\" for nonemergency development food aid provided in the 2008 farm bill. Presumably, U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that currently carry out food aid programs would have participated in these CDRF programs. The Administration maintained that by removing cost inefficiencies of the Food for Peace program, such as monetization, the same level of nonemergency program activity would be supported and more people would be reached. Finally, the Administration's FY2014 budget proposed to create a new Emergency Food Assistance Contingency Fund ($75 million) to provide emergency food assistance for unexpected and urgent food needs.", "In the FY2014 appropriation, Congress rejected the proposed reforms to food aid funding and implementation practices. P.L. 113-76 continues to fund food aid through the traditional accounts in the agriculture appropriation, providing $1.466 billion for the Food for Peace, Title II program and $185.13 million for the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program, a 7.5% increase, in total, over the FY2013 funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Humanitarian Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Humanitarian assistance is intended to save lives and meet basic human needs in the wake of natural disasters and conflicts. In FY2012, humanitarian assistance funding in the foreign operations accounts totaled $4.56 billion. The FY2013 full-year continuing resolution increased funding over the FY2012 level for two key humanitarian assistance accounts. International Disaster & Famine Assistance (IDA) increased from $1.10 billion to an estimated $1.55 billion (post-sequester estimate), with the increased funds designated as OCO. The Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account increased from $1.98 billion to $2.70 billion (post-sequester estimate), also with OCO funds. In addition, the Administration transferred $200 million of previously appropriated OCO funds in the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund to the MRA account ($100 million) and IDA account ($120 million) to respond to the crisis in Syria.", "The Administration's FY2014 foreign operations budget included $4.13 billion for humanitarian assistance accounts, including $1.76 billion for MRA, $2.05 billion for IDA, $250 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (of which $200 million was specifically for Syria), and $75 million for a new Emergency Food Assistance Contingency Fund (EFACF). Of the IDA funds, $629 million were allocated to USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to respond to natural disaster, civil strife, food security, and displaced populations. The remaining $1.42 billion was designated for Food for Peace activities currently funded through the Agriculture appropriation (see Food Aid above). In total, the humanitarian assistance request was about 27% below the FY2013 post-sequester estimate, due in part to $250 million in food aid being moved to the Development Assistance account.", "The FY2014 appropriation, P.L. 113-76 , provides $1.80 billion for IDA, $3.06 billion for MRA, and $50 million for ERMA. As discussed above, the legislation did not adopt proposed reforms to food aid programs, provided no funding for the proposed EFACF, and continued to appropriate food assistance through agriculture accounts. In total, the foreign operations accounts included $4.91 billion in humanitarian assistance, a nearly 15% increase over FY2013 funding and almost 19% more than the Administration requested. The explanatory statement describes the increase as intended to address acute humanitarian needs related to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Administration Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration introduced three major foreign assistance initiatives in 2009 and 2010\u2014the Global Health Initiative, the Food Security Initiative (Feed the Future), and the Global Climate Change Initiative\u2014which continued to be priorities in the FY2014 budget request. ", "Global Health Initiative. The request included $8.315 billion for global health programs, a 3% increase over the FY2013 post-sequester estimate. The FY2014 appropriation includes $8.439 billion in the global health account, a 4.7% increase over FY2013 funding and $1.5% more than the FY2014 request. The sub-allocations outlined in the explanatory statement are similar to those in the request for the largest programs, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal and child health, but differ notably for a few priorities: tuberculosis (+24%), neglected tropical disease (+18%), and nutrition (+21%). Food Security Initiative. Feed the Future (FtF) is the Administration's food security initiative, designed to support long-term country-led agricultural growth and nutrition plans. For FY2014, the Administration requested a total of $1.191 billion for Feed the Future across several appropriations account, a 9% increase over the FY2012 funding. (FY2013 data are not yet available.) Increased funding would be channeled to economic resilience activities in regions of Africa facing chronic food insecurity. A general provision in the FY2014 appropriations legislation provides that \"not less than\" $1.1 billion appropriated through bilateral economic assistance accounts should be used for food security and agricultural development activities. Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI). The GCCI would have decreased 2% from FY2012 funding (FY2013 data are not yet available), including a $100 million transfer from ESF, under the Administration's FY2014 request of $837 million. Within that total, bilateral clean energy funding would have increased by 7% and adaptation programs by 1%, while sustainable landscapes funding would have been reduced by 10%. Total U.S. contributions to World Bank climate accounts would have decreased by 6% if the $100 million ESF transfer to these funds is calculated into the FY2012 funding total. The FY2014 appropriation for GCCI programs is unclear, as the funding directives within the ESF and DA accounts, through which the majority of GCCI funding flows, do not mention climate activities.", "Appendix A. State-Foreign Operations Appropriations, by Account", "Appendix B. International Affairs (150) Function Account, FY2012-FY2014", "Appendix C. Government Shutdown Effects on the Department of State and Foreign Aid", "FY2014 began on October 1, 2013, with a partial government shutdown because Congress had not passed any appropriations bills for FY2014 and could not agree to differing House and Senate terms for a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government funded. State operations and foreign assistance programs generally continued to operate because of two-year funding for the Department of State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs account that funds salaries and expenses and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Operating Expenses account. In addition to residual FY2013 and prior year money, trust funds, fees, permanent appropriations, and the Working Capital Fund remained available. In contrast, the Office of Inspector General, the International Boundary and Water Commission, and reportedly the American Sections of the International Joint Commission and International Boundary Commission operate on single-year appropriations and did shut down until the CR became law. ", "Since the majority of foreign aid programs operate with multi-year or no-year funding, most foreign aid continued to flow. Activities within these programs, however, were limited by prohibitions on new grants and cooperative agreements as well as restrictions on travel, training, and representational events, among other things. These applied to programs such as State's global health activities, migration and refugee assistance, and democracy promotion funds. ", "A few foreign aid programs operate with single-year appropriations but, according to Department of State officials, were able to operate on FY2013 money. U.S. security assistance programs, including International Military Education and Training (IMET), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), with small exceptions, were funded only through FY2013. If there had been another significant gap in FY2014 funding, more immediate impacts might have been felt by the recipients of these programs, such as Israel, as might U.S. support to the peacekeeping mission in the Sinai, according to the Department of State. Multilateral assistance within the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account also typically is funded with one-year appropriations. A lack of FY2014 funding for this account could have delayed U.S. voluntary contributions to such international entities as the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP). If there had been another government shutdown and the balance of FY2013 funding were insufficient, these programs funded entirely through single-year appropriations would have shut down until a new appropriation was enacted or unless they were deemed by the relevant Chief of Mission to be necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property or for the \"conduct of foreign affairs essential to national security.\" A delay in FY2014 funding could have affected recipients of these programs immediately.", "If another shutdown had occurred in FY2014 and funds lapsed, both the Department of State and USAID might have instituted procedures to cease operations other than \"excepted\" functions\u2014those essential to national security, including the conduct of foreign affairs. Among other restrictions, a hiring freeze would have remained in place and new security investigations would have been suspended. The Foreign Service Institute would have closed and training would not have been authorized. In addition, the department would have restricted a number of allowances, including representation allowances (reimbursement for expenses while on official commission overseas), education allowances, and educational travel, unless the travel was necessary for human safety. In addition to those, unpaid allowances for non-excepted positions could also have included include post differential (such as hardship posts) and danger pay, according to the department."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
