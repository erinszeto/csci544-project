In reviewing the evolution of the PWEDA's statutory authority, several observations are worth making:", "Congress has consistently used unemployment as the primary criterion to determine eligibility for EDA assistance, but it has authorized the inclusion of other criteria, resulting in up to 80% of counties being deemed eligible for assistance. Although Congress has cast a wide net in terms of the criteria for EDA eligibility, it has remained focused on a singular mission: supporting private sector job creation in economically depressed areas primarily through the financing of infrastructure projects, including technology enhancements. Congress has continued to promote multi-jurisdictional regional planning as a core activity in support of EDA's job creation mission. The use of EDA public works-based assistance as an anti-recession tool has generally been opposed by some in Congress and viewed as slow and costly in generating jobs for the unemployed during a recession.", "During its 46-year history, EDA has evolved from a cluster of programs targeted primarily to rural communities experiencing long-term economic depression to an agency that has also been called upon to target assistance to urban areas and to address issues confronting communities experiencing sudden economic dislocation caused by factory shutdowns, foreign competition, base closures, and disasters. Although Congress initially approved legislation that used unemployment rates as the primary determinant of eligibility, it has also used per capita income and other criteria to qualify areas for assistance. Supporters contend that this allows EDA to be responsive to areas experiencing population outmigration, natural disasters, natural resource depletion, military base closures, the sudden loss of manufacturing jobs, and other special needs, while detractors contend that this broad targeting has diffused the agency's resources.", "As the programs of EDA evolved, Congress enacted legislation that standardized matching fund requirements among programs, simplified the application process, encouraged regional cooperation, established performance measures, and provided additional performance-based funding to grant recipients. The 1998 amendments standardized the federal cost share at 50% of a project's cost, but allowed EDA to provide supplemental assistance to increase the EDA contribution to no more than 80% of a project's cost. The 2004 amendments allowed EDA to waive completely the cost share requirements based on an EDA finding of insufficient taxing or borrowing capacity.", "In an effort to encourage regional cooperation, Congress conditioned the receipt of public works and economic adjustment assistance on the development and implementation of a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) and required each grantee's CEDS to be consistent with local and district plans. Congress also directed EDA to award additional funds for outstanding performance in the execution of grant activities. Most recently, with the passage of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5), Congress returned to the practice of using EDA assistance as a countercyclical tool. This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Created with the enactment of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (PWEDA; P.L. 89-136), the Economic Development Administration has a 46-year history of supporting job creation and long-term economic recovery efforts in the nation's economically distressed areas. The 112 th Congress may consider legislation reauthorizing the EDA, the authorizations of which expired at the end of FY2008. At least one bill, S. 782 , which would reauthorize the agency and its programs through FY2015, has been reported out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and placed on the Senate calendar. Also, Congress is expected to consider funding for the agency and its programs as part of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. As the 112 th Congress considers these and other legislative proposals that may reauthorize, amend, and fund the agency and its programs, a review of the evolution of the agency's statutory authority may inform Congress in its deliberations. In considering the reauthorization of the agency and its programs, Congress will do so within the larger policy context regarding other competing national issues, including efforts to reduce federal spending in order to address federal budget deficits and the national debt, concerns about duplication and fragmentation of federal economic development assistance, and efforts to support economic recovery and job creation following the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.

The PWAA authorized an appropriation of $900 million to be allocated by the President from among federal, state, and local projects authorized by Congress and required that at least $300 million be allocated to redevelopment areas (these were longer-term economically depressed areas) as defined by ARA.", "One of the principal complaints lodged against the PWAA was that it dispensed funds to too many areas for projects with too little economic value or impact.

The act affirmed Congress's commitment to placed-based economic development policies by tying eligibility to an area's unemployment rate and funding public works projects linked to commercial and industrial development as a means of creating jobs and combating poverty. The act also established Economic Development Districts (EDDs) comprising two or more redevelopment areas (RAs) as a means of promoting regional coordination and cooperation in the formulation and execution of Overall Economic Development Plans (OEDPs). The creation of EDDs was a significant departure from the single-county approach under ARA and mirrored the role of Local Development Districts created under ARDA. The legislation limited the federal share of a project's cost, thus requiring local participating entities to share the risk. In addition, the act relied heavily on the use of unemployment data to define eligible RAs, but included alternative criteria such as median income that had the net effect of expanding the number of EDA-eligible counties. ", "One of the criticisms of EDA that has endured since its inception is the high percentage of communities that continue to qualify as economically distressed. Over the life of the program, according to estimates included in a Rutgers University study, 60%-90% of counties met the qualifications for designation as economically distressed.", "As passed by Congress, the PWEDA included grants to public agencies and nonprofit entities for public works projects, loans to businesses, and technical assistance and grants to redevelopment areas to be used to develop OEDPs.

On the one hand, some policymakers supported a limited federal role in economic development, arguing that government intervention distorts the marketplace, while others embraced policies that were intended to reduce regional deficiencies and improve the competitiveness of depressed areas. Congress not only embraced physical development policies and programs such as EDA assistance programs, but, as a part of President Nixon's \"New Federalism\" initiative, it also moved to consolidate manpower training programs, such as those authorized by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, and other physical development programs.
