These payments accounted for 89.3% of the $1.289 billion provided overall for the Impact Aid program. Section 8003(b) payments differ from funds provided by most other federal elementary and secondary education programs in that they are not limited to specified uses (such as improving the educational achievement of disadvantaged students). While Section 8003(b) funds are generally used for current local education expenditures, they may also be used for capital expenditures. In addition, funds need not be spent only on federally connected children. Finally, because Impact Aid payments are not aimed at specific educational goals, accountability requirements for the use of funds or for specific outcomes are minimal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Funding Approach", "paragraphs": ["The federal government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends the following September 30. Funding for federal programs that is provided through the annual appropriations process is typically available at the start of the fiscal year, unless otherwise specified. In general, this period of availability most often begins on the first day of the fiscal year of the appropriations act, also referred to as the \"budget year.\" For the purposes of this report, such periods of availability are referred to as \"budget year appropriations.\" The Impact Aid program is funded using budget year appropriations provided in the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) appropriations bill. It should be noted that of the elementary and secondary education programs administered by ED that receive $1 billion or more in annual appropriations, Impact Aid Section 8003(b) is the only program that receives budget year appropriations.

Some observers have suggested that providing funding for these payments on a regular appropriations schedule has caused issues for program operations. Because of the timing of the school year, significant planning and preparation for the upcoming year tends to occur during the spring and summer months. However, the current timing of enactment and availability of federal funds provided through Impact Aid makes it difficult for LEAs to include them in their budget planning process. In addition, the full allocation of funds to LEAs is delayed in instances where the federal government is operating under a short-term continuing resolution at the beginning of the fiscal year until regular appropriations bills or a full-year continuing resolution is enacted. LEAs dependent on Impact Aid funding are also affected more quickly by any decrease in funding than LEAs receiving funds under other federal elementary and secondary education formula grant programs. For example, as a result of the FY2013 sequester, Impact Aid funding was reduced immediately during the 2012-2013 school year, while the decrease in funding for education programs receiving forward funding or advance appropriations did not affect LEAs until the following school year (2013-2014).

In general, this alternative approach would provide appropriations a number of months in advance of when they would become available with budget year appropriations. Such a process would presumably allow LEAs to incorporate funding with more certainty in their planning process for the upcoming school year. In addition, because of the lag in availability, if appropriations acts were delayed in any given year, LEAs presumably would not be adversely affected for the purposes of the upcoming school year.", "While appropriations could be made available at any time, as specified in the appropriations act in which they are enacted, two such conventions have been used for certain other ED programs to accommodate the disconnect between the federal fiscal year and the school year\u2014\"advance appropriations\" and \"forward funding.\" The Impact Aid Section 8003(b) payment is the only K-12 program administered by ED that receives $1 billion or more through the annual appropriations process that is not provided advance appropriations, forward funding, or a combination of the two .

The reasons such appropriations have been advocated include avoiding funding gaps or relying on continuing resolutions for funding at the beginning of the fiscal year, as well as the belief that such appropriations enable better advanced planning for those programs because they are typically enacted many months prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. O thers have argue d, however, that the ability to make such commitments may be limited by the extent to which programmatic needs can be forecasted in advan ce, and that providing alternative periods of availability for some programs makes their budgetary levels difficult to compare to programs that receive budget year appropriations.

Forward funding is similar to advance appropriations, in that it is enacted in advance of the school year for which it is provided. In the context of education, the distinction between the two is that forward funding becomes available during the summer months to provide for program costs that largely occur during the following fiscal year, whereas advance appropriations first become available in the fall, during that following fiscal year.", "At the program level, there is little difference between providing funds in July or October, as most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1.

For statutory enforcement, the Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed limits on discretionary spending that apply each fiscal year between FY2012 and FY2021. For procedural enforcement, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 provides for allocations of budget authority under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee, referred to as a \"302(a) allocation,\" as well as the suballocation of that spending to each of the 12 Appropriations subcommittees, referred to as a \"302(b) allocation.\" Both the 302(a) and 302(b) allocations, as well as the statutory discretionary spending limits, are enforceable during floor consideration through points of order that may be raised against any measure, including amendments, that would cause these limits to be exceeded. In addition, the statutory limits are enforceable after enactment through sequestration. ", "The amount provided in an appropriations act for a given fiscal year, for budget enforcement purposes, is determined by its period of availability. That is, the amount provided is \"scored\" in the fiscal year in which it first becomes available for obligation. Forward funding becomes available during the latter part of the budget year, and so is scored against the budget year of the bill in which it is enacted. In contrast, advance appropriations are scored against the limits on appropriations that apply the first fiscal year that they are available for obligation (typically the following fiscal year), and not the budget year of the bill in which they are enacted. Consequently, budget enforcement for advance appropriations would typically occur that following fiscal year in combination with the new discretionary appropriations for that year. That is, in the following fiscal year, the appropriations process begins with a \"charge\" against the appropriations limits for the budget year, even before the appropriations acts for that fiscal year have been drafted.", "Given that budget enforcement rules generally limit discretionary spending a single fiscal year at a time, providing appropriations in advance may allow them to be considered outside the context of the spending decisions for the upcoming year. In response to concerns about the potential to avoid the budget year limits when considering advance appropriations, various House and Senate procedural limits on the amount of advance appropriations that may be provided have been imposed through the congressional budget resolution and other associated procedural mechanisms since FY2001. These limits have typically specified the accounts for which advance appropriations may be provided, and have capped the amounts for certain advance appropriations. For FY2015, for example, the Senate limits established in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 , \u00a7112) restricted advance appropriations enacted in FY2015 appropriations acts to a total of $28.582 billion for the following accounts: ", "Employment and Training Administration; Job Corps; Education for the Disadvantaged; School Improvement; Special Education; Career, Technical, and Adult Education; Payment to Postal Service; Tenant-based Rental Assistance; and Project-based Rental Assistance.
