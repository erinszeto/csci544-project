That is, federal funds are awarded to provide a net increase in financial resources for specific types of educational services (such as the education of disadvantaged students or students with disabilities), rather than effectively providing general subsidies to state and local governments. All of the fiscal accountability requirements included in federal elementary and secondary education programs are intended to ensure that all federal funds represent a net increase in the level of financial resources available to serve eligible students, and that they do not ultimately replace funds that states or LEAs would provide in the absence of federal aid.", "Two fiscal accountability requirements that apply to major federal K-12 education aid programs would also be relevant to the Teacher Stabilization program. The first requirement\u2014maintenance of effort\u2014requires, for example, that recipient LEAs must have provided, from state and local sources, a level of funding (either aggregate or per student) in the preceding year that is at least a specified percentage of the amount in the second preceding year. A second fiscal accountability requirement provides that federal funds must be used to supplement, not supplant (SNS), state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of students eligible to be served under the federal program in question. SNS provisions prohibit states and/or LEAs from using federal funds (1) to provide services that state and/or local funds have provided or purchased in the past; (2) to provide services that are required to be provided under federal, state, or local law; or (3) to provide services for some students (e.g., those eligible under specific federal programs) that are provided to other students with non-federal funds. Similar to the Education Jobs Fund, funds provided under the Teacher Stabilization program would not be subject to supplement, not supplant requirements (except as noted above).

The percent of awarded funds drawn down by states varied from about 7.8% in New Jersey to nearly 100% in several states. The differences in the draw down rates may be attributed to several factors, including the timing of the grant awards (funds were awarded after the start of the 2010-2011 school year), no requirement for states to provide funds to LEAs within a certain time frame, and the ability to obligate funds through September 30, 2012, which would permit their use during the 2011-2012 school year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "First Responder Stabilization (Title II, Subtitle C)39", "paragraphs": ["The American Jobs Act would provide $5 billion for a proposed Community Oriented Policing Stabilization Fund (the fund), which would be used to \"prevent layoffs of, and support additional jobs for, law enforcement officers and other first responders.\" Of the proposed appropriation for the fund, $4 billion would be for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office for a competitive grant program for hiring, rehiring, or retaining law enforcement officers.

The mission of the COPS program is to advance community policing in all jurisdictions across the United States. The COPS program awards grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States so they can hire and train law enforcement officers to participate in community policing, purchase and deploy new crime-fighting technologies, and develop and test new and innovative policing strategies. COPS grants are managed by the COPS Office, which was created in 1994 by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to oversee the COPS program. ", "The American Jobs Act would require that grants be awarded in accordance with the conditions set forth in the authorizing legislation for the COPS program. However, the matching requirement and maximum grant award amount would be waived under the proposed program. These waivers would allow the COPS Office to award grants to law enforcement agencies that cover the entire cost of hiring, rehiring, or retaining a law enforcement officer, but it also likely means that the COPS Office would award fewer grants than it would if both the matching and maximum grant amount conditions were left in place. While the matching and maximum grant amount requirements would be waived under this program, the COPS Office would still be required to ensure that, unless all eligible applicants receive awards, every state receives no less than 0.5% of the total appropriation and that half of the total appropriation goes to law enforcement agencies serving jurisdictions of 150,000 or fewer.", "In evaluating the current proposal, it might be useful to examine how the COPS Office awarded the funding it received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). The COPS Office established the COPS Hiring Recover Program (CHRP) to award the funds it received under ARRA. The COPS Office acknowledged that it had a statutory requirement to promote community policing, but that the intent of the ARRA was to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery; to assist those most impacted by the recession; and to stabilize state and local government budgets. As such, applicants for funding under the CHRP were required to submit data on their community's fiscal health, crime rate, and planned community policing activities. The COPS Office used the data to develop a score for each application whereby 50% of the final score was based on fiscal health factors and the other 50% was based on the applicant's crime rate and planned community policing activities. Given that the purpose of the proposed American Jobs Act program is to prevent layoffs and support additional jobs for law enforcement officers, which would imply that funding should be targeted to areas where there is some level of fiscal distress, it is possible that the COPS Office could use the CHRP methodology as a blueprint for awarding grants under the proposed program.

Recruitment and retention grants help volunteer and combination fire departments finance activities related to the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. The SAFER program was established by the 108 th Congress in Section 1057 of the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-136 ), and is codified as Section 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229a).

The American Jobs Act would include this waiver authority for the additional $1 billion in grant money to be made available for FY2012. Specifically, this waiver authority would allow SAFER grants to be used to retain and rehire firefighters, and to fill positions eliminated through attrition.

Unemployment benefits may be extended at the state level by the permanent EB program if high unemployment exists within the state. Once regular unemployment benefits are exhausted, the EB program may provide up to an additional 13 or 20 weeks of benefits, depending on worker eligibility, state law, and state economic conditions.

Using a two-year versus a three-year EB trigger lookback is an important adjustment because some states are likely to trigger off their EB periods in the near future despite high, sustained\u2014but not increasing\u2014unemployment rates.
