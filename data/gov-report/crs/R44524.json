Historically, both the United States and the EU have provided significant government support for their agricultural sectors. In the United States, federal farm policy has traditionally focused on price and/or income support programs concentrated on row crops including grains, oilseeds, and cotton as well as sugar and dairy. In contrast, the EU provides more extensive support to a broader range of farm and food products\u2014including livestock products and fresh and processed fruits and vegetables.", "Significant structural differences in their respective farm sectors have helped to shape differences in farm policy. The United States has double the farmland base (over 1 billion acres versus about 457 million acres), while the EU has five times the number of farms at 10.8 million with an average size of 47 acres, compared with 2.1 million U.S. farms at an average size of 441 acres. As a result, EU outlays per acre appear much larger than in the United States, whereas U.S. outlays per farm appear much larger. In general, the small size of EU farm holdings, their substantially larger number of farms relative to the United States, and the larger share of rural population (25% versus 18%) has played a strong role in the formation of EU farm policy as compared to the United States. The EU tends to have a stronger rural development emphasis and allows frequent exemptions for identifiably small farming units from certain cross compliance restrictions and payment limitations.", "Since the mid-1990s, both regions have reoriented their domestic agricultural policy toward less market-distorting policies in response to both internal budget pressures and international trade commitments. EU policymakers have faced additional pressures to reform domestic agricultural policy, due to the EU's steady growth to 28 European nations and 508 million people by 2013\u2014including the agriculturally intensive but economically poorer countries of Eastern Europe.", "Several policy trends have emerged in both the EU and United States, including the following:", "Traditionally, the United States uses less trade-distorting support than the EU, although the EU has made substantial reductions in the volume of its trade distorting support. When measured as a share of total gross farm receipts, support for market-distorting commodity programs has decreased for both the EU and United States, but the EU's share remains about double the U.S. share. In both the EU and United States, support for less distorting non-commodity-type programs (e.g., conservation, rural development, agro-forestry, and nutrition) has increased substantially and now accounts for a majority of total farm support. U.S. consumers have received net benefits from agriculture-based support programs, whereas EU consumers have generally transferred more support to agricultural producers than they have received in off-setting benefits (i.e., the EU's consumer subsidy estimate is negative), although the net transfer has been declining over time as a share of gross farm receipts.", "Because the United States and the EU figure prominently in the development and use of global agricultural policy, information comparing their farm support programs will likely be of interest to Congress as the United States prepares for another round of domestic farm bill negotiations and engages in international trade negotiations on several fronts, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) with the EU, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Pacific Rim nations, and within the WTO's multilateral negotiating forum."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Both the United States and European Union (EU) have large, diverse, and economically important agricultural sectors.

In 2005, following the 2004 accession of 10 new EU member states, the EU had an estimated 14.5 million farms. By 2013, the number of EU farm holdings had declined to an estimated 10.8 million (the most recent data point) with an average size of 43 acres. This contrasts with the United States, where 2.1 million farms with an average size of 477 acres per farm were in operation in 2015. ", "The technological scale of agricultural production varies dramatically across the EU's 28 member states. Many of the EU's Eastern European member states have been slow to adopt newer technology, in large part due to the extremely small size of their agricultural holdings. For example, Romania had an estimated 3.6 million farm holdings in 2013, with an average size of about 11 acres. Poland has another 1.4 million holdings averaging about 28 acres each, and Italy has over 1 million farms and an average holding of about 37 acres.

For example:", "In the United States, Congress develops and authorizes federal farm policy. In contrast, the EU agricultural policy has traditionally been developed by the European Commission, largely outside of the legislative arena. The United States has traditionally focused its producer support programs on dairy and row crops including grains, oilseeds, and cotton. In addition, the United States has provided substantial support to the sugar sector via supply management and import quotas.

To fully appreciate the current status of U.S. and EU farm policy, this section briefly reviews the origins and evolution of their respective policies.

As a result, the initial focus of U.S. farm policy was supporting commodity prices and rural incomes.", "EU farm policy began later, following the devastation of World War II and the creation of the precursor European Economic Community (EEC) on January 1, 1958, based on the 1957 Treaty of Rome. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Europe confronted serious food shortages. Although the shortages subsided by the mid-1950s, Europe remained a major importer of foodstuffs well into the 1970s. Thus, the EEC's initial policy focus was on ensuring adequate internal food supplies and supporting the rural economy. ", "The EEC established the CAP in 1962 based on three major principles: ", "1. A unified market in which there is a free flow of agricultural commodities with common prices within the EU, 2. P roduct preference for domestic production in the internal market over foreign imports through common customs tariffs, and 3. Financial solidarity through common financing of agricultural programs. ", "The CAP's original objectives were to increase agricultural productivity, ensure fair living standards for farmers, stabilize markets, ensure the availability of food, and provide food at reasonable prices. These aims were achieved primarily by the EEC intervening in commodity markets to buy farm output when market prices fell below agreed target prices. To prevent imports from undercutting the high internal prices that resulted from the operation of the intervention buying system, the EEC levied variable tariffs on imported agricultural products. The surpluses of agricultural products that resulted from the high internal prices of the intervention buying system were reduced by export subsidies. The system of intervention buying, import levies, and export subsidies was carried out in various common market organizations (CMOs) for bananas, cereals, floriculture, dried fodder, fruits and vegetables, hops, olive oil and table olives, flax and hemp, eggs, pork, milk products, rice, seeds, sugar, tobacco, beef and veal, sheep meat and goat meat, wine, poultry meat, and other agricultural products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Encouraging Surplus Production", "paragraphs": ["The United States was a major beneficiary of Europe's large agricultural import needs during the 1940s and 1950s. Despite strong U.S. exports to Europe, by the late 1950s, technological advances combined with relatively strong government price supports had led to the accumulation of large U.S. stocks of grains and cotton. In response, U.S. farm policy instituted supply management provisions in the 1960s including acreage planting restrictions and large global food aid donations for surplus removal. ", "In the early 1970s, a global economic and commodity market crisis helped to draw down world grain and oilseed reserves, sharply raised global commodity prices, and induced both the United States and the EEC to increase support for their respective agricultural sectors. For example, the United States instituted commodity-price targets linked to the cost of production, thus building in a self-inflating aspect that encouraged increasing support outlays and concomitant agricultural output independent of market conditions. Similarly, the EEC maintained internal support prices at levels well above world market conditions, thus isolating domestic producers from international market signals.", "Among the unintended consequences of the CAP were high prices for consumers and high budget expenditures. During the 1970s and 1980s, the CAP accounted for as much as 70% of the total EEC budget. EEC trading partners criticized the CAP for distorting world markets and interfering with global agricultural trade. As the EEC expanded to 12 members by 1986, the generous support programs of the CAP resulted in increasing budget outlays. ", "By the mid-1980s, generous price and income supports in both the United States and the EEC had resulted in overproduction and large stock accumulations (a substantial portion government-owned). Burgeoning EEC and U.S. supplies in the world's two dominant grain stock holders swelled global stocks to record levels, dampened global commodity prices, and created intense budgetary pressures for reform. By 1982, the CAP had successfully shifted the EEC from food deficit to food surplus, and extensive use of export subsidies had increased the EEC's share of world food exports, often at the expense of U.S. exporters. In 1985, the United States responded with its own export subsidy program\u2014the Export Enhancement Program\u2014to help protect U.S. market share in international markets. The United States and the EU recognized their dilemma in precipitating an agricultural trade war but were hesitant to unilaterally undertake reforms for fear of losing market share in the very competitive international marketplace.

In the 1990 farm bill ( P.L. 101-624 ), acreage eligible for income support payments was reduced and acreage set-asides were tied to end-of-season stocks, making them mandatory when stocks were too high relative to usage. ", "By the early 1990s, with further enlargement looming, the EEC felt compelled to reduce its budgetary liability ( Table 3 ). The prospect of enlarging eastward toward larger countries with smaller and poorer farm households heightened the urgency of reform. The EEC followed the United States by initiating the MacSharry Reforms of 1992, which reduced internal support prices and compensated for lower prices by making production-based (i.e., coupled) payments. In 1993, the Masstricht Treaty established the EU in place of the EEC.

In addition to eliminating most planting restrictions, as well as farmer-owned (but government-financed) grain reserves, the bill replaced target-price deficiency payments (i.e., a counter-cyclical income support program) with direct payments (i.e., a lump sum decoupled payment) and extended the use of special marketing loan repayment provisions (first begun for rice and cotton in the 1985 farm bill) to other major program crops. This effectively curtailed the U.S Department of Agriculture's role in commodity storage and management.", "The EU also continued to increase the market-orientation of its own farm policy. The Agenda 2000 reforms further lowered support prices, replaced them with even larger production-based direct payments, and required that some farmland be taken out of production.

", "The major component of Pillar I is the decoupled direct payment (DP), which replaced the coupled, production-based payments made under various commodity-specific CMOs. As a result, support became largely decoupled from current prices or production. EU member countries could temporarily maintain a limited link between payments and production (partial decoupling) but had to move toward full decoupling. The 2003 reforms also imposed a ceiling on Pillar I spending: Increases were limited to 1% per year in nominal terms from 2007 to 2013. In addition, the receipt of farm income support was made contingent upon the farmer meeting an extensive array of new agricultural and environmental norms introduced in 2003. The budget for Pillar II was intended to more than double by 2013, but budget restrictions substantially limited spending.

The 2008 CAP Health Check built on the 2003 reforms as it simplified the CAP's direct aid system, established a process for shifting funding from direct aid to rural development (referred to as modulation), clarified support for newly acceded countries, and increased milk quotas gradually leading up to their abolition in 2015. In addition, reform of the EU wine sector was begun in 2008, including the end to the planting rights system by 2018 at the latest, and the sugar reform was to culminate with abolition of sugar quotas by 2017.

The 2014 farm bill reshaped the farm safety net for traditional program crops, most notably by eliminating decoupled direct payments (valued at $5 billion per year for 1996-2013) and adding two new partially coupled payment programs: the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs. Unlike the EU, where direct payments represent the largest share (71%) of the projected CAP budget for 2014-2020 ( Table 5 ), domestic nutrition programs comprise the largest share (80%) of projected farm bill outlays over the five-year farm bill period 2014-2018 ( Table 6 ).", "The U.S. farm commodity safety net is comprised of three components. First are the traditional f arm commodity programs which represent the heart of U.S. farm policy by virtue of their long history (dating back to the 1930s). Support is based primarily on statutorily fixed prices, although ARC uses a moving average of market prices. For crop years 2014-2018, the marketing loan program establishes minimum prices for approximately two dozen commodities, including corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, and peanuts. In addition, producers with production histories for covered crops could choose between PLC payments and ARC payments. Second is f ederal crop insurance which makes available subsidized insurance for more than 130 commodities to help farmers manage risks associated with a loss in yield or revenue. Producers pay a portion of the premium, which increases as the level of coverage rises. USDA pays the rest of the premium\u201462%, on average, in 2014\u2014and covers the cost of selling and servicing the policies.
