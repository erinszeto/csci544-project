It included $39 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an increase of 4% in net budget authority from the FY2008 non-emergency level. That requested increase in net budget authority was largely attributable to a decline in the amount available to offset the HUD budget. The President's budget request would have resulted in an overall decline in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities of just over 1% from the FY2008 level.", "Despite the request for an overall decline in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities, the President's FY2009 budget did request increased appropriations in several areas, including project-based Section 8 rental assistance, the HOME Investment Partnerships block grant program, and Homeless Assistance grants. The President's FY2009 budget requested reductions in funding for several programs, including the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program and the Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities program. It proposed eliminating funding for several programs that were funded in FY2008, including the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program, the Brownfields Redevelopment program, Section 108 loan guarantees, and the Rural Housing and Economic Development block grant program.

These funds are generally provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular program level funding.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits in the amount of new, non-emergency, discretionary appropriations they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to provide less in regular annual appropriations. Another way to stay within these limits is to find offsets for spending. A portion of the cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees paid by HUD partners or clients.", "The interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections, determines HUD's total budget authority. Budget authority is also the \"cost\" of the HUD budget, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office in its scorekeeping process. The total amount of budget authority provided to HUD each year, while important for federal budgeting purposes, is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding that is being provided for HUD's programs and activities.", "For example, if Congress has increased appropriations for HUD's programs and activities at the same time that offsetting receipts are increasing by a greater amount, then HUD's total budget authority may appear to be declining. Conversely, if Congress has reduced appropriations for HUD's programs and activities at the same time that offsetting receipts are declining by a greater amount, then HUD's budget authority may appear to be increasing. If Congress wished to maintain level budget authority for HUD programs, Congress would increase appropriations if offsets are declining (or, provide less appropriations if offsets are increasing).", "As shown by the line in Figure 1 , total non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 28% between FY2002-FY2008, from over $29 billion to just under $38 billion. However, the increase in total budget authority masks several important trends.", "From FY2002 to FY2008, regular annual appropriations, which is the amount available to fund HUD's programs and activities, grew by 20%. During the same period, the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections, which Congress uses to reduce the cost of providing new appropriations, declined by more than 65% (see Figure 1 ). As a result, the increase in total non-emergency budget authority for HUD from FY2002-FY2008 is not fully attributable to increases in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities; rather, part of the increase in total budget authority is attributable to decreases in the amount available in offsetting receipts.", "For example, in FY2007, Congress provided $39 billion in regular appropriations for HUD's programs and activities. Since $3 billion was available from offsets and rescissions, HUD's total budget authority was $36 billion. If less had been available in offsets, the cost to Congress of providing $39 billion in regular appropriations would have been higher.", "The increase in regular (non-emergency) appropriations shown in Figure 1 (from just over $35 billion in FY2002 to over $40 billion in FY2008) is largely attributable to the growth in appropriations for the project-based and tenant-based Section 8 program. From FY2002-FY2008, appropriations for Section 8 grew by more than 40%; appropriations for all other programs and activities during that period declined by about 4%.

Net restricted assets are accumulated unspent funds that agencies are not permitted to spend because their use would result in the agency leasing more than their allocated number of vouchers (referred to as overleasing). In order to enable agencies to spend their net restricted assets, Congress directed HUD to reduce agencies' FY2008 funding by the amount by which their net restricted assets exceeded 7% of their prior year renewal funding (see discussion under \"Renewal Formula\" heading below). It was estimated that roughly the same amount of net restricted asset funding would be freed up as was rescinded ($723 million).

This rate of increase is likely below the annual adjustment factor (AAF), which is the inflation measure that is generally used for calculating PHAs' budgets; in FY2009, the unweighted average AAF is about 3.4%.", "S. 3261 proposed a renewal funding strategy similar to the one used in FY2008.

That leaves a net funding level of $14,450 million, which is more than $400 million greater than the amount proposed by S. 3261 and more than $100 million greater than the amount requested by President Bush. Combined with the assumed $750 million in \"freed-up\" net restricted assets, the omnibus provides a FY2009 program level ($15,200 million) that is about 3.4% higher than FY2008, and equal to the unweighted average AAF in FY2009 (see footnote 9).
