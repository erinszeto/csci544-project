{"id": "R42983", "title": "Public Access to Data from Federally Funded Research: Provisions in OMB Circular A-110", "released_date": "2013-03-01T00:00:00", "summary": ["The results of scientific studies are often used in making government policy decisions. While the studies are often published, traditional federal research funding policies did not require the data on which they are based to be made available publicly. Such policies did, however, generally require researchers to share data and physical samples with other scientists after publication of the research. A rider, often called the Shelby Amendment or Data Access Act, that was attached to the Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY1999, P.L. 105-277, mandated the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to amend Circular A-110 to require federal agencies to ensure that \"all data produced under a [federally funded] award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA].\" The amendment authorizes user fees. OMB was required to make changes and release a revised circular; subsequently, agencies that chose to do so issued their own conforming rules. The final revision was published in the Federal Register on October 8, 1999, and has not been changed in subsequent updates to the circular.", "The Shelby Amendment originated from disputes about access to research information used in federal regulations. It was a significant change from traditional practice, since, while permitted, federal agencies typically did not require grantees to submit research data and, pursuant to a 1980 Supreme Court decision, agencies did not have to give the public access under FOIA to research data they did not possess as part of agency records.", "To balance the need for public access while protecting the research process, OMB's revision limits the kinds of data that will be made accessible (it excludes personal and business-related confidential data) and limits applicability to federally funded data relating to published research findings produced under a federal award and used in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law. Opponents of the amendment said that FOIA is an inappropriate vehicle to allow wider public access, since it would harm the traditional process of scientific research; human subjects would believe that the federal government might obtain access to confidential information; researchers would have to spend additional time and money putting data into a form required by the government, thereby interfering with ongoing research; and private sector cooperation and funding for government/university/industry partnerships would be jeopardized.", "Proponents of the amendment said that accountability and transparency are paramount: The public should have a right to review scientific data underlying research funded by government taxpayers. Some proponents argued that the amendment would result in significant savings. Some also believed that the OMB revision narrowed the scope of public access to research data contrary to congressional intent. Senator Shelby said the final revision, \"while still narrow in scope, is a good first step.... \" Legislative efforts both to repeal the provision and withhold funding for its implementation failed.", "The data available for this report suggest that the provision has not been commonly invoked in FOIA requests. To the extent that is the case, it supports the assessment that neither the benefits nor the concerns raised have materialized to a significant degree. That might change if usage increased, but the continuing movement toward increased public access to the results of federally funded research that has occurred independently of the 1999 revision to Circular A-110 may make its use in FOIA requests increasingly unnecessary."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The results of scientific studies are used in making many governmental policy decisions. While the studies are often published, the data on which they are based may not be, even for federally funded research.

In October 1998, a provision in P.L. 105-277 changed that, requiring that such data be made publicly available (112 Stat. 2681-495).", "To implement the new requirement in 1999, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had to reconcile potentially competing public interests. On the one hand, the public has an interest in verifying the soundness of the science underlying policy decisions. That may require open access to data from government-funded research, especially if those data are used in developing federal regulations.", "On the other hand, the public has an interest in ensuring that government-funded research is performed efficiently and effectively and that the rights of individuals involved in that research are protected. Requiring FOIA access to federally funded research could impose additional costs and other burdens on researchers and risk making information about individual research subjects public.", "This report provides background on the 1999 revisions to federal policy, a discussion of the impacts of those changes, and an analysis of the issues raised by them.

Unless required by statute, awarding agencies are prohibited from limiting public access to recipient records unless the agency can demonstrate that such records must be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure by FOIA if they belonged to the agency. Agencies can also \"obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award,\" and authorize \"others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.\"", "The P.L. 105-277 provision, commonly referred to as the Shelby amendment, mandated OMB to modify Circular A-110 \"to require Federal agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act.\" Pursuant to the changes made to Circular A-110, if a request is made under FOIA, agencies will be required to obtain certain types of research data from grantees and provide the requester access to the data, if FOIA exemptions do not apply. Also, to the extent permitted by FOIA, the agencies may collect research data in anticipation of public requests for data. FOIA and the circular also provide for cost reimbursement via fees charged to persons who request data under FOIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rationale for the Change in Law", "paragraphs": ["Passage of the Shelby amendment is rooted in a two-year effort, begun in 1997 in House committee discussions, to make federally funded research data accessible to the public. A key element contributing to the effort was debate over the scientific basis of Environmental Protection Agency regulations to strengthen national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. In particular, dispute focused on the unavailability of data underlying Harvard's \"Six Cities\" study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, that found a link between particulate air pollution and health. Industry groups requested to review the data, but the researchers refused, citing confidentiality agreements with the subjects. Subsequently, a procedure by which an independent group of scientists could review the data was developed, but the law's supporters believed that better access was needed.", "The amendment's supporters said that two issues were raised by the EPA dispute. One was the need for transparency\u2014that the public should have access to data that they paid for and that affects policy. The second related to accountability\u2014that the public, not only peer reviewers or scientists, should have a right to examine the data on which agency regulations are based, since the data or interpretations of it might be incorrect, and regulations can be very expensive to implement and to comply with. Proponents argued that data access is important to ensure that regulations are well-supported scientifically and do not carry an undue burden.", "Those issues were not new, but they had been relatively quiet since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that a grantee's data were not agency records within the meaning of FOIA because the data had not been created or obtained by a federal agency. The case was Forsham v. Harris . The legal issue presented was whether records that were created and retained by nonagencies, but which are in some way affiliated with an agency, may be classified as agency records.", "In Forsham, the Court established the minimum requirements for determining agency record status in the context of records created by nonagencies. The plaintiffs were a private organization of physicians who had sought to obtain the data underlying the report of a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) grantee funded to conduct a study of diabetes treatment regimens. They alleged that the data they sought were agency records because (1) they were records of the grantee, which received its funds from a federal agency and was subject to some supervision in the use of those funds; (2) the federal agency had authority under its grant agreement to have obtained the data had it chosen to do so; and (3) the data formed the basis of the grantee's reports which were relied upon by the agency.", "The court found that Congress had purposely excluded federal grantees from FOIA, and held that the private grantee was not an agency subject to FOIA. The court also concluded that the required data were not agency records within the meaning of FOIA because the data had not been created or obtained by a federal agency; and \"FOIA applies to records which have in fact been obtained and not to records which merely could have been obtained.\" The Court suggested that the grantee's data could become agency records if it could be shown that the agency directly controlled the grantee's day-to-day activities.", "The legislative history of the Shelby amendment is sparse because no hearings were held on it before passage. The major indication of legislative intent, other than the language in the provision itself and the report language, is from Senate floor statements made at the time the Senate adopted the amendment. However, in the 106 th Congress, on July 15, 1999, the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the House Committee on Government Reform held a hearing on H.R. 88 , a bill that would have repealed the amendment. That hearing provided additional background. Proponents of the amendment cited the costs of compliance with federal regulations coupled with the lack of public review of the data used by agencies in developing regulations. They also cited concerns about the adequacy of peer and agency review mechanisms to validate scientific data for setting regulations. Opponents cited concerns about possible violation of the privacy of human subjects, risks to confidential proprietary information, misinterpretation of data, inhibitory effects on the research enterprise, and costs of compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies for Access to Data from Federally Funded Research Other Than Provisions in Circular A-110", "paragraphs": ["Research performers funded by federal grants have long been required to provide the agency with grant completion reports and copies of publications resulting from the research. Agencies have also developed policies to encourage researchers to share their data with other researchers. However, agencies did not traditionally require researchers to provide the data used or collected to the federal agency that sponsored the research. Therefore, those data were not generally available to the public.", "Those practices are based on principles and policies about governmental support of science. Many of the principles about federal support for science were discussed first in Science, the Endless Frontier, by Vannevar Bush, a science adviser to Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. That document is considered by many observers to have established the basis of policy for governmental support of, and accountability for, extramural, especially academic, research by grants. After World War II, Congress initiated large programs to fund scientific research because of its perceived immediate or future value to the nation. Post-World War II enactments (creating the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and so forth) led to the development of programs of governmental grants for research and for education and training of scientists in U.S. colleges and universities. Scientists were largely given responsibility through the research funding agencies to select research grantees by means of peer and merit review procedures; many of the responsibilities for administrative and financial accountability for grants research were shifted to universities.", "Also in the postwar period, additional federal intramural laboratories were established to enable the conduct of applied or mission-relevant research, and private companies began research and development (R&D) for the federal government. In FY2009 about half of the $133 billion in federal funding for R&D was for research. More than three-quarters of the R&D funds were extramural\u2014provided to nonfederal researchers. Universities were the single largest performer of federally funded research, receiving half of research funds, and industry was the largest performer of development, receiving more than two-thirds of those funds. In short, Congress, \"in some instances, made a conscious decision to finance this research in the private sector [that is, in academic institutions, other nonprofit institutions, and industry], rather than to create an alternative state system of research. In so doing it has attempted to preserve value peculiar to private systems ... ,\" including grantee autonomy, while incorporating federal interests. A legal interpretation of these private interests relevant to grant research was discussed in Forsham, including \"the values of competitive priority and peer recognition ...\" and the preservation of \"grantee autonomy.\"", "The system of federal grants to support scientific research reflects principles that scientists consider important to the conduct of research. Those include scientific peer review of data and findings, replication of research results, use of publications to award credit for discovery and interpretation of data, and protection of the process of scientific inquiry. Especially important to scientists is public discussion of preliminary findings and research data without the potential for interference by political interests that might act to oppose research in progress.", "Even before passage of the Shelby amendment, Circular A-110 allowed agencies to obtain and use the data produced under an award and authorized others to use \"such data for federal purposes\" (OMB Circular A-110, 36(c)). However, neither Circular A-110 nor other instruments set overall federal policy about ownership of data produced under grant awards. In general researchers acted as owners, and agencies permitted them to act as owners, of data in that they retain them and control access to them.", "Over time, federal agencies developed their own separate policies that generally endorse sharing by the researchers of recorded information following publication of research results, with access limited to other researchers and with adequate safeguards for protection of confidential information relating to human subjects or confidential commercial information. Some agencies allow public access to research data via databases. Several major research funding agencies\u2014such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014encourage or require researchers to share raw data, slides, or physical samples with other researchers, usually, but not in all cases, after publication of research results. Agencies stipulate a variety of time periods for researchers to retain data, ranging from three to seven years; some require researchers to provide data automatically to other researchers; others do not.", "For instance, the 1994 policy governing the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that provides the largest amount of federal research funds (predominately in the life sciences) to universities and colleges, required supported researchers \"to make results and accomplishments of their activities available to the public,\" although there was no specific requirement with respect to data per se. However, NIH grantees and contractors were required to make \"unique research resources,\" including physical samples such as specific cell lines and cloned DNA, available to other researchers following publication or fulfillment of a contract. In certain cases researchers are expected to deposit data in data banks to permit efficient access to the scientific community.", "In 2003, NIH released a policy on sharing research data, requiring grant applications for amounts over $500,000 to address data sharing. The final notice states that \"NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers.\" The plan must take into account relevant privacy requirements and other laws and regulations, which require, for example, removal of personally identifiable information. NIH does not require that data be released while the research is in progress, but it must be made available by the time of publication of the main results from the data.", "NSF is the second largest federal funder of research at universities and colleges. It supports research in all areas of science. From its inception in 1950 until 1989, NSF had no written policy on data sharing (except relating to Automated Data Processing (ADP), software and large databases, which were written beginning in 1969). Its early policies allowed nongovernmental scientist/grantees to use their own professional procedures and incentives to promote sharing of information. It expected grantees to share data consonant with the principles of scientific exchange and replication in scientific research. In 1984, the NSF National Science Board adopted a data sharing policy. In 1989, the findings of an NSF committee were incorporated into a written data sharing policy that appeared in NSF's grant and management documents. Since the 1990s, NSF grantees have been expected to promptly submit findings for publication, and to \"share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of [the] work.\" Grantees are also \"encouraged to share software and inventions.\"", "One prominent move toward increased public access was a statement of principles from an international group of genomics researchers in 1996. It called for freely available public access to all information on the human genome that was produced at research centers performing genome sequencing at large scales.", "Some nongovernmental science policy groups have also long advocated the disclosure of research data to other researchers after publication if disclosure is balanced by protections for privacy and intellectual property rights. In 1985, a report from the National Research Council states, \"Data relevant to public policy should be shared as quickly and widely as possible, in time with public release and following appropriate review.\" A 1998 statement of the three Academy presidents urged professional societies, academic leaders, and industry to develop clear and workable standards of open communication in scientific research.", "Presaging the public pressures that would come with the enactment of the Shelby Amendment, the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR), an association of research universities, issued a paper in 1996 urging senior university officials to develop policies to respond to increasing pressures for public access to data from federally sponsored research. Noting that the tradition of FOIA exemptions might weaken, it stated, \"Scientists may not be able to defend their 'rights' in the public's view, unless they can argue convincingly that reasonable limitations of release are actually in the public's interest.\"", "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Council, in early 1999, adopted a resolution stating that \"it supports the public disclosure of scientific findings and regulatory decisions, at the appropriate time and with appropriate safeguards.... \" AAAS requires that authors submitting articles for publication in Science make \"all data necessary to understand, assess, and extend the conclusions of the manuscript \u2026 available to any reader of Science, \" as well as all computer codes \"involved in the creation or analysis of data.\" It also requires that large data sets be deposited in and made available through a repository. Various other professional groups, such as the American Sociological Association, the American Economic Association, and other scientific associations, developed policies encouraging or requiring sharing of data cited in articles published in their journals. In 2009, the publishers of Nature adopted, as a condition of publication, a requirement of authors \" to make materials, data and associated protocols promptly available to readers without preconditions.\"", "A 2009 Academy report presented a broad \"Data Access and Sharing Principle: Research data, methods, and other information integral to publicly reported results should be publicly accessible.\" The report goes on to recommend,", "All researchers should make research data, methods, and other information integral to their publicly reported results publicly accessible in a timely manner to allow verification of published findings and to enable other researchers to build on published results, except in unusual cases in which there are compelling reasons for not releasing data. In these cases, researchers should explain in a publicly accessible manner why the data are being withheld from release.", "It also recommended that each research field have a set of standards for sharing data, developed through a process involving not only researchers and their institutions but other stakeholders, such as sponsors, journals, and public interest organizations.", "Also in 2009, a report for the National Science and Technology Council by an interagency working group referred to digital scientific data as \"national and global assets\" and recommended the development of a structured approach to preservation of and access to such data throughout the life cycle of the data. It stated that \"preservation and access capabilities are critical to the progress of individuals, nations, science, and society.\" The report recommended that agencies develop data policies \"to maximize appropriate information access and utility and to provide for rational, cost-efficient data life cycle management.\"", "The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ) required the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), via a working group, to coordinate agency policies \"related to the dissemination and long-term stewardship of the results of unclassified research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications, supported wholly, or in part, by funding from the Federal science agencies\" (Sec. 103(a)). The act required a report to Congress, which was submitted in March 2012. The report summarized results of a Request for Information soliciting public input on public access to digital data. Responses showed broad support for increasing public access and requiring funding proposals to include data management plans. The report also stated that most federal agencies did not have policies on public accessibility for \"data generated through Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and some other types of funding mechanism.\" ", "In a February 2013 memorandum to federal agency heads, the OSTP Director affirmed the Obama Administration's commitment \"to ensuring that \u2026 the direct results of federally funded scientific research are made available to and useful for the public, industry, and the scientific community. Such results include peer-reviewed publications and digital data.\" It requires federal agencies funding more than $100 million in R&D annually to develop and implement plans for increasing public access to data generated after the effective date of the memorandum from unclassified research funded at least in part by federal funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Freedom of Information Act and Its Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["FOIA provides a procedure for any individual to obtain access to information in records held by federal executive agencies.

Only direct costs can be reimbursed, and they are limited at most to search, duplication, and review. Lower charges apply to certain classes of requesters, such as educational institutions and the media.", "Before passage of the Shelby amendment, private performers of federally funded research were not required to provide federal agencies with raw data and related information in response to FOIA requests. However, if the funding agency obtained the data for \"federal purposes,\" such as to investigate possible scientific misconduct, the data became agency records subject to FOIA.

Reynolds Tobacco Company to try to obtain the data records of a Georgia researcher's study showing that children between the ages of 3 and 8 identified the company's cartoon camel and linked it to cigarettes. The researcher refused to allow the children to be identified and interviewed as the company wanted. The case involved litigation and a conflict between the university administration and the researcher regarding the applicability of the state law. Subsequently the State passed a law to prohibit invasion of the children's privacy, but the researcher resigned his position and abandoned the line of research he had been pursuing.", "Some state laws allow the release of specific kinds of scientific research data. California, Massachusetts, and Michigan have laws permitting the release of epidemiological data. The laws vary and some are more restrictive than the changes permitted by the language of Shelby amendment. For example, the California Public Records Act, unlike FOIA, permits an agency to withhold a record if \"on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.\" The law also apparently allows researchers to negotiate directly with the requesting party to protect sensitive data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB's Revision of Circular A-110", "paragraphs": ["The Shelby amendment required OMB to revise Circular A-110 by September 30, 1999.

OMB said that it based its first proposed revision on its interpretation of floor statements in support of the provision made by Senators Shelby, Trent Lott, and Ben Nighthorse Campbell.

As discussed above, many federal agencies encourage or require researchers to share physical specimens, as well as data, with other researchers after the completion of a research project. Federal agency definitions such as those used by the NSF, NIH, and NASA defined data as recorded information, regardless of form or medium. That can include computer software and copyrightable materials. The definitions of data, however, do not include physical specimens.", "In their April 5, 1999, letter to then-OMB Director Jacob Lew, Senators Shelby, Lott, and Campbell stated,", "At a minimum, data should include all information necessary to replicate and verify the original results and assure that the results are consistent with the data collected and evaluated under the award.

The definition focused on recorded factual material needed to validate research findings, and specifically excluded several other kinds of information and materials, including physical samples about which commenters on the February proposed revision had expressed concern. However, arguably the second version would have permitted access to a film or video of interviews with subjects, which are both recorded data and samples. The final version seems to permit researchers to withhold access to such records.", "The second proposed and the final revisions also excluded from the definition of research data, materials similar to two FOIA exemptions. Despite the objections of many, including sponsoring Senators, that exclusions \"at the outset ... [are] ... inconsistent with the plain meaning of the law, and that these kinds of data could be exempted by an agency via the FOIA exemption process,\" OMB retained them in the final revision. One exclusion, related to Exemption 4, is for \"trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential\u2026until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law.\" The second revision had excluded \"information which may be copyrighted or patented\" (which commenters thought was too broad). The other exclusion is for \"information\" that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" The second revision had excluded \"files\" rather than \"information,\" but OMB explained in the supplementary information attached to the final revision notice that many commenters said they feared that video or audio tapes of research subjects might not be considered to be in the form of a file and could be subject to disclosure, but that the word \"information\" covers such materials.", "Thus, a grantee would not be required to submit excluded records to the funding agency. In addition, the agency would presumably subject the submitted records to further screening under the exemptions. OMB also noted that the courts have allowed agencies to withhold an \"entire record ... if necessary to ensure privacy (e.g., in a case where, notwithstanding the redaction of names or other personal identifiers, an individual's identity could still be inferred from other information ...).\"", "Some observers have argued that limiting public access to data from federally funded research may create imbalances in public debate about federal actions that fall under the Shelby Amendment in those cases where research funded by industries and other private-sector entities is also used. Data from such privately funded research would not be available under the revisions to Circular A-110. One suggested means of addressing an imbalance would be to expand the reach of the Shelby Amendment to cover all research used in such actions, whether federally or privately funded.

Furthermore, the materials must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or cited by an agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law.", "Examination of funding sources indicates that only a small proportion of federally funded R&D is potentially covered by the revisions to Circular A-110. Much of the scientific activity that Circular A-110 covers is basic research. Most basic research data is not accessible to the public under FOIA because of exemptions, the way data is defined, and the fact that most academic basic research is unlikely to produce results used in developing \"an agency action that has the force and effect of law.\" However, much basic research is aimed at developing scientific principles that can lay the groundwork for applied research that is targeted at specific policies, actions, or regulatory issues. In addition, the continuing broad movement toward increasing public access to research data may eventually make the circular revision largely obsolete.", "OMB also said in the supplementary information attached to the second revision that it might narrow data access only to regulations that meet a $100 million threshold level of impact, and it sought public comments on this suggestion. The supplementary material attached to the final revision said OMB would not limit the applicability only to agency actions that have an impact over $100 million, because it received comments of both strong support for and opposition to the $100 million threshold.", "Some believed at the time that much research used in developing \"agency actions that have the force and effect of law\" would still not be accessible to the public. That is because Circular A-110 does not cover contracts, which agencies must use if procuring services, such as data which an agency knew from the outset would be used in developing specific agency actions, including regulations. Federal agencies would not be required under the amendment to obtain data from contracted research. Thus, such data would not be available to the public under FOIA unless the contract required that the data be provided to the agency. The circular also does not cover grants to state and local governments, so data from such awards would not be available under the amendment. In light of such considerations, some observers proposed that OMB extend the revisions of Circular A-110 to both the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 C.F.R. 1ff), which cover contracts, and Circular A-102, which covers grants and cooperative agreements with state and local governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is Meant by \"Published\"?", "paragraphs": ["The first OMB revision limited applicability of the amendment to \"data relating to published research findings.... \" It did not define the word published , which could be interpreted narrowly or broadly, as commenters noted.

Some critics said that language would not resolve several problems. For instance, OMB Watch said \"... the trigger should not be based solely on whether the agency simply cites the research in its support of the regulation. Rather, the trigger should be based on whether data from the cited research was part of the underlying assumptions or assessments used in developing the regulation.\" NIH proposed narrowing access to \"significant scientific findings\":", "When a regulatory agency cites research in the regulatory process, that research may be critically or marginally applicable to that regulation. A brief review of regulations revealed that some cite hundreds of research studies, all of which would be subject to FOIA under this amendment. It would greatly reduce the burden of this legislation if access were afforded to data from only those studies that were critical in the formulation of the regulation.", "Another question still troubling to some, despite the language of the final revision, was what impacts public access would have on the ability of the researchers who develop a data set to benefit appropriately from the effort they have invested. Researchers often publish more than one paper from a set of data. Data cannot be copyrighted and scientists have traditionally been reluctant to make data public until they have had an opportunity to analyze them fully and publish the results. After data become publicly available, others might use them to publish analyses before the original researchers have the opportunity to do so.

In addition, ... clarification that risk assessments and other federal reports or surveys are covered independently under the proposed revision will also help by providing the public with a chance to review the underlying data supporting these government findings before they are used in a rulemaking process.", "The first, second, and final versions of the revisions to the circular proposed a \"reasonable time\" standard for the response to a request for research data. Some say that those who use FOIA to obtain data to comment on a proposed regulation may not obtain the data quickly enough to do so. Typical comment periods for regulations are 30, 60, or 90 working days, although longer periods may be provided for complex rules. In most cases, an agency would be required under FOIA to notify the requester within 30 working days (six weeks) whether it would comply with a request. If it grants the request, it must comply \"promptly\" or it may be subject to legal action. Once the data are obtained, requesters must examine and possibly reanalyze them to develop comments. In defense of the \"reasonable time\" standard, OMB explained, in the supplementary information attached to the final revision, \"Since OMB and the agencies do not yet have experience with implementing the public access process, we believe the 'reasonable time' standard, which allows consideration of the circumstances of a particular case, is appropriate.

Thus, if the researcher kept records subject to the new circular for more than three years, the funding agency would be able to seek that information to respond to a FOIA request. If eligible research were officially cited or used in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law, but more than three years after an award had ended, the data might no longer be available.", "Questions arose about who\u2014whether the university or the researcher\u2014should be the custodian of the data.

One is the \"transparency\" argument\u2014that the public should have access to the data, since it was funded with taxpayer dollars. Other reasons are more directly related to accountability and the processes and politics of U.S. policymaking that rely on scientific and technical information or judgments. As more, and more costly, public policy decisions are based on scientific and technical information, there will likely be more public scrutiny of the rationale for those decisions. That is especially true in controversial issues where different scientists might interpret research data and their policy implications differently or when opposing interest groups might bring conflicting scientific data to bear on decision-making. Some contend that public understanding of science and public financial support for science might be enhanced with more access to research data. Others say that more access would ensure confidence in the legitimacy of governmental actions.", "Some say that peer review by other scientists may not be adequate to validate research, especially when findings affect important public policy decisions. That is crucial when research findings are based on \"metaanalysis\" or \"research synthesis\"\u2014when a researcher develops a new policy-relevant research finding based on synthesizing the findings of many different research studies relating to the same topic. Those research methods are increasingly used in policy analysis. Others question not only the techniques used in metaanalysis, but also the validity of the original research and findings. In addition, some segments of the public are skeptical of the government's ability to correctly represent, interpret, or present all relevant scientific findings, especially given disclosures about federal agency misrepresentation of medical experimentation, such as the Tuskegee experiments, relating to treatment of syphilis, and of radiation exposure levels around some nuclear research laboratories. There has also been skepticism about federal agency findings and policies relating to research or research evaluations of subsidy or intervention programs in such diverse areas as science education and genetic engineering of crop seeds and other farm products. Advocates of public access say that, in cases like those, they should be given access to research data to replicate the analyses, to verify or refute the findings, or to evaluate methods used in conducting the research and interpreting the data. Interested members of the public seek the same kinds of access as other researchers often have to data, physical samples, specimens, and other records from federally funded research.", "For most research, however, scientists find that independent evaluation of the raw data from a study is not necessary to evaluate the validity of the research. Federal agencies and the scientific community use several methods during the research process, with public involvement usually limited to later stages. Those evaluations usually do not involve examination by others of the raw data produced by the researchers. Before a grant for a scientific study is awarded, the granting agency generally performs a merit review of the proposed study, including an evaluation of the proposed methods of research and analysis. That review often involves evaluation of the proposal by independent scientists. As a study progresses, scientists usually report on progress, including preliminary findings, to their colleagues. Those findings may become public at that time if reported at scientific conferences attended by members of the press. Researchers may adjust methodologies or perform additional research based on the feedback they receive from colleagues. Once a study, or a particular stage, is completed, researchers usually prepare the results for publication. As part of that process, drafts of articles reporting the findings are usually evaluated by other scientists, who examine the methodology, analysis, and other elements. Once a paper is published, other segments of the scientific community and the public may respond to it, and they might challenge the premises, methodology, analyses, or conclusions. Such challenges might include other research aimed at testing the validity of the findings. The potential for such testing is one of the fundamental checks on validity provided by the scientific method. If independent researchers obtain the same results, that greatly strengthens the conclusions. If the results cannot be replicated, then the original conclusions were probably not correct.", "However, replication can be difficult or even impossible for large-scale studies or those using unique sets of information, such as the Harvard Six Cities study cited earlier. Also, in some instances, regulatory or other decisions might need to be made before confirming experiments could be performed. It is for such cases that evaluation of the data by others can be especially important in judging the validity of the research.", "Public access to such data may lead to several alternative evaluations being produced by interested parties. That should help validate conclusions and increase the likelihood that errors will be detected. According to some, it could lead to a \"higher standard of review ... [and] the end result of this approach will be a body of scientific work more rigorously tested and reliable.\" However, evaluation of data is itself an area of expertise requiring skill and training. For example, statistical analysis can be done in many ways, and use of an inappropriate procedure can easily lead to spurious conclusions.

Without such agreements, private researchers would not participate in these partnerships.\" NAS President Alberts testified on this subject at hearings on July 15, 1999:", "For example, commercial interests that have a strong competitive interest in particular areas of research will now be able to use FOIA requests to obtain university-based research data for their own use and competitive advantage in an effort to dominate or control that area of research, ultimately discouraging independent university research in these areas.

In fact, according to testimony of James T.
