Before the 2001 tax law, the child tax credit wasrefundable only to some taxpayers with three or more children, but it now isrefundable (up to certain limits) for those with earnings above $10,000. This reporttreats the direct payment component of these credits, but not the reduction in taxliability, as a welfare expenditure.

Examples of these other tax benefits arethe deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owner-occupied homes(equivalent to outlays of $63.3 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, in 2002).

Some of the major expansions follow. Effective in 1969, Congress gave a work incentive bonus to all mothers who receivedAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) checks; the bonus, virtuallyrepealed in late 1981, was the right to a welfare supplement even after their earningsrose above the state standard of need. In 1969, minimum rents for public housingwere abolished (reinstituted, at a lower level, in 1974). By 1970 amendment, theFood Stamp program was converted into a federal income guarantee in participatingcounties. By 1972 amendment, basic educational opportunity grants were adoptedfor all needy college students (extended to \"middle - income\" students by 1978 lawand renamed Pell grants in 1980). In 1972, effective in 1974, a federal cash incomeguarantee -- Supplemental Security Income (SSI) -- was enacted for the aged,blind, and disabled, and Congress established the Special Supplemental FoodProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Effective in 1974, food stampswere extended to all counties, providing a national income guarantee in the form offood stamps. In 1975, a rebatable tax credit was adopted for low-income workerswith children.", "In 1981, Congress moved to restrict eligibility for some programs and to lower some benefits. For example, it imposed gross income eligibility limits for AFDC andfood stamps, reduced AFDC and food stamp benefits for families with earnings,raised public housing rents, and reduced subsidies for school lunches. Effective inFY1983, it temporarily reduced the food stamp guarantee. Thereafter, Congressrestored food stamp benefit rules for workers (1985), expanded Medicaid eligibilityfor some needy persons not enrolled in cash welfare, sharply expanded the EITC (andgave it inflation protection) (1986), and required all states to offer AFDC to needytwo-parent families in which the primary earner is unemployed or underemployed(1988). It also established the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) programfor AFDC recipients and expanded federal matching funds for work and training andfor related child care. In 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ), Congress again expanded the EITC,with the goal of ending poverty for a family of four with a parent who works full timeat the minimum wage (counting food stamps toward the antipoverty goal). At thesame time, it established a small EITC for childless workers.", "In 1996, effective July 1, 1997 at the latest, Congress repealed AFDC, JOBS, and Emergency Assistance, replacing them with a fixed annual block grant forTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), through FY2002. It specifiedthat state TANF programs must condition eligibility on work, impose a lifetime limit(5 years at most) on federally funded basic ongoing aid (traditional cash aid), andachieve prescribed work participation rates for full funding. The 1996 law ( P.L.104-193 ) also ended eligibility for most welfare benefits for non-citizens, added tothe Food Stamp program a stringent work requirement for childless persons aged18-50, and sharply expanded federal funding for child care, consolidating the fundsin the Child Care and Development Block Grant. In 1997, Congress added specialwelfare-to-work grants to TANF (for FY1998 and FY1999 years only), moderatedsome of the rules affecting non-citizens (see later section on Non-Citizen Eligibilityfor Major Federal Benefits ), established a new program of State-Children's HealthInsurance (S-CHIP), and created a child tax credit (made refundable, by the 2001 taxact) for taxpayers with more than $10,000 in annual earnings.", "Spending Trends by Level ofGovernment.

Under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of HHS has broadstatutory authority to conduct research and demonstration projects under sixprograms, including Medicaid and SCHIP. Using waiver authority, the HealthInsurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Initiative, announced by the BushAdministration in August 2001, encourages states to develop statewide projects thatcoordinate Medicaid and SCHIP with private health insurance coverage and targetsuninsured individuals with income below 200% of the federal poverty level, just asSCHIP does. Later, the Administration indicated that unspent SCHIP funds couldbe used to finance the HIFA initiative. (28) As ofJune 12, 2003, CMS approved 14SCHIP 1115 waivers (6 others were in review). Seven of the 14 approved waiversare SCHIP HIFA demonstrations.

Benchmark equivalent coverage must also include at least 75% ofthe actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for each of the benefits inthe \"additional service category.\" These additional services include prescriptiondrugs, mental health services, vision services, and hearing services.

Generally, Medicaid does not allow cost sharing for medical services (e.g.,deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance), and cost sharing associated withprogram participation (e.g., enrollment fees, and premiums) is limited to nominalamounts. If the state implements SCHIP through a separate state program, premiumsor enrollment fees may be imposed, but they are subject to limits.

(33) For childrenwhose family income is between101% and 150% FPL, service-related cost-sharing must meet \"adjusted nominalamounts.\" (34) These adjusted amounts reflect theenrollees' increased ability to pay.
