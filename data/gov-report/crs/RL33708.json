Similarly, \"attempted monopolization\"connotes a situation in which an entity unlawfully or unfairly attempts to secure a market monopoly. The long-standing, judicially created Rule of Reason, which involves balancing an anticompetitive action with any procompetitive results, underscores those facts.", "Whether a market participant who is a monopolist must deal with anyone who desires to deal with it continues to be largely governed by the so-called Colgate doctrine.

There is neither an arbitrary antitrust directive concerning the requisite amount of competition deemed acceptable in any given market, nor any predetermination of the point beyond which a market participant may grow; nor is there any absolute number of competitors a market participant must face. Although there are general prohibitions against monopolization and attempted monopolization in the Sherman and Clayton Acts, and a prohibition against \"unfair acts\" in commerce in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, \"monopoly\" and \"monopolist\" are merely descriptive terms, used to illustrate a situation in which a single entity possesses effective control of the market in which it operates. Neither term implies anything about the lawfulness of the monopoly possessed: there is no concept of \"no fault\" monopolization in United States antitrust law. Absent a finding by a court of \"guilty behavior\" by a monopolist, therefore, there can be no finding of \"monopolization.\" Further, the antitrust Rule of Reason has modified the concept of competition by recognizing that in certain situations the anticompetitiveness of some actions must be balanced against any procompetitive effects that might be produced by those actions.", "Accordingly, any assessment of whether any of the prohibitions against monopolization have been violated requires two inquiries. First, it must be determined whether an entity is in fact a monopolist; and second, whether that monopolist has unlawfully monopolized the market(s) within which it operates (the applicable, \"relevant market,\" which may be either product- or geographically based, or both).", "Assuming that a market participant has been legally determined to be a monopolist (as opposed to being so determined by reference to the popular definition\u2014i.e., one who possesses at least a 51% market share), the question arises, \"Does that monopoly entity have a legal obligation to deal with any or all of its actual or potential competitors?\" The courts have generally answered, \"No,\" but the situation long thought to create such an obligation\u2014monopolist ownership or control of an \"essential facility\" \u2014is, currently, not as settled as was once thought.

In addition, a monopolist must generally also be guilty of \"the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\" That having been said, however, courts have had to evaluate actual business conduct in order to distinguish between lawful (e.g. , that having a \"legitimate business purpose,\" or that which is merely indicative of aggressive competition) and unlawful (that which is predatory\u2014i.e., seemingly economically irrational except for its adverse effect on competition, or exclusionary) conduct by a monopolist.

In the first case, however, the ISOs (independent service organizations) did not directly allege a refusal to deal, but, rather, that Kodak had unlawfully tied the sale of both the repair parts it manufactured, as well of certain others manufactured under license, to the purchase of its service, violating the antitrust laws by extending its lawful monopoly in the parts market into the service/repair market and, thus, eliminating much of the competition to itself from ISOs; in the second, plaintiff ISOs alleged specifically that the Xerox Corporation's refusal to sell them either patented repair parts or copyrighted service manuals violated the antitrust laws.", "The Supreme Court held, in Image Technical Services, that the lower courts must determine whether Kodak, in fact, possessed sufficient market power in the market for parts used to service photocopier equipment to be able to unlawfully tie the purchase of service for its copiers to the purchase from it of repair parts for those copiers (in other words, to require purchasers of its copier equipment to agree either to use only its repair parts/service or not to use the repair parts/services of an ISO); on remand, a jury found the existence of the Supreme Court's required monopoly power and the misuse of that power in the service market, and the appeals court affirmed that finding and the injunction it precipitated. In the Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation , the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the United States District Court for Kansas' grant of summary judgment to Xerox, noting, first, that although a patent holder (or other intellectual property owner) does not, by virtue of his patent, have a right to violate the antitrust laws, \"it is also correct that the antitrust laws do not negate the patentee's right to exclude others from patent property.\" The court, emphasizing that the differing allegations in this case and Image Technical Services necessitated a different approach to analyzing the antitrust legality of the challenged actions, stated:", "...
