Of particular interest to policy makers are the allocation of spectrum for specific types of use (such as TV broadcasting, radio, advanced wireless services, or unlicensed) and the assignment of licenses for exclusive or shared use of specific frequencies. Today, most frequencies allocated for commercial uses are assigned through auctions, with licenses going to the highest bidder. Another important allocation of spectrum is for unlicensed use. Both commercial and non-commercial entities use unlicensed spectrum to meet a wide variety of monitoring and communications needs. Suppliers of wireless devices must meet requirements for certification to operate on frequency bands designated for unlicensed use. Examples of unlicensed use include garage door openers and Wi-Fi communications. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates licensed and unlicensed spectrum not allocated for federal use, is responsible for auctioning spectrum licenses, and can also use its authority to redistribute licenses.", "Proceeds from spectrum license sales are presently attributed to general revenue in the U.S. Budget. In the 108 th Congress, however, a precedent was established with the creation of a Spectrum Relocation Fund to hold proceeds from the auction of specified radio frequencies allocated to federal use; federal agencies vacating spectrum to be auctioned for commercial use are being compensated from the fund for costs of relocation. In the 109 th Congress, the Deficit Reduction Act ( P.L. 109-171 ) included provisions that placed certain auction proceeds in a Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. The fund is being mainly used to assist the transition from analog television broadcasting to digital broadcasting, and for contributions to programs for public safety. Over $7 billion of the auction proceeds were applied to deficit reduction. The funding came from the auction of spectrum (at 700 MHz) currently used for analog television broadcasting, to be vacated by February 17, 2009. The auction, Auction 73, concluded on March 18,2008; it grossed $19,592,420,000.", "The rules for Auction 73 introduced two new business models for spectrum management and assignment that represented departures from past policy. One model designated a block of spectrum licenses for a network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device or software application, referred to as open access. The other model would require a shared network to accommodate both public safety and commercial users in a partnership. A national license, referred to as the D Block, was put up for auction, as part of Auction 73, with a reserve price of $1.3 billion. The winning bidder would have been required to assume the cost and responsibility of building the network using D Block spectrum and adjacent spectrum assigned to public safety. The sole bid for the D Block was below the reserve price and consequently the D Block will be re-auctioned. The prospects for this new auction have triggered a debate about the nature of competition in the wireless industry and the need for a nationwide public safety network that may be resolved by Congress through legislation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Radio frequency spectrum is used for all forms of wireless communications, including cellular telephony, paging, personal communications service, radio and television broadcast, telephone radio relay, aeronautical and maritime radio navigation, and satellite command and control.

Although Congress has a legislative role in spectrum management, the FCC routinely takes on the responsibility of making decisions about the assignment of spectrum for different uses and sets the rules for auctions of spectrum licenses.", "Two recent important auctions of spectrum licenses were for the 700 MHz band, Auction 73, and the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS), designated Auction 66 or AWS-1.

A national asset with international rules and regulations . For example, most domestic uses of spectrum are assigned bands of operation through the International Telecommunications Union, an agency of the United Nations; satellites for broadcasting are governed by international treaty. Administered . To avoid interference from competing broadcast transmissions, frequency assignments are managed by recognized authorities. Administrative decisions as to how to allocate spectrum (for example, the number of channels to assign with a license) influence its commercial potential and the supply of spectrum for commercial and public use.", "The development and implementation of better wireless communications technologies are critical to maximizing the efficiency of spectrum resources.

Additionally, some uses of spectrum are governed by international regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spectrum Auctions", "paragraphs": ["Because two or more signal transmissions over the same frequency in the same location at the same time could cause interference (a distortion of the signals), the FCC, over many years, has developed and refined a system of exclusive licenses for users of specific frequencies. In the recent past, the FCC has granted licenses using a process known as \"comparative hearings\"(also known as \"beauty contests\"), and has used lotteries to distribute spectrum licenses. After years of debate over the idea of using competitive bidding (i.e., auctions) to assign spectrum licenses, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ) added Section 309(j) to the Communications Act, authorizing the FCC to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services.

Auctions are a market-driven solution to assigning licenses to use specific frequencies and are a recent innovation in spectrum management and policy. Spectrum for what is widely described as \"prime\" frequencies (300 MHz -3000 MHz) is judged by many to be the most commercially desirable and is widely sought after at auction by competing interests. Several lucrative auctions have added billions to the federal treasury, applied to general revenue.", "The FCC has the authority to conduct auctions only when applications are mutually exclusive (i.e., two licensees in the same frequency band would be unable to operate without causing interference with each other), and when services are primarily subscription-based.

While there may be special requirements for specific auctions, the following rules generally apply. As a screening mechanism, all auctions require bidders to submit applications and up-front payments prior to the auction. Most auctions are conducted in simultaneous multiple-round bidding in which the FCC accepts bids on a large set of related licenses simultaneously, using electronic communications. Bidders can bid in consecutive rounds until all bidding has stopped on all licenses. The rules the FCC sets for each auction cover many activities, such as evaluating and qualifying bidders, the bidding process, and final payment.

Qualification as a small business includes annual revenues of no more than $40 million, averaged over three years. The FCC originally also gave special provisions to women-owned, minority-owned, and rural telephone companies, referred to as designated entities. After a 1995 Supreme Court decision determined that government affirmative action policies must pass a \"strict scrutiny\" test to demonstrate past discrimination, the FCC removed minority-owned and women-owned groups from its list of businesses qualifying for bidding credits as designated entities. Many industry observers have expressed concern that some of the small businesses participating in auctions actually represent larger companies. By contracting with a larger company, some companies that bid as a designated entity or entrepreneur are alleged to have benefitted from bidding credits and other considerations granted to smaller companies while tapping the financial resources of a major wireless telecommunications company. Furthermore, a study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that a significant number of small companies that acquired spectrum licenses through preferential programs later transferred the licenses to larger companies.", "To avoid providing an undue advantage to designated entities, the FCC modified auction rules for the first Advanced Wireless Services auction, held in 2006. Notably, the FCC adopted rules to limit the transfer of designated entity benefits to any applicant or licensee with an \"impermissible material relationship.\" The FCC also sought to curtail \"unjust enrichment payments,\" by requiring that designated entities hold spectrum acquired in the AWS-1 auction for at least ten years; the rule previously set a time period of five years.

They argue that blind bidding would prevent collusion, for example between incumbents to keep out a new entrant, retaliatory bidding, and other practices that may skew auction results. Blind bidding was proposed during the comments period leading up to the AWS-1 auction but met resistance from the wireless industry, on the grounds that there were sufficient prospective bidders to assure competition.", "Media Access Project published two studies on the AWS-1 auction alleging evidence of collusive bidding and other practices that enabled incumbent wireless companies to exclude new entrants and possibly manipulate the process so that final bids were lower than might have been the case if the auction had been truly competitive.

If they did it while an auction was going on, that would be an explicit violation of the rules.\" The same news article included a strong denial from one of the successful auction bidders cited in the report, T-Mobile, which was widely reported in the industry press as anxious to acquire the spectrum as part of its international strategy for 3G.", "From a policy perspective, the allegations, whether or not they are supported by documentation, raise some new questions about the role of auction rules in shaping the final outcome of an auction, and whether the FCC has a tendency to give more weight to the comments of the incumbents it regulates than to potential new entrants.

At auction in 1996, broadband C block licenses were sold for bids totaling $13 billion. By mid-1997, however, many of the license winners (most notably NextWave Telecom Inc.) had defaulted and declared bankruptcy. The licenses were then seized by a court in bankruptcy litigation. In September 1997, the FCC offered a set of options for C-block licensees to restructure their debt (that offer was modified in March 1998). The licensees opted to maintain their bankrupt status, however, preventing the C-block spectrum from being re-auctioned. Based on its interpretation of a series of decisions in 1999 and 2000 by a U.S. Court of Appeals, the FCC cancelled the licenses that had not been paid for and re-auctioned that spectrum.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, essentially weighing NextWave's right to protection under bankruptcy laws against the FCC's right to allocate spectrum.

In particular, spectrum in bands within the 1710-1850 MHz range is sought by wireless telecommunications companies to facilitate the implementation of next-generation wireless technologies, including high-speed mobile services (3G). After much study, the NTIA and the FCC, aided by an Intra-Government 3G Planning Group, announced plans to provide for the transfer of spectrum in the 1710-1755 MHz range from federal agencies.

A successful package bid eliminates a number of licenses from the general bidding process, reducing the supply of licenses open for bids from small players that are seeking only one or two licenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Auction Results", "paragraphs": ["The auction grossed $19,592,420,000. All of the licenses except for the D Block, intended for shared use with public safety, were successfully auctioned. The D Block received a single bid of $472,042,000, well below the minimum price of $1.3 billion the FCC established for that license. In the rules established for the auction, the FCC allowed for the possibility of re-auctioning the D Block with different requirements, but reserved the right to make a decision based on its determination of public interest. In an Order adopted and released on March 20, 2008, the FCC directed the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block because it is \"in the public interest to provide additional time to consider all options....\" The FCC therefore has begun a review of its rules regarding licensing, structuring a partnership, setting service requirements, and other rules and obligations established prior to the commencement of Auction 73. It has prepared a further notice of proposed rule-making that seeks comments on identified options that might be pursued in disposing of the D Block.", "Some commentators believe that the conditions placed on the licenses in the Upper 700 MHz Band diverted bidding activity to the lower part of the band, driving up the prices of these licenses. Some of the smaller companies may have been outbid in their efforts to obtain CMA licenses because of increased competition and the effect of package bidding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Spectrum, a valuable resource governed by available technology, is regulated by the federal government with the primary objectives of maximizing its usefulness and efficiency, and to prevent interference among spectrum users. A key component of spectrum policy is the allocation of bands for specific uses and the assignment of frequencies within those bands. Auctions, a fairly recent innovation in frequency assignment, are regarded as a market-based mechanism for allocating spectrum. Other market-driven policies include licensing fees based on fair-market valuations of spectrum and flexibility in spectrum usage within assigned bandwidths. Today, spectrum for commercial applications is typically auctioned to the highest bidder, but many commercial users have spectrum acquired before the present-day auction process was implemented.", "Auctions as a means of allocating spectrum are considered a success by many observers because of the federal revenue generated, as well as for the speed with which licenses auctioned have gone to the companies that value them the most and are most likely to put them to use. Moreover, many prefer letting businesses determine whether to invest in a new service rather than relying on the government to decide who receives a spectrum license. The FCC has concluded that auctioning of spectrum licenses has contributed to the rapid deployment of new wireless technologies, increased competition in the marketplace, and encouraged participation by small businesses. However, many have questioned whether auction policy should be supplemented more aggressively with other market-driven solutions, and whether the existing auction process and administration can be improved.", "Spectrum management is an exercise in reconciling divergent interests. Over time, developments in technology may significantly increase the amount of useable spectrum and consequently the ease with which a policy of equitable allocation and use can be crafted. For the immediate future, Congress may choose to debate and act on questions such as reforming spectrum management and allocation mechanisms. Some observers argue that a fully-developed policy should take into account issues such as international competitiveness, the communications needs of public safety agencies and the military, the role of wireless technology in economic growth, and the encouragement of new technologies that make spectrum use more efficient and more beneficial to society as a whole. The stated objective of many policy reformers is a coherent national policy that provides the proper balance for existing applications while at the same time providing opportunities for future growth and development.", "Given the number of objectives in the allocation and use of spectrum, and the differing solutions for achieving them, choices made for 700 MHz could be far-reaching in setting the direction for future policy decisions."], "subsections": []}]}}
