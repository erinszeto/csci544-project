Aimed at addressing a host of perceived problems with the U.S. immigration system, this legislation combined border security and interior enforcement provisions with provisions on temporary workers, permanent admissions, and unauthorized aliens. The Senate considered several immigration reform measures ( S. 1348 , S.Amdt. 1150 to S.1348, S. 1639 ) in May and June of 2007.

It also provides for the temporary admission of foreign students. Temporary visitors, including workers, business personnel, and students, enter as nonimmigrants. As such, they are admitted for a temporary period of time and a specific purpose. The main nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the H visa. In addition, certain temporary workers and business personnel enter under other visa categories, as discussed below. Issuances of temporary employment-based visas have risen steadily over the past decade. The nonimmigrant visa categories used by foreign students are the F visa for academic study, the M visa for vocational study, and the J visa for cultural exchange. The number of nonimmigrants admitted under these three categories has more than doubled over the past two decades.", "The INA also provides for the permanent admission, as legal permanent residents (LPRs), of certain categories of foreign workers and business personnel. There are five employment-based preference categories. Most employment-based LPRs enter under the first three categories, which, as detailed below, encompass aliens of extraordinary ability as well as unskilled workers. These three categories have been the focus of recent efforts to reform the permanent employment-based immigration system. The smaller fourth and fifth preference categories, which respectively cover special immigrants and immigrant investors, are discussed separately in other sections of this report (Iraqi special immigrants are discussed in the \" Iraqi Refugees \" section; religious workers\u2014the largest special immigrant subcategory\u2014and immigrant investors are covered in the \" Other Issues and Legislation \"section).

Employers must pay their H-2A workers and similarly employed U.S. workers the highest of the federal or applicable state minimum wage, the prevailing wage rate, or the adverse effect wage rate (AEWR). They also must provide workers with housing, transportation, and other benefits, including workers' compensation insurance.", "Various bills have been introduced in the 110 th Congress that address foreign temporary agricultural workers. Some of these bills, including H.R. 371 / S. 237 / S. 340 (all identical and known as AgJOBS) and H.R. 1792 , propose a complete overhaul of the H-2A program. Both AgJOBS and H.R. 1792 would streamline the process of importing H-2A workers and would make changes to existing H-2A requirements regarding minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions. The streamlining and other changes proposed by the measures are different, however. For example, both AgJOBS and H.R. 1792 would make changes to existing H-2A wage requirements. AgJOBS would freeze the AEWR at the January 2003 level for three years after the date of enactment, while, under H.R. 1792, H-2A employers would no longer be subject to the AEWR. S. 1639 , which was considered in the Senate, and H.R. 1645 (STRIVE Act), which was the subject of a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law, include H-2A reform provisions like those in AgJOBS. H.R. 2954 contains H-2A reform provisions similar to those in H.R. 1792. A modified version of the AgJOBS Act of 2007 was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in May 2008 as an amendment to its version of the supplemental appropriations bill. This language, however, was subsequently dropped from the Senate version of the supplemental bill ( H.R. 2642 ) and is not included in the law, as enacted ( P.L. 110-252 ).", "Instead of reforming the H-2A program, some measures before the 110 th Congress would establish new agricultural worker programs. H.R. 2413 would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new W seasonal agricultural worker program.

S. 330 also proposes a new W temporary worker program, but it would cover both agricultural and nonagricultural work.", "In addition to its H-2A reform provisions, AgJOBS proposes a legalization program for agricultural workers. Under the program, the Secretary of DHS would grant a temporary resident status (termed \"blue card status\") to an alien worker who had performed a requisite amount of agricultural employment in the United States during the 24-month period ending on December 31, 2006, and who meets other requirements. No more than 1.5 million blue cards could be issued during the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment. To be eligible to adjust to LPR status, the alien in blue card status would have to meet additional work and other requirements. Existing numerical limits under the INA would not apply to adjustments of status under the bill. Similar provisions are included in H.R. 1645 . By contrast, neither H.R. 1792 nor H.R. 2413 would establish a legalization program for unauthorized agricultural workers.

H-2B employers must pay their workers at least the prevailing wage rate. There is a statutory annual cap of 66,000 on the number of aliens who may be issued H-2B visas or otherwise provided with H-2B status. In recent years, various comprehensive immigration reform bills have proposed to overhaul the H-2B program and/or establish new guest worker programs for H-2B-like workers. For example, S. 1639 , which the Senate considered in June 2007, would establish a new guest worker program to replace the H-2B program.", "In the aftermath of the Senate's unsuccessful cloture vote on S. 1639 , attention has been focused on an expired INA provision exempting certain returning H-2B workers from the 66,000 cap. This provision, which was in effect from FY2005 through FY2007, exempted from the H-2B cap, returning H-2B workers who had been counted against the cap in any one of the three prior fiscal years. Bills that would re-enact an H-2B returning worker exemption have been introduced in the House and Senate. H.R. 5495 and H.R. 5849 would exempt from the FY2008 cap returning H-2B workers who were counted against the cap in FY2005, FY2006, or FY2007. H.R. 5233 would exempt from the FY2008 and FY2009 caps returning workers who were counted against the H-2B cap in any one of the three fiscal years preceding the year at issue. S. 2839 includes a provision (\u00a72) that would exempt from the FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 H-2B caps returning workers who were counted against the cap in FY2005, FY2006, FY2007, or FY2008.", "Other bills propose to revise the expired H-2B returning worker exemption to cover workers who were present in the United States as H-2B nonimmigrants in any one of the prior three fiscal years, but who were not necessarily counted against the cap in any of those years. S. 988 would exempt from the H-2B cap for each fiscal year through FY2012 workers who were present in the United States in H-2B status in any one of the three years preceding the year at issue. H.R. 1843 would similarly revise the exemption and would make it a permanent INA provision. A returning H-2B worker exemption was included in the FY2008 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill ( H.R. 3093 ), as passed by the Senate. For FY2008, \u00a7540 of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 3093 would have exempted from the H-2B cap, aliens who had been present in the United States as H-2B nonimmigrants in any one of the past three years. This provision was not included in the House-passed version of H.R. 3093, and it is not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ). Another returning H-2B worker provision of this type was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in May 2008 as an amendment to its version of the supplemental appropriations bill.

An employer wishing to bring in an H-1B nonimmigrant must attest in a labor certification application (LCA) to DOL that the employer will pay the nonimmigrant the greater of the actual wages paid to other employees in the same job or the prevailing wages for that occupation; the employer will provide working conditions for the nonimmigrant that do not cause the working conditions of the other employees to be adversely affected; and there is no strike or lockout. The employer also must post at the workplace the application to hire nonimmigrants. Firms categorized as H-1B dependent (generally if at least 15% of the employees are H-1B workers) must also attest that they have attempted to recruit U.S. workers and that they have not laid off U.S. workers 90 days prior to or after hiring any H-1B nonimmigrants.", "Although most employment-based nonimmigrant visas are not numerically limited, the H-1B visa is subject to an annual cap of 65,000. For the past few years, the H-1B visa limit has been reached before the beginning of the fiscal year. DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that the FY2009 H-1B cap was reached within the first few days it accepted petitions. At the same time, current law exempts some H-1B workers from the annual cap. For example, up to 20,000 aliens holding a master's or higher degree are exempt from the H-1B cap each year. This 20,000 limit is quickly met.", "Multiple bills on the H-1B visa have been introduced in the 110 th Congress. A variety of constituencies are advocating substantial increases in H-1B admissions. Among the bills to increase admissions, S. 1038 / H.R. 1930 would amend the INA to exempt from the annual H-1B visa cap, an alien who has earned a master's or higher degree from an accredited U.S. university; or has been awarded a medical specialty certification based on post-doctoral training and experience in the United States. S. 1038/H.R. 1930 further would increase the annual H-1B cap, with an escalator clause that would provide a 20% increase for the following year if the previous year's ceiling is reached. S. 1092 would amend the INA to increase the annual H-1B cap to 115,000 in FY2007 and 195,000 in FY2008. It also would eliminate the 20,000 annual cap on aliens with masters' or higher degrees who can enter the United States without being subject to H-1B visa limits. H.R. 1758 would amend the INA to provide an additional 65,000 H-1B visas in each fiscal year from FY2008 through FY2012 for persons who have a master's or Ph.D. degree and meet the requirements for such status. Under this bill, the employers of these workers would be required to make scholarship payments to institutions of higher education. Taking yet a different approach, H.R. 5642 would set the ceiling on total H-1B admissions at 195,000 for FY2008 and FY2009.", "A second set of bills, including S. 1035 , S. 31 , and H.R. 2538 , focuses on strengthening H-1B requirements and expanding enforcement. S. 1035 aims to enhance labor market protections pertaining to H-1B visas. Specifically, this bill would require that employers seeking to hire an H-1B visa holder pledge that they have made a good-faith effort to hire U.S. workers first and that the H-1B visa holder will not displace a U.S. worker. S. 1035 also would prohibit employers from hiring H-1B employees who are then outsourced to other companies, and would prohibit companies from hiring H-1B employees if they employ more than 50 people and more than 50% of their employees are H-1B visa holders. Another bill\u2014S. 31\u2014would increase penalties on employers for violating the LCA, provide H-1B aliens with whistle-blower protections, and require USCIS to submit to Congress a fraud risk assessment of the H-1B visa program. H.R. 2538 would alter the LCA process by requiring H-1B employers to use whichever of its three proposed wage determination methods results in the highest wages. It also would prohibit employers from outsourcing or otherwise contracting for the placement of an H-1B nonimmigrant with another employer. In addition, H.R. 2538 would eliminate the exemption from the H-1B cap for certain aliens with a U.S. master's or higher degree.", "A third set of bills includes provisions to both increase admissions and expand enforcement. Among the bills of this type, S. 1351 would increase the H-1B cap to 150,000 in FY2008 with an escalator clause for subsequent years. It also would strengthen labor market protections for U.S. workers competing with potential H-1B workers and would expand the investigative and enforcement authority of DOL. S. 1397 and H.R. 5630 would exempt from the H-1B ceilings any alien who has: earned a master's or higher degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from an institution of higher education in the United States; or been awarded a medical specialty certification based on post-doctoral training and experience in the United States. Up to 20,000 aliens who have earned a master's or higher degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from an institution of higher education outside the United States would also be exempted under S. 1397 and H.R. 5630. S. 1397 would raise the annual H-1B limit to 115,000 for FY2007 and rely on a market-based calculation to potentially escalate the limit above 115,000 for each subsequent fiscal year. S. 1397 also includes enforcement provisions on application fraud and misrepresentation, employer penalties, and DOL investigations. H.R. 5630 would raise the annual H-1B limit to 130,000 for FY2008 with an escalator clause for subsequent years. H.R. 5630 also would strengthen labor market protections for U.S. workers competing with potential H-1B workers. S. 1639 includes a variety of revisions to the H-1B provisions in the INA. Among other things, this bill would raise the FY2008 cap to 115,000 and provide that in subsequent years DHS may issue additional H-1B visas up to a 180,000 cap. It also would require the submission of Internal Revenue Service W-2 forms as part of the H-1B renewal petition. S. 1639 draws on the labor market protections proposed in S. 1035 .", "As originally passed by the Senate, \u00a7532 of the FY2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations bill ( H.R. 3043 ) would have required employers to pay a supplemental fee of $3,500 for each H-1B hired, with a reduced amount ($1,750) paid by small businesses with 25 or fewer employees. Public hospitals would have been exempt from the supplemental fee. The fees would have been allocated largely to programs for gifted and talented students and for education in science, technology, engineering, and math.

Those holding an O visa may stay up to three years, with a one-year renewal option. The P visa has a somewhat lower standard of achievement than the O visa and is restricted to a narrower band of occupations and endeavors.

P-1 visas are for athletes and members of entertainment groups at an internationally recognized level of performance. Individual athletes on P visas may stay in intervals of up to 5 years at a time, up to 10 years in total; other P visa holders may stay up to one year.

Instead, by definition, they are in the country illegally. Unauthorized alien students are eligible for free public elementary and secondary education, but many of them who want to attend college face various obstacles. Among these obstacles, a provision enacted in 1996 as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA; Division C of P.L. 104-208 , \u00a7505) discourages states and localities from granting unauthorized aliens certain \"postsecondary education benefits,\" widely interpreted to refer to \"in-state\" residency status for tuition purposes.

Aliens granted cancellation of removal have their status adjusted to LPR status.", "Under S. 774 and H.R. 1275 , aliens could affirmatively apply for cancellation of removal without being placed in removal proceedings. To be eligible for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under these bills, the alien would have to demonstrate that he or she met various requirements, including that he or she had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of enactment and had not yet reached age 16 at the time of initial entry.

Unlike these bills, however, it would not make participation mandatory for all employers. Instead, it would require federal contractors to participate. In addition, under S. 3093, employers participating in E-Verify could elect to verify the employment eligibility of their existing employees. The Secretary of Homeland Security also could require any employer or class of employers to use E-Verify to verify the employment eligibility of its current workforce if the Secretary has reasonable cause to believe that the employer has committed material violations of the INA prohibitions on unlawful employment.", "H.R. 98 and H.R. 2954 would require Social Security cards to include an encrypted machine-readable electronic identification strip unique to the bearer and a digitized photograph. Under the bills, a new hire would have to present a Social Security card of this type to his or her employers, who would use it to verify the worker's identity and work authorization. Employment eligibility verification would be conducted by accessing a database to be established by DHS that would contain DHS and SSA data. These verification requirements would take effect two years after the date of enactment and would apply to any employment commencing on or after that effective date.

Not later than three years after enactment, employers would be required to participate in either the EEVS or the SEEVS. The EEVS would be modeled broadly on E-Verify, although it would differ from the current system in key ways. For example, the EEVS would use information from a government database, the National Directory of New Hires, that is not currently part of E-Verify. Like H.R. 1645 , H.R. 5515 would enable individuals who are terminated from employment as a result of a disapproval notice (akin to a final nonconfirmation under E-Verify) to seek administrative and judicial review. The SEEVS, which H.R. 5515 would direct SSA to establish by regulation, would provide for identity authentication and employment eligibility verification. It would use the services of private sector entities to enroll new employees by means of identity authentication, to protect authenticated information through biometric technology, and to verify employment eligibility. Employees would be afforded the same rights and protections in connection with responses to inquiries under the SEEVS as under the EEVS.", "H.R. 5515 also would increase monetary penalties for employer violations of INA \u00a7274A prohibitions on unlawful employment (\u00a7104) and would amend INA \u00a7274B on unfair immigration-related employment practices to add new antidiscrimination requirements related to the EEVS and the SEEVS (\u00a7103).
