The proposal is comprehensive and follows largely the outline of the current 2002 farm bill, which expires this year. It includes proposals regarding commodity support, conservation, trade, nutrition and domestic food assistance, farm credit, rural development, agricultural research, forestry, energy, and such miscellaneous items as crop insurance, organic programs, and Section 32 purchases of fruits and vegetables.", "The Administration delivered its report to Congress, not as a bill, but as a possible focus for debate and a foundation for developing legislation.

The report and related USDA materials are available on the Department's website at http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?navid=FARM_BILL_FORUMS . In the following pages, Congressional Research Service analysts summarize current policy and programs, describe the USDA recommendations, and pose questions related to the policy, program, and/or budgetary impact of the recommendations. The organization of this report parallels that of the USDA report. The USDA report presumes a new five-year farm bill covering the 2008-2012 time frame.

The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays the costs of commodity support under a $30 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Congress annually appropriates funds to the CCC that are used to pay down its loans from the Treasury. Commodity support expenditures are estimated to have averaged about $12.6 billion per year over the six-year life of the current farm bill (FY2002-FY2007). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts that future spending for commodity support under current law would amount to about $7 billion per year over the next five years (FY2008-FY2012). The decline from past spending levels is due to current and anticipated high market prices for supported crops well into the future.", "USDA ' s proposed 2007 farm bill outlines modifications to the commodity programs that are claimed to save $4.494 billion from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 10-year current services baseline of $74.566 billion for commodity support.

In contrast, according to the Secretary, the USDA proposal would minimize market distortions and encourage farmers to plant crops based on market prices instead of subsidy prices. Loan rates for each commodity would be set at the lesser of (a) 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices (i.e., the average of the last five years excluding the high and low year), or (b) the loan rates specified in the House-passed version of the 2002 farm bill (which are lower than current law for feed grains, wheat, cotton, oilseeds, and peanuts).

This opportunity is available daily.", "The Secretary asserts that there are substantial difficulties and inequities in calculating daily PCPs. Additionally, short-term market price declines create windfall opportunities for farmers that are costly and inconsistent with the fundamental income support objectives of the marketing loan program. The proposed change would replace daily PCPs with monthly PCPs. Additionally, farmers would receive LDPs based on the monthly PCPs in effect on the days producers lose beneficial interest in the commodities. Currently, farmers can collect LDPs and hold onto commodities and market them at a later time when market prices are higher than the loan rates. The USDA proposal is claimed to save $250 million over 10 years ($25 million per year) compared to an unspecified OMB baseline spending level.", "1. Over the six-year life of the current farm bill, LDPs are estimated by USDA to cost an annual average of about $2.547 billion.

Direct payments are made on land with a history of production (called base acres) of feed grains (largely corn), wheat, upland cotton, rice, oilseeds (largely soybeans), and peanuts. The payment rate for each commodity is specified in the law. The annual payment to a farm is its commodity base acres times program yield times the payment rate. The direct payment program is designed to cost about $5 billion per year. The payment is made for each eligible farm based on historic production and yield, and not on actual production or market prices. Hence, it was envisioned as not trade-distorting and not subject to WTO spending limits on subsidies.", "The Secretary has proposed to continue the direct payments and, except for upland cotton, to keep the current payment rates in place from 2008 through 2009, and then increase them by about 7% in 2010 for the three-year period through 2012. Uniquely, the upland cotton direct payment rate would immediately increase about 7% and remain at the higher level.", "1. Is the increase in direct payments for program commodities a mechanism to maintain payments to farmers that otherwise would decline under conditions of high market prices and reduced marketing loan program payments? If market prices do remain high, what would be the economic justification for higher direct payments? Would these higher payments be capitalized into higher land prices and rents?", "2. A high proportion of the increase in direct payments would be for one commodity, upland cotton. USDA's recommendations report states that \"[t]he combination of increases in upland cotton yields per acre and declining U.S. upland cotton textile production is expected to limit price gains and result in substantial cotton program expenditures, compared to other commodities.\" Why would a declining domestic textile industry have a depressing impact on prices given that in the past, increased exports have offset any decline in domestic use? Are the loan rate and target price for cotton substantially out of line with markets, and the cost of production? Are marketing loan and counter-cyclical program costs likely to be high in the future compared to other commodities?", "3. Over the past five years, crop disaster payments amounted to about $1.3 billion per year, and no payments yet have been made on disaster losses for 2005 and 2006.

The eligibility requirement is that a person must be actively engaged in farming on an operation that has program commodity base acres. The sharing of direct payments between tenants and landlords is a matter agreed to among the parties in a manner consistent with local custom. The Secretary ' s farm bill proposal would give beginning farmers direct payments at a rate that is 20% higher than for other farmers for the first five years. The expected cost is $250 million over 10 years.", "1. How does the USDA intend to define a beginning farmer?", "2. How many beginning farmers are expected to benefit from this program?", "3. Is it likely that sellers of farmland will raise the asking price or the beginning farmers will raise the offer price to acquire cropland by the amount of the increased direct payment? In other words, could the higher direct payment be bid into higher cropland prices and higher rental rates, as has been the case with regular direct payments?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue-Based Counter-Cyclical Payments", "paragraphs": ["Counter-cyclical payments were adopted in the 2002 farm bill as a way of providing certainty and stability to ad hoc emergency market loss payments enacted in years following low market prices. The five-year (FY2003-FY2007) average annual cost of counter-cyclical payments is estimated at about $2.5 billion. The payments are made when the season average farm market price of a program crop are below the effective target price. The counter-cyclical payments, like direct payments, are paid on base acres without regard to what or how much of any crop is grown on the base acres.", "The Secretary has proposed that counter-cyclical payments be triggered by a shortfall in national crop revenue rather than a shortfall in the national average price. This change would bring crop yields and production into the equation. There have been years when prices were high but yields were low, so farmers were in need of support but the program made no payments. In contrast, there have been years when the price was low but yields were high so payments were made even though farmers did not need the support. This change is estimated to generate savings of $3.7 billion under the OMB 10-year current services baseline of $11.245 billion.", "1. Historically, commodity support programs have been designed to absorb risks on the price side of the farm income equation, while crop insurance and disaster assistance have addressed yield risks. Does the idea of revenue-based counter-cyclical payments integrate the two sides of risk management in a way that could serve as a model to integrate commodity support with disaster assistance and crop insurance? What are the risks and benefits of integration?", "2. What are the fundamental economic, business, trade agreement, or political barriers to creating a national counter-cyclical revenue program to replace commodity support programs, crop insurance, and disaster assistance for at least the subsidized crops?", "3. With few exceptions over the past 20 years, Congress has provided disaster assistance to the nation's farmers and ranchers whenever weather-related losses have been substantial. Some would argue that the Administration's farm bill proposal does not appear to offer what the Secretary of Agriculture might call an \"equitable, predictable\" alternative for any farmers not producing program crops. Could the revenue-based counter-cyclical program contained in the farm bill proposal for program crops serve as a starting point for a similar program for unsupported crops?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Value and Eligibility Limits", "paragraphs": ["In 1970, Congress first enacted annual limits on commodity support program payments. Currently, there is a per person limit of $40,000 on direct payments, $65,000 on counter-cyclical payments, and $75,000 on marketing loan gains/loan deficiency payments. The combined limit of $180,000 can be doubled to $360,000 under the spouse allowance or the three-entity allowance (a person can receive payments on three farms but at half the value on the second two). There is no limit on commodity certificate gains or marketing loan gains from the forfeiture of collateral under the nonrecourse loan program. Also, there is an adjusted gross income (AGI) eligibility cap of $2.5 million.", "In practice, according to the 2002 farm bill-authorized Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture, most farmers pushing up against the limits have devised ways to avoid the limits. In general, cotton and rice farmers (because of the higher per acre value of their crops and their large size) feel threatened by payment limits, in contrast to corn, soybean, and wheat farms, introducing a regional factor (north vs. south) into the debate. For some proponents of lower and more effective payment limits, it is an issue of equity and a concern that large payments accelerate the consolidation of farms into ever larger units. Opponents argue that the payments are fundamental to the safety net for agriculture and that large efficient farms are equally subject to risks as smaller farms.", "The Secretary has proposed eight changes that would make it difficult to evade a $360,000 per individual payment limit and would exclude anyone with more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income from eligibility for commodity program payments. The proposal is expected to save $1.5 billion under the OMB current services 10-year baseline of about $75 billion for commodity support.", "1. The projected savings of $1.5 billion from tightening the eligibility and payment limits appears small compared to the roughly $75 billion 10-year baseline. How many farms and how many individuals are expected to be affected?", "2. How much of the savings would come from reduced cotton and sugar payments, the commodities likely to be most impacted?", "3. A large proportion of commercial farms are managed by operators who own some land, but not even a majority of the acres they farm. In crop share arrangements, absentee landlords are receiving commodity program payments. To what extent would absentee landlords be impacted by the new $200,000 AGI limit? Could this lead to changes in tenant-landlord lease contracts toward cash rent? Would a further shift to cash rent be good for U.S. agriculture?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 1031 Exchanges", "paragraphs": ["Section 1031 is a feature of the federal tax code that allows a seller of income-producing property to acquire like-kind property and treat the transaction as a tax deferred exchange. The capital gains on the disposed property are transferred to the basis of the acquired property, and taxes on the gains are deferred until the acquired property is sold at a later date. This feature of the tax code is well known and used by owners of rental housing, but the rule applies to all income producing property, including farmland.", "The Secretary ' s proposal would prohibit commodity subsidy benefits to any farm acquired through a 1031 exchange. Justification is based on the argument that tax-deferred farmland exchanges are contributing to the escalation of farmland prices, making it difficult for new entrants to purchase land and small farms to expand.", "1. Do farmers ever use the 1031 exchange to geographically consolidate their holdings for efficiency purposes? If so, has the Administration considered exempting these farmers from the proposed new policy?", "2. Might there be cases where beginning farmers would use the 1031 exchange to acquire farmland? Should an exemption be made to the proposed prohibition in cases of beginning farmers?", "3 Can the argument that Section 1031 creates economic distortions, contributing to increased farmland prices, be applied to other parts of the economy that utilize that feature of the tax code?", "4. Several studies, including work done in the USDA, conclude that commodity subsidies are substantially capitalized into land prices and higher rental rates. What has a greater impact on farmland price escalation, commodity subsidies or 1031 exchanges? Is redesigning commodity programs to eliminate their effect on land prices something that should be considered, or not?", "5. Have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Ways and Means Committee been consulted about changing the tax code to eliminate 1031 exchanges in general or for farmland in particular?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dairy Counter-cyclical Payments and Price Support", "paragraphs": ["The federal government long has mandated that the farm price of milk be supported. The 2002 farm bill continued the Dairy Price Support Program at the then-current support price of $9.90 per hundredweight (cwt.) of farm milk. Support is achieved through a standing offer to purchase cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk at prices equivalent to the milk support price. The Administration proposal recommends continuation of the program at the current support level of $9.90 per cwt.", "The 2002 farm bill authorized a new counter-cyclical dairy payment program, called the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. Under the MILC program, dairy farmers nationwide are paid whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption in Boston falls below $16.94/cwt. As amended by the FY2006 Budget Reconciliation Act, farmers receive 34% of the difference between the $16.94 target price and the lower market price on up to 2.4 million lbs. of annual production. The program expires August 31, 2007, so there is no funding in the budget baseline. The Administration recommends renewing the MILC program at the current 34% payment rate for FY2008, and then gradually reducing the rate to 20% over the coming six years.", "1. A July 2004 USDA study on the \"Economic Effects of U.S. Dairy Policy and Alternative Approaches to Milk Pricing\" concludes that \"current dairy programs are limited in their ability to change the long-term economic viability of dairy farms\" and that the MILC program contributes to dairy surpluses and reduces the farm milk price. Some observers would argue that the price support program (which removes milk from the market) and the MILC program (which encourages more production) appear to be working at cross-purposes. Why does USDA recommend a continuation of current dairy policy?", "2. Since the MILC program's inception, large dairy farms have contended that the 2.4 million lb. payment limit (a herd size of about 125 cows) is biased against them, given that 2.4 million lbs. represents a small portion of their production. What is the federal government's response to their concerns?", "3. Under our current WTO trade obligations, the aggregate measure of support for dairy is based on how much higher the domestic support price is set above a fixed world reference price, and this imputed subsidy is applied to all domestic milk production. Using this formula, the WTO views the aggregate measure of support for the dairy price support program to be more than $4.5 billion annually (even though federal outlays are well below $1 billion), and classifies it as \"amber box\" (the most trade-distorting category). The current U.S. proposal in the Doha Round is to reduce its total amber box support from the current $19.1 billion to $7.6 billion. With dairy support contributing so much toward the proposed new maximum, did the USDA consider proposing an alternative to current policy that is decoupled from price and production?", "4. Since the MILC program's inception in 2002, it has provided total counter-cyclical payments of $2.4 billion over five marketing years (2002-2006). USDA estimates that the 10-year total cost of extending and revising the MILC program under its proposal is $793 million (FY2008-FY2017). Why is the cost estimate so far below historical expenditures on the program? Is it due to projections for improved dairy market conditions, or do proposed revisions to the program significantly reduce expenditures? Why are changes to the other commodity support programs being proposed that would save money, but the status quo would be maintained for dairy policy that will cost additional money over baseline?", "5. The current MILC program calculates payments based on current monthly production levels. The Administration's farm bill proposal would base payments on 85% of the three-year average of milk marketed during FY2004-FY2006, instead of on current production. The proposal states that such a change would make the MILC program consistent with other farm bill counter-cyclical programs. What is the rationale for making this change to the MILC program?

Mexico separately is limited to shipping 276,000 short tons through calendar year 2007, and then has open access to the U.S. market under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). An additional supply control feature of the law allows for imposition of domestic marketing allotments on U.S. sugar, but only when imports are less than 1.532 million short tons. The suspension of allotments when imports increase was adopted in the 2002 farm bill at the urging of the domestic sugar industry.", "With no limit on Mexican sugar imports after 2007, and several bilateral free trade agreements adopted or in process that would allow in more sugar, the United States is faced with the likelihood of imports exceeding 1.532 million short tons.

Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton when U.S. prices were higher than world prices so that the buyers were not disadvantaged by buying U.S. cotton. The Step 2 provision for upland cotton was repealed by Congress following a ruling that it violated the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Step 3 allowed for a special additional import quota for upland cotton when high world prices for U.S. cotton and Step 2 export subsidies created tight supplies for domestic mills.", "The USDA ' s farm bill proposes to eliminate Step 1 because it has been used infrequently. When it has been used the result has been increased costs for cotton LDPs. Step 3 would be eliminated because its purpose has disappeared with the elimination of Step 2.

Practically, this means that corn base acres can be planted to any other subsidized crop and vice versa, but not to fruits or vegetables. The limitation was put in place because producers of unsubsidized, but high value, specialty crops objected to likely competition from subsidized land.", "For purposes of meeting its WTO obligations, the United States has considered direct payments on base acres to be minimally production- and trade-distorting because they are decoupled from production decisions and market prices. Consequently, direct payments have been reported to the WTO as \"green box\" and not counted against the $19.1 billion limit on \"amber box\" trade-distorting subsidies. A WTO ruling on the U.S. cotton program reasoned that the planting flexibility restriction does not meet criteria for decoupled income support.
