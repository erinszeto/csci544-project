In such instances, some activities may be covered by reference while funding for others is provided through the text of the measure. For example, Division C of P.L. 115-245 \u2014the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019\u2014provided continuing appropriations through December 7, 2018, by referencing the FY2018 regular appropriations acts, while the other divisions of P.L. 115-245 provided full-year regular appropriations for the FY2019 Defense and Labor-HHS-ED bills.

When action on the regular appropriations bills is not complete by the time when the first CR expires, subsequent CRs will often simply replace the expiration date in the preceding CR with a new expiration date.

All other activities in the CR, however, would continue to be funded by the CR unless they were likewise superseded or the CR expired. The duration of funds for certain activities could also be shortened if other conditions that are specified in the CR occur.

This is in contrast to regular and supplemental appropriations acts, which generally provide specific amounts for each account.", "In previous years, many CRs have provided funding across accounts by reference to the amount of budget authority available in specified appropriations acts from the previous fiscal year.

For example, P.L. 105-240 , the first CR for FY1999, provided a variable funding rate for covered activities. Specifically, the CR provided funds derived from three possible reference sources: the House- and Senate-passed FY1999 regular appropriations bills, the amount of the President's budget request, or \"current operations\" (the total amount of budget authority available for obligation for an activity during the previous fiscal year), whichever was lower. In instances where no funding was provided under the House-and Senate-passed FY1999 appropriations bills, the funding rate would be based on the lower of the President's budget request or current operations. In addition, while the first CR for a fiscal year may provide a certain funding rate, subsequent CRs sometimes may provide a different rate.", "CRs have sometimes provided budget authority for some or all covered activities by incorporating the actual text of one or more regular appropriations bills for that fiscal year rather than providing funding according to the rate formula. For example, P.L. 112-10 provided funding for the Department of Defense through the incorporation of a regular appropriations bill in Division A, whereas Division B provided formulaic funding for all other activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.

The next 10 days, a period of intense legislative negotiations leading up to the national elections on November 7, 2000, were covered by a series of 10 one-day CRs. The next 31 days were covered by two CRs, the first lasting 10 days and the second lasting 21 days. The first of these two CRs was enacted into law on November 4, the Saturday before the election, and extended through November 14, the second day of a lame-duck session. The second CR was enacted into law on November 15 and expired on December 5, which was 10 days before the lame-duck session ended. The remaining five CRs, which ranged in duration from one to six days, covered the remainder of the lame-duck session and several days beyond (as the final appropriations measures passed by Congress were being processed for the President's approval).", " Table 5 provides more detailed information on the number, length, and duration of CRs enacted for FY1977-FY2019. As indicated previously, this represents the period after the start of the federal fiscal year was moved from July 1 to October 1 by the Congressional Budget Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Features of Full-Year CRs After FY1977", "paragraphs": ["Full-year CRs have been used to provide annual discretionary spending on a number of occasions. Prior to the full implementation of the Congressional Budget Act in FY1977, full-year CRs were used occasionally, particularly in the 1970s. Full-year CRs were enacted into law for four of the six preceding fiscal years (FY1971, FY1973, FY1975, and FY1976). Following the successful completion of all 13 regular appropriations acts prior to the start of FY1977, full-year CRs were used in each of the 11 succeeding fiscal years (FY1978-FY1988) to cover at least one regular appropriations act. Three years later, another full-year CR was enacted for FY1992. Most recently, full-year CRs were enacted for FY2007, FY2011, and FY2013.", " Table 4 identifies the 15 full-year CRs enacted for the period since FY1977. Nine of the 15 full-year CRs during this period were enacted in the first quarter of the fiscal year\u2014three in October, two in November, and four in December. The six remaining measures, however, were enacted during the following session between February 15 and June 5.", "The full-year CRs enacted during this period also varied in terms of length and the form of funding provided. Full-year CRs prior to FY1983 were relatively short measures, ranging in length from one to four pages in the Statutes-at-Large . Beginning with FY1983 and extending through FY1988, however, the measures became much lengthier, ranging from 19 to 451 pages. The greater page length of full-year CRs enacted for the period covering FY1983-FY1988 may be explained by two factors. First, full-year CRs enacted prior to FY1983 generally established funding levels by formulaic reference. Beginning with FY1983, however, Congress began to incorporate the full text of some or all of the covered regular appropriations acts, thereby increasing its length considerably. None of the full-year CRs enacted between 1985 and 1988 used formulaic funding provisions. Secondly, the number of regular appropriations acts covered by full-year CRs increased significantly during the FY1983-FY1988 period. For the period covering FY1978-FY1982, the number of regular appropriations acts covered by CRs for the full fiscal year ranged from one to six (averaging about three). Beginning with FY1983 and extending through FY1988, the number of covered acts ranged from five to 13, averaging about 10.", "The next two full-year CRs, for FY1992 and FY2007, returned to the earlier practice of using formulaic references and anomalies to establish funding levels. Both CRs provided funding only through this means. As a consequence, the length of these measures was considerably shorter than the FY1983 through FY1988 full-year CRs.", "The two most recent full-year CRs, for FY2011 and FY2013, in some respects were a hybrid of the earlier and recent approaches. The FY2011 full-year CR provided funding for 11 bills through formulaic provisions and anomalies. It also carried the full text of one regular appropriations bill in a separate division of the act (the FY2011 Department of Defense Appropriations Act). Similarly, the FY2013 CR contained the texts of five regular appropriations bills in Divisions A through E of the act\u2014the FY2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; the Department of Defense Appropriations Act; the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act; and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. In addition, Division F was characterized as providing continuing appropriations for the remaining seven regular appropriations bills through formulaic provisions and anomalies. Unlike previous years, the formula for providing continuing appropriations was based on the amount provided in FY2012 rather than a rate."], "subsections": []}]}}
