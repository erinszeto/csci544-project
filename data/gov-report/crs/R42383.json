As stated above, the budget resolution is presently a concurrent resolution, considered by both the House and Senate, but not sent to the President for his signature or veto. Instead, the President submits his preferred budgetary levels in his annual budget submission, as required by law, and in addition, he may sign or veto any legislation that Congress enacts implementing budgetary policy.

It is not \"realistic,\" because tax and spending policies will change over time. Neither is it intended to be a forecast of future budgetary outcomes. Rather, the projections ... reflect CBO's best judgment about how the economy and other factors will affect federal revenues and spending under existing policies.", "Specific rules for calculating the baseline appear in Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. In projecting the baseline, direct spending and receipts are generally assumed to continue at levels specified in existing law. These projections are based upon economic assumptions (e.g., economic growth, inflation, and unemployment) and other technical assumptions (e.g., demographic and workload changes) about future years. Discretionary spending levels are determined annually, so there is no obvious consensus as to what levels of discretionary spending best represent current policy. The level of discretionary spending, however, is assumed to stay constant in inflation-adjusted terms, meaning that the current year's spending level will be adjusted \"sequentially and cumulatively\" for inflation and other factors. Actual spending and revenue levels are not set by the baseline; they are set by spending and revenue legislation enacted by Congress and the President. While the Office of Management and Budget calculates their own baseline submitted with the President's budget, CBO submits the official congressional baseline to Congress in late January of each year each year as part of the Budget and Economic Outlook report.", "H.R. 3578 , the Baseline Reform Act of 2012, passed the House on February 3, 2012, by a vote of 235-177, after being marked up by the House Budget Committee on December 7, 2011, and reported from committee on January 30, 2012. The measure proposes to change the calculation of the baseline by removing the inflation adjustment made to discretionary spending. By removing the annual inflation adjustment for discretionary spending from the baseline calculation, nominal dollars stay the same but the purchasing power of discretionary spending would fall as inflation occurs. In addition, by holding the level of spending constant, the spending per person would decrease as the population grows.", "In the current baseline, the inflation adjustment rule is not in effect because the discretionary spending caps agreed to under the BCA have been incorporated into the baseline calculation for discretionary spending until 2021. The change to the baseline included in H.R. 3578 therefore would not be incorporated until 2022, with the exception of projected spending for \"Overseas Contingency Operations,\" which is not subject to the discretionary spending limits. ", "H.R. 3578 also requires CBO to submit a supplemental projection that assumes the extension of current revenue policy, regardless of such revenue policy being set to expire.

This information is to be prepared as a supplement, and not a replacement for estimates already required by CBO under Section 402 of the 1974 Budget Act, which requires CBO, to the extent practicable, to prepare for any measure reported from a House or Senate committee an estimate of the costs incurred in carrying out such a bill in the year it is to become effective as well as each of the next four years.", "Since 2003, House Rules have required a supplementary macroeconomic impact analysis of tax legislation reported by the House Ways and Means Committee (or a reason given for why it cannot be prepared).

In other words, the amounts flowing in and out of the government are recorded in the year when those flows occur. One exception is the treatment of federal loans and federal loan guarantees since enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 USC 661). For federal loans and loan guarantees, only the subsidy costs inherent in those transactions are recorded on budget as outlays in the year that a loan or loan guarantee is made. Neither the amounts of the loan disbursed nor subsequently repaid enters the federal budget as an outlay.", "The subsidy cost of a federal loan or loan guarantee is calculated as the difference between the net present value of future expected expenses and income. Future expenses and income are discounted using the government's expected borrowing cost. H.R. 3581 modifies the Federal Credit Reform Act by requiring expenses and income to be discounted by a rate that includes a \"fair value\" risk adjustment, where fair value is defined by Financial Accounting Standards #157. The proposed adjustment is intended to represent the additional compensation (risk premium) that private lenders or insurers would require to take on the risks inherent in the transaction. This change would make the cost of government loans and loan guarantees more comparable to the cost of an equivalent transaction undertaken by private lenders or insurers. According to a 2004 CBO report,", "Using Treasury rates to discount expected cash flows neglects the cost of market risk and results in the systematic understatement of costs for both direct and guaranteed loans. Using risk-adjusted discount rates, which include the cost of market risk, would correct that understatement and improve the comparability of budgetary costs for credit and other programs.", "Opponents of H.R. 3581 argue that market risk is not relevant to the federal budget and a fair value adjustment would make loans and loan guarantees appear more costly than an equivalent grant or tax expenditure. A fair value adjustment was statutorily required for the budgetary treatment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and CBO sometimes presents additional information on costs under a fair value adjustment in their evaluations of credit programs.", "The practical effect of this change would be to increase the costs of federal loan and loan guarantees recorded in the budget, because interest rates on private loans are generally higher than government borrowing rates. CBO estimates that this change would increase recorded subsidy costs by $55 billion in 2012. H.R. 3581 would not change the availability of federal loans or loan guarantees through existing programs, or the interest or other fees paid by borrowers and received by the government. H.R. 3581 contains language that prevents this change from affecting budgetary enforcement rules and adjusts the discretionary spending caps created by the Budget Control Act to accommodate increases in recorded discretionary spending as a result of the subsidy re-estimates. Going forward, the change would affect the scoring of bills to create or modify loan and loan guarantee programs, however, which would affect their treatment under PAYGO rules, for example.", "According to CBO, the major programs affected by H.R. 3581 would be the Federal Housing Administration's and the Department of Veteran Affairs' mortgage guarantee programs, the Department of Education's student loan programs, the Department of Agriculture's credit programs for rural utilities, and the Small Business Administration's loan and loan guarantee programs. H.R. 3581 maintains the exemptions for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, national flood insurance, the National Insurance Development Fund, federal crop insurance, and the Tennessee Valley Authority from credit-reform accounting.", "H.R. 3581 would also move Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on budget for as long as they remain in federal conservatorship. In previous fiscal years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have appeared on budget only through the transfers that they have received from the Treasury Department on a cash flow basis since they were taken into conservatorship. Other provisions of H.R. 3581 would require two studies from CBO and OMB, and require federal agencies to make their budget justifications submitted to any congressional committee available online to the public on the same day. Overall, CBO estimates appropriations equal to $14 million would be required for the next five years across relevant agencies in order to comply with all provisions of H.R. 3581 ."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
