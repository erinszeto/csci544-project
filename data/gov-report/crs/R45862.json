In general, weighted student funding systems base school funding on the number of pupils in each school in specified categories. Under these funding systems, weights are assigned to pupil characteristics that are deemed to be related to the costs of educating such pupils\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as being from a low-income family, being an English Learner (EL), or having a disability\u00e2\u0080\u0094and their educational program (such as grade level or career-technical education).", "Eligible federal funds that may be consolidated in an LEA's weighted student funding system include those available under ESEA Title I-A (Education for the Disadvantaged), Supporting Effective Instruction (Title II-A), English Language Acquisition (Title III-A), and Student Support and Academic Enrichment (Title IV-A). No non-ESEA funds (e.g., funds available under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or the Perkins Career and Technical Education (Perkins) Act) may be consolidated. Once eligible federal funds are consolidated in a participating LEA's weighted student funding system, these funds are treated the same way as the state and local funds.", "LEAs participating in Title I-E must have a funding system that uses weights or allocation amounts that provide \"substantially more funding\" than is allocated to other students to ELs, students from low-income families, and students with any other characteristic related to educational disadvantage that is selected by the LEA. The system must also ensure that each high-poverty school receives in the first year of the local flexibility demonstration agreement more per-pupil funding for low-income students than was received for low-income students from federal, state, and local sources in the year prior to entering into the agreement and at least as much per-pupil funding for ELs as was received for ELs from federal, state, and local sources in the prior year. The weighted student funding system must include all school-level actual personnel expenditures for instructional staff, including staff salary differentials for years of employment, and actual nonpersonnel expenditures in the LEA's calculation of eligible federal funds and state and local funds to be allocated to the school level.", "The Title I-E authority is limited to 50 LEAs in school years preceding 2019-2020, but could be offered to any LEA from that year onward, if a \"substantial majority\" of the LEAs participating in previous years have met program requirements. In February 2018, the Secretary announced that the U.S. Department of Education (ED) would begin accepting applications from LEAs to enter into agreements under the Student-Centered Funding Pilot, which is how ED refers to the Title I-E authority. To date, only six LEAs have applied for the Title I-E authority, and only Puerto Rico has been approved to enter into an agreement. Puerto Rico will begin implementing the Title I-E flexibility authority during the 2019-2020 school year. Thus, no LEAs will have implemented weighted student funding systems under Title I-E prior to the 2019-2020 school year.", "While it is unclear why relatively few LEAs have expressed interest in participating in the Title I-E authority, there are several possible explanations, some of which are summarized below:", "ED did not act to implement the Title I-E authority until February 2018, more than two years after the enactment of the ESSA. Local flexibility demonstration agreements are for a three-year period with a possible renewal. LEAs may not feel that the changes needed to implement the required weighted student funding system are worthwhile for a three-year period without knowing for certain if the authority would be extended. States and LEAs that currently have weighted student funding systems often include funds for students with disabilities and career and technical education in their systems. However, LEAs would be prohibited from consolidating IDEA or Perkins funds under the Title I-E authority. Public schools that operate schoolwide programs under Title I-A already have the authority to consolidate state, local, and certain federal funds, including those available under IDEA or Perkins. There may be concerns that some public schools may lose funds by switching to a weighted student funding system. As the Title I-E authority does not include any funding to ease the transition to the new funding system for schools that may be negatively affected, LEAs may be hesitant to participate. Under the ESEA Title I-A program, which accounts for over 76% of the eligible federal funds under Title I-E, funds have historically been provided to public schools with the highest concentrations of low-income students. Under the Title I-E authority, if an LEA chooses to consolidate its Title I-A funds it is likely that the distribution of Title I-A funds would be more diffuse. It is possible that some LEAs may view the consolidation of federal funds and the resulting redistribution of funds among public schools in the LEA as a step toward the portability of federal funds, whereby funds would be associated with individual students rather than schools and could ultimately follow them to any school of their choosing, including a private school."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to add a new Part E to Title I entitled \"Flexibility for Equitable Per-Pupil Spending.\" Under Title I-E, the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) has the authority to provide local educational agencies (LEAs) with flexibility to consolidate eligible federal funds with state and local funding to create a \"single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged students.\" The ESEA Title I-E authority is applicable to LEAs that are using or agree to implement \"weighted student funding\" systems to establish budgets for, and allocate funds to, individual public schools.

State governments provided $318.6 billion (47.0%) of these revenues, local governments provided $303.8 billion (44.8%), and the federal government provided $56.0 billion (8.3%). Over the last several decades, the share of public elementary and secondary education revenues provided by state governments has increased, the share provided by local governments has decreased, and the federal share has varied within a range of 6.0% to 12.7%.

This state share varies widely, from approximately 25% in Illinois to almost 90% in Hawaii and Vermont. The programs through which state funds are provided to LEAs for public elementary and secondary education have traditionally been categorized into five types of programs: (1) Foundation Programs, (2) Full State Funding Programs, (3) Flat Grants, (4) District Power Equalizing, and (5) Categorical Grants. , Of these, Foundation Programs are the most common, although many states use a combination of program types.

Most of these states have policies that assign numeric weights to different categories of pupils, while in other states the school finance program specifies different target dollar amounts for specific categories of pupils, which is mathematically equivalent to assigning weights.", "Many states also adjust pupil weights for those in selected grade levels, geographic areas, or programs.

While levels of expenditures per pupil may be determined for individual schools under these budgetary systems, they are calculated \"after the fact,\" based on whatever staff and other resources have been assigned to the school. And while standard ratios of pupils per teacher or other resource measures may be applied LEA-wide in these situations, substantial variations in the amounts actually spent on teachers and other resources in each school can result from systematic variations in teacher seniority and other factors. These variations might be masked by local policies to apply average salaries, rather than specific actual salaries, in school accounting systems.

An interview with Dr. Roza based on their preliminary findings revealed that nearly all 19 LEAs in the study that use weighted student funding systems cite equity (89%) and flexibility for school principals (79%) as a main reason for implementing such systems.

If SSAE funds were consolidated with state and local funds under a weighted student funding system, then the participating LEA would have to demonstrate that the activities being implemented in its schools meet these purposes. However, the LEA would not have to meet SSAE grant requirements about how much funding was used for each purpose. If a participating LEA consolidates funds from an eligible federal program that provides competitive grants to LEAs into its weighted student funding system, it is still required to carry out the scope and objectives, at a minimum, as described in the LEA's approved application.

Thus, the waiver authority granted to the Secretary for the purposes of Title I-E is broader than the general waiver authority available under Section 8401. Under the latter, the Secretary is prohibited from waiving provisions such as the allocation or distribution of funds to grantees.

For example, each participating LEA must agree to meet the three Title I-A fiscal accountability requirements in Section 1118, which include maintenance of effort (Section 1118(a)), supplement, not supplant (Section 1118(b)), and comparability (Section 1118(c)). ", "The maintenance of effort provision requires LEA expenditures of state and local funds to be at least 90% of what they were for the second preceding fiscal year for public elementary and secondary education. The use of either a weighted student funding system or a traditional funding system should not directly affect the amount of state and local funds spent on public education, so the use of a weighted student funding system does not present any problems with meeting this requirement. ", "The supplement, not supplant provision requires that Title I-A funds be used so as to supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be provided to Title I-A schools. According to ED, an LEA may presume that this requirement has been met if the LEA \"implements its system so that the State and local funds that are included in the system include the funds that Title I, Part A schools would have received if they were not Title I, Part A schools.\" ", "Comparability requires that a comparable level of services be provided with state and local funds in Title I-A schools compared with non-Title I-A schools prior to the receipt of Title I-A funds. Many LEAs currently meet this provision using a pupil-teacher ratio to compare Title I-A and non-Title I-A schools. It is possible that they may not be able to continue to use this method under a weighted student funding system. According to ED, if an LEA demonstrates comparability based on the state and local funds received by each Title I-A school compared to non-Title I-A schools through an equitable funding system, the LEA's weighted student funding system would \"constitute per se comparability.\" Therefore, according to ED, an LEA might find it \"advantageous to demonstrate comparability based on funds rather than a staff-student ratio.\"", "The identification of public schools for purposes of the supplement, not supplant and comparability fiscal accountability provisions requires the identification of public schools as Title I-A schools and their Title I-A funding levels under the current structure of the program. Thus, Title I-A provisions that require LEAs to determine which public schools would receive Title I-A funds and the amount that each school would receive cannot be waived by the Secretary, even though funds would not be distributed based on these determinations if an LEA chose to include Title I-A funds in its weighted student funding system. However, as previously mentioned, an LEA does not have to distribute Title I-A funds based on the current distribution requirements if the LEA includes Title I-A funds in its weighted student funding system.

Prior to allocating funds through its weighted student funding system, each participating LEA must determine the amount of funds from each eligible federal program whose funds have been consolidated that must be reserved to provide equitable services under that program. For example, under Title I-A a participating LEA must still determine the amount of funding that would have been provided to a public school attendance area if the LEA was allocating Title I-A funds in accordance with Section 1113(c). Based on this funding level, the LEA must determine how much Title I-A funding needs to be reserved for serving eligible private school students. The participating LEA must then follow current procedures with respect to consulting with private school officials and providing needed services under each program to eligible private school students. Remaining Title I-A funds not reserved at the LEA level would be distributed through the LEA's weighted student funding formula.", "Participating LEAs are also required to meet all applicable federal civil rights laws (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act) and all IDEA requirements. These requirements may not be waived by the Secretary.

For example, participating LEAs must continue to meet state-level requirements, such as implementing state academic standards, administering annual state assessments, meeting educational accountability requirements, and issuing an annual local report card, including reporting per-pupil expenditures by school. In addition, state-level requirements delegated by a state to an LEA as part of a subgrant agreement cannot be waived. For example, if a participating LEA is delegated state responsibilities for identifying migratory children and transferring student records, these responsibilities must be met. The Secretary has also determined that a participating LEA that has schools identified for comprehensive or targeted support and improvement under Section 1111 must ensure that such schools develop and implement improvement plans. If a participating LEA chooses to offer public school choice as an intervention in schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement, however, the LEA would no longer be subject to the limitation on funding for transportation. A participating LEA is also required to continue addressing the disparities that result in low-income and minority students in Title I-A schools being taught at higher rates than other students by inexperienced, ineffective, or out-of-field teachers.

These grants are either provided directly to LEAs or, in most cases, to LEAs via the state. ", "Most of the attention regarding the possible impact of the weighted student funding authority has been focused on the ESEA Title I-A program. In addition to constituting about 76% of the total FY2019 appropriations for all programs potentially affected by the Title I-E authority ( Table 1 ), it is the only one of the potentially affected federal programs under which most funds are allocated to individual schools under statutory school allocation policies, and therefore the only program where current policies for the allocation of funds to schools can be compared to how funds might be allocated to schools under the weighted student funding authority. The other potentially affected federal programs are either much less focused on individual schools (as opposed to being centrally managed by LEAs), are much less widespread in their distribution of funds among LEAs, and/or are focused largely on SEAs rather than LEAs or schools. Thus, in most cases, ESEA Title I-A funds are likely to be the primary federal program funds directly affected by the ESEA Title I-E authority in most participating LEAs. It is possible, however, depending on which eligible federal funds and the percentage of such funds an LEA decides to include in its weighting student funding system, that the distribution of funds under other ESEA programs that have funds eligible for consolidation could change substantially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Policies for Allocating Title I-A Funds to Schools Within LEAs", "paragraphs": ["As is explained below, the allocation of Title I-A funds within LEAs is focused on providing grants to schools with comparatively high concentrations of students from low-income families, not individual students. Thus, the authority under ESEA Title I-E to combine Title I-A funds with state and local funds under weighted student funding formulas and to have the Title I-A funds follow students to any public school in the LEA, not just those with concentrations of students from low-income families, is a significant shift from the way the program is generally implemented. ", "Under almost all federal education assistance programs, grants are made to states or to LEAs (or subgranted to LEAs by SEAs) with services or resources provided in a manner that is managed by the SEA or LEA. In sharp contrast to this general pattern, most ESEA Title I-A funds are allocated to individual schools, under statutory allocation provisions, although LEAs retain substantial discretion to control the use of a share of Title I-A grants at a central district level. While there are several rules related to school selection, LEAs must generally rank public schools by their percentage of pupils from low-income families, and serve them in rank order. LEAs may choose to consider only schools serving selected grade levels (e.g., only elementary schools or only middle schools) in determining eligibility for grants, so long as all public schools where more than 75% of the pupils from low-income families receive grants (if sufficient funds are available to serve all such schools). LEAs also have the option of serving all high schools where more than 50% of the pupils are from low-income families before choosing to serve schools at selected grade levels.", "All participating schools must generally have a percentage of children from low-income families that is higher than the LEA's average, or 35%, whichever of these two figures is lower. The percentage of students from low-income families for each public school is usually measured directly, although LEAs may choose to measure it indirectly for middle or high schools based on the measured percentages for the elementary or middle schools that students attended previously (sometimes called \"feeder schools\"). LEAs have the option of setting school eligibility thresholds higher than the minimum in order to concentrate available funds on a smaller number of schools, and this is especially the practice in some large urban LEAs. For example, according to data available from ED, in the 2015-16 school year all public schools reported as participating in Title I-A in Chicago had a free and reduced-price lunch child percentage of 55% or higher, whereas the minimum eligibility threshold would generally be 35%.", "In almost all cases, the data used to determine which pupils are from low-income families for the distribution of Title I-A funds to schools are not the same as those used to estimate the number of school-age children in low-income families for purposes of calculating Title I-A allocations to states and LEAs. This is because Census or other data are generally not available on the number of school-age children enrolled in a school, or living in a residential school attendance zone, with income below the standard federal poverty threshold. Thus, LEAs must use available proxies for low-income status. The Title I-A statute allows LEAs to use the following low-income measures for school selection and allocations: (1) eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches under the federal child nutrition programs, (2) eligibility for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), (3) eligibility for Medicaid, or (4) Census poverty estimates (in the rare instances where such estimates may be available for individual schools or school attendance areas). According to the most recent relevant data, approximately 90% of LEAs receiving Title I-A funds use free/reduced-price school lunch (FRPL) data\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes alone, sometimes in combination with other authorized criteria\u00e2\u0080\u0094to select Title I-A schools and allocate funds among them.

For example, for a family of four people during the 2018-2019 school year, the income threshold for eligibility was $32,630 for free lunches and $46,435 for reduced price lunches. By contrast, the poverty threshold for a family of four people in 2018 was $25,100. ", "While Title I-A funds are to be focused on the schools within a recipient LEA with percentages of students from low-income families that are relatively high in the context of their locality, many Title I-A schools do not have high percentages of low-income students when considered from a national perspective. Largely because of the relatively low poverty rate thresholds for LEA eligibility to receive Title I-A grants, many low-poverty LEAs receive Title I-A funds, and often the highest-poverty schools in those LEAs do not have high percentages of students from low-income families compared to the nation as a whole. For example, according to ED, 23% of the nation's public schools that are in the lowest quartile nationwide in terms of their percentage of students from low-income families (35% or below) receive Title I-A grants.", "Title I-A funds are allocated among participating schools in proportion to their number of pupils from low-income families, although grants to eligible schools per pupil from a low-income family need not be equal for all schools. LEAs may choose to provide higher grants per child from a low-income family to schools with higher percentages of such pupils. ", "A Title I-A school at which 40% or more of the students are from low-income families may provide Title I-A services via a schoolwide program, under which all of the students at the school may be served.

In making this determination, LEAs may use either the same source of data used to select and allocate funds among public schools (i.e., usually FRPL data) or one of a specified range of alternatives. ", "As noted earlier, the allocation of Title I-A funds within LEAs is focused on providing grants to schools with comparatively high concentrations of students from low-income families, not individual students. One rationale for the strategy of concentrating Title I-A funds on relatively high poverty schools is that the level of funding for each participating student is relatively low and can finance a substantial level of services only if combined with Title I-A funding for numerous eligible students in a school. Title I-A funding per student is usually discussed in terms of grant amounts per student served under the program. Especially with the growth of schoolwide programs in recent years, the amount of funding per student deemed to be participating in the program (which includes all students in schoolwide program sites) would be estimated at $645. Even this amount, which is based on dividing the total FY2019 Title I-A appropriation ($15,859,802,000) by the latest published estimate of the number of students participating in Title I-A programs (24.6 million), would be an overestimate, as it does not take into account the share of Title I-A funds that do not reach individual schools because they are used at the state or LEA level for activities such as administration, school improvement, and districtwide programs (e.g., professional development for Title I-A teachers). However, under weighted student funding the more relevant figure would be the level of funding per student from a low-income family. If the standard of low-income most often applied in the current Title I-A school allocation process were used, the number of public school students from low-income families would be slightly higher (25.8 million) and the national average Title I-A grant per pupil from a low-income family would be $614.

Thus, in participating LEAs, at least some federal programs that are currently centrally managed by LEAs may be decentralized and managed, at least in part, by individual schools.

One reason for the low rate of participation could be the relatively slow implementation by ED. The authority was provided under the ESSA's amendments to the ESEA, enacted on December 10, 2015. However, ED's initial announcement that the flexibility authority was available was made more than two years later, on February 2, 2018.

There is no definitive, comprehensive listing of LEAs currently using weighted student funding formulas. While a number of relatively large urban LEAs are doing so, the total number of such LEAs may still be rather small, limiting the number of likely and eligible applicants for the federal weighted student funding authority.", "Potential applicants may be deterred by the limitations to the federal weighted student funding authority. While state- and LEA-level weighted student funding formulas often include state and local funding for students with disabilities and career and technical education programs, the Title I-E authority does not apply to funds under IDEA or the Perkins CTE Act. While it might seem most appropriate for an ESEA flexibility provision to apply only to ESEA programs, and while the IDEA and the Perkins CTE Act involve somewhat different constituencies and interest groups than the ESEA, the Title I-E flexibility authority might be more consistent with many state and local weighted student funding policies, and offer enhanced flexibility to participating LEAs, if it included at least some of the IDEA and Perkins CTE Act funding streams. In addition, as discussed below, schools operating schoolwide programs under Title I-A are already permitted to consolidate federal funds provided through non-ESEA programs (e.g., IDEA and Perkins CTE Act funds) with their state and local funds.

The authority to consolidate funds under schoolwide programs is only available to Title I-A schools operating those programs (as opposed to operating targeted assistance programs). Schools operating schoolwide programs have the choice of whether to consolidate their federal, state, and local funds or not.

While this would not be a concern at public schools that numerous pupils from low-income families choose to attend, it would be an issue at schools that only a few such children choose to attend. ", "However, this concern might be countered by the fact that under a weighted student funding process, not only Title I-A funds but also state and local funds and potentially other eligible federal program funds would be combined and allocated under a formula giving additional weight to students from low-income families. It is also specifically required that the high-poverty schools in a participating LEA receive in the first year of implementation more total funding per pupil from a low-income family (and at least as much per EL) as in the year preceding initial implementation of the flexibility authority, and at least as much in succeeding years. Thus, while Title I-A funds alone would likely be substantially more widely dispersed among schools than they currently are, it is possible that total federal, state, and local funding to relatively high-poverty schools would increase, especially in LEAs that had not previously adopted weighted student funding policies with respect to their state and local funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Would the Title I-E flexibility authority increase the extent to which federal programs other than Title I-A are focused on individual schools?", "paragraphs": ["It is possible that as a result of the Title I-E flexibility, some eligible federal programs may become more focused on the use of funds at the school level as opposed to the state or LEA level. There is currently limited data on how funds under eligible federal programs are distributed to the school level, if at all. It may be helpful from a data analysis perspective to have comprehensive data on the specific federal education funds provided to each public school to examine whether switching to a weighted student funding system that meets the requirements of Title I-E alters this distribution of funds.", "Under the ESEA as amended by the ESSA, Title I-A requires participating states to include in school report cards data on expenditures at each public school. The state report card must provide data on LEA- and school-level per-pupil expenditures of federal, state, and local funds, including actual personnel expenditures and actual nonpersonnel expenditures, disaggregated by the source of funds. The data must be reported for every LEA and public school in the state. These data have not been reported for LEAs and public schools in the past. Based on draft guidance issued by ED, SEAs and LEAs may delay reporting per-pupil expenditures until they issue report cards for the 2018-2019 school year. However, if an LEA decides to delay the reporting of per-pupil expenditures, the SEA and its LEAs are required to provide information on their report cards for the 2017-2018 school year about the steps they are taking to provide such information on the 2018-2019 school year report card.", "While this new reporting requirement does not require schools to disaggregate the receipt of funds under Title I-E eligible federal programs, it will, for the first time, detail the per-pupil expenditure of aggregate federal funds that are allocated or used at the school level. If LEAs participating in the Title I-E authority include Title I-A funds in their agreement, it may be possible to get a sense of whether the allocation of federal funds at individual schools is changing under weighted student funding systems that meet the requirements of Title I-E."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Might the weighted student funding authority represent a model for a major change in strategy for Title I-A and other potentially affected ESEA programs?", "paragraphs": ["In participating LEAs that include Title I-A funds in their weighted student funding systems, Title I-A would be transformed from a \"school-based\" program to an \"individualized grant.\" The Title I-E flexibility authority arguably represents a substantial change in the basic strategy of Title I-A, and to a lesser extent other potentially affected federal education programs. As discussed earlier, from its beginning in 1965 Title I-A has been primarily a school-based program. Funds are to be allocated only to the relatively high-poverty schools in each participating LEA. Within those recipient schools, Title I-A funds are to be used only to serve the lowest-achieving students unless the school meets the 40% low-income threshold, in which case they can be used to serve all students. The level of Title I-A funding per student served is relatively modest, and it is implicitly assumed that such amounts are sufficient to provide substantial services only if combined for relatively large numbers of students from low-income families in a school. Further, there are a number of requirements regarding the authorized uses of Title I-A funds to meet the special educational needs of educationally disadvantaged students in participating schools.", "The weighted student funding pilot represents a very different approach. First, while academic outcome accountability and civil rights requirements will continue to apply to all public schools in states receiving Title I-A funds, and fiscal accountability requirements will continue to apply to certain \"high-poverty\" schools within LEAs, other requirements for targeting schools or uses of funds will be waived. Administrative burdens would be reduced, but so would a number of potentially important requirements for targeting services on students with the greatest educational needs.", "Title I-A and other federal program funds would be combined with state and local funds into weighted grant amounts that would be dispersed among all public schools in the LEA, and that would follow students if they transfer among schools in the LEA (though possibly with a time lag). This is a very different approach from traditional Title I-A programs. The \"individualized grant\" approach embodied in the Title I-E authority might serve as a model that could, in the future, be expanded if desired through congressional action to include students attending public schools in other LEAs of the same state, or possibly even eligible students enrolled in private schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Do the provisions of Title I-E provide adequate assurance that the purposes of the eligible ESEA programs will be met by participating LEAs?", "paragraphs": ["The Title I-E flexibility authority provides for the waiver of a wide range of requirements regarding the allocation of Title I-A funds to schools, and regarding the authorized uses of funds under all of the eligible federal programs. However, participating LEAs must ensure that the purposes of the eligible federal programs included in their weighted student funding systems are met. This may be challenging for participating LEAs, at least initially, as more federal funding from non-Title I-A programs is provided to the school level as opposed to being retained and controlled at the LEA level and as Title I-A funds are potentially used for the first time in schools that had not previously received the funds.
