{"id": "RL34402", "title": "New Markets Tax Credit: An Introduction", "released_date": "2016-08-31T00:00:00", "summary": ["The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) is a non-refundable tax credit intended to encourage private capital investment in eligible, impoverished, low-income communities. NMTCs are allocated by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), a bureau within the United States Department of the Treasury, under a competitive application process. Investors who make qualified equity investments reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming the credit. The NMTC program, enacted in 2000, is currently authorized to allocate $61 billion through the end of 2019. To date, the CDFI has made 912 awards totaling $43.5 billion in NMTC allocation authority. Demand for NMTC allocations has exceeded total allocations each award round\u2014with the 2014 allocation round awarding $3.5 billion in allocation authority from applications requesting approximately $19.9 billion in NMTCs.", "The most recent program extension was made in the 114th Congress. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113) extended the NMTC authorization through 2019 at $3.5 billion per year.", "This report will be updated as warranted by legislative changes."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) was enacted by the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-554 ) to provide an incentive to stimulate investment in low-income communities (LIC). The original allocation authority eligible for the NMTC program was $15 billion from 2001 to 2007. Congress, subsequently, has increased the total allocation authority to $61 billion and extended the program through 2019. Qualified investment groups apply to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) for an allocation of the New Markets Tax Credit. The investment group, known as a Community Development Entity (CDE), seeks taxpayers to make qualifying equity investments in the CDE. The CDE then makes equity investments in low-income communities and low-income community businesses, all of which must be qualified. After the CDE is awarded a tax credit allocation, the CDE is authorized to offer the tax credits to private equity investors in the CDE.", "The tax credit value is 39% of the cost of the qualified equity investment and is claimed over a seven-year credit allowance period. In each of the first three years of the investment, the investor receives a credit equal to 5% of the total amount paid for the stock or capital interest at the time of purchase. For the final four years, the value of the credit is 6% annually. Investors must retain their interest in a qualified equity investment throughout the seven-year period.", "The 114 th Congress extended the NMTC program authorization with the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113 ), which extended the NMTC authorization through 2019 at $3.5 billion per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Components", "paragraphs": ["The process by which the NMTC affects eligible low-income communities involves multiple agents and steps.

For example, the Treasury Department's CDFI reviews NMTC applicants submitted by CDEs, issues tax credit authority to those CDEs deemed most qualified, and plays a significant role in program compliance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Community Development Entities (CDE)", "paragraphs": ["A CDE is a domestic corporation or partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of loans, investment funding, or financial counseling in low-income communities (LICs). To become certified as a CDE, an organization must submit an application to the CDFI that demonstrates that it meets three criteria: (1) it is a domestic corporation or partnership duly organized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, (2) it has a primary mission of serving low-income communities, and (3) it maintains accountability to residents of these low-income communities. A CDE may demonstrate meeting the third criterion by filling at least 20% of either its advisory or its governing board positions with representatives of low-income communities.", "Only CDEs may apply for the NMTC. Upon receipt of NMTC allocation, CDEs attract investors using the credits. While both for-profit and nonprofit CDEs may apply for the NMTC, only for-profit CDEs may pass the NMTC on to investors. To ensure that projects are selected on economic merit, nonprofit CDEs awarded NMTCs must transfer their allocations to for-profit subsidiaries prior to offering NMTCs to investors.", "As Figure 1 illustrates, CDEs play a critical role in a properly functioning NMTC process. CDEs are the intermediaries between the potential low-income community investments and the CDFI during the application process.

As defined by the criterion above, about 39% of the nation's census tracts covering nearly 36% of the U.S. population are eligible for the NMTC. Additionally, designated targeted populations may be treated as low-income communities. Further, the definition of a low-income community includes census tracts with low populations and census tracts within high migration rural counties.

Once the investor begins claiming the NMTC, the credit can be recaptured if the CDE (1) ceases to be a CDE, (2) fails to use substantially all of the proceeds for eligible purposes, or (3) redeems the investment principal.", "Almost all qualified equity investments (QEI) in low-income communities or serving low-income populations could be eligible to receive the NMTC. These eligible investments are referred to as qualified low-income community investments (QLICIs). QLICIs are categorized in four ways: (1) loans or investments to qualified active low-income community businesses (QALICB), (2) the provision of financial counseling, (3) loans or investments in other CDEs, and (4) the purchase of loans from other CDEs.

In addition, priority points are available for addressing the statutory priorities of investing in unrelated entities and having demonstrated a track record of serving disadvantaged businesses or communities. The application is reviewed and scored to identify those applicants most likely to have the greatest community development impact and ranked in descending order of aggregate score.", "Tax credit allocations are then awarded based upon the aggregate ranking, until all of the allocation authority is exhausted. In each of the completed NMTC rounds, significantly more CDEs applied for allocations than were able to receive allocations. For example, in the most recent completed allocation round (2014) nearly 29% of applicants received allocations. Additionally, allocation authority of $19.9 billion was requested, compared with the $3.5 billion in allocation authority available.", "Prior to receiving the authority to offer tax credits to investors, every CDE allocatee must sign an allocation agreement.

As Congress debates reauthorization of the NMTC, the following policy considerations could be pertinent to any consideration of these bills.", "The NMTC is primarily intended to encourage private capital investment in eligible low-income communities. However, the source of the investment funds has implications for the effectiveness of the program in achieving its objective. From an economic perspective, the impact of the NMTC would be greatest in the case where the investment represents new investment in the U.S. economy that would not have occurred in the absence of the program. Conversely, the impact of the NMTC is diminished to the extent the tax credit is applied to investment that would have otherwise occurred or been funded by a shift in investment from more productive alternatives. ", "To date, only one study has empirically assessed the question of whether NMTC investment is funded through shifted investment or whether it represents new investment. The findings of the study suggest that corporate investment represented a shift in investment location. In contrast, the authors concluded that a portion of individual NMTC investment, roughly $641 million, represented new investment. ", "Although important, understanding the source of NMTC investments alone is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of the NMTC. A comprehensive review of the program would require an accounting of both the social and economic costs and benefits of the NMTC, an undertaking which may pose considerable challenges. For example, this would include examining the efficiency and opportunity costs of the NMTC investments, while a comprehensive accounting of the NMTC benefits would need to identify and value \"spillovers\" such as its effect on neighboring businesses and communities. ", "The most comprehensive evaluation of the NMTC, to date, was conducted by the Urban Institute under contract from the CDFI Fund. While the evaluation's final report found project level activity consistent with the NMTC achieving program goals, it was unable to generalize its findings to the broader universe of NMTC activity or census tract level outcomes due to evaluation design limitations. The report noted it was an initial effort to a more robust research plan that has not yet been implemented. ", "Others, notably GAO, have recommended that the NMTC be simplified by converting the NMTC into a grant program. This option may be able to deliver the same level of incentive with lower cost to the government, as investors do not generally \"buy\" tax credits at face value\u2500allowing a smaller grant to provide a similar level of incentive. Specifically, tax credit markets historically set a price of 70 to 80 cents per dollar of tax credit, with lower valuations in recent years due to tight credit markets and decreased corporate profits. ", "A grant option, however, likely provides a lesser incentive for investors to invest in NMTC projects, as they may not be the beneficiary of the incentive. If this occurs, improving the access to capital in low-income communities (an NMTC program goal) would be more difficult. Further, a grant program may complicate existing mechanisms designed to ensure the NMTC is used for intended purposes, as CDEs are likely less capitalized than investors and the possible removal of IRS authority to recapture benefits (as the NMTC would no longer be a tax program).", "An additional issue is the geographic distribution of NMTC activity. Initial concerns focused on distinctions between urban and rural NMTC activity and have been addressed through legislation. Further, NMTC activity has occurred in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. However, the distribution of NMTC activity appears concentrated in a few states\u2500\u2500with the 10 states with the highest activity accounting for just over 50% of all NMTC activity. In contrast, the 25 states with the least NMTC activity account for less than 14% of all NMTC activity. The current distribution of activity is not likely to reflect the distribution of low-income populations and may raise questions concerning the equity of the NMTC.", "Finally, the NMTC is one of several programs designed to improve conditions in low-income communities. In a 2004 assessment of the NMTC, the Office of Management and Budget noted that the goal of the NMTC overlaps that of several other tax credits and numerous programs administered by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Commerce. Given this overlap and the desire to target federal funds to their most productive uses, it follows that information on the performance of the NMTC relative to other programs with a similar goal would be of use. To date, however, no comparative, empirical study of this nature has been undertaken."], "subsections": []}]}}
