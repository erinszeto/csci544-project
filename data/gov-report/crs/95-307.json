Its total appropriation increased approximately 31.0% in 10 years\u2014FY2004, $5,652.0 million; FY2008, $6,084.0 million; and the FY2013 request, $7,373.1 million. (See Figure 1 .) The FY2013 budget request for the NSF of $7,373.1 million represents a 4.8% increase ($340.0 million) above the FY2012 estimate of $7,033.1 million. (When inflation is taken into account, NSF's budget increased 7.3% in the past 10 years.) Under President Barack Obama's Strategy for American Innovation, the Administration proposed doubling the federal investment in basic research over a period of 10 years relative to FY2006 levels. However the recommendation for doubling funding for the NSF and other targeted agencies does not appear achievable considering the focus on the nation's current economic situation, debt, and budget deficit. There has been significant pressure on cutting discretionary funding. The Administration has proposed that the FY2013 request will be an installment toward a doubling effort. ", "NSF has identified several priorities in the FY2013 request, including cyberinfrastructure framework for 21 st century science and engineering; integrated NSF support promoting interdisciplinary research and education; advanced manufacturing; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education; research at the interface of the biological, mathematical, and physical sciences; enhancing access to the radio spectrum; widening implementation and demonstration of evidenced-based reforms, and clean energy. NSF's core commitment to developing a qualified and diverse scientific workforce continues as a priority. In the FY2013 budget, the agency will measure the percentage of colleges and universities supported through NSF undergraduate programs to determine the degree that they use proven instructional practices. The agency has set a goal of 80.0% for this measure. ", "The FY2013 budget request provides support for seven major directorates and other programs and activity accounts.

One continuing question has focused on the process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle. In a management report on major projects, NSF contends that because of the changing nature of science and technology, it is necessary to have the flexibility of reconsidering facilities at the various stages of development. In addition, NSF asserts that it must be able to respond, effectively, to possible changes in interagency participation, international and cooperative agreements, or co-funding for major facilities. NSF maintains that while some \"concepts\" may evolve into major research projects, others may prove infeasible for project support.", "In February 2008, NSF released its third annual Facility Plan . The 2008 Facility Plan covers readiness stage projects through those projects that are in the process of completion. The Facility Plan describes NSF's goals and strategies for incorporating the existing approaches and practices into a system for selecting, managing, and overseeing large facility projects to make certain that a large facility is both constructed properly and is the appropriate facility to build. All projects seeking funding in the MREFC move through a sequence of increasingly detailed stages and assessments in order to be considered for construction support.", "Several pieces of competitiveness legislation have been introduced during the 112 th Congress to strengthen science and mathematics education. Concerns have been expressed about the nation's continued ability to compete in world markets and to produce a scientific and technical workforce that would ensure economic prosperity and military capability. A priority of the NSF is to advance the productivity of research for students and teachers and to increase the number of U.S. students pursuing scientific and technical disciplines. However, the FY2013 budget request has proposed reductions for some science education programs. The America COMPETES Act authorized increased funding for selected science and mathematics education programs, and the establishment of some new programs. Several of these programs did not receive the level of funding in the budget request. Questions have been raised as to whether the NSF can effectively continue in its explicit mission and responsibility to improve science and mathematics education.", "On October 18, 2010, Subra Suresh was sworn in as the 13 th director of the NSF.
