In so doing, Congress sought to strike a delicate balance between national security interests and personal privacy rights. Subsequent legislation expanded federal laws dealing with foreign intelligence gathering to address physical searches, pen registers and trap and trace devices, and access to certain business records. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, P.L. 107-56, made significant changes to some of these provisions. Further amendments were included in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, P.L. 107-108, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, P.L. 107-296, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, P.L. 108-458, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, P.L. 109-177, and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, P.L. 109-178. In addressing international terrorism or espionage, the same factual situation may be the focus of both criminal investigations and foreign intelligence collection efforts. Some of the changes in FISA under these public laws are intended, in part, to facilitate information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence elements. In its Final Report, the 9/11 Commission noted that the removal of the pre-9/11 \"wall\" between intelligence and law enforcement \"has opened up new opportunities for cooperative action within the FBI.\"", "On May 17, 2002, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued a memorandum opinion and order written by the then Presiding Judge of the court, and concurred in by all of the other judges then on the court. The unclassified opinion and order were provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to a letter from Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley, and Senator Specter, who released them to the public on August 22, 2002. In its decision, the FISC considered a motion by the U.S. Department of Justice \"to vacate the minimization and 'wall' procedures in all cases now or ever before the Court, including this Court's adoption of the Attorney General's July 1995 intelligence sharing procedures, which are not consistent with new intelligence sharing procedures submitted for approval with this motion.\" The FISC granted the Department's motion, but modified part of what it saw as proposed minimization procedures. This decision was not appealed directly, but the Department of Justice did seek review of an FISC order granting as modified an application for electronic surveillance of an agent of a foreign power and for an FISC order renewing that surveillance, both subject to restrictions based on the May 17 memorandum opinion and order by the FISC. The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review reversed and remanded the FISC orders on November 18, 2002. This report will examine the detailed statutory structure provided by FISA and related provisions of E.O. 12333, and will discuss the decisions of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. It will be updated as subsequent changes require."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed P.L. 107-56 , the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act or the USA PATRIOT Act. Among its provisions are a number which impacted or amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 et seq. , an act which provides a statutory structure for the use of electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen registers, trap and trace devices, and orders requiring production of tangible things within the United States to gather foreign intelligence information or to assist in specified types of investigations.", "The changes made to FISA by P.L. 107-56 were far reaching. For example, the law expanded the number of United States district court judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and provided for roving or multipoint electronic surveillance authority under FISA. It amended FISA provisions with respect to pen registers and trap and trace devices, and substantially expanded the reach of the business records provisions to provide a mechanism for production of any tangible thing pursuant to a FISA court order. The amended language changed the certification demanded of a federal officer applying for a FISA order for electronic surveillance or a physical search from requiring a certification that the purpose of the surveillance or physical search is to obtain foreign intelligence information to requiring certification that a significant purpose of the surveillance or search is to obtain foreign intelligence information. As implemented, this has made it possible for FISA to be used where the primary purpose of the investigation is criminal investigation, so long as a significant foreign intelligence purpose is also present. FISA, as amended, also affords a private right of action to persons aggrieved by inappropriate use or disclosure of information gathered in or derived from a FISA surveillance or physical search or through the use of a pen register or trap and trace device. Of the amendments made by the USA PATRIOT Act, all but the section which increased the number of judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court were set by that Act to sunset on December 31, 2005. P.L. 109-160 and P.L. 109-170 extended the sunset of certain FISA provisions, among others, to February 3, 2006, and March 10, 2006, respectively. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, P.L. 109-177 , replaced the sunset provisions of P.L. 107-56 , as amended, with new provisions extending the application of the affected amendments to December 31, 2009. Amendments to FISA were also made by the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, P.L. 107-108 ; the Homeland Security Act of 2002, P.L. 107-296 ; and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004, P.L. 108-458 .", "In the 109 th Congress, two measures, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, P.L. 109-177 , and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, P.L. 109-178 , made significant changes to FISA. P.L. 109-177 extended the duration of FISA electronic surveillance, physical searches, and pen register and trap and trace devices. It also added requirements to applications for production of certain sensitive types of records, and expanded the requirements for applications for FISA orders for production of tangible things and for orders authorizing such production. This Act created a new petition review pool within the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to address challenges to such production orders or to related nondisclosure orders, and established a detailed procedure for review of such orders. Further, it directed the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice to perform a comprehensive audit of the effectiveness and use, including improper or illegal use, of the investigative authority under title V of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq. , for fiscal years 2002-2006. The measure modified the requirements for multipoint electronic surveillance under FISA. It also expanded congressional oversight of FISA electronic surveillance, physical searches, and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices. P.L. 109-178 amends the procedures for judicial review of production and nondisclosure orders under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861.", "On May 17, 2002, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued an opinion and order written by the then Presiding Judge of the court, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. All of the other judges then on the FISC concurred in the order. The opinion was provided by the current Presiding Judge of the FISC, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, to the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to a July 31 letter from Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley and Senator Specter. On August 22, 2002, the unclassified opinion was released to the public by Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley and Senator Specter.", "In the memorandum opinion and order, the FISC considered a motion by the U.S. Department of Justice \"to vacate the minimization and 'wall' procedures in all cases now or ever before the Court, including this Court's adoption of the Attorney General's July 1995 intelligence sharing procedures, which are not consistent with new intelligence sharing procedures submitted for approval with this motion.\" In its memorandum and accompanying order, the FISC granted the Department of Justice's motion, but modified the second and third paragraphs of section II.B of the proposed minimization procedures.", "The FISC's May 17 th memorandum opinion and order were not appealed directly. However, the Justice Department sought review in the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review (Court of Review) of an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance of an agent of a foreign power, subject to restrictions flowing from the May 17 th decision, and of an FISC order renewing that surveillance subject to the same restrictions. The Court of Review reversed and remanded the FISC orders. This opinion, the first issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence SurveillanceCourt of Review since its creation in 1978, was also released to the public. This report will provide background on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, discuss its statutory framework, and review these two decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Investigations for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence give rise to a tension between the Government's legitimate national security interests and the protection of privacy interests. The stage was set for legislation to address these competing concerns in part by Supreme Court decisions on related issues. In Katz v. United States , 389 U.S. 347 (1967), the Court held that the protections of the Fourth Amendment extended to circumstances involving electronic surveillance of oral communications without physical intrusion. The Katz Court stated, however, that its holding did not extend to cases involving national security. In United States v. United States District Court , 407 U.S. 297 (1972) (the Keith case), the Court regarded Katz as \"implicitly recogniz[ing] that the broad and unsuspected governmental incursions into conversational privacy which electronic surveillance entails necessitate the application of Fourth Amendment safeguards.\" Mr. Justice Powell, writing for the Keith Court, framed the matter before the Court as follows:", "The issue before us is an important one for the people of our country and their Government. It involves the delicate question of the President's power, acting through the Attorney General, to authorize electronic surveillance in internal security matters without prior judicial approval. Successive Presidents for more than one-quarter of a century have authorized such surveillance in varying degrees, without guidance from the Congress or a definitive decision of this Court. This case brings the issue here for the first time. Its resolution is a matter of national concern, requiring sensitivity both to the Government's right to protect itself from unlawful subversion and attack and to the citizen's right to be secure in his privacy against unreasonable Government intrusion.", "The Court held that, in the case of intelligence gathering involving domestic security surveillance, prior judicial approval was required to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. Justice Powell emphasized that the case before it \"require[d] no judgment on the scope of the President's surveillance power with respect to the activities of foreign powers, within or without the country.\" The Court expressed no opinion as to \"the issues which may be involved with respect to activities of foreign powers or their agents.\" However, the guidance which the Court provided in Keith with respect to national security surveillance in a domestic context to some degree presaged the approach Congress was to take in foreign intelligence surveillance. The Keith Court observed in part:", "...We recognize that domestic surveillance may involve different policy and practical considerations from the surveillance of \"ordinary crime.\" The gathering of security intelligence is often long range and involves the interrelation of various sources and types of information. The exact targets of such surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in surveillance operations against many types of crime specified in Title III [of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq. ]. Often, too, the emphasis of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the Government's preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency. Thus, the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more conventional types of crimes. Given these potential distinctions between Title III criminal surveillances and those involving domestic security, Congress may wish to consider protective standards for the latter which differ from those already prescribed for specified crimes in Title III. Different standards may be compatible with the Fourth Amendment if they are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of Government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens. For the warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of citizen rights deserving protection.... It may be that Congress, for example, would judge that the application and affidavit showing probable cause need not follow the exact requirements of \u00a7 2518 but should allege other circumstances more appropriate to domestic security cases; that the request for prior court authorization could, in sensitive cases, be made to any member of a specially designated court...; and that the time and reporting requirements need not be so strict as those in \u00a7 2518. The above paragraph does not, of course, attempt to guide the congressional judgment but rather to delineate the present scope of our own opinion. We do not attempt to detail the precise standards for domestic security warrants any more than our decision in Katz sought to set the refined requirements for the specified criminal surveillances which now constitute Title III. We do hold, however, that prior judicial approval is required for the type of domestic surveillance involved in this case and that such approval may be made in accordance with such reasonable standards as the Congress may prescribe.", "Court of appeals decisions following Keith met more squarely the issue of warrantless electronic surveillance in the context of foreign intelligence gathering. In United States v. Brown , 484 F.2d 418 (5 th Cir. 1973), cert. denied , 415 U.S. 960 (1974), the Fifth Circuit upheld the legality of a warrantless wiretap authorized by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence purposes where the conversation of Brown, an American citizen, was incidentally overheard. The Third Circuit in United States v. Butenko , 494 F.2d 593 (3 rd Cir. 1974), cert. denied sub nom, Ivanov v. United States , 419 U.S. 881 (1974), concluded that warrantless electronic surveillance was lawful, violating neither Section 605 of the Communications Act nor the Fourth Amendment, if its primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence information. In its plurality decision in Zweibon v. Mitchell , 516 F.2d 594, 613-14 (D.C. Cir. 1975), cert. denied , 425 U.S. 944 (1976), the District of Columbia Circuit took a somewhat different view in a case involving a warrantless wiretap of a domestic organization that was not an agent of a foreign power or working in collaboration with a foreign power. Finding that a warrant was required in such circumstances, the plurality also noted that \"an analysis of the policies implicated by foreign security surveillance indicates that, absent exigent circumstances, all warrantless electronic surveillance is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional.\"", "With the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), P.L. 95-511 , Title I, October 25, 1978, 92 Stat. 1796, codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 et seq. , Congress sought to strike a delicate balance between these interests when the gathering of foreign intelligence involved the use of electronic surveillance. Collection of foreign intelligence information through electronic surveillance is now governed by FISA and E.O. 12333. This report will examine the provisions of FISA which deal with electronic surveillance in the foreign intelligence context, as well as those applicable to physical searches, the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices under FISA, and access to business records and other tangible things for foreign intelligence purposes.

In a memorandum and order written by the then Presiding Judge, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, issued on the last day of his tenure on the FISC, and concurred in by all of the judges then sitting on the FISC, the FISC granted the Department of Justice (DOJ) motion with significant modifications to section II.B. of what the FISC characterized as the proposed minimization procedures. The court required a continuation of the Attorney General's 1995 minimization procedures, as subsequently modified by the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, and preservation of a \"wall\" procedure to maintain separation between FBI criminal investigators and DOJ prosecutors and raw FISA investigation data regarding the same facts or individuals, so as to prevent these law enforcement personnel from becoming \"de facto partners in FISA surveillances and searches,\" while permitting extensive sharing of information between such investigations.", "The FISC was particularly concerned with those aspects of section II.B. of the proposed procedures which would permit criminal prosecutors and law enforcement officers to initiate, direct or control electronic surveillance or physical searches under FISA, with an eye towards law enforcement objectives, rather than foreign intelligence information gathering. The FISC set the stage for its analysis by recounting a significant number of past instances where FISA applications had included false, inaccurate or misleading information regarding information sharing or compliance with \"wall\" procedures in FBI affidavits or, in one case, in a statutorily required certification by the FBI Director; and past occasions where the FISC's orders had been violated in regard to information sharing and unauthorized dissemination of FISA information to criminal investigators and prosecutors. While both the FBI's and DOJ's Offices of Professional Responsibility had been investigating these incidents for over a year at the time of the writing of the opinion, the court had not been advised of any explanations as to how such misrepresentations had occurred. The court's dissatisfaction with these irregularities formed a backdrop for its analysis of the motion and applications before it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the Memorandum Opinion and Order", "paragraphs": ["Its analysis was based upon its reading of the statutory language and premised, in part, on the fact that the USA PATRIOT Act had not amended the provisions of FISA dealing with minimization requirements, although other FISA provisions had been modified. The minimization provisions with respect to both electronic surveillance and physical searches under FISA continue to be designed to \"minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of non-publicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons, consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information .\" The court regarded the standard it applied to the proposed procedures before it as \"mandated in [50 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1805(a)(4) and \u00a7 1824(a)(4), which state that 'the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures under \u00a7 101(h), [\u00a7 1801(h) and \u00a71824(4)] of the act.'\"", "In its memorandum opinion, the FISC first discussed the court's jurisdiction, noting that the text of the statute \"leaves little doubt that the collection of foreign intelligence information is the raison d ' etre for the FISA.\" The court found support for this conclusion in a review of pertinent provisions of the act. It found further support in E.O. 12139 and E.O. 12949, which give the Attorney General authority to approve the filing of applications for orders for electronic surveillances and physical searches and authorize the Director of the FBI and other senior executives to make required certifications under FISA for the \"purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information.\" The FISC therefore concluded that its jurisdiction was limited to granting FISA orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches for the collection of foreign intelligence information under the standards and procedures prescribed in the act. In reaching this conclusion, the FISC, in a footnote, characterized the issue before it as \"whether the FISA authorizes electronic surveillance and physical searches primarily for law enforcement purposes so long as the Government also has 'a significant' foreign intelligence purpose.\" Rejecting the approach taken by the Government in its supplemental brief in the case, the Court stated that \"its decision is not based on the issue of its jurisdiction but on the interpretation of minimization procedures.\" Maintaining its focus upon the minimization procedures, the FISC also declined to reach the question raised by the Attorney General \"whether FISA may be used primarily for law enforcement purposes.\"", "The court also regarded the scope of its findings regarding minimization as applicable \"only to communications concerning U.S. persons as defined in \u00a7 1801(i) of the act: U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens whether or not they are named targets in the electronic surveillance and physical searches.\" It emphasized that its opinion was not applicable to communications of foreign powers as defined under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), or to non-U.S. persons.", "After stating its continued approval of the \"Standard Minimization Procedures for a U.S. Person Agent of a Foreign Power,\" the court turned its attention to two sections of supplementary minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General on March 6, 2002, regarding \"II. Intelligence sharing procedures concerning the Criminal Division,\" and \"III. Intelligence sharing procedures concerning a USAO [U.S. Attorney's Office].\" The FISC regarded these procedures as minimization procedures as that term is defined under FISA by virtue of the fact that they were adopted by the Attorney General and were \"designed to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons.\" Therefore, these procedures were measured against the standard for minimization procedures set forth in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1805(a)(4) and 1824(a)(4):", "... The operative language of each section to be applied by the Court provides that minimization procedures must be reasonably designed in light of their purpose and technique, and mean\u2014", "specific procedures, which shall be adopted by the Attorney General, that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance, [search] to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information. \u00a71801(h)(1) and \u00a71821(4)(A).", "The court then reviewed the minimization procedures upon which it had been relying prior to the application before it, to wit, the Attorney General's 1995 \"Procedures for Contacts between the FBI and Criminal Division Concerning FI [Foreign Intelligence] and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations,\"as augmented by the Attorney General in January 2000 and expanded further by the Deputy Attorney General in August 2001. The FISC indicated that these procedures permitted the following \"substantial consultation and coordination\":", "a. reasonable indications of significant federal crimes in FISA cases are to be reported to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice;", "b. [t]he Criminal Division may then consult with the FBI and give guidance to the FBI aimed at preserving the option of criminal prosecution, but may not direct or control the FISA investigation toward law enforcement objectives;", "c. the Criminal Division may consult further with the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office about such FISA cases;", "d. on a monthly basis senior officials of the FBI provide briefings to senior officials of the Justice Department, including OIPR [Office of Intelligence Policy and Review] and the Criminal Division, about intelligence cases, including those in which FISA is or may be used;", "e. all FBI 90-day interim reports and annual reports of counterintelligence investigations, including FISA cases, are being provided to the Criminal Division, and must now contain a section explicitly identifying any possible federal criminal violations;", "f. all requests for initiation or renewal of FISA authority must now contain a section devoted explicitly to identifying any possible federal criminal violations ;", "g. the FBI is to provide monthly briefings directly to the Criminal Division concerning all counterintelligence investigations in which there is a reasonable indication of a significant federal crime;", "h. prior to each briefing the Criminal Division is to identify (from FBI reports) those intelligence investigations about which it requires additional information and the FBI is to provide the information requested; and", "i. since September 11, 2001, the requirement that OIPR be present at all meetings and discussions between the FBI and Criminal Division involving certain FISA cases has been suspended; instead, OIPR reviews a daily briefing book to inform itself and this Court about those discussions.", "The FISC indicated further that it \"routinely approved the use of information screening 'walls' proposed by the government in its applications\" to maintain both the appearance and the fact that FISA surveillances and searches were not being used \" sub rosa for criminal investigations.\" In March 2000, September 2000, and March 2001, the FISC was advised by the Department of Justice of a significant number of erroneous statements or omissions of material facts in FISA applications, almost all of which involved misstatements or omissions as to information sharing and unauthorized disseminations to criminal investigators and prosecutors. Although the FBI and the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility had been investigating the circumstances involved in these misstatements and omissions for over a year, as of the date of the opinion, the court had not been advised of the reasons for these erroneous statements. The court responded to these concerns in 2001 by instituting supervisory measures to assess compliance with \"wall\" procedures.", "In the case before the FISC, the government moved that all \"wall\" procedures be eliminated in international terrorism surveillances and physical searches under FISA. The FISC indicated that the new 2002 procedures proposed by the Attorney General would apply to two types of cases in which \" FISA is the only effective tool available to both counterintelligence and criminal investigators\" (emphasis supplied)\u2014those involving overlapping investigations (which the court described as cases, usually international terrorism cases, in which separate intelligence and criminal investigations of the same FISA target who is a U.S. person are conducted by different FBI agents, where separation can easily be maintained) and those involving overlapping interests (i.e., cases in which one investigation of a U.S. person FISA target is conducted by a team of FBI agents with both intelligence and criminal interests \"usually involving espionage and similar cases in which separation is impractical\"). In both types of investigations, the FISC indicated that the 2002 proposed minimization procedures provided authority for \"extensive consultations between the FBI and criminal prosecutors 'to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against actual or potential attack, sabotage, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers and their agents....'\" Such consultation is expressly provided for in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1806(k)(1) and 1825(k)(1).", "Under the proposed minimization procedures, those consultations would include providing prosecutors with access to \"all information\" developed in FBI counterintelligence investigations, including through FISA, among other information. Section II.B. of the proposed minimization techniques would authorize criminal prosecutors to \"consult extensively and provide advice and recommendations to intelligence officials about 'all issues necessary to the ability of the United States to investigate or protect against foreign attack, sabotage, terrorism, and clandestine intelligence activities.'\" The FISC was particularly concerned about the authority given criminal prosecutors under Section II.B. \"to advise FBI intelligence officials concerning ' the initiation, operation, continuation, or expansion of FISA searches or surveillance .'\" The court regarded this provision as \"designed to use this Court's orders to enhance criminal investigation and prosecution, consistent with the government's interpretation of the recent amendments that FISA may now be 'used primarily for a law enforcement purpose.'\" Under section III of the proposed procedures, U.S. attorneys are given the authority to engage in consultations to the same extent as the Criminal Division of DOJ under parts II.A. and II.B. in cases involving international terrorism. The FISC interpreted these procedures as giving criminal prosecutors \"a significant role directing FISA surveillances and searches from start to finish in counterintelligence cases involving overlapping intelligence and criminal investigations or interests, guiding them to criminal prosecution.\"", "In light of the court's past experience with FISA searches and surveillances, the FISC found the proposed procedures to be \"designed to enhance the acquisition, retention and dissemination of evidence for law enforcement purposes, instead of being consistent with the need of the United States to 'obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information ' (emphasis added [by the FISC]) as mandated in \u00a7 1801(h) and \u00a7 1821(4).\" The court regarded the procedures as, in effect, an effort by the government to amend FISA's definition of minimization procedures in ways that Congress had not and to substitute FISA for the electronic surveillance requirements of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq. , and for the search warrant requirements in Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court found this unacceptable. Nor was the court persuaded by the government's contention that the 1995 procedures' prohibition against criminal prosecutors \"directing or controlling\" FISA cases should be revoked. \"If criminal prosecutors direct both the intelligence and criminal investigations, or a single investigation having combined interests, coordination becomes subordination of both investigations or interests to law enforcement objectives.\"", "The FISC stated:", "Advising FBI intelligence officials on the initiation, operation, continuation or expansion of FISA surveillances and searches of U.S. persons means that criminal prosecutors will tell the FBI when to use FISA (perhaps when they lack probable cause for a Title III electronic surveillance), what techniques to use, what information to look for, what information to keep as evidence and when use of FISA can cease because there is enough evidence to arrest and prosecute. The 2002 minimization procedures give the Department's criminal prosecutors every legal advantage conceived by Congress to be used by U.S. intelligence agencies to collect foreign intelligence information, ... based on a standard that the U.S. person is only using or about to use the places to be surveilled or searched, without any notice to the target unless arrested and prosecuted, and, if prosecuted, no adversarial discovery of the FISA applications and warrants. All of this may be done by use of procedures intended to minimize collection of U.S. person information, consistent with the need of the United States to obtain and produce foreign intelligence information. If direction of counterintelligence cases involving the use of highly intrusive FISA surveillances and searches by criminal prosecutors is necessary to obtain and produce foreign intelligence information, it is yet to be explained to the Court.", "Having found section II.B. of the proposed minimization procedures inconsistent with the statutory standard for minimization procedures under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801(h) and 1821(4), the court substituted its own language in place of the second and third paragraphs of II.B. as submitted by the Attorney General. The substitute language permitted consultation between the FBI, the Criminal Division of DOJ, and the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review of DOJ (OIPR) \"to coordinate their efforts to investigate or protect against foreign attack or other grave hostile acts, sabotage, international terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or [agents of foreign powers],\" so that the goals and objectives of both the intelligence and law enforcement investigations or interests may be achieved. However, it prohibited law enforcement officials from making recommendations to intelligence officials regarding initiation, operation, continuation, or expansion of FISA surveillances and searches. In addition, the substitute language foreclosed law enforcement officials from directing or controlling the use of FISA procedures to enhance criminal prosecution; nor was advice intended to preserve the option of criminal prosecution to be permitted to inadvertently result in the Criminal Division directing or controlling an investigation involving FISA surveillance or physical searches to achieve law enforcement objectives. While direct consultation and coordination were permitted, the substitute language required OIPR to be invited to all such consultations and, where OIPR was unable to attend, the language required OIPR to be apprized forthwith in writing of the substance of the consultations, so that the FISC could be notified at the earliest opportunity.", "In its order accompanying the FISC memorandum opinion, the court held that the proposed minimization procedures, so modified, would be applicable to all future electronic surveillances and physical searches under FISA, subject to the approval of the court in each instance. In this order, the court also adopted a new administrative rule to monitor compliance. The new Rule 11 regarding criminal investigations in FISA cases provided:", "All FISA applications shall include informative descriptions of any ongoing criminal investigations of FISA targets, as well as the substance of any consultations between the FBI and criminal prosecutors at the Department of Justice or a United States Attorney's Office."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Decision of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary", "paragraphs": ["The FISC memorandum opinion and order discussed above were not appealed directly. Rather, the Department of Justice sought review in the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (Court of Review) of an FISC order which authorized electronic surveillance of an agent of a foreign power, but imposed restrictions on the government flowing from the FISC's May 17 th decision, and of an order renewing that surveillance subject to the same restrictions. Because of the electronic surveillance context of these orders, the Court of Review's analysis was cast primarily in terms of such surveillance, although some aspects of its analysis may have broader application to other aspects of FISA. In its first decision ever, the Court of Review, in a lengthy per curiam opinion issued on November 18, 2002, reversed and remanded the FISC orders. In so doing the Court of Review emphasized that the May 17 th decision, although never appealed, was \"the basic decision before us and it [was] its rationale that the government challenge[d].\" After reviewing the briefs of the government and two amici curiae, the American Civil Liberties Union (joined on the brief by the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Center for National Security Studies, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation) and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Court of Review concluded that \"FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, supports the government's position, and that the restrictions imposed by the FISA court are not required by FISA or the Constitution.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the Opinion", "paragraphs": ["The Court of Review began its analysis by articulating its view of the May 17 th FISC decision. The Court of Review stated that the FISC appeared to proceed in its opinion from the assumption that FISA constructed a barrier between counterintelligence/intelligence officials and law enforcement officers in the Executive Branch, but did not support that assumption with any relevant language from the statute. The Court of Review opined that this \"wall\" was implicit in the FISC's \"apparent\" belief that \"it can approve applications for electronic surveillance only if the government's objective is not primarily directed toward criminal prosecution of the foreign agents for their foreign intelligence activity,\" while referencing neither statutory language in FISA nor USA PATRIOT Act amendments, which the government argued altered FISA to permit an application even if criminal prosecution was the primary goal. Instead, the Court of Review noted that the FISC relied upon its statutory authority to approve \"minimization procedures\" in imposing the restrictions at issue.", "The Court of Review stated that the government raised two main arguments: First, DOJ contended that the restriction, recognized by several courts of appeals prior to the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, that FISA could only be used if the government's primary purpose in gathering foreign intelligence information was not criminal prosecution, was not supported by the statutory language or the legislative history of FISA. This argument was not presented to the FISC, but the Court of Review indicated that it could entertain the argument, because proceedings before the FISC and before the Court of Review were ex parte . Second, the government argued that, even if the primary purpose test was appropriate prior to the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, the amendments made by that act eliminated that concept. The government also argued that the FISC's interpretation of the minimization procedures provisions misconstrued those provisions and amounted to \"an end run\" around the USA PATRIOT Act amendments. DOJ argued further that the FISC minimization procedures so intruded into the Department's operations as to be beyond the constitutional authority of Article III judges. Finally, DOJ contended that application of the primary purpose test in a FISA case was not constitutionally compelled under the Fourth Amendment.", "The Court of Review noted that, as enacted in 1978, FISA authorized the grant of an application for electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information if there is probable cause to believe that \"the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,\" and that \"each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\" The reviewing court focused upon the close connection between criminal activity and the definitions of \"agent of a foreign power\" applicable to United States persons contained in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801(b)(2)(A) and (C), to wit: \"any person who 'knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence activities ... which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States,' or 'knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in preparation therefor.'\" The court noted further that FISA defined \"international terrorism\" to mean \"activities that 'involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or any State.'\" \"Sabotage,\" as defined by FISA, covers activities that \"'involve a violation of chapter 105 of [the criminal code] [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2151-2156], or that would involve such a violation if committed against the United States.'\" For purposes of its opinion, the Court of Review described these types of crimes as \"foreign intelligence crimes.\"", "The court observed that, as passed in 1978, 50 U.S.C. \u00a71804 required a national security official of the Executive Branch, usually the FBI Director, to certify that \"the purpose\" of the electronic surveillance under FISA was to obtain foreign intelligence information, and opined that \"it is virtually impossible to read the 1978 FISA to exclude from its purpose the prosecution of foreign intelligence crimes, most importantly because, as we have noted, the definition of an agent of a foreign power\u2014if he or she is a U.S. person\u2014is grounded on criminal conduct.\" It found further support for its view that \"foreign intelligence information\" included evidence of \"foreign intelligence crimes\" from the legislative history as reflected in H.Rept. 95-1283 and S.Rept. 95-701, while acknowledging that the House report also stated that FISA surveillances \"are not primarily for the purpose of gathering evidence of a crime. They are to obtain foreign intelligence information, which when it concerns United States persons must be necessary to important national concerns.\" The Court of Review regarded the latter statement as an observation rather than a proscription.", "The Court of Review saw the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Truong Dinh Hung , 629 F.2d 908 (4 th Cir. 1980), a decision based upon constitutional analysis rather than FISA provisions, as the springboard for the \"primary purpose\" test cases interpreting FISA and upholding FISA surveillances against Fourth Amendment challenges. After reviewing a number of the FISA cases applying the primary purpose test, the Court of Review concluded that a dichotomy between foreign intelligence gathering and criminal investigations implicit in the application of the primary purpose test was not statutorily compelled. The court found that FISA, as originally passed, did not \"preclude or limit the government's use or proposed use of foreign intelligence information, which included evidence of certain kinds of criminal activity, in a criminal prosecution.\" In addition, the Court of Review, relying on arguments of the Department of Justice and the language of subsection 1805(a)(5), interpreted 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1805 of FISA as originally enacted as not contemplating that the [FISC] would inquire into the government's purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information.", "Further, the court rejected the FISC's characterization of the Attorney General's 1995 procedures, as modified and augmented in January 2000 and August 2001, as minimization procedures. These procedures were formally adopted by the FISC as minimization procedures defined in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801(h) and 1821(4) in November 2001, after passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, and were incorporated in all applicable orders and warrants granted since their adoption by the FISC. On March 6, 2002, the Attorney General adopted new \"Intelligence Sharing Procedures,\" intended to supercede prior procedures, to \"allow complete exchange of information and advice between intelligence and law enforcement officials,\" to \"eliminate the 'direction and control' test,\" and to permit \"exchange of advice between the FBI, OIPR, and the Criminal Division regarding 'the initiation, operation, continuation, or expansion of FISA searches or surveillance.\" The following day, the government filed a motion with the FISC advising the court of the Attorney General's adoption of the 2002 procedures, seeking to have that court adopt the new procedures in all matters before the FISC and asking the court to vacate its orders adopting the prior procedures as minimization procedures and imposing \"wall\" procedures in certain types of cases. That motion led to the FISC decision to adopt the 2002 procedures with modifications that was, by reference, before the Court of Review in its November 18, 2002, decision.", "The Court of Review characterized the FISC's adoption of the Justice Department's 1995 procedures, as modified and augmented, as minimization procedures as follows:", "Essentially, the FISA court took portions of the Attorney General's augmented 1995 Procedures\u2014adopted to deal with the primary purpose standard\u2014and imposed them generically as minimization procedures. In doing so, the FISA court erred. It did not provide any constitutional basis for its action\u2014we think there is none\u2014and misconstrued the main statutory provision on which it relied. The court mistakenly categorized the augmented 1995 Procedures as FISA minimization procedures and then compelled the government to utilize a modified version of those procedures in a way that is clearly inconsistent with the statutory purpose.", "The Court of Review interpreted \"minimization procedures\" under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h) to be designed to protect, as far as reasonable, against the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of nonpublic information which is not foreign intelligence information. In light of the Court of Review's interpretation of \"minimization procedures\" under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h), the court found no basis for the FISC's reliance upon that section \"to limit criminal prosecutors' ability to advise FBI intelligence officials on the initiation, operation, continuation, or expansion of FISA surveillances to obtain foreign intelligence information, even if such information includes evidence of a foreign intelligence crime.\"", "In addition, the Court of Review found that the FISC had misconstrued its authority under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805 and misinterpreted the definition of minimization procedures under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h). The Court of Review expressed approbation for the Government's argument that the FISC, in imposing the modified 1995 procedures upon the Department of Justice as minimization procedures, \"may well have exceeded the constitutional bounds that restrict an Article III court. The FISA court asserted authority to govern the internal organization and investigative procedures of the Department of Justice which are the province of the Executive Branch (Article II) and the Congress (Article I).\"", "The Court of Review deemed the FISC's \"refusal ... to consider the legal significance of the Patriot Act's crucial amendments [to be] error.\" The appellate court noted that, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, the requirement in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(a)(7)(B) that the Executive Branch officer certify that \"the purpose\" of the FISA surveillance or physical search was to gather foreign intelligence information had been changed to \"a significant purpose.\" The court noted that floor statements indicated that this would break down traditional barriers between law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering, making it easier for law enforcement to obtain FISA court orders for surveillance or physical searches where the subject of the surveillance \"is both a potential source of valuable intelligence and the potential target of a criminal prosecution.\" The court noted that some Members raised concerns about the Fourth Amendment implications of this language change which permitted the Government to obtain a court order under FISA \"even if the primary purpose is a criminal investigation.\" Interestingly, although the Court of Review did not regard a dichotomy between foreign intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes as necessarily implied by the 1978 version of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(a)(7)(B), the court viewed the statutory change from \"the purpose\" to \"a significant purpose\" in the USA PATRIOT Act as recognizing such a dichotomy.", "The Court of Review disagreed with the FISC interpretation of the consultation authority under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806(k). The Court of Review saw this provision as one which reflected the elimination of barriers between law enforcement and intelligence or counterintelligence gathering, without a limitation on law enforcement officers directing or controlling FISA surveillances. \"[W]hen Congress explicitly authorizes consultation and coordination between different offices in the government, without even suggesting a limitation on who is to direct and control, it necessarily implies that either could take the lead.\"", "In analyzing the \"significant purpose\" amendment to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(a)(7)(B), the Court of Review deemed this a clear rejection of the primary purpose test. If gathering foreign intelligence information is a significant purpose, another purpose such as criminal prosecution could be primary. Further, the court found that the term \"significant\" \"imposed a requirement that the government have a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes.... Although section 1805(a)(5) ... may well have been intended to authorize the FISA court to review only the question whether the information sought was a type of foreign intelligence information, in light of the significant purpose amendment of section 1804, it seems section 1805 must be interpreted as giving the FISA court the authority to review the government's purpose in seeking the information.\" The Court of Review saw the \"significant purpose\" language as \"excluding from the purpose of gaining foreign intelligence information a sole objective of criminal prosecution.\" If the government, at the commencement of a FISA surveillance has not yet determined whether to prosecute the target, \"[s]o long as the government entertains a realistic option of dealing with the agent other than through criminal prosecution, it satisfies the significant purpose test.\" Under the Court of Review's analysis:", "If the certification of the application's purpose articulates a broader objective than criminal prosecution\u2014such as stopping an ongoing conspiracy\u2014and includes other potential non-prosecutorial responses, the government meets the statutory test. Of course, if the court concluded that the government's sole objective was merely to gain evidence of past criminal conduct\u2014even foreign intelligence crimes\u2014to punish the agent rather than halt ongoing espionage or terrorist activity, the application should be denied.", "The court stated further that, while ordinary crimes may be intertwined with foreign intelligence crimes, the FISA process may not be utilized to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes. The Court of Review emphasized that the government's purpose as reflected in the Section 1804(a)(7)(B) certification is to be judged by the FISC on the basis of", "...the national security officer's articulation and not by a FISA court inquiry into the origins of an investigation nor an examination of the personnel involved. It is up to the Director of the FBI, who typically certifies, to determine the government's national security purpose, as approved by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.... That means, perforce, if the FISA court has reason to doubt that the government has any real non-prosecutorial purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information it can demand further inquiry into the certifying officer's purpose\u2014or perhaps even the Attorney General's or Deputy Attorney General's reasons for approval. The important point is that the relevant purpose is that of those senior officials in the Executive Branch who have the responsibility of appraising the government's national security needs.\"", "Turning from its statutory analysis to its examination of whether the statute, as amended, satisfied Fourth Amendment parameters, the Court of Review compared the FISA procedures with those applicable to criminal investigations of \"ordinary crimes\" under Supreme Court jurisprudence and under the wiretap provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Relying upon Dalia v. United States , 441 U.S. 238, 255 (1979), the court indicated that in criminal investigations, beyond requiring that searches and seizures be reasonable, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to demand satisfaction of three criteria: a warrant must be issued by a neutral, detached magistrate; those seeking the warrant must demonstrate to the magistrate that there is probable cause to believe that the evidence sought will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction for a particular offense; and the warrant must describe with particularity the things to be seized and the place to be searched.", "The Court of Review compared the procedures in Title III with those in FISA, finding in some respects that Title III had higher standards, while in others FISA included additional safeguards. In both, there was provision for a detached, neutral magistrate. The probable cause standard in Title III for criminal investigations was deemed more demanding than that in FISA. Title III requires a showing of probable cause that a specific individual has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a particular criminal offense. FISA requires a showing of probable cause that the target of the FISA investigative technique is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. A foreign power is not defined solely in terms of criminal activity. In the case of a target who is a U.S. person, the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" contemplates, in part, the involvement of or, in the case of clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power, the possibility of criminal conduct. The court regarded the lesser requirement with respect to criminal activity in the context of clandestine intelligence activities as to some extent balanced by the safeguard provided by FISA's requirement that there be probable cause to believe that the target is acting \"for or on behalf of a foreign power.\"", "With regard to the particularity requirement, as to the first element, Title III requires a finding of probable cause to believe that the interception will obtain particular communications regarding a specified crime. In contrast, FISA requires an official to designate the type of foreign intelligence information being sought and to certify that the information being sought is foreign intelligence information. When the target of the FISA investigation is a U.S. person, the standard of review applied by the FISC is whether there is clear error in the certification, a lower standard that a judicial finding of probable cause. While the FISC can demand that the government provide further information needed for the court to make its determination as to whether the certification is clearly erroneous, the statute relies also upon internal checks on Executive Branch decisions through the requirement that the certification must be made by a national security officer and approved by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.", "In connection with the second particularity element, Title III", "... requires probable cause to believe that the facilities subject to surveillance are being used or are about to be used in connection with commission of a crime or are leased to, listed in the name of, or used by the individual committing the crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(d), [while] FISA requires probable cause to believe that each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used by a foreign power or agent [of a foreign power]. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(a)(3)(B). ... Simply put, FISA requires less of a nexus between the facility and the pertinent communications that Title III, but more of a nexus between the target and the pertinent communications.\"", "The Court of Review also compared Title III to FISA with respect to necessity (both statutes require that the information sought is not available through normal investigative procedures, although the standards differ somewhat), duration of surveillance (30 days under Title III, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c), as opposed to 90 days under FISA for U.S. persons, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(e)(1)), minimization and notice.", "With respect to minimization, the Court of Review noted that Title III, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5), required minimization of what was acquired, directing that surveillance be carried out \"in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter.\" FISA, on the other hand, \"requires minimization of what is acquired, retained, and disseminated.\" Observing that the FISC had found \"in practice FISA surveillance devices are normally left on continuously, and the minimization occurs in the process of indexing and logging the pertinent communications,\" the Court of Review deemed the reasonableness of such an approach to be dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case:", "Less minimization in the acquisition stage may well be justified to the extent the intercepted communications are \"ambiguous in nature or apparently involve[] guarded or coded language,\" or \"the investigation is focusing on what is thought to be a widespread conspiracy [where] more extensive surveillance may be justified in an attempt to determine the precise scope of the enterprise.\" ... Given the targets of FISA surveillance, it will often be the case that intercepted communications will be in code or a foreign language for which there is no contemporaneously available translator, and the activities of foreign agents will involve multiple actors and complex plots....", "With respect to notice, the Court of Review observed that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d), Title III mandated notice to the target of the surveillance and, in the judge's discretion, to other persons whose communications were intercepted, after the surveillance has expired. In contrast, under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806(c) and (d), FISA does not require notice to a person whose communications were intercepted unless the government intends to use, disclose, or enter into evidence those communications or derivative information in a trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other federal, state or local authority against that person. The Court of Review noted that where such information was to be used against a criminal defendant, he or she would be given notice, and stated that \"where such evidence is not ultimately going to be used for law enforcement,\" Congress had observed that \"[t]he need to preserve secrecy for sensitive counterintelligence sources and methods justifies elimination of the notice requirement.\" In a footnote, the court noted that the Amici had drawn attention to the difference in the nature of the notice given the defendant or aggrieved person under Title III as opposed to FISA. Under Title III, a defendant is generally entitled under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(9) to obtain the application and order to challenge the legality of the surveillance. However, under FISA, the government must give the aggrieved person and the court or other authority (or in the case of a state or local use, the state or political subdivision must give notice to the aggrieved person, the court or other authority, and the Attorney General) of their intent to so disclose or use communications obtained from the surveillance or derivative information. In addition, under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1806(f) and (g), if the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm national security, the U.S. district court may review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and other materials related to the surveillance, to determine whether the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, whether disclosure or discovery is necessary, and whether to grant a motion to suppress. The Court of Review noted that these determinations are to be made by the U.S. district judge on a case by case basis, and stated that \"whether such a decision protects a defendant's constitutional rights in a given case is not before us.\"", "Based on this comparison of Title III and FISA, the Court of Review found that \"to the extent that the two statutes diverge in constitutionally relevant areas\u2014in particular, in their probable cause and particularity showings\u2014a FISA order may not be a 'warrant' contemplated by the Fourth Amendment.... Ultimately, the question becomes whether FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, is a reasonable response based on a balance of the legitimate need of the government for foreign intelligence information to protect against national security threats with the protected rights of citizens.\"", "The court framed the question as follows: \"does FISA amplify the President's power by providing a mechanism that at least approaches a classic warrant and which therefore supports the government's contention that FISA searches are constitutionally reasonable.\" In its analysis, the court first considered whether the Truong case articulated the correct standard. Truong held that the President had inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information, but did not squarely address FISA. Starting from the perspective that Truong deemed the primary purpose test to be constitutionally compelled as an application of the Keith case balancing standard, the Court of Review found that the Truong determination that \"once surveillance becomes primarily a criminal investigation, the courts are entirely competent to make the usual probable cause determination, and ... individual privacy interests come to the fore and government foreign policy concerns recede when the government is primarily attempting to form the basis of a criminal investigation.\" The Court of Review found that this analysis was based upon a faulty premise that in the context of criminal prosecution \"foreign policy concerns recede,\" and found further that the line the Truong court \"sought to draw was inherently unstable, unrealistic, and confusing.\" The Court of Review opined that in the context of counterintelligence, foreign policy concerns did not recede when the government moved to prosecute. Rather \"the government's primary purpose is to halt the espionage or terrorism efforts, and criminal prosecutions can be, and usually are, interrelated with other techniques used to frustrate a foreign power's efforts.\"", "In addition, the court found that the method of determining when an investigation became primarily criminal by looking to when the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice assumed the lead role, had led over time to the \"quite intrusive organizational and personnel tasking the FISA court [had] adopted.\" The court found the \"wall\" procedure to generate dangerous confusion and create perverse organizational incentives that discouraged wholehearted cooperation of \"all the government's personnel who can be brought to the task.\" This the court suggested could be thought to be dangerous to national security and could be thought to discourage desirable initiatives.", "In addition, the court saw the primary purpose test as administered by the FISC, \"by focusing on the subjective motivation of those who initiate investigations ... was at odds with the Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment cases which regard subjective motivation of an officer conducting a search or seizure as irrelevant.\" ", "Assuming arguendo that FISA orders were not warrants within the scope of the Fourth Amendment, the Court of Review returned to the question of whether searches under FISA are constitutionally reasonable. While the Supreme Court has not considered directly the constitutionality of warrantless government searches for foreign intelligence purposes, the balance between the government's interest and personal privacy interests is key to an examination of this question. The Court of Review viewed Keith as suggesting that a somewhat relaxed standard might be appropriate in foreign intelligence crimes as opposed to ordinary crimes.", "The Court of Review then briefly touched upon the Supreme Court's \"special needs\" cases, where the Court upheld searches not based on a warrant or individualized suspicion in extraordinary circumstances involving \"special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement.\" In City of Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U.S. 32, 42 (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a highway check point program designed to catch drug dealers was not within the \"special needs\" exception to the requirement that a search be based upon individualized suspicion, because \"the government's 'primary purpose' was merely 'to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.'\" The Court stated that \"the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose.\" The Court relied upon an examination of the primary purpose of the program, but not the motivations of individual officers, to determine whether the \"special needs\" standard had been met. The Supreme Court noted that an appropriately tailored road block could be used \"to thwart an imminent terrorist attack.\"", "After summarizing Edmond , the Court of Review emphasized that it is the nature of the threat or emergency that took the matter beyond the realm of ordinary crime control. It concluded that, while the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of the reasonableness of a search under the Fourth Amendment standard, it is a critical factor in the analysis. In its view, the \"programmatic purpose\" of FISA, \"to protect the nation against terrorists and espionage threats directed by foreign powers,\" was one which, from FISA's inception, was distinguishable from \"ordinary crime control.\" The Court of Review also concluded that, \"[e]ven without taking into account the President's inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, we think the procedures and government showings required under FISA, if they do not meet the minimum Fourth Amendment warrant standards, certainly come close.\" Applying the balancing test that it had drawn from Keith between foreign intelligence crimes and ordinary crimes, the Court of Review held surveillances under FISA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, were reasonable and therefore constitutional. In so doing, however, the Court of Review", "acknowledged] ... that the constitutional question presented by this case\u2014whether Congress' disapproval of the primary purpose test is consistent with the Fourth Amendment\u2014has no definitive jurisprudential answer. The Supreme Court's special needs cases involve random stops (seizures) not electronic searches. In one sense, they can be thought of as a greater encroachment into personal privacy because they are not based on any particular suspicion. On the other hand, wiretapping is a good deal more intrusive than an automobile stop accompanied by questioning.", "The Court of Review reversed the FISC's orders before it for electronic surveillance \"to the extent they imposed conditions on the grant of the government's applications, vacate[d] the FISA court's Rule 11, and remand[ed] with instructions to grant the applications as submitted and proceed henceforth in accordance with this opinion.\"", "50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1803(b) provides that, where the Court of Review upholds a denial by the FISC of a FISA application, the United States may file a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Since consideration of applications for FISA orders is ex parte, there is no provision in FISA for an appeal to the United States Supreme Court from a decision of the Court of Review by anyone other than the United States. Nevertheless, on February 18, 2003, a petition for leave to intervene and a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review was filed in this case in the U.S. Supreme Court by the American Civil Liberties Union, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services. On March 14, 2003, the Bar Association of San Francisco filed a motion to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the motion to intervene and petition for certiorari.

In addition, it provides a statutory mechanism for the FBI to seek production of \"any tangible things\" for an investigation seeking foreign intelligence information not involving a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence with respect to any person under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861. FISA creates enhanced procedural protections where a United States person is involved, while setting somewhat less stringent standards where the surveillance involves foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. With its detailed statutory structure, it appears intended to protect personal liberties safeguarded by the First and Fourth Amendments while providing a means to ensure national security interests.", "The USA PATRIOT Act, P.L. 107-56 , increased the number of FISC judges from 7 to 11, while expanding the availability of FISA electronic surveillance, physical searches and pen registers and trap and trace devices. For example, under P.L. 107-56 , an application for a court order permitting electronic surveillance or a physical search under FISA is now permissible where \"a significant purpose\" of the surveillance or physical search, rather than \"the purpose\" or, as interpreted by some courts, \"the primary purpose\" of the surveillance or physical search, is to gather foreign intelligence information. While the previous language withstood constitutional challenge, the Supreme Court has not yet determined the constitutional sufficiency of the change in the FISA procedures under the Fourth Amendment. On the other hand, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review has examined a number of constitutional issues in In re Sealed Case , finding that FISA orders, if not satisfying the constitutional warrant requirement, are close to doing so; and finding that, even if a FISA order does not qualify as a warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes, electronic surveillance under FISA as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act is reasonable and therefore constitutional. At the same time, however, the Court of Review acknowledged that the constitutional question of whether Congress' disapproval of the primary purpose test is consistent with the Fourth Amendment \"has no definitive jurisprudential answer.\"", "The USA PATRIOT Act also amended FISA to allow court orders permitting so-called multipoint or \"roving\" electronic surveillance, where the orders do not require particularity with respect to the identification of the instrument, place, or facility to be intercepted, upon a finding by the court that the actions of the target of the surveillance are likely to thwart such identification. P.L. 107-108 further clarified this authority.", "Under P.L. 107-56 , pen registers and trap and trace devices may now be authorized for e-mails as well as telephone conversations. In addition, the act expanded the previous FBI access to business records, permitting court ordered access in connection with a foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigation not just to business records held by common carriers, public accommodation facilities, physical storage facilities, and vehicle rental facilities, but to any tangible things.", "While expanding the authorities available for foreign intelligence investigations, FISA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2002, also contains broader protections for those who may be the target of the various investigative techniques involved. For example, whether the circumstances involve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen registers or trap and trace devices or access to business records and other tangible items, FISA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, does not permit the court to grant orders based solely upon a United States person's exercise of First Amendment rights.", "In addition, P.L. 107-56 created a new private right of action for persons aggrieved by inappropriate disclosure or use of information gleaned or derived from electronic surveillance, physical searches or the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices. These claims can be brought against the United States for certain willful violations by government personnel.", "Finally, the inclusion of a sunset provision for the FISA changes made in the USA PATRIOT Act, with the exception of the increase in the number of FISC judges, provides an opportunity for the new authorities to be utilized and considered, and an opportunity for the Congress to revisit them in light of that experience.", "Sections 898 and 899 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, P.L. 107-296 , amended FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71806(k)(1) and 1825(k)(1) respectively, to permit federal officers conducting electronic surveillance or physical searches to acquire foreign intelligence information under FISA to consult with federal law enforcement officers \"or law enforcement personnel of a state or political subdivision of a State (including the chief executive officer of that State or political subdivision who has the authority to appoint or direct the chief law enforcement officer of that State or political subdivision).\" Such consultations are to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against actual or potential attacks or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. These sections also state that such consultations do not preclude the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or other designated Executive Branch officials from making the necessary certifications as part of the application process for a FISA court order under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1804(a)(7) or 1823(a)(7), nor are these consultations to preclude entry of an order under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1805 or 1824.", "Section 6001 of Title VI of FISA, as added by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, P.L. 108-458 , expanded the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" in the context of non-U.S. persons to encompass those who engage in international terrorism or in activities in preparation for international terrorism, regardless of whether they have any connection or affiliation with a foreign government or other foreign organization or entity. This new definition is included among those FISA provisions subject to the sunset provisions in Section 224 of the USA PATRIOT Act, as amended. Section of the new Title VI of FISA also imposed new, detailed semiannual reporting requirements to facilitate congressional oversight of the implementation of the Act, which are codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1871.", "The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, P.L. 109-177 (Reauthorization Act), Section 102, adopted a sunset of December 31, 2009, for FISC orders for multipoint or \"roving\" wiretaps under Section 105(a) of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(a), for FISC orders for production of tangible things under Section 501 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, and congressional oversight requirements in Section 502 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862. Section 103 of P.L. 109-177 extended the sunset relating to \"lone wolf\" agents of foreign powers to December 31, 2009.", "Section 105 of P.L. 109-177 extended the maximum duration initial orders authorizing of electronic surveillances and physical searches under Sections 105(e) and 304 of FISA to 120 days, while extensions of such electronic surveillances and physical searches could be for up to one year. The duration of both initial orders and extensions to orders authorizing installation and use of FISa pen registers or trap and trace devices is extended from 90 days to one year in cases where the Government has certified that the information likely to be obtained is foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person.", "Section 106(a) of P.L. 109-177 permits the FBI Director to delegate his authority to make an application for a production order regarding library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, firearms sales records, tax return records, educational records, or medical records containing information that would identify a person, to either the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security (or any successor position). Neither the Deputy Director nor the Executive Assistant Director may not further delegate such authority.", "Section 106(b) of P.L. 109-177 requires an application for a FISA production order to include statement of the facts supporting a reasonable belief that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation (other than a threat assessment) to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a United States person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. It provides that certain tangible things are \"presumptively relevant\" to such an investigation if the statement of facts shows that they pertain to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of the authorized investigation, or an individual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of the investigation.", "Section 106(c) of P.L. 109-177 provides that an FISC judge must approve a FISA production order if he or she finds that the application meets the statutory requirements. Under Section 106(d) of P.L. 109-177 , such an ex parte order must include a particularized description of the tangible things sought, must allow a reasonable time for such things to be assembled, must notify the recipients of the production order of applicable nondisclosure requirements, and must be limited to things which may be subject to a grand jury subpoena or any other federal court order directing production of records or tangible things. The order must not disclose that such order is issued for purposes of such an authorized investigation.", "Section 106(d) of the Reauthorization Act prohibits the recipient of a production order from disclosing to anyone except those persons to whom disclosure is necessary to comply with such order; an attorney to obtain legal advice or assistance with respect to the production of things in response to the order; or other persons as permitted by the FBI Director or his designee. Subsection 106(e) of the measure requires the production order recipient, upon the request of the FBI Director or his designee, to identify to the FBI those to whom such disclosure has been or will be made, unless the disclosure has been or is to be made to an attorney from whom legal advice or assistance is sought.", "Section 106(f) of P.L. 109-177 amends 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1803 to establish a petition review pool of FISC judges to hear challenges to FISA production or related nondisclosure orders, and sets forth a detailed judicial review process for consideration of such petitions.", "Section 106A of the Reauthorization Act directs the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a comprehensive audit of the effectiveness and use, including any improper or illegal use, of the investigative authority provided to the FBI under 50 U.S.C. 1861 for calendar years 2002-2006, and requires the results to be filed in two unclassified reports to the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.", "Section 108(a) and (b) amend the requirements for an application and for an FISC order authorizing multipoint electronic surveillance under FISA.

In so doing, the measure in effect deletes an exception to this identification requirement where the person to whom the disclosure is made is an attorney from whom the person making the disclosure is seeking legal advice or assistance.", "In addition to examining the statutory structure in FISA, as amended, this report has explored two published decisions, one from the FISC in In re All Matters Submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and one from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review in In re Sealed Case . Because historically the decisions of the FISC have not been made public, and because the opinion of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review discussed in this report was the first decision ever made by that court, the recent decisions of the FISC and the Court of Review provided a unique opportunity to observe the decision-making processes and differing perspectives of the two courts created by FISA.", "The FISC's decision was set against a backdrop of a significant number of instances in which the Department of Justice had failed to maintain a \"wall\" between foreign intelligence gathering and criminal investigations. All seven of the then sitting members of the FISC concurred in the May 17, 2002, order of the court, written by the then presiding judge of the court. The FISC, in its May 17 th opinion and order, treated the Attorney General's proposed 2002 \"Intelligence Sharing Procedures for Foreign Intelligence and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations Conducted by the FBI\" as minimization procedures, and approved them as modified. The modifications made by the Court permitted the FBI, the Criminal Division, and OIPR to consult with one another \"to coordinate their efforts to investigate or protect against foreign attack or other grave hostile acts, sabotage, international terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents.\" In so doing, the FISC permitted such cooperation and coordination to address, among other things, the exchange of information already acquired, identification of categories of information needed and being sought, prevention of either foreign intelligence gathering or criminal law enforcement investigation or interest from obstructing or hindering the other; compromise of either investigation, and long term objectives and overall strategy of both investigations to insure that overlapping intelligence and criminal interests of the United States are both achieved. While permitting direct consultation and coordination between components, the FISC required that OIPR be invited to all consultations and, if OIPR was unable to attend, the modified procedures required that OIPR be \"forthwith\" informed in writing of the substance of the meeting so that the FISC could be notified promptly. In addition, under the procedures as modified by the FISC, law enforcement officials were prohibited from making recommendations to intelligence officials regarding the initiation, operation, continuation or expansion of FISA searches or surveillances. Nor could law enforcement officials direct or control the use of FISA procedures to enhance criminal prosecution. The FBI and the Criminal Division were given the responsibility to ensure that this did not occur, and were also required to make certain that advice intended to preserve the criminal prosecution option did not inadvertently result in the Criminal Division directing or controlling the investigation using FISA tools to further law enforcement objectives. In addition, the FISC adopted a new Rule 11, dealing with criminal investigations in FISA cases, to facilitate monitoring of compliance with its May 17, 2002 order. This rule required all FISA applications to include informative descriptions of ongoing criminal investigations of FISA targets, as well as the substance of consultations between the FBI and criminal prosecutors at the Department of Justice or a U.S. Attorney's office.", "In its November 18, 2002 opinion, the Court of Review took a starkly different view of the Attorney General's proposed procedures and firmly rejected the FISC analysis and conclusions. The issue came before the Court of Review as an appeal of two FISC orders, one granting an application to authorize electronic surveillance of an agent of a foreign power subject to restrictions stemming from the FISC May 17 th opinion and order and the other renewing the authorization for electronic surveillance subject to the same conditions.", "The Court of Review held that the FISC's interpretation of the augmented 1995 procedures and the proposed 2002 procedures as minimization procedures under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h) was in error. The Court of Review found that the FISC had misconstrued 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801(h) and 1805 and may have overstepped its constitutional authority by asserting authority to govern the internal organization and investigative procedures of the Justice Department.", "It found that FISA, as originally enacted, did not create a dichotomy between foreign intelligence information gathering and law enforcement investigations, nor did it require maintenance of a \"wall\" between such investigations. While FISA as enacted in 1978 required that a national security official certify that \"the purpose\" of the investigation was to gather foreign intelligence information, the court regarded the definition of \"foreign intelligence information\" as including evidence of criminal wrongdoing where a U.S. person is the target of the FISA investigation. In light of the fact that the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" applicable to U.S. persons involved criminal conduct, or, in the context of clandestine intelligence operations, the possibility of criminal conduct, the court distinguished \"foreign intelligence crimes\" from \"ordinary crimes.\" In foreign intelligence crimes, intelligence gathering and criminal investigations may become intertwined.", "The Court of Review reviewed past court decisions requiring that, in seeking a FISA order authorizing electronic surveillance, the government must demonstrate that the \"primary purpose\" of the surveillance was to gather foreign intelligence information and not to further law enforcement purposes. Rejecting the \"primary purpose test\" as applied by the FISC and the courts of appeals of several circuits, the Court of Review did not find it to be compelled by the statutory language of FISA as originally enacted or by the Fourth Amendment.", "The Court of Review also held the FISC to have been in error in its refusal \"to consider the legal significance of the Patriot Act's crucial amendments....\" In particular, the court focused upon the change of the required certification by the national security official from a certification that \"the purpose\" of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information to a certification that \"a significant purpose\" of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(a)(7)(B); and the enactment of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806(k), authorizing consultation and coordination by federal officers engaged in electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information with federal law enforcement officers.", "Finding that the \"significant purpose\" amendment recognized the existence of a dichotomy between intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes, the Court of Review concluded that this test was satisfied if the government had \"a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes.\" While the gathering of foreign intelligence information for the sole objective of criminal prosecution would be precluded by the \"significant purpose\" language, if \"the government entertains a realistic option of dealing with the agent [of a foreign power] other than through criminal prosecution,\" the court found the \"significant purpose\" test satisfied. Although the court was of the view that, prior to passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, the FISC may well not have had authority under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(a)(5) to inquire into anything other than the issue of \"whether the information sought was a type of foreign intelligence information, in light of the significant purpose amendment of section 1804\" the Court of Review concluded that \"it seems section 1805 must be interpreted as giving the FISA court the authority to review the government's purpose in seeking the information.\" The court held that the government's purpose under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(a)(7)(B) was \"to be judged by the national security official's articulation and not by a FISA court inquiry into the origins of an investigation nor an examination of the personnel involved.... [I]f the FISA court has reason to doubt that the government has any real non-prosecutorial purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information it can demand further inquiry into the certifying officer's purpose\u2014or perhaps even the Attorney General's or Deputy Attorney General's reasons for approval.\"", "The Court of Review also considered whether FISA, as amended, passed constitutional muster under the Fourth Amendment. It deemed the procedures and government showings required under FISA to come close to the minimum requirements for a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, if not meeting such requirements. Assuming arguendo that a FISA order was not a warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes, the Court of Review found FISA constitutional because the surveillances authorized thereunder were reasonable."], "subsections": []}]}}
