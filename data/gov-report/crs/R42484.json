Normally, a program that receives mandatory funding in the last year of its authorization will be assumed to continue at that level of funding into the future as if there were no change in policy.

Savings from the commodity title do not begin until FY2015 because agricultural disaster payments begin in FY2014, and the repeal of direct payments is not felt until FY2015. Direct payments for the 2013 crop year (authorized under the extension of the 2008 farm bill and paid according to statute after October 1, 2013) were paid in FY2014. Moreover, most payments for the new farm commodity program do not occur until FY2016 because they are paid after the end of the marketing year, which occurs a year after harvest (e.g., for crops harvested in the fall of 2014\u2014the first year of the 2014 farm bill\u2014payments would be after October 1, 2015, which is FY2016). This makes the budgetary effect for Title I in FY2015 particularly large because it is primarily the repeal of direct payments. Changes to both crop insurance and conservation grow gradually over time, with more of the effect in the second five years. In fact, conservation has additional spending in the first two years, relative to the baseline, before savings occur.", " Figure A-1 and Figure B-1 show the corresponding multi-year graphs for the House and Senate bills, respectively. These year-by-year figures reveal additional differences that are peculiar to the House and Senate bills.

Of this amount, $391 billion was for nutrition, $65 billion for the farm safety net (farm commodity support and crop insurance), $28 billion for conservation, and nearly $5 billion for other titles ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ).", "In terms of the 10-year score at enactment discussed throughout this section, the 2014 farm bill is expected to spend $956 billion over 10 years (-1.7% compared to the baseline).

The Senate bill's $17.9 billion reduction (-1.8%) would have reduced expected outlays to $955 billion (the third bar).

Baseline projections rise and fall based on changes in economic conditions, even without any action by Congress. ", "Each farm bill title with mandatory spending represents a share or proportion of the farm bill budget. One share of the farm bill that has attracted attention is the nutrition baseline, but other shares of the baseline have similar stories. ", "The proportion and size of the farm bill budget contained in the nutrition title has increased over time. When the 2008 farm bill was enacted, the nutrition title was 67% of the 10-year total ($406 billion out of a $604 billion 10-year projected total). When the 2014 farm bill was enacted six years later, the share in the nutrition title was 79% of the total ($756 billion out of a $956 billion 10-year projected total). ", "This growth in size and proportion does not mean, however, that the nutrition has grown at the expense of agricultural programs. During this period, legislative changes in the farm bill account for only a fraction of the change. For example, the 2014 farm bill scored $16 billion in 10-year savings from the most recent baseline, while 10-year expected costs increased $352 billion from one farm bill to the next. By title, the farm bill scored $8 billion in 10-year savings from nutrition, while 10-year nutrition outlays increased by $350 million. Similarly, legislative changes to crop insurance and the farm commodity program do not equal the changes in outlays for those titles.", " Table 6 highlights changes in budgetary expectations for SNAP and farm safety net supports from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill. This is a separate way of analyzing costs than the official scoring analysis discussed earlier in this report.", "In recent years, due to the recession, projected nutrition program outlays rose because food assistance needs increased as the automatic safety net triggered greater payments to more beneficiaries according to formulas in the law. The projected 10-year SNAP outlay rose by 10.9% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill. This $350 billion increase in expected 10-year outlays is entirely from changing economic expectations that require more outlays, since the legislative changes in the farm bill scored an $8 billion reduction. Over the same period, expected crop insurance outlays increased as agricultural market prices rose and caused the insured value of crops (and thus premium subsidies) to grow. The expectation of 10-year crop insurance outlays rose by 11.3% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill\u2014a higher annualized rate of increase than for SNAP, though the dollar magnitude is less. The $43 billion increase in expected 10-year outlays for crop insurance is mostly from changing economic expectations rather than the $5.7 billion increase that was legislated in Title XI by the 2014 farm bill. Conversely, expected farm commodity program outlays fell as market prices rose and less counter-cyclical price support was expected under the law. In addition, the 2014 farm bill eliminated direct payments, the largest relevant component of 2008 farm bill spending. The expectation of 10-year farm commodity program outlays fell by 10.3% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill. In total, the $41 billion reduction in expected 10-year outlays from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill is from both changing economic conditions and the $14 billion net reduction legislated in Title I. The \"farm safety net\" subtotal of crop insurance and the farm commodity programs is nearly constant from the 2008 farm bill to the 2014 farm bill. Expected 10-year outlays were $133 billion in 2008 and are $134 billion in the 2014 farm bill.

For example, three other research programs would receive baseline only through FY2018. Similarly, all of the mandatory-funded program in the rural development title, the farmers market promotion program, and outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers, among other programs, also do not have a baseline beyond FY2018.
