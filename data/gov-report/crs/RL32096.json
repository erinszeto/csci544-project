The Supplementary Treaty limits the political offense bar to extradition; it authorizes judicial inquiry into the motives behind an extradition request; and it allows an individual sought by the British to be heard by the court on the issues of probable cause and dual criminality. On March 31, 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft and United Kingdom Home Secretary David Blunkett announced the signing of a new extradition treaty that reopened the matter. The Senate gave its advice and consent to the 2003 Treaty on September 29, 2006, subject to an understanding, two declarations, and three provisos, 152 Cong. Rec. S10766-767 (daily ed. Sept. 29, 2006).", "The understanding, declarations and provisos confirm that (1) federal courts will retain the authority to bar extradition when a request fails to meet the demands of 2003 Treaty; (2) the 2003 Treaty does not obligate the United States to take any action proscribed by the Constitution; (3) the parties have disclaimed any interest in prosecuting offenses committed in Northern Ireland prior to and addressed in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It also urges the Secretary of State to consider carefully any requests for the extradition of a fugitive who was previous acquitted, and after the Treaty becomes effective it requires annual reports from the Secretary on the number and disposition of extradition requests under the Treaty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Extradition is the process by which one country formally surrenders a person to another country for criminal prosecution or punishment. Ordinarily, extradition is governed by a treaty which operates in the nature of a contract and by implementing statutory provisions.

The difficulties that led to the Supplementary Treaty arose from judicial application of the \"political offense exception\" found in the 1977 Treaty. The federal courts in this country had held that the political offense exception found in most of our extradition treaties precluded extradition on the basis of criminal charges growing out of conduct \"committed in the course of and incidental to a violent political disturbance, such as a war, revolution or rebellion.\" Shortly after the 1977 Treaty became effective, federal courts denied extradition requests on the basis of the political offense exception in four instances growing out of the unrest in Northern Ireland. The two countries responded by negotiating a Supplementary Treaty, S.Treaty Doc. 99-8 (1985). As transmitted to the Senate, the Supplementary Treaty curtailed the political offense exception, and also eased the statute of limitations bar, extended the permissible duration of provisional arrest pending the formal submission of evidence sufficient to support an extradition request, and made its changes retroactively applicable, S.Treaty Doc. 99-8 (1985).", "Exemptions to the political offense exception were the most controversial aspect of the treaty offered to the Senate. The Administration argued that the political offense exception should not be available for crimes of violence committed in a nation open to nonviolent resolution of political differences, and that contrary to critics' suggestions the treaty posed no threat to civil liberties. Critics, on the other hand, argued that the repudiated political offense exception reflected a long-held reluctance to deny refuge to the opponents of repressive governments , lest we be forced to extradite the overseas equivalents of the farmers and other minutemen at Lexington and Concord. In addition, some suggested that adjustments in the political offense exception might best be addressed uniformly in statute rather than on an ad hoc treaty by treaty basis; while others questioned the wisdom of endorsing some aspects of criminal justice system in Northern Ireland.", "Apart from the political offense question, opponents also protested that the Supplementary Treaty as transmitted eliminated the statute of limitations defense to any British request and made its alternations retroactively applicable. The Administration pointed out that the treatment of retroactivity and the lapse of time issues were standard features of \"our newer treaties.\"", "After consulting with the Administration and the British Government, the Senate produced a compromise. First, the Supplementary Treaty that entered into force after Senate amendment limits the political offense exception to permit the extradition of terrorists in most cases. Second, in such purported terrorist extradition cases, it creates a defense to extradition where the fugitive can establish that extradition has been sought or would result in his trial or punishment because of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions. And it establishes a procedure for appellate review in such cases. Third, it makes it clear that the federal courts may deny extradition in the absence of probable cause and in response to evidence presented by the individual sought. Finally, it drops the proposed revision of the statute of limitations clause, so that extradition must be denied if prosecution would be barred under the laws of either country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since the Supplementary Treaty", "paragraphs": ["Of the four men whose extradition cases served as a catalyst for the Supplementary Treaty, Desmond Mackin returned to Ireland; William Quinn was extradited; and Peter McMullen was deported, as was Joseph Doherty. Others appear to have found little refuge in the Supplementary Treaty. Commentary on the Supplementary Treaty and on the cases that followed has been mixed, often depending upon whether the author's focus was terrorism, intervention in foreign civil conflicts, or inquiry into foreign judicial systems. Finally, the conditions in Northern Ireland that rested at the heart of the extradition controversy seem to have improved somewhat. Under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement violence subsided, and those held under the Diplock and similar procedures have been released.", "While they lack the more individualist attributes of the Supplementary Treaty, the extradition treaties with other nations transmitted to the Senate since then have generally featured a more modest series of exemptions to the political offense bar. Most would permit extradition for a political offense that involves a crime of violence against a head of state or his family, or a crime covered by a treaty obligation to extradite, or attempt or conspiracy to commit either of these types of crimes. A few, however, do contain exemptions to the political offense ban reminiscent of the Supplementary Treaty. \"3.

First, its historical development suggests that it is grounded on the belief that individuals have a \"right to resort to political activism to foster political change.\" This justification is consistent with the modern consensus that political crimes have greater legitimacy than common crimes. Second, the exception reflects a concern that individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly unsuccessful rebels\u00e2\u0080\u0094should not be returned to countries where they may be subjected to unfair trial and punishments because of their political opinions.

Absent a treaty bar, United States courts have held that it should apply to crimes committed incidental to and in furtherance of rebellion or similar political disturbance, Id. at 797-78. Reliance upon the exception led to the exemptions to the exception found in the proposed Supplementary Treaty. The Senate accepted a somewhat reduced list of exemptions to the political offense exception in exchange for expanded judicial authority to verify probable cause and the bona fides of a request.", "The 2003 Treaty undoes the Senate changes in the Supplementary Treaty and enlarges its list of exemptions from the political offense exception (noted in the italics below):", "1. Extradition shall not be granted if the offense for which extradition is requested is a political offense.", "2.

At first blush, it seems unlikely to arise with any great frequency. Its actual reach, nevertheless, may increase slightly depending upon the Parties' understandings of the meaning of \"family\" and the new breadth of subparagraph 4(2)(g) relating to accessories. It might, for example, embrace anyone who harbored or otherwise afterwards assisted those who assassinated Lord Mountbatten, assuming the underlying offense were found to be a political offense.", "Several of the enlargements\u00e2\u0080\u0094those dealing with possession, conspiracy, property damage, expanding voluntary manslaughter to include involuntary, and reaching unlawful detention (serious or otherwise)\u00e2\u0080\u0094repeal specific Senate amendments to the Supplementary Treaty as originally transmitted to the Senate. The inclusion of threats, firearms, possession of explosives, property damage (independent of bodily injury), and accessories after the fact appears to carry the provision well beyond the coverage of even the more ambitious of such provisions in our other recent extradition treaties. Its sweep is made all the more dramatic by removal of the judicial safety valve found in the Supplementary Treaty's \"improper motives\" Article.", "The Senate responded with the explicit understanding that as part of the extradition process normally conducted under the laws of the United States, \"a United States judge makes determinations regarding the application of the political offense exception.\" The understanding is reenforced by the second declaration confirming the role of the courts in the extradition process and by the provisos indicating that the 2003 Treaty is not designed to permit the prosecution of fugitives from Northern Ireland for offenses committed prior to the Good Friday Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Courts, Improper Motives, and Probable Cause", "paragraphs": ["Transfers responsibility for determining whether the extradition request is politically-motivated from the courts to the executive", "It does.

Of course, the question\u00e2\u0080\u0094of whether the crime upon which an extradition request rests is political crime\u00e2\u0080\u0094is closely related to the question of whether an extradition request is grounded in improper political motives.
