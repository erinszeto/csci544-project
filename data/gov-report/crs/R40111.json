Further investment in energy conservation is expected to meet the future mandated energy reduction goals.

However, as Energy Savings Contractors (ESCOs) assume a certain risk in guaranteeing savings through ESPCs, the risk is factored into their cost. Also, ESPC commitments may extend up to 25 years\u2014an indication of the time needed to recoup the ESCO's investment. As energy efficiency improvements made through UESCs do not necessarily come with savings guarantees and thus risk, the lower cost may translate into higher savings. Federal agencies may not be taking full advantage of this savings opportunity. This may be due to individual utilities limited role promoting UESCs, the number of utilties that may offer UESCs, installation managers' unfamiliarity with UESCs, and ESCOs influence in promoting ESPCs.", "Aging buildings may have limits in meeting energy efficiency goals, and investment in energy conservation may eventually see diminishing returns in energy savings. Overall goals may be achieved, ultimately, through the replacement of older building with new buildings built to LEED standards and even newer \"high-performance\" building standards being developed the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Whether future investments in energy conservation projects and ESPC commitments should give way to replacing older inefficient building with new construction is an issue that Congress may eventually wish to consider. Authorizing ESPCs for building renovation could be used to install more efficient equipment, better insulation and windows, and possibly renewable energy sources whose installation might not be accomplished by appropriation alone. Congress may wish to consider expanding the EISA Section 518 EPSC provision (non-building applications), to study renovating energy-inefficient buildings to LEED and high-performance standards. ", "Under EISA 2007, Congress has authorized mixing appropriated funds with private financing of ESPCs. How funds appropriated for O&M may be applied to ESPCs, though, is unclear. DOE has not yet promulgated rules on the new authority. The lack of rules may prove to be a critical barrier to accomplishing DOD-related provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA provides nearly $3.7 billion under O&M for Defense Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization that may be applied toward energy efficiency projects and repair and modernization of DOD facilities. Another $300 million for Research Development, Test and Evaluation may be applied to improvements in energy generation on military installations. The combined funding nearly matches the $4.2 billion in ECIP, ESPC, and UESC spending from FY1999 through FY2007. The ARRA appropriation, however, remains available for obligation until September 30, 2010. Acquisition planning for the improvements, not including the year-long acquisition process, may exceed the time\u2013frame of funding availability. Timely acquisition, to meet the economic stimulus intent of ARRA, may also depend on having an adequately trained acquisition workforce in place. Given the lack of rules, comparatively high funding level, and short obligation period, Congress may wish to consider whether DOD may act effectively on the provisions. ", "Finally, though DOD's average utility energy costs fall in the range of national energy prices, Congress may wish to consider how DOD's energy costs (not just consumption) could be reduced further. As the single largest national energy consumer, DOD might leverage its buying power in negotiating lower utility rates. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
