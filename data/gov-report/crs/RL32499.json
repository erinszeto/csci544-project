Saudi leaders acknowledge providing financial support for Islamic and Palestinian causes, but maintain that no official Saudi support goes to any terrorist organizations, such as Hamas.", "Al Qaeda affiliated terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia from 2003 to 2006 appear to have given added impetus to the Saudi leadership in expanding counter-terrorist financing efforts. Since mid-2003, the Saudi government has: set up a joint task force with the United States to investigate terrorist financing in Saudi Arabia; shuttered some charitable organizations suspected of terrorist ties; passed anti-money laundering legislation; banned cash collections at mosques; centralized control over some charities; closed unlicensed money exchanges; and scrutinized clerics involved in charitable collections.

Similar public and private Saudi efforts have financed religious education and proselytization programs in dozens of Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority countries. In places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Chechnya, Bosnia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Kashmir, Kosovo, and the West Bank and Gaza, some of these activities appear to have provided financial or material support to individuals or groups actively involved in terrorism, armed violence, or the propagation of divisive religious ideologies.

U.S. officials state that this network collected funds and funneled them to Arab fighters in Afghanistan, and later to Al Qaeda, using charities and other non-governmental organizations. According to the Commission's report, Saudi individuals and other financiers associated with the Golden Chain enabled bin Laden and Al Qaeda to replace lost financial assets and establish a base in Afghanistan following their abrupt departure from Sudan in 1996. These activities were facilitated in part, the report argues, by the \"extreme religious views\" that exist within Saudi Arabia and the fact that \"until recently\" Saudi charities were \"subject to very limited oversight.\"", "Although the report highlights a series of unsuccessful U.S. government efforts to gain access to a senior Al Qaeda financial operative who had been detained by Saudi Arabia in 1997, the report credits the Saudi government with assisting U.S. officials in interviewing members of the bin Laden family in 1999 and 2000. The report argues that these meetings were integral to U.S. efforts to understand the role of bin Laden's personal wealth in the financing of Al Qaeda. As a result of this assistance, U.S. officials learned that Saudi government actions in the early 1990s had in effect divested bin Laden of his share of the bin Laden family fortune, leading Al Qaeda to rely thereafter on a \"a core group of financial facilitators\" based in the Persian Gulf \"and particularly in Saudi Arabia\" for funding.

And for years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this problem.\" The authors argued that a connection between Saudi donors and Al Qaeda is logical for several reasons:", "Saudi Arabia possesses the greatest concentration of wealth in the region; Saudi nationals and charities were previously the most important sources of funds for the mujahideen [fighters against the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan]; Saudi nationals have always constituted a disproportionate percentage of Al Qaeda's own membership; and Al Qaeda's political message has long focused on issues of particular interest to Saudi nationals, especially those who are disenchanted with their own government [emphasis added].", "The report grouped Saudi Arabia with Pakistan, Egypt, and other Gulf states and regional financial centers as \"source and transit countries,\" implying that donations to terrorist causes not only originate in these countries but also that donations from other countries pass through them en route to terrorist organizations.

The report acknowledged the Saudi government's announcement of \"the enactment or promulgation of a profusion of new laws and regulations and the creation of new institutional arrangements... intended to tighten controls over the principal modalities of terrorist financing.\" The report welcomed the steps and concluded that \"on a comparative basis\" Saudi Arabia had taken \"more decisive legal and regulatory action to combat terrorist financing than many other Muslim states.\"", "The second report also identified several areas in which its authors argued that Saudi authorities could have done more to combat terrorist financing. It argued that additional action was essential \"because of the fundamental centrality that persons and organizations based in Saudi Arabia have had in financing militant Islamist groups on a global basis.\" The report cited a lack of publicly available enforcement information as the basis for its questions about the Saudi government's commitment to implement its new terrorist financing laws and regulations. For example, the report specifically criticized the Saudi government's \"failure to punish, in a demonstrable manner, specific and identified leaders of charities found to be funneling money to militant Islamist organizations.\" Saudi authorities claimed at the time to have prosecuted five individuals \"for terror financing\" and frozen the assets \"of number of other individuals.\"", "In response to the second report's release, Adel Al Jubeir, then-foreign policy advisor to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and chief Saudi spokesman, charged that the task force's conclusions were \"politically motivated, ill-informed, and factually incorrect.\" A Treasury Department spokesperson reportedly agreed with the report's assertion that Saudi Arabia should take further steps to combat terrorist financing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The September 11 Lawsuit", "paragraphs": ["In mid-August 2002, the families of more than 600 victims of the September 11 attacks filed a suit for approximately $1 trillion against three members of the Saudi royal family, a number of financial institutions and individuals, and the government of Sudan.
