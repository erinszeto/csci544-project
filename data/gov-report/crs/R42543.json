The act allocated 10 MHz of additional radio frequency spectrum to accommodate the new network and required that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assign a license to FirstNet, comprising the newly designated frequencies plus 10 MHz previously assigned to states by the FCC for public safety use. In addition, the act designated federal appropriations of over $7 billion for the network and other public safety needs. These funds are provided through new revenue from the auction of licenses to the commercial sector in other spectrum bands.", "The establishment of FirstNet is an important step toward reaching what has been a national goal since September 11, 2001: the provision of interoperable communications for first responders. The immediate goal for FirstNet is to provide a broadband network nationwide to carry data, although it will provide an option for voice communications as well. The cost of constructing and maintaining a nationwide network is estimated by many experts to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the long term. The law anticipates that most of these costs will be covered by partnerships between FirstNet and the private sector in return for commercial access to FirstNet's spectrum.", "In order to maintain control over the quality and nature of communications, many states are likely to continue to invest in and maintain their own Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks that operate on narrowband frequencies under the jurisdiction of state and local public safety agencies. Information available to the public indicates that FirstNet intends to discourage states from building and operating their own networks within FirstNet, in part by limiting the amount of spectrum available for this purpose. FirstNet has taken the position that state autonomy in network design decisions and management will jeopardize FirstNet's ability to provide a network that meets its coverage and service goals.", "P.L. 112-96 was signed into law on February 22, 2012, setting in motion the process of setting up FirstNet as an \"independent authority within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration,\" as required by the act; laying out the parameters for partnerships and state, tribal, and federal participation; and meeting requirements either statutory or practical. After extensive consultation with stakeholders and potential partners in preparing proposals for partnering with FirstNet, the initial phases of organization culminated with the deadline for submitting proposals to build and operate the nationwide network, on May 31, 2016.", "On November 21, 2016, one of the FirstNet bidders eliminated from consideration, Rivada Mercury, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals of Federal Claims over what Rivada says is the illegal and wrongful exclusion of the consortium from the FirstNet procurement process. The lawsuit is expected to delay the contract award until March 1, 2017, at the earliest, although further delays are possible depending on the resolution of the lawsuit.", "Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will have up to 180 days to deliver detailed deployment plans to each state and territory. Governors will then have 90 days to decide whether to opt in to FirstNet or to opt out and build their own Radio Access Network which must be interoperable with FirstNet. As FirstNet becomes operational, the potential level of public safety agency participation should be better understood, providing opportunities to evaluate the success of FirstNet in meeting the goals Congress set for it in 2012. The 115th Congress will likely continue monitoring the development and deployment of FirstNet through periodic hearings in both the House and Senate."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) is a federal agency that includes private sector and other non-federal representation on its board of directors. FirstNet was created by Congress with provisions in Title VI (Spectrum Act) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) to ensure the deployment and operation of a nationwide, broadband network for public safety communications. It is established as an \"independent authority\" within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the Department of Commerce.", "In addition to establishing the structure and goals for FirstNet, Congress provided $7 billion for costs related to planning and deploying the broadband network, and a $135 million grant program to assist states with plans to connect to FirstNet's broadband network. These funds are provided from revenue realized through auctioning licenses for radio frequency spectrum, as designated in the act. The anticipated cost of building and operating a nationwide core broadband network\u2014and the interoperable radio networks that connect to it\u2014is significantly in excess of the amount appropriated. The act therefore provides for public-private partnerships with FirstNet or with states, and for fees (charged to states and other users) to ensure that FirstNet becomes self-sustaining. To attract private sector partners, FirstNet can offer access to its assets, including radio frequency spectrum capacity, in return for financial payment or other support. FirstNet holds a license for 20 MHz of broadband spectrum, assigned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as required by the act. The act allows states that meet specified requirements to lease spectrum from FirstNet and thereby negotiate their own partnerships that share spectrum in Radio Area Networks for their state or region. The act requires that FirstNet deploy its network using the fourth-generation wireless technologies of Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is a powerful cellular technology with industry standards that are consistently being upgraded to expand its capabilities. LTE is also a platform for commercial carrier-expansion into fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications and the Internet of Things.", "There are many challenges for public safety leaders and policymakers in establishing the framework for a nationwide network that meets state, local, tribal, and territorial needs for robust, interoperable emergency communications. Currently, for example, state emergency communications needs are typically met by separate networks using different technologies. Furthermore, each state has its own laws and procedures for building, managing, and funding communications infrastructure. Among the challenges facing FirstNet is establishing a governance model that accommodates current investments and future needs of its clients without compromising the coherence of a national network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Request for Proposal and Latest Developments", "paragraphs": ["FirstNet officials face enormous pressure to produce a functional network in a timely manner, reflecting widespread concerns that public safety communications will not be adequate for response and recovery if a catastrophic national emergency occurs. Among the timelines that the winning bidder must meet is geographical coverage for 95% of the country within six months of receiving the contract. This obligation suggests that participation of one of the four nationwide carriers (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile) to carry FirstNet traffic will be essential, even if the carrier acts as a subcontractor and not a lead partner. Agreements with rural carriers may also be used to meet rural coverage goals. The winning contractor must guarantee priority access to public safety on the 20 MHz of spectrum capacity that FirstNet brings to the table. The requirements for buildout using FirstNet spectrum (referred to as Band 14) are 20% coverage of population within the first year of operation and 60% coverage within two years.", "Also within six months, the winning contractor is expected to submit simultaneously to 56 states and territories, as required by the act, a plan for how FirstNet would be deployed within that state or territory (tribal areas are covered in state plans). FirstNet will make available $6.5 billion of its federal funding for the buildout. The bidder must indicate the cost of each state's buildout within the context of its cost model. States that successfully meet the criteria to build their own network within FirstNet will be eligible for a proportionate share of the $6.5 billion, provided in the form of a grant. The total cost to build out the network is estimated by most experts to be in excess of $30 billion over 10 years.", "The successful bidder will sign a contract for 25 years, expiring in FY2042.

This document proposed a comprehensive broadband network solution for FirstNet that would reach from core network management requirements to include local area networks in many communities, as well as some devices used to access the network. A Second Notice , issued by the Department of Commerce for comment on March 9, 2015, provided FirstNet's perspective on the intent of Congress in enacting language that allows states to build their own networks. The discussion in the Second Notice also supplemented the Public Notice on Statutory Interpretations , issued in September 2014. A number of important issues are raised in these formal statements of proposed interpretation, including possible definitions of \"public safety\" and \"rural.\" ", "A third public notice concerning the definition of \"public safety\" was released after a FirstNet board meeting on April 24, 2015. Also on April 24, the proposed acquisition approach and the draft Request for Proposal(s) (RFP) were considered in a closed meeting. The draft RFP builds on proposals from previous notices and RFIs. The planning process for 2015-2016 centered on circulating the draft Request for Proposal(s) and a final RFP. FirstNet concluded that the contract or contracts would be awarded through the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) process. ", "According to FirstNet, \"key goals are to meet the needs of public safety and to provide extensive coverage so Federal subscribers and other public safety users can count on the network when they are on the job.\" Network coverage includes deployable units, such as vehicles equipped to connect with the network, and local area networks operated by FirstNet. \"Incident commanders and officials will have local control over the network so, for example, they can assign users and talk groups and determine who can access applications.\" The underlying premise of the strategy is that the chosen network solutions will allow FirstNet to \"control and operate\" national and regional core network infrastructure, Radio Access Networks (RANs) in states that opt in, as well as devices, applications, and other functions. To achieve this level of coverage, FirstNet's \"acquisition strategy centers on maximizing the network's value to public safety while meeting its financial sustainability obligations under the Act.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Network Design", "paragraphs": ["Although many details have not been made public, the general architecture of FirstNet's broadband network has been presented at numerous public events and is available on the FirstNet website. The network design shows what is referred to as a heterogeneous network, or HetNet. It depicts the Radio Access Network to include both macro and micro networks. In simple terms, high towers with base stations, known as eNodeB in LTE network design, are referred to by the wireless industry as a macro network; a variety of small cell network designs are referred to as micro networks. The macro network is often described as providing coverage over distance and the micro network as providing capacity as well as extra coverage at the local level. ", "The trend in the evolution of network coverage is depicted in Figure 1 . In this configuration, the micro network has become the predominate provider of mobile communications coverage and capacity through contiguous small cell networks. The tower of the macro network (eNodeB) assures nationwide connectivity and provides additional coverage. Small cell networks are by and large autonomous, providing coverage for their area and connecting to other small cell networks or cellular towers when needed. These micro networks are local in nature but fully interoperable across wide geographic areas. For FirstNet, a network strategy that shifts the majority of routine, public safety mobile communications onto shared spectrum in small cell networks will free much of the 20 MHz spectrum license for secondary use by commercial carriers. Only in times of a major emergency would public safety users make heavy demands on the macro network and spectrum licensed to FirstNet. ", "In an LTE network, it is the eNodeB macro coverage infrastructure\u2014not the micro network\u2014that requires a significant spectrum assignment to operate efficiently. During the period 2011-2012, when the Spectrum Act was drafted and enacted, the Radio Area Network would have consisted primarily of high-site towers with base stations (eNodeB). Since the Spectrum Act was passed, communications technologies have evolved in ways not fully anticipated at the time. Congress, therefore, may have assumed that a state with a successful plan to opt out and create its own public-private partnership would be granted a statewide license for 20 MHz to operate a Radio Area Network using eNodeB towers and base stations. Micro networks, however, can operate within the 20 MHz assignment, essentially sharing the spectrum, but may require no more than 1.5 x 1.5 MHz for a basic LTE network. Therefore, if FirstNet decides that only micro network capacity will be made available for a state-operated Radio Area Network, then the state will have a sub-license for a relatively small amount of spectrum that may be difficult\u2014perhaps impossible\u2014to leverage in a public-private partnership. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Public Safety Radio Networks", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, state and local agencies\u2014aided by federal grant programs\u2014have invested in improving the reliability and interoperability of mission critical voice communications over Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks. The 2014 National Emergency Communications Plan prepared by the Department of Homeland Security emphasizes the need to continue investment in these networks to provide communication for first responders until such time as FirstNet is deployed and capable of handling mission-critical voice communications over broadband. These networks may also be essential for local and state backup service when access to FirstNet has been preempted by a large-scale emergency, or they may be an alternative to using FirstNet.

Consultation will be through a state-selected coordinator as specified in the act. Appointment of an individual or governmental body as the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) is required as a condition of state participation and eligibility to receive grants established by the act. ", "Every state has one or more agencies that plan for public safety, homeland security, and emergency communications. To be eligible for grants from the Department of Homeland Security, a state establishes a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) to administer its Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (SCIP). SCIPs are written to conform with federal guidelines and requirements, such as the National Emergency Communications Plan. States may decide to use the existing SWIC as the required single point-of-contact or may choose to appoint a separate coordinator. Each state and other participants have appointed a coordinator to work directly with FirstNet. The coordinator (SPOC) is responsible for managing FirstNet activities in his or her state. Often this includes revising the existing SCIP to include broadband communications. ", "The governor of each state is to be notified by FirstNet when it has completed its requests for proposals regarding construction, operation, maintenance, and improvement of a nationwide network. The governor or his designee will receive the details of the proposed plans and notification of the amount of funding available to the state if it participates in the FirstNet program. ", "The act only identifies two options for a state: join FirstNet or build a statewide Radio Access Network subject to the provisions of the act. The act does not include specific provisions for a state that chooses to build its own Radio Access Network without opting out of FirstNet, although providing such an option may be within FirstNet's charter. A state might, for example, choose to build its own data management center or mobile access routers while also sharing FirstNet's infrastructure for regional and national coverage. The act also is silent on whether states may choose to opt out of the broadband network entirely, choosing neither to join FirstNet nor to build a broadband network on the frequencies assigned to FirstNet. Some states may prefer to concentrate their resources on improving mission-critical voice networks and acquire broadband access from a commercial provider or through other means. FirstNet, through its partners, intends to provide service in all states, even if a state chooses not to be a customer or otherwise participate in the network. ", "The Spectrum Act specifies that a state that chooses to build its own Radio Access Network must submit an alternative plan for construction, operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Radio Access Network within the state. The state has 90 days to agree to participate or to notify FirstNet, the NTIA, and the FCC of its intent to deploy its own part of the Radio Access Network, and an additional 180 days to provide its plan to the FCC. The state must demonstrate to the FCC, which the law requires to review the plan, that its planned Radio Access Network would comply with minimum technical requirements and be interoperable with FirstNet. ", "If a state's plan is approved it will be eligible to apply for a grant, administered by the NTIA, that will be funded from the Network Construction Fund created by the act. The amount available may be less than what would have been provided if the state had opted in to the FirstNet program, because the grant will be applied only toward building the Radio Access Network and may be subject to matching grant requirements. Approval of the grant is contingent on meeting additional requirements established by the NTIA, including sustainability, timeliness, cost-effectiveness, security, coverage, and services that are comparable to FirstNet. The state would be required to pay a user fee for access to FirstNet's core network. It would not be permitted to enter commercial markets or lease access to its network except through a public-private partnership. FirstNet has determined that any revenue to the state from a partnership must be used only for costs associated with its participation in FirstNet. If a state's plan meets FCC and NTIA requirements, then the NTIA may approve lease authority for FirstNet to grant a sub-license to a state, to operate on some portion of the FirstNet spectrum.

If a state's plan has met the initial approval of the FCC, it must then demonstrate to the NTIA that it meets technical and financial requirements. To the general parameters provided in the Spectrum Act, the NTIA has added several specific criteria for states that parallel requirements for contractors, including:", "The State Alternative Plan Proposal submission and the related request for a spectrum lease will be treated as a single request for a grant (even though the state may choose not to request a grant as described in the Spectrum Act) in accordance with provisions of the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-224 ). The forthcoming Federal Funding Opportunity announcement will include additional details regarding the technical capabilities required of a state, in addition to those published in the July 19 notice. States must submit their application to the NTIA within 60 days of FCC approval of the alternative plan. State network plans must adhere to the same policies as those applied to FirstNet. States will be required to provide information on how it will manage its Radio Access Network, including, for example, its staffing plan and budget documents. States must disclose partnership agreements and address funding risks; NTIA may require surety bonds to ensure network construction is completed. Deadlines for the state plan must match those presented in FirstNet's plan for the state. A state plan that relies on new buildouts of the network (\"greenfield\") might not qualify as cost effective.

This decision, if implemented, represents a change in an earlier statement that proposes including the eNode B as part of the Radio Area Network. Provide local area network capacity and connections as an extension of FirstNet, limiting state authority to providing fill-in capacity for some under-served areas. Assign to FirstNet contractors the responsibility of identifying additional partners or subcontractors to act under the authority of the contractor; this might include, for example, negotiating an agreement with a local power company for access to its infrastructure.

These costs include the continued operation and possible expansion of state and local LMR voice networks; the cost of integration of LMR and broadband infrastructure; the costs of forfeiting to FirstNet the potential economies of scale in network construction and operation; and the cost of lost opportunities for competition and innovation in wireless services at the state and local level.

It claims that a federalized network is the \"only solution\" that meets its goals of providing nationwide coverage, interoperability, and assured access. In the Second Notice it concludes that allowing populous states to opt out of FirstNet and build their own public safety broadband networks, monetizing the value of the 20 MHz of spectrum assigned for that purpose, will beggar their more rural neighbors who cannot so readily capture the value of excess capacity. This is a presumption of market failure that is not supported by information made public by FirstNet and is inconsistent with the many positive analyses of the economic value of small cell networks, community broadband, and the Internet of Things. ", "The value of economies of scale in building and operating wireless networks has long been recognized by telecommunications experts and policymakers. The FCC, for example, has modified its policies to make it easier for wireless companies to expand through mergers and acquisitions in order to benefit from scale economies. These and related FCC decisions are based on, among other considerations, improving coverage through macro networks to customers for wireless services. When FirstNet refers to the importance of economies of scale, it is apparently referring to geographic coverage through macro networks.", "The economics for small cell networks, however, enable profitability by providing economies of scope, with many different types of services to multiple customer segments in a small area. Economies are provided not through macro network coverage but by micro network capacity to accommodate many customers with different technology needs. Many wireless network experts believe that dense deployments of small cells in an area served by a single eNodeB tower will increase efficiency and reduce costs while increasing capacity to handle many different markets.", "Although urbanized areas are seen by many as the primary market for expanding small cell services, the benefits may also be important in rural or remote areas. Experts suggest that, in addition to serving public safety, a rural small cell configuration could support, for example, transportation improvements, education, job search, agricultural and forestry management, new efficiencies in municipal government and services, and economic growth. Economies of scale at the macro level may also be available in states with a low population density. A cost-effective network solution may be achieved by adjacent states combining their resources to provide coverage with eNodeBs and maximizing the utility of small cell networks at the local level. For state and local public safety agencies, maximizing the value of spectrum may be less important than achieving sufficient levels of scale and scope to meet their requirements.", "FirstNet refers to the need to monetize the value of its spectrum holdings to expand coverage, based on the existing commercial footprint for LTE, not the footprint of statewide or local public safety networks. It does not estimate the value to states and communities of small cell networks and the wireless component of community broadband that may be transferred to FirstNet's commercial partners. FirstNet's plans appear to capture for its own use most of the value of spectrum used to provide both coverage and capacity. This value is unknown but potentially far greater than what FirstNet can lawfully spend on improving its network or by reducing user fees. The excess value of the spectrum and access to local markets that FirstNet is using to barter for goods and services, therefore, will in most cases go to FirstNet's contractual partners, not to the states and communities intended by the act to be the primary beneficiaries of FirstNet's actions.

Instead of negotiating with each state or regional network, federal agencies need only negotiate with FirstNet to gain immediate access to the entire network; National reach in times of emergency and assured access to federal incident commanders and officials; Economies of Scale.

Although contractors may, after receiving a contract, negotiate with states and localities for access to their assets, the value and availability of those assets have not been openly stated in the FirstNet planning process; Displacement of local competitors by the FirstNet contractor in local and state broadband development. Smaller communities may not be able to generate sufficient business for two or more broadband service providers. To achieve financially viable programs, they might be restricted to using the incumbent (FirstNet) provider; Displacement of partners for broadband development. Desirable partners (such as a rural utility) may not be available for local projects because of contractual obligations to FirstNet; Loss of market power for state public safety customers.

The OIG did not specifically review activities of the NTIA Office of Public Safety Communications, created to assist FirstNet with administrative tasks, including staffing.", "The OIG review determined that nearly $11 million had been inappropriately spent, much of it going for consulting work that did not meet contractual definitions of deliverables. The OIG referred to this consulting work as \"work products\" and questioned the expenditures. The DOC responded that it conducted relevant contracting activities in accordance with federal procurement laws and regulations and monitored performance, and that the contracts produced \"first-rate feasibility research, technical analysis, strategic planning, and outreach services from highly specialized consultants, whose work product has laid the groundwork for executing FirstNet's mission.\" ", "The OIG made recommendations to the Secretary, the General Counsel, the Chair of FirstNet, and the DOC's Senior Procurement Official regarding various procedures and responsibilities. A joint response from FirstNet, the NTIA, and the General Counsel concurred with the specific recommendations from the OIG, although not all the findings. In general, they defended their actions in the context of unique requirements and time constraints in setting up FirstNet. ", "The OIG review covered a limited range of issues linked to oversight procedures. Although it did not go into detail, the OIG noted \"inconsistent administration\" and several instances of significant time lags in the performance of DOC officials. For example, \"6 months after the Board began regular meetings, senior NTIA and Office of General Counsel officials were still debating [the monitoring] of potential conflicts of interest.\" OIG found that most of the lapses occurred in the year after the FirstNet board held its first official meeting in September 2012.

The FCC manages commercial and non-federal spectrum use, including spectrum allocated to public safety. The NTIA manages federal spectrum resources and, along with NIST, is an agency within the Department of Commerce. OEC is part of the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, Department of Homeland Security. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spectrum Assignment", "paragraphs": ["Radio frequency spectrum is an essential resource for wireless communications. The energy in electronic telecommunications transmissions converts electro-magnetic spectrum (airwaves) into signals to deliver voice, text, and images. These signal frequencies are allocated for specific purposes, such as television broadcasting or WiFi, and assigned to specific users through licenses. Allocating sufficient spectrum for wireless emergency communications has long been a concern for Congress. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), for example, directed the FCC to allocate 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use.", "With the passage of the Spectrum Act, some existing public safety licenses in the 700 MHz band and an additional license for commercial use (known as the D Block) \u2014together totaling 22 MHz\u2014have been re-designated by Congress for a federal license for paired spectrum at 758-768 MHz and 788-798 MHz, plus guard bands at 768-769 MHz and 798-799 MHz to mitigate interference from adjacent channels. As required by the act, the initial, 10-year license to use these frequencies was assigned by the FCC to FirstNet. It is renewable for an additional 10 years, on condition that FirstNet has met its duties and obligations under the act. ", "A total of 34 MHz of spectrum capacity will therefore be available for public safety networks within the 700 MHz band: the 22 MHz designated for broadband, and 12 MHz allocated for narrowband communications, primarily voice. Additionally, there are public safety networks on adjacent frequencies within the 800 MHz band. Time and technological advances may someday bring these spectrum assets together, but at present there are three distinct public safety network technologies in use or planned within the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands. These are broadband communications at 700 MHz; interoperable narrowband communications at 700 MHz; and narrowband communications at 800 MHz. Some of the narrowband networks at 700 MHz and 800 MHz can share infrastructure and radios but older narrowband networks at 800 MHz are often not easily integrated with narrowband networks being built on 700 MHz frequencies. ", "The act also gives the FCC the authority to \" ... allow the narrowband spectrum to be used in a flexible manner, including usage for public safety broadband communications ... \" subject to technical and interference protection measures. States, therefore, might be able to convert some existing narrowband networks to broadband use in addition to service from FirstNet. ", "The act requires that public safety users return frequencies known as the T-Band. These are frequencies between 470 and 512 MHz allocated for television that have been made available for public safety use in 11 urban areas. Since the transition to digital television, radio transmissions on some of these frequency assignments have experienced interference and the public safety agencies that use them are considering moving to new networks at 700 MHz. Other areas have recently invested to upgrade networks built on the T-Band frequencies and are concerned about the loss of this communications capacity. The act requires that the FCC act by February 2021 to establish a relocation plan that would free up the T-Band for reassignment through competitive bidding. Proceeds from the auctions of T-Band frequencies are to be available for grants to cover relocation costs. There are no requirements in the law as to how the NTIA, the designated grants administrator, is to structure the grant program or determine eligible costs. The law also does not address technical complications that may arise because of adjacent commercial assignments not included in the rebanding. ", "Some of the earliest spectrum assignments for public safety are in channels below 512 MHz. Public safety and other license-holders in designated channels below 512 MHz are required to reband their holdings to conform to an FCC mandate to improve spectrum efficiency. This narrowbanding requirement, as it is called, requires that assigned channels be reduced from a width of 25 kHz to 12.5 kHz, thereby freeing up new spectrum capacity for public safety and other uses. The deadline to meet the narrowbanding requirement was January 1, 2013.

Callers to 911, however, generally assume that the newer technologies they are using to place a call are matched by the same level of technology at the 911 call centers, known as Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). However, this is not always the case. To modernize the system to provide the quality of service that approaches the expectations of its users will require that the PSAPs and state, local, and possibly federal emergency communications authorities invest in new technologies. As envisioned by most stakeholders, these new technologies\u2014collectively referred to as Next Generation 911 or NG9-1-1\u2014should incorporate Internet Protocol standards. An IP-enabled emergency communications network that supports 911 will facilitate interoperability and system resilience; improve connections between 911 call centers; provide more robust capacity; and offer flexibility in receiving and managing calls. The same network can also serve wireless broadband communications for public safety and other emergency personnel, as well as other purposes.

The act does not state whether roaming agreements may be negotiated by states that opt out and receive spectrum leases from the NTIA to operate their own Radio Access networks. Agreements might also cover rules for priority access in times of high demand for network capacity. Priority access can take several forms, such as \"ruthless pre-emption,\" in which non-public-safety transmissions are immediately terminated to make way for emergency communications, or negotiated priority agreements that might, for example, place public safety users at the head of the line for network access as capacity becomes available. The act stipulates that the FCC's authority may not require roaming or priority access unless (1) the public safety and commercial networks are technically compatible; (2) the commercial network is reasonably compensated; and (3) access does not preempt or otherwise terminate or degrade existing traffic on the commercial network. Within these limits, the FCC appears to have some leeway to use its regulatory authority to support public safety in negotiations with partners. The FCC cannot, under the act, mandate ruthless pre-emption, although the act does not preclude contractual negotiations that would allow it.", "The act's provisions for roaming and priority access do not require a commercial vendor to make additional investments to insure technical compatibility, and the act's language might be interpreted as precluding an FCC mandate to that effect.
