Since then, Congress has committed more than $5 billion in bilateral aid to the Palestinians, who rely heavily on external donor assistance.", "Under the Trump Administration, U.S. policy toward the Palestinians has shifted. In 2018, the Administration significantly cut U.S. funding for the Palestinians, closed the PLO's representative office in Washington, DC, and merged the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem (which had dealt independently with the Palestinians for decades) into a single diplomatic mission with the U.S. embassy to Israel.", "Some of these moves relate to an increase in U.S.-Palestinian tensions stemming from the Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (in December 2017) and transfer of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (in May 2018). In response to the Administration's policy changes on Jerusalem, PLO Chairman and PA President Mahmoud Abbas has broken off high-level political contacts with the Administration, and the Administration reportedly is seeking leverage to persuade Abbas to renew bilateral discussions. Meanwhile, the PLO has filed suit in 2018 to have the International Court of Justice order the United States to remove its embassy from Jerusalem.", "Even before tensions increased under the Trump Administration, lack of progress toward peace with Israel had led the PLO to advocate the Palestinian cause in international fora. The Palestinians obtained membership in the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2011, and a 2012 resolution in the U.N. General Assembly identified \"Palestine\" as a \"non-member state.\" Palestinians also have applied international legal pressure on Israel. The Palestinians acceded to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in April 2015, and the ICC could conceivably investigate Israeli, Palestinian, or other individuals for alleged crimes committed in the West Bank and Gaza.", "Conducting relations with the Palestinians has presented challenges for several Administrations and Congresses. The United States has historically sought to bolster PA President Abbas vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas (a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization supported in part by Iran). Since 2007, Hamas has had de facto control over Gaza. The Abbas-led PA still exercises limited self-rule over specified areas of the West Bank. Given Abbas's age (he was born in 1935) and questions regarding his health, observers speculate about who will succeed him and about the implications for the current situation of divided rule in the West Bank and Gaza.", "Gaza also presents a dilemma. Severe humanitarian and economic problems persist there, and it is a small, population-dense territory that has been the site of three major conflicts between Palestinian militants and Israel over the past decade (2008-2009, 2012, and 2014). Israel and Egypt maintain tight control over access to and from Gaza. They seem reluctant to significantly open Gaza's borders because of concerns about bolstering Hamas. Fatah and Hamas have agreed in principle numerous times to reinstate unified PA rule over the West Bank and Gaza, but Abbas has maintained that he will not accept responsibility in Gaza if Hamas's militia remains intact. Hamas and other Palestinian militants have turned to a range of violent actions, seeking an arrangement in which Israel eases restrictions on access to and from Gaza in exchange for a long-term cease-fire.

Although in 1947 the United Nations intended to create two states in Palestine\u2014one Jewish and one Arab\u2014only the Jewish state came into being. Varying explanations for the failure to found an Arab state alongside a Jewish state in mandatory Palestine place blame on the British, the Zionists, neighboring Arab states, the Palestinians themselves, or some combination of these groups. ", "As the state of Israel won its independence in 1947-1948, roughly 700,000 Palestinians were driven or fled from their homes, an occurrence Palestinians call the nakba (\"catastrophe\"). Many ended up in neighboring states (Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan) or in Gulf states such as Kuwait. Palestinians remaining in Israel became Israeli citizens. Those who were in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza were subject to Jordanian and Egyptian administration, respectively. With their population in disarray, and no clear hierarchical structure or polity to govern their affairs, Palestinians' interests were largely represented by Arab states who had conflicting interests.", "1967 was a watershed year for the Palestinians. In the June Six-Day War, Israel decisively defeated the Arab states who had styled themselves as the Palestinians' protectors, seizing East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip (as well as the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria). Thus, Israel gained control over the entire area that constituted Palestine under the British Mandate. Israel's territorial gains provided buffer zones between Israel's main Jewish population centers and its traditional Arab state antagonists. These buffer zones remain an important part of the Israeli strategic calculus to this day.", "After the 1967 war, Israel only effectively annexed East Jerusalem (as well as the Golan Heights), leaving the West Bank and Gaza under military occupation. However, both territories became increasingly economically linked with Israel. Furthermore, Israel presided over the settlement of thousands of Jewish civilians in both territories (although many more in the West Bank than Gaza)\u2014officially initiating some of these projects and assuming security responsibility for all of them. Settlement of the West Bank increased markedly once the Likud Party, with its vision of a \"Greater Israel\" extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, took power in 1977. Having Israelis settle in the West Bank presented some economic and cultural opportunities for Palestinians, but also new challenges to their identity and cohesion, civil rights, and territorial contiguity. These challenges persist and have since intensified. ", "The Arab states' defeat in 1967, and Israeli rule and settlement of the West Bank and Gaza, allowed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to emerge as the representative of Palestinian national aspirations. Founded in 1964 as an umbrella organization of Palestinian factions and militias in exile under the aegis of the League of Arab States (Arab League), the PLO asserted its own identity after the Six-Day War by staging guerrilla raids against Israel from Jordanian territory. The late Yasser Arafat and his Fatah movement gained leadership of the PLO in 1969, and the PLO subsequently achieved international prominence on behalf of the Palestinian national cause\u2014representing both the refugees and those under Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza. Often this prominence came infamously from acts of terrorism and militancy.", "Although Jordan forced the PLO to relocate to Lebanon in the early 1970s, and Israel forced it to move from Lebanon to Tunisia in 1982, the organization and its influence survived. In 1987, Palestinians inside the West Bank and Gaza rose up in opposition to Israeli occupation (the first intifada , or uprising), leading to increased international attention and sympathy for the Palestinians' situation. In December 1988, as the intifada continued, Arafat initiated dialogue with the United States by renouncing violence, promising to recognize Israel's right to exist, and accepting the \"land-for-peace\" principle embodied in U.N. Security Council Resolution 242. Arafat's turn to diplomacy with the United States and Israel may have been partly motivated by concerns that if the PLO's leadership could not be repatriated from exile, its legitimacy with Palestinians might be overtaken by local leaders of the intifada in the West Bank and Gaza (which included Hamas). These concerns intensified when Arafat lost much of his Arab state support following his political backing for Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

In response, Israel took actions that it asserted were necessary to safeguard its citizens' security, rendering unusable much of the PA infrastructure built over the preceding decade. During the second intifada, U.S.- and internationally supported efforts to restart peace negotiations under various auspices failed to gain traction.

The limited self-rule regime of the PA was undermined further by Hamas's legislative election victory in 2006, and its takeover of Gaza in 2007.

Security Council Resolution 242 and to contemplate recognizing Israel's right to exist.
