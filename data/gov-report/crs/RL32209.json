The term \"armed forces\" includesstrategic, land, naval, air, command, administration, and support forces. It also includes paramilitaryforces such as the gendarmerie , as well as customs service and border guards if these are trained inmilitary tactics, equipped as a military force and operate under military authority in the event of awar.

The 2003-2004 edition of The Military Balance contains military expenditure figures from 2002, while the mostrecent edition of the U.S. State Department's WMEAT contains military expenditure figures from1999. The IISS obtains its figures using data from national governments, the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO), the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, consistent and accurate data formany countries are not available even from these sources, as many countries neither publish theirmilitary expenditures nor report them accurately to these organizations. In these cases, the IISSestimates military expenditures \"based on information from several sources.\" (3) Such cases aremarked with an \"E\" on Table 1 and Table 2 in this report.", "For most countries, the IISS converts budget data into dollars using current exchange rates in US Dollars. For countries where basic economic data are hard to obtain, such as former commandeconomies like China, Russia, or countries in conflict, the IISS uses purchasing power parity (PPP)estimates for its conversions. PPPs measure the relative purchasing power of different currenciesover equivalent goods and services.

Inthis definition, a) civilian-related expenditures of defense ministries are excluded and military-relatedexpenditures of other ministries are included; b) grant military assistance is included in theexpenditures of the donor country; c) purchases of military equipment for credit are included at thetime the debt is incurred, not at the time of payment.", "For most other countries, figures represent the expenditures of the ministry of defense. When these are known to include the costs of internal security, an attempt is made to remove suchexpenditures. A wide variety of data sources is used for these countries, including the publicationsand data resources of other U.S. Government agencies, standardized reporting to the United Nationsby country, and other international sources.

Figures for China are based on U.S. Government estimatesof the yuan costs of Chinese forces, weapons, programs, and activities. WMEAT warns that figuresfor Chinese military spending should be treated as having a wide margin of error.
