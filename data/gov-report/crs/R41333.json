Violations of Section 2339A are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years; violations of Section 2339B by imprisonment for not more than 20 years. Although neither section creates a civil cause of action for victims, treble damages and attorneys' fees may be available for some victims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a72333.

One is general (there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over an offense under this section) and the other descriptive (there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over an offender under this section if the offender is a U.S. national, etc.). Section 2339A has no such provisions, but it is likely applicable overseas at least in cases in which its predicate offenses have extraterritorial reach.

Section 2339A passed with little fanfare as part of a wide-ranging crime package, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Almost immediately thereafter, Congress amended Section 2339A and supplemented it with Section 2339B as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). As the House committee report explained, new Section 2339B reflected a recognition of", "the fungibility of financial resources and other types of material support. Allowing an individual to supply funds, goods, or services to an organization, or to any of its subgroups, that draw significant funding from the main organization's treasury, helps defray the costs to the terrorist organization of running the ostensibly legitimate activities. This in turn frees an equal sum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.", "In 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act amended both sections, increasing the maximum term of imprisonment from 10 to 15 years (and to life imprisonment when commission of the offense resulted in death); adding \"expert advice or assistance\" to forms of proscribed material support or resources; and subjecting attempts and conspiracies to violate Section 2339A to the same maximum penalties as the substantive violation of the section.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of \"material support or resources\" that applies to both sections. The specific forms of support that had been used to define the term became examples of a more general definition which covers \"any property, tangible or intangible, or service.\" Clarifying definitions of the examples \"training\" and \"expert advice or assistance,\" were added, as was a clarifying explanation of the term \"personnel\" as used in Section 2339B. At the same time, the predicate offense list of Section 2339A was expanded to cover any of the federal crimes of terrorism.", "In 2009, Congress added genocide and recruiting child soldiers to Section 2339A's predicate offense list and adjusted Section 2339B's deadlines for the government's interlocutory appeals relating to classified information. In 2015, it increased the maximum penalty for violations of Section 2339B from imprisonment for not more than 15 years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years.

This occurred most often for regulatory, \"public welfare\" misconduct, misconduct that did not constitute a common law crime. These offenses ordinarily carried fines or relatively short periods of incarceration. Courts and commentators came to associate the absence of a mens rea with less severely punished offenses.", "The Supreme Court has stopped short of equating felony status with the intent to require a mens rea component. In Staples , however, it declared that where \"dispensing with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful conduct , a severe penalty is a further factor extending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a mens rea requirement. In such a case, the usual presumption that a defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal should apply.\"", "Section 2339A speaks to \"whoever provides\" material support. Unlike Section 2339B, it does not say \"whoever knowingly provides\" material support. Thus, on its face, it might be thought to envelop both those who knowingly provide support and those who unknowingly or inadvertently provide support. Yet, Staples suggests that the courts will reject such an interpretation in the absence of a clear congressional contrary intent. Section 2339A offenses are 15-year felonies. This seems to weigh heavily on the implied mens rea side of the ledger. The nature of the support provided might suggest a more mixed result. Some of the support, like providing lodging or training, is a form of \"traditionally lawful conduct.\" Some, like providing false documentation, is not. The most telling indication of Congress's intent, however, appears later in the section where Congress has supplied an explicit mens rea requirement. Providing support only violates the section if it is provided \"knowing or intending\" that the support will be used to commit or prepare for the commission of a predicate offense. A defendant cannot unknowingly provide support or resources while at the same time \"know[] or intend[] that they are to be used\" for the commission of one of the predicate offenses.", "As general rule, a \"knowing\" mens rea standard requires the government to prove that the defendant had \"knowledge of the facts that constituted the offense.\" The government need not prove that the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provides", "paragraphs": ["Little is said of the meaning of the word \"provides\" in Section 2339A or Section 2339B.

Mere preparation is not enough. \"To constitute a substantial step, a defendant's actions must cross the line between preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances.\" It is no defense that, unbeknownst to the defendant, commission of the underlying offense was impossible, as for example because he was dealing with government undercover agents rather than agents of a foreign terrorist organization. An attempt to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B and actually providing such assistance are punished the same: imprisonment for not more than 20 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from the commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization) (or not more than twice the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense).", "Conspiracy to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B is the agreement to provide such support. The offense is complete upon assent; the support need only be planned, not delivered. Moreover, each of the conspirators is liable not only for the conspiracy, but for any other foreseeable offense committed by any of the conspirators in furtherance of the overall scheme. Like attempt, conspiracy to provide material support carries the same penalties as the completed substantive offense: imprisonment for not more than 20 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from the commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization) (or not more than twice the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense). Unlike attempt, conspirators may be punished for both conspiracy and for actually providing material support should their scheme succeed.", "Under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a72, anyone who counsels, procures, aids, or abets a violation of Section 2339B or any other federal crime is punishable as though he had committed the offense himself. \"In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, [and] that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\" \"Typically, the same evidence will support both a conspiracy and an aiding and abetting conviction.\" Unlike conspiracy, however, liability under Section 2 only attaches if someone else commits the substantive offense.

The Sentencing Guidelines assign a base offense level of 26 which translates, without more, to a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months imprisonment for offenders with a virtually pristine criminal record. Section 2339B offenses, however, like those of Section 2339A, may trigger the Guidelines' terrorism adjustment. Section 3A1.4 raises the offense level to 32, criminal history category VI that translates to a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months imprisonment.

An accused charged with a violation of a federal crime of terrorism faces an enhanced prospect of pre-trial detention.
