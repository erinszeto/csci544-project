These benefits include disability compensation and pensions, education benefits, survivor benefits, medical treatment, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, and burial and memorial benefits. In order to receive these benefits, a veteran (or an eligible family member) must apply for them by submitting the necessary information to a local VA office. The local VA office will make an initial determination on the application for benefits. Any veteran who is not satisfied with the local VA's determination is permitted to appeal the decision. This report provides a step-by-step breakdown of the appeal process for veterans' claims.", "When making an appeal on an initial determination, the claimant may choose to proceed with the traditional review process or may choose to have a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at the local VA office review the case. In the event the veteran opts for a DRO review and is not satisfied with the result, the claimant may still avail himself/herself of the traditional process and appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA). The local VA office will prepare the claim file for the appeal and provide the claimant with a blank VA Form 9\u2014a form that must be completed to make an appeal to the BVA. Claimants must follow specific procedures to request the appeal and must meet certain deadlines for submitting the proper information.", "The claimant may choose to have a hearing with the BVA during the appeal process. There are three different types of hearings that the claimant may choose (1) an in-person hearing with a BVA member, held in Washington, DC; (2) an in-person hearing with a BVA member, held at a local VA office; or (3) a teleconference hearing. The hearings with the BVA are informal and nonadversarial in nature. The claimant will be given the opportunity to explain the reasons for the appeal and to submit additional evidence during the hearing. The claimant may be represented during the appeal process.", "After the BVA reaches a decision on the appeal, there are further options the claimant may pursue if he or she is still not satisfied with the BVA decision. A claimant may file a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). The CAVC, an Article I court, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the BVA. A claimant must submit a notice of appeal within 120 days of receiving the decision from the BVA. However, the Supreme Court in Henderson v. Shinseki clarified that the 120-day deadline is not a \"jurisdictional\" deadline. Therefore, an appeal to the CAVC will not necessarily be dismissed for missing the deadline. However, the claimant must have a good reason for filing late, such as an inability to meet the deadline due to mental incapacity.", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals from a CAVC decision.

Thus, the Court determined that Congress did not intend the 120-day deadline to be a jurisdictional rule.

It stated,", "The doctrine of equitable tolling has generally established parameters, and over time decisions of the Federal Circuit and this Court have addressed those parameters in the context of appeals to this Court. Thus, for example, equitable tolling was not applied when failure to file was due to general negligence or procrastination. Rather, it was applied only when circumstances precluded a timely filing despite the exercise of due diligence, such as (1) a mental illness rendering one incapable of handling one's own affairs or other extraordinary circumstances beyond one's control, (2) reliance on the incorrect statement of a VA official, or (3) a misfiling at the regional office or the Board.", "The CAVC held that if an appellant accidentally files the notice of appeal at the wrong location\u2014for example, at the BVA instead of with the CAVC\u2014but the notice of appeal is otherwise timely, equitable tolling is appropriate. It also held that, although mental illness can be a reason to find equitable tolling to be appropriate, the appellant must demonstrate that he is actually \" incapable of functioning or making decisions due to mental illness, that his mental illness prevented him from filing his appeal or seeking the assistance of counsel, or that his mental disabilities were related directly to his untimely filing.\" Therefore, although the 120-day deadline is not \"jurisdictional,\" it still precludes review from the CAVC in many circumstances. However, it should be noted, the Federal Circuit overruled Bove in Dixon v. McDonald .", "In Bove , the CAVC had held that it had the authority to address untimely filings and equitable tolling sua sponte \u2014that is, on its own accord without prompting from either party\u2014and that the 120-day time period in which to file an appeal is not subject to waiver or forfeiture by the Secretary. The Federal Circuit overruled the CAVC with respect to its sua sponte authority \"to resolve timeliness in the face of the Secretary's waiver by granting him relief that he explicitly declined to seek.\" The Federal Circuit determined that the CAVC's conclusion was wrong for three reasons: (1) it failed to account for statutory limits to its jurisdiction; (2) it misread Supreme Court precedent; and (3) it misconstrued the relevant policy considerations. Thus, the Federal Circuit held that the CAVC does not have the sua sponte authority to grant relief on a non-jurisdictional timeliness defense when the Secretary has waived the defense. However, the first holding in Bove , that the 120-day period in which to file an appeal is subject to equitable tolling, was not overruled and remains valid."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals from a CAVC decision. The Federal Circuit provides the last appeal of right during the appeal process. By statute, the review provided by the Federal Circuit is rather limited. The Federal Circuit is not permitted to review \"(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\" The Federal Circuit can only review actions to see if they are arbitrary or capricious, unconstitutional, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, or procedurally deficient. The Federal Circuit may modify, reverse, or remand decisions by the CAVC, as appropriate. If either party is dissatisfied with the ruling from the Federal Circuit, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court does not have to hear the case and may deny certiorari. If the Supreme Court decides to hear the case, any decision reached by the Court is final."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
