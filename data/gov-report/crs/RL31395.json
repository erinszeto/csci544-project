Under a separate law passed prior to ratification of the accord, UNITA's armed forces will receive a general amnesty for wartime offenses committed against the state and Angolan people. The agreement followed the death of Jonas Savimbi, the founder and long-time leader of UNITA, who was killed in a government ambush in February, 2002 in eastern Angola. Savimbi's death raised the prospect of possible realignments within the UNITA organization or of changes in its leadership.

A tripartite agreement among the three major liberation movements to form a transitional government collapsed just after Angola became independent of Portugal in 1975. Parties to the agreement included the Popular Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), the current ruling party; its armed rival, UNITA; and the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), led until recently by Holden Roberto. Although all three groups sought national liberation and included members from across Angola, each drew the core of its support from different ethnic coalitions. UNITA has been dominated by the Ovimbundu ethnic group of central Angola, although it has also drawn support from the Chokwe, Luena, and Ovambo communities of eastern and southern Angola. The MPLA was originally predominantly a coalition between the Mbundu of northwest Angola, persons of mixed race, and urban dwellers. The FNLA drew much of its support from the northern Bakongo people and some rural Mbundu.", "A civil war began following the collapse of the agreement, as the MPLA, UNITA, the FNLA and other splinter groups fought one another for control of the government in Luanda, then \u2013 and since \u2013 held by the MPLA. In the 1970s and 1980s, the conflict was shaped by the Cold War. The Soviet Union and Cuba assisted the then-Marxist MPLA, which established a de facto one party state. The United States and South Africa aided UNITA and the FNLA. In 1985, Congress repealed a 1976 ban on covert aid to Angolan belligerents; in 1986 the Reagan Administration initiated covert military assistance to UNITA.", "In 1979, Eduardo dos Santos, Angola's current president and leader of the governing MPLA, succeeded Agostino Neto, the country's president at independence. Dos Santos, born in1942 in Luanda to a family of ethnic Mbundu origins, studied petroleum engineering in the Soviet Union at the Institute of Oil and Gas in Baku. Before becoming president, he had been minister of foreign affairs in Angola's first post-independence government, after serving as first deputy prime minister and minister of planning (1978-1979). Dos Santos oversaw a gradual liberalization of the MPLA's socialist political ideology during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and later supported a reorientation toward liberal, free market policies, as did many other African leaders. He has presided over the long-running civil war, and in recent years he appears to have taken closer control of its prosecution. In 1999, he abolished the post of prime minister and created a highly autonomous Defense Ministry.", "The Dos Santos government has been labeled authoritarian by many observers because of its sometimes harsh repression of its domestic political opponents, and journalists \u2013 and for curtailing public expression and the opportunity for its citizens to change their government (see \" Human Rights \" section, below).

In September 1992, Angola held its first and only multi-party elections, in which 18 parties contested, and which were monitored by the United Nations (U.N.). Campaigning was reportedly tense, given the recentness of open conflict, and because the separatist Cabinda movement FLEC (see below) called for an electoral boycott. Over 75% of voters cast ballots. The MPLA won a parliamentary majority, but the presidential race resulted in the necessity of a run-off election. Neither dos Santos, with 49.6% of the vote, nor Savimbi, with 40%, won a required majority.", "UNITA officials alleged that the MPLA government had engaged in widespread election fraud, including the use of dummy ballots, stolen ballot boxes, and rigged counts, and asserted that the personal security of UNITA supporters was being violated by government supporters. In an atmosphere of increasing conflict across Angola, UNITA dismissed a U.N. finding that the election had been substantially free and fair and, asserting that the conditions for a fair run-off did not exist, rejected a run-off election, effectively abandoning the Bicesse Accord. It rearmed and rapidly took control of large areas. The MPLA, which had substantially demobilized, faced the increasing UNITA attacks with the help of armed civilians and police; it subsequently invested heavily to build its military capacity, and launched a broad offensive against UNITA.", "International pressure on UNITA to return to negotiations grew. In September 1993, the United Nations imposed an oil and arms embargo on UNITA. Peace talks subsequently ensued, culminating in the November 1994 Lusaka Protocol, which called for a renewed cease-fire, the re-validation of the Bicesse Accords; the disarmament and demobilization of UNITA; and UNITA's participation in a government of national reconciliation. A 7,000-member U.N. peacekeeping operation was deployed, but implementation of the Protocols was repeatedly delayed. A Government of Unity and National Reconciliation was installed in April 1997, but Savimbi refused to come to the capital, citing safety concerns, and low-level conflict continued.

In August 1998, UNITA was suspended from parliament. Full scale war did not resume until December 1998, when the MPLA government, angered by UNITA's failure to honor the Protocols, attacked UNITA strongholds in central Angola, causing the final collapse of the Protocols. UNITA managed to stall the offensive, and launched counterattacks, making significant territorial gains by mid-1999, including the seizure of much of diamond-rich eastern Angola. The U.N. targeted further sanctions against UNITA in April 2000. The U.N. has primarily blamed UNITA for its failure to implement the Lusaka Protocol.

By July 2000, the government claimed control of over 90% of the country. In late 2000, the government undertook large scale operations along the Namibian border, in apparent military cooperation with Namibia, and later attacked UNITA in the east, near Zambia. UNITA also came under pressure as a result of the Angolan government's military presence in Congo-Brazzaville and the government's participation, as an armed ally of the DRC government, in the DRC war.

In some, food and other provisions were seized, property destroyed, and vehicles burned. Civilian captives were reportedly taken by UNITA on multiple occasions, although UNITA has usually denied responsibility for such actions. Despite severe military pressure, UNITA appeared \u2013 based upon the high and continuing numbers of reported attacks by the group throughout 2001 and published analyses of the conflict \u2013 to possess a formidable, mobile guerrilla force and a national command-and-control network.

The president's announced intention not to run has reportedly elicited scepticism among some opposition members and observers of Angolan politics, given the president's firm control of national politics and military affairs. Some see the move as a bid to unify a sometimes fractious party prior to elections, to bolster the rationale for an extended dos Santos presidency, and to defend against and draw out potential contenders within his party.

Security Council (UNSC) to monitor a cease-fire and police activities under the Bicesse Accords. It was later charged with observing and verifying the 1992 presidential and legislative elections in Angola. After renewed fighting in October 1992 the UNAVEM II mandate was altered to allow the mission to assist the two sides to agree on modalities for finalizing the peace process and to broker related national or local cease-fire agreements. After the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994, UNAVEM II was charged with verifying the first stages of the peace agreement. It was superceded by UNAVEM III in February 1995, which was to monitor and verify the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.", "In June 1997 UNAVEM III was replaced by the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), which was given an enlarged, multi-sectoral mandate. Its political unit monitored the implementation of the Lusaka agreements and the normalization of state administration across Angola, and monitored UNITA's integration into these institutions. It also assisted with confidence-building and the mediation of conflicts arising from these activities. A police affairs unit assisted with police-related aspects of political normalization and post-conflict integration; verified police neutrality; promoted security, freedom of movement and association; and monitored the disarmament of civilians. A human rights unit investigated human rights abuses, and promoted the observation of human rights and the development of national human rights education and monitoring capacities. A military unit monitored cease-fire compliance, demobilization, and the integration of UNITA into the FAA. A U.N. organization, the Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit, supported the demobilization and social reintegration of UNITA ex-combatants, monitored humanitarian needs, and acted as a coordination unit for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The security situation deteriorated sharply in 1998, leading to a resumption of full scale war, and in February 1999 the mission was terminated. In October 1999, the UNSC established the U.N. Office in Angola (UNOA) to liaise with the political, military, police and other authorities in Angola. UNOA was mandated with exploring possible measures for restoring peace; assisting in institutional capacity building; the delivery of humanitarian assistance; the promotion of human rights; and related coordination activities.", "In order to compel UNITA to comply with peace accords that it had signed during the Lusaka peace process, existing U.N. sanctions on UNITA were strengthened in June 1998.

The added sanctions included the freezing of UNITA assets abroad; restrictions on official contacts with UNITA in Angola; a ban on diamond exports from Angola not authorized by the Angolan government; and a ban on the provision to UNITA of mining equipment and services, and of water and road vehicles and spare parts. In May 1999, the U.N. Security Council created a panel of experts to trace violations of sanctions on arms trafficking, oil supplies and the diamond trade, and the movement of UNITA funds.
