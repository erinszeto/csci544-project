The conflict has resulted in thousands of military andcivilian casualties and the massive destruction of housing and infrastructure. Putin's rise to powerand continuing popularity have been tied at least partly to his perceived ability to prosecute thisconflict successfully. In the run-up to Russian legislative elections in December 2003 and apresidential election in March 2004, Putin endeavored to demonstrate that peace had returned to theregion.", "After Chechen terrorists held hundreds of Moscow theater-goers hostage in late 2002, thePutin administration appeared unequivocally opposed to talks with the rebels and more dedicatedto establishing a pro-Moscow government in Chechnya. This pro-Moscow government has used itsown forces to battle the remaining rebels, ostensibly permitting the disengagement and withdrawalof most Russian troops from the region. This \"Chechenization\" of the conflict, along with relatedpacification efforts, has constituted the main elements of the Russian government's campaign to winddown the fighting. Pacification efforts have aimed to gain the support or acquiescence of thepopulation to federal control and have included rebuilding assistance and elections. Theassassination of a pro-Moscow Chechen leader in May 2004, the attack on a school in the town ofBeslan, Russia, in September 2004, by Chechen terrorists, and widening of conflict to other areasof Russia's North Caucasus have raised questions about whether Chechenization and pacification aresucceeding.", "A consistent theme of U.S. and other international criticism of Russia is that Russian troopsuse excessive and indiscriminate force to quell separatism in Chechnya and commit serious humanrights abuses. Several analysts have discerned a decrease in Bush Administration criticism ofRussian policy in Chechnya, perhaps spurred to some degree by the Moscow theater hostage crisisand stepped-up terrorist bombings and armed attacks throughout Russia in recent years. U.S.concerns before the Iraq conflict with gaining Russia's support also may have contributed to theshifts. There appeared to be fewer Administration suggestions to Russia that it should open peacetalks with \"moderate\" separatists, more tolerance for Russia's argument that it primarily was battlingterrorism in Chechnya, and some hope that elections and rebuilding in Chechnya could contributeto a \"political settlement.\" But some in the Administration also argue that Russia is showingdeclining interest in the adoption of Western democratic and human rights \"values,\" and that suchslippage could ultimately harm bilateral relations.", "Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2006 ( H.R. 3057 ; P.L. 109-102 )retains a provision first included in FY2001 appropriations that cuts some aid to Russia unless thePresident determines that Russia is not hampering access to Chechnya by non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs).

(1) Theconflict has ebbed and flowed since then and has resulted in thousands of military and civiliancasualties and the massive destruction of housing and infrastructure. Chechen rebel forces, estimatedby Russian officials to have declined to several hundred dedicated fighters, currently appearweakened but still tenacious. (2) They now mainly engage in small-scale armed attacks andbombings, including suicide bombings, against both Russian troops and civilians in Chechnya andother parts of Russia. ", "Suicide bombings had been relatively rare occurrences in both Chechnya conflicts butappeared to increase after 2001. The deadliest incidents were the hostage-taking at a Moscow theaterin October 2002 (although most of the 130 deaths of hostages resulted from the rescue effort) anda suicide truck bombing in December 2002 that destroyed a government building in Chechnya andkilled more than seventy. Ten suicide bombings throughout Russia in 2003 -- that resulted in over200 casualties -- seemed aimed in part to publicize the Chechnya conflict and to sway voters inupcoming elections in Russia and Chechnya. Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev reportedly tookresponsibility for the Moscow theater hostage-taking and at least two of the suicide bombings. (3) ", "The pace and lethality of suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks increased in 2004, andthese attacks spread far beyond Chechnya. A suicide bombing in the Moscow subway in Februaryresulted in about forty casualties. Chechen female suicide bombers downed two Russian commercialairliners in August, killing 89. Other incidents included an attempt to assassinate the leader ofRussia's Ingushetia region in April and a large-scale Chechen terrorist attack against security forcesand government offices in Ingushetia in June, causing the deaths of about 100 Ingush police. Basayev reportedly took responsibility for this attack, and he received praise from Maskhadov. Attacks in Chechnya's capital of Grozny on August 21, 2004, reportedly resulted in the deaths ofabout 120 pro-Moscow Chechens. Basayev also claimed responsibility for a September 2004 attackin the town of Beslan in Russia's North Ossetia region, where terrorists seized over 1,100 gradeschool teachers, students, parents, and others as hostages. The hostage standoff ended with thedestruction of the school and the deaths of 320 children and others. ", "Basayev likewise allegedly claimed to be the primary planner of an October 2005 attack onpolice and security offices in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, that reportedly resulted inthe deaths of over 100 police and rebels and nearly two dozen civilians. Russian officials accusedtwo communities of local Islamic extremists of involvement in the attacks (the Yarmuk Jama'at andthe Institute of Islamic Studies) with Basayev's assistance, indicating the spread of such extremismthroughout the North Caucasus, according to some observers. (4) ", "Maskhadov was killed during a skirmish with the Russian military on March 8, 2005, andwas replaced as \"president\" and \"prime minister\" of Chechnya by Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev. In2002, Maskhadov reportedly had designated Sadulayev as his heir, and Basayev announced afterMaskhadov's death that the State Defense Committee (Majlis ul-Shura) of Chechnya had concurredwith Maskhadov's wishes. (5) In August 2005, Sadulayev announced a reorganization of therebel \"government\" that included naming new \"ministers\" and dismissing Maskhadov's \"diplomatic\"representatives abroad, including \"foreign minister\" Ilyas Akhmadov. Indicative of close ties,Sadulayev made Basayev his second in command by appointing him the \"first deputy primeminister.\" While criticizing Basayev's tactic of hostage-taking as ineffective (but not unethical), hereportedly praised his military leadership and gave him control over all security functions of the rebel\"government.\" (6) Sadulayev announced another government re-organization in February 2006 that appeared to furtherreduce the influence of \"moderate\" Chechen rebels. He decreed that Zakayev would no longer bethe deputy prime minister, with responsibility for foreign policy guidance, although he would remainminister of culture. At the same time, Sadulayev elevated the status of the hardline Islamicideologist Movladi Udugov by naming him head of a new Information Service. (7) ", "Since the 2002 Moscow theater siege, the Putin administration has appeared unequivocallyopposed to talks with the rebels and more dedicated to establishing a pro-Moscow government inChechnya. This regional government increasingly is using its own forces to battle the remainingrebels. According to some estimates, there are now about 20,000 Chechen police and securitypersonnel. This has permitted the disengagement and withdrawal of thousands of Russian troopsfrom the region. This \"Chechenization\" of the conflict, along with related pacification efforts,constitutes the main elements of the Russian government's campaign to wind down the Chechnyaconflict. Pacification efforts aim to gain the support or acquiescence of the population to federalcontrol and include rebuilding assistance and elections. The assassination of the Chechen presidentin May 2004, and the attack on the school in Beslan in September 2004 have raised questions aboutwhether Chechenization and pacification are succeeding.", "The Putin government long claimed that the fight against terrorism in Chechnya required thesuspension of some civil rights. However, it claimed in 2002 that ebbing fighting permitted thebolstering of civil rights and arranged a constitutional referendum and a presidential election in theregion in 2003. Many human rights organizations nonetheless have documented or alleged ongoinghuman rights abuses by Russian and pro-Moscow Chechen forces, including sweeps of villages bytroops in search of hiding rebels. Such sweeps result in civilian disappearances, summary killings,and hostage-taking for ransom. Although the scale and number of such sweeps may have declinedto some degree since 1999, more than 400 civilian abductions may have occurred in 2004 and morethan 200 in 2005, according to Russia's Memorial human rights organization. (8) Many observers have objectedto an apparent Chechen government policy of abducting the relatives of rebel leaders, includingMaskhadov's, to compel the leaders to surrender. (9) Chechen rebels also continue to commit abuses. ", "The Putin government in 2003-2004 pressed displaced Chechens outside the region to returnto Chechnya, arguing that civil order had been largely restored and that rebuilding had commenced. By June 2004, authorities had closed tent cities in Chechnya's neighboring Ingush region to forcethese displaced people to return to Chechnya (or to move elsewhere). During his January 2004 visitto Chechnya, U.N. Undersecretary-General Jan Egeland raised concerns about these efforts to forcethe Chechens to return, such as by bulldozing camps or turning off electricity, especially since hefound that living conditions in Chechnya were still harsh and unsafe. A mid-2005 U.N. assessmentindicated that there were still large numbers of internally displaced and ill-housed Chechens. (10) ", "To encourage displaced Chechens to return to the region and to bolster popular support, theRussian government launched a limited program of compensation for the destruction of housingduring the conflict that reportedly assisted about 39,000 Chechen families. Reconstruction inChechnya is lagging far behind schedule, however, because of a lack of coordination between federaland regional governments and widespread corruption. (11) Noting this slow progress, the U.N. appeal for aid for 2005stated that the region's population still faced abductions, tortures, terrorist attacks, extrajudicialmurders, and rape. The appeal reported that most Chechens remained unemployed and in poverty,many without homes or basic services such as healthcare, education, electricity, water, and seweragesystems.

The Russian government has hailed elections as restoring civil order,affirming the region's status as a constituent part of Russia, establishing new pro-Moscow politicalinstitutions, and formally repudiating the former Chechen government of President AslanMaskhadov. The Russian government hopes that the new political system will come to be viewedas legitimate by the international community, and that Chechens will at least acquiesce to the newsystem. The strategy has included holding a constitutional referendum and presidential, legislative,federal, and local elections in Chechnya. This strategy was put to a severe test in May 2004 with theassassination of Akhmad Kadyrov, who had been elected to the Chechen presidency just monthspreviously. The Putin government continued on this course, however, and held new presidentialelections in the region in August 2004. The assassination delayed a legislative election until late2005.

Despite promises by Putin that a constitutional referendum would by held in late 2002, pro-Moscow Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov argued successfully that unrest in the regionprecluded a referendum until March 26, 2003. Besides a question on approving the constitution,voters were asked to approve draft laws on electing a president and a legislature. Some Chechensprotested against holding a referendum absent a peace settlement of the conflict, but AkhmadKadyrov reportedly dismissed such protesters as enemies. (14) Visiting representatives from the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe in early March appeared to view thereferendum preparations with a few misgivings, including the absence of organized and openopposition to the constitutional draft. They determined that the unstable and inhospitableenvironment precluded deploying a full contingent of observers, but recommended that a handfulof observers be sent to assess the referendum. (15) ", "The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) reported a very high 89.5% turnout among 569,000eligible voters and that 96% approved the new constitution. The voting rolls reportedly includedabout 23,000-30,000 Russian troops who were considered \"permanently based\" in Chechnya. Also,the authorities deemed that up to 17,000 Chechens displaced in Ingushetia were eligible to vote. TheOSCE observers described voting irregularities in the polling places they visited, and somejournalists reported few observable voters and many voting irregularities. There were allegationsthat displaced and resident Chechens were threatened with food aid cutoffs or other sanctions if theydid not vote. In some districts, the vote counts reportedly were higher than the number of registeredvoters. (16) Despite theseproblems, the OSCE voiced hope that the vote might lead to political talks and the end of humanrights abuses. President Putin hailed the win as removing the last serious threat to Russia's territorialintegrity. Putin's presidential spokesman dismissed criticism of the referendum by somerepresentatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), asserting that theywere needlessly badgering Russia. (17) ", "Before the referendum, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and others hadraised concerns about the secretive constitutional drafting process and unsuccessfully had urgedrewriting some sections they viewed as problematic. As approved, the Chechen Constitution appearsto spell out fewer powers than those provided in other regional constitutions. The constitution doesnot provide the region with a special status in the Russian Federation, totally repudiating its uncertainautonomy in 1996-1999. Russian language is designated the exclusive language of officialdiscourse. The Constitution prohibits advocacy of separatism and establishes strong federal controlover the region, specifying the primacy of federal law, ensured in part by the center's appointmentand direct control over the regional Prosecutor. The federal government can remove the regionalpresident and the federal legislature can dissolve the regional legislature.

Prospectivecandidates were required either to gather signatures from 2% of the electorate or to pay a $160,000deposit. Eleven candidates were registered for the ballot, but three of the major opponents toAkhmad Kadyrov -- State Duma deputy Aslambek Aslakhanov and businessmen Malik Saydullayevand Khusein Dzhabrailov -- dropped out before the election under circumstances deemedquestionable, according to some observers.

On election day,journalists and observers from Agence France Presse and the Moscow Helsinki Commissionreported a low turnout at several polling places they visited in the region, perhaps partly becausemany Chechens feared venturing out because of rebel threats of violence. Nonetheless, electoralofficials reported that 88% of 562,000 registered voters turned out, of which 81% voted for AkhmadKadyrov. He allegedly had electoral support throughout Chechnya, including in all mountainousconflict areas.

The White House condemned the attack, stating that \"no national, ethnic, religious or other causecan ever justify the use of terrorism.\" The Putin government continued its electoral strategy -- ratherthan returning to direct presidential rule over the region -- by seeking another pro-Moscow Chechento take Kadyrov's place.

Besides including pro-Moscow Chechens, manyadvocates of talks urge including \"moderate\" separatists, although there are varying views on whois moderate. Most observers exclude Islamic extremists such as Basayev, because of their terroristacts, although some argue that all parties to the conflict should be invited to take part in talks. BothSadulayev and Basayev demand full independence for Chechnya and its adoption of Shariarule. (40) ", "Chechnya's Future. Alternative futures facingChechnya include not only Russia's hope to wind down the conflict but also the possibilities ofcontinued low-level fighting or greatly escalating violence. The Russian government argues thatits pacification and Chechenization efforts, along with attrition of the rebel forces, will result in alargely peaceful and secure Chechnya.", "According to some observers, the Putin administration is divided on how far to accommodatethe pro-Russian Chechen leadership's jockeying for greater self-rule and autonomy. Some observerssuggest that the apparent strengthening of Russian nationalism as a result of the State Duma electionand the strengthening of the security apparatus within the Putin administration may make thegovernment less supportive of the Chechenization process. The Russian government could do a volte face and re-impose a greater degree of direct rule and exclude ethnic Chechens from politicaland economic control over their region. Reflecting this more nationalist viewpoint, some Russiansargue that Chechnya's oil and other resources should serve as reparations to Russia for the economiccosts of the conflict.

They alsowarn that Islam is becoming a motivating factor in what formerly was mainly a secular struggle forChechen independence. Some even caution that Islamic fundamentalism also is increasing amongthe wider Chechen society. These trends may be creating wider schisms within Chechen society thatcontribute to religious conflict. Growing Islamic extremism also could make it increasingly difficultin the future for Russia to engage in peace talks that consider less than full independence. ", "Some observers warn that widening Islamic unrest in the Dagestan, Ingushetia, andKabardina-Balkariya regions in 2005-2006 is indicative of a widening pool of terrorist recruitmentin the North Caucasus.

U.S. concerns before the Iraq conflict withgaining Russia's support, concerns afterward with terrorist attacks within Iraq on coalition forces,and concerns about the replacement of the \"moderate\" Maskhadov with Sadulayev (who is an Islamicfundamentalist with close and clear links to Basayev) also may have contributed to the shifts. Thereappeared to be fewer Administration suggestions to Russia that it should open peace talks withseparatists, more tolerance for Russia's argument that it was battling terrorism in Chechnya, andsome hope that elections and rebuilding efforts in Chechnya could contribute to a \"politicalsettlement.\" (45) ", "The Administration's view that elections could contribute to a political settlement washighlighted by the U.S. Mission to the OSCE on March 27, 2003.

(47) After the race, however, State Department spokesman RichardBoucher on October 6 criticized the elimination of viable challengers to Akhmad Kadyrov andconstraints on the media and concluded that \"given these problems, it's unclear whether the electionwill have sufficient credibility and legitimacy [among Chechens] to advance the settlement process.\" He also called on the \"people of Chechnya on both sides ... to work with the Russians to resolve thisconflict peacefully.\" (48) Putin downplayed this criticism by stressing \"understanding ... from the President of the UnitedStates,\" regarding Russia's efforts to combat \"Islamic radicalism\" in Chechnya, and that \"it servesU.S. interests to shore up\" such efforts. (49) Secretary Powell reiterated during his January 2004 Moscowvisit that the United States was \"not satisfied with\" the October 2003 presidential election inChechnya.\" (50) Afterthe August 2004 presidential race in Chechnya, the U.S. State Department described it as having\"serious flaws\" and not democratic (51) ", "More recently, the State Department has placed more emphasis on the anti-terrorism aspectsof the Chechnya conflict.

A similar response was given by Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns at a pressconference after a late 2005 meeting of the U.S.-Russia Counter-terrorism Working Group.

Then it means that the policy aimedat creating elements that rock the Russian Federation is being pursued there too.\" (57) ", "The U.S. government and the U.N. Security Council have labeled some Chechen factions andindividuals as terrorists. While there also appears to be ample evidence of foreign Islamicfundamentalist support for some Chechen rebel groups, (58) the questions of support by al Qaeda and recent rebel support forterrorist actions outside Russia remain controversial. Analyst Brian Williams argues that there is noevidence of Chechen rebel involvement in Afghanistan or other ties with al Qaeda.

Commentingon Putin's apparent backtracking on democratization in the face of the Beslan attack, Senator JohnMcCain stated on September 21, 2004, that \"I think that Mr. Putin is using this latest terrible tragedy,this horrible thing in Beslan as an excuse to further consolidate his power, to repress the media, tohave a Duma that will basically be a rubber stamp ...

TheChechen government has permitted a few NGOs and international aid agencies to set up offices inthe region. However, many of the groups have faced Russian government impediments to theiroperations, remain troubled by ongoing violence in the region, and are suspicious that Russian forcesmay be among those targeting aid workers.

", "Russia's new law that tightens reporting requirements and the activities of NGOs may hindertheir access (the law comes into effect in April 2006). Even before this date, it appears that thepro-Russian Chechnya government may be growing less supportive of the activities of NGOs. Onetroubling incident was Ramzan Kadyrov's early February 2006 ban on the activities of the DanishRefugee Council NGO. He accused it of aiding Chechen rebels, spying for the West, and reflectinganti-Islamic views (a Danish newspaper had published a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed). Theban was heavily criticized by the international community and by many in Chechnya and Russia. The ban was soon repudiated by the Russian government and the NGO resumed activities inChechnya in early March 2006. (65) "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
