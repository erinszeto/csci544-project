The statute prohibits both the offer or payment of remuneration for patient referrals, as well as the offer or payment of anything of value in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering of any item or service that is reimbursable by a federal health care program.", "The Stark law and its implementing regulations prohibit physician self-referrals for certain health services that may be paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.

Considering that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest purchaser of health care in the United States, and that Medicare and Medicaid combined pay about one-third of the nation's health expenditures, it is not surprising that these federal health programs have been considered prime targets for fraudulent activity. Accordingly, efforts to address this fraud and abuse continue to be a priority for Congress. ", "The federal government has an array of statutes that it uses to fight health care fraud. This report provides a brief overview of some of the key federal statutes, including program-related civil and criminal penalties, the anti-kickback statute, the Stark law, and the False Claims Act, that are used to combat fraud and abuse in federal health care programs.

Under Section 1128A of the Social Security Act, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) is authorized to impose civil penalties and assessments on a person, including an organization, agency, or other entity, who engages in various types of improper conduct with respect to federal health care programs, including the imposition of penalties against a person who knowingly presents or causes to be presented to a federal or state employee or agent certain false or fraudulent claims. For example, penalties apply to services that were not provided as claimed, or claims that were part of a pattern of providing items or services that a person knows or should know are not medically necessary. In addition, certain payments made to physicians to reduce or limit services are also prohibited. This section provides for monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each item or service claimed, up to $50,000 under certain additional circumstances, as well as treble damages.", "Section 1128B of the Social Security Act provides for criminal penalties involving federal health care programs. Under this section, certain false statements and representations, made knowingly and willfully, are criminal offenses. For example, it is unlawful to make or cause to be made false statements or representations in either applying for benefits or payments, or determining rights to benefits or payments under a federal health care program. In addition, persons who conceal any event affecting an individual's right to receive a benefit or payment with the intent to either fraudulently receive the benefit or payment (in an amount or quantity greater than that which is due), or convert a benefit or payment to use other than for the benefit of the person for which it was intended may be criminally liable. Persons who have violated the statute and have furnished an item or service under which payment could be made under a federal health program may be guilty of a felony, punishable by a fine of up to $25,000, up to five years imprisonment, or both. Other persons involved in connection with the provision of false information to a federal health program may be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to one year.", "One of the most severe sanctions available under the Social Security Act is the ability to exclude individuals and entities from participation in federal health care programs. Under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act, exclusions from federal health programs are mandatory under certain circumstances, and permissive in others (i.e., OIG has discretion in whether to exclude an entity or individual). Exclusion is mandatory for those convicted of certain offenses, including (1) a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare, Medicaid, or a state health care program; (2) a criminal offense relating to neglect or abuse of patients in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service; or (3) a felony relating to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of a controlled substance. OIG has permissive authority to exclude an entity or an individual from a federal health program under numerous circumstances, including conviction of certain misdemeanors relating to fraud, theft, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, or other financial misconduct; a conviction based on an interference with or obstruction of an investigation into a criminal offense; and revocation or suspension of a health care practitioner's license for reasons bearing on the individual's or entity's professional competence, professional performance, or financial integrity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Anti-Kickback Statute", "paragraphs": ["In light of the concern that decisions of health care providers can be improperly influenced by a profit motive, and in order to protect federal health care programs from additional costs and overutilization, Congress enacted the anti-kickback statute. Under this criminal statute, it is a felony for a person to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive anything of value (i.e., \"remuneration\") in return for a referral or to induce generation of business reimbursable under a federal health care program. The statute prohibits both the offer or payment of remuneration for patient referrals, as well as the offer or payment of anything of value in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering of any item or service that is reimbursable by a federal health care program. Persons found guilty of violating the anti-kickback statute may be subject to a fine of up to $25,000, imprisonment of up to five years, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs for up to one year.", "There are certain statutory exceptions to the anti-kickback statute. Under one exception, \"remuneration\" does not include a discount or other reduction in price obtained by a provider of services or other entity if the reduction in price is properly disclosed and reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider or entity under a federal health care program. Another exception includes, under certain circumstances, amounts paid by a vendor of goods or services to a person authorized to act as a purchasing agent for a group of individuals that furnish services reimbursable by a federal health program. In addition to these exceptions, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (OIG) has promulgated regulations that contain several \"safe harbors\" to prevent common business arrangements from being considered kickbacks. Safe harbors listed by regulation include certain types of investment interests, personal services and management contracts, referral services, and space rental or equipment rental arrangements. OIG has indicated that the safe harbor provisions are not indicative of the only acceptable business arrangements, and that business arrangements that do not comply with a safe harbor are not necessarily considered \"suspect.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stark Law: Physician Self-Referrals", "paragraphs": ["Limitations on physician self-referrals were enacted into law in 1989 under the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly referred to as the \"Stark law.\" The Stark law, as amended, and its implementing regulations prohibit certain physician self-referrals for designated health services (DHS) that may be paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. In its basic application, the Stark law provides that if (1) a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) has a \"financial relationship\" with an entity, the physician may not make a referral to the entity for the furnishing of designated health services (DHS) for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid, and (2) the entity may not present (or cause to be presented) a claim to the federal health care program or bill to any individual or entity for DHS furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. It has been noted that the general idea behind the prohibitions in the Stark law is to prevent physicians from making referrals based on financial gain, thus preventing overutilization and increases in health care costs. ", "A \"financial relationship\" under the Stark law consists of either (1) an \"ownership or investment interest\" in the entity or (2) a \"compensation arrangement\" between the physician (or immediate family member) and the entity. An \"ownership or investment interest\" includes \"equity, debt, or other means,\" as well as \"an interest in an entity that holds an ownership or investment interest in any entity providing the designated health service.\" A \"compensation arrangement\" is generally defined as an arrangement involving any remuneration between a physician (or an immediate family member of such physician) and an entity, other than certain arrangements that are specifically mentioned as being excluded from the reach of the statute. The Stark law includes a large number of exceptions, which have been added and expanded upon by a series of regulations. These exceptions may apply to ownership interests, compensation arrangements, or both. ", "Violators of the Stark law may be subject to various sanctions, including a denial of payment for relevant services and a required refund of any amount billed in violation of the statute that had been collected. In addition, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicaid and Medicare programs may apply. A civil penalty not to exceed $15,000, and in certain cases not to exceed $100,000, per violation may be imposed if the person who bills or presents the claim \"knows or should know\" that the bill or claim violates the statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "False Claims Act", "paragraphs": ["The federal False Claims Act (FCA), codified at 31 U.S.C. Sections 3729-3733, is considered by many to be an important tool for combating fraud against the U.S. government. The FCA is a law of general applicability that is invoked frequently in the health care context. It has been reported that from January 2009 through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, the Justice Department used the False Claims Act to recover more than $16.5 billion in health care fraud cases. ", "In general, the FCA imposes civil liability on persons who knowingly submit a false or fraudulent claim or engage in various types of misconduct involving federal government money or property. Health care program false claims often arise in terms of billing, including billing for services not rendered, billing for unnecessary medical services, double billing for the same service or equipment, or billing for services at a higher rate than provided (\"upcoding\"). Penalties under the FCA include a penalty of $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim filed, plus additional damages.", "Civil actions may be brought in federal district court under the FCA by the Attorney General or by a person known as a relator (i.e., a \"whistleblower\"), for the person and for the U.S. government, in what is termed a qui tam action. The ability to initiate a qui tam action has been viewed as a powerful weapon against health care fraud, in that it may be initiated by a private party who may have independent knowledge of any wrongdoing. Popularity of qui tam actions brought under the FCA may be attributed partially to the fact that successful whistleblowers can receive between 15% and 30% of the monetary proceeds of the action or settlement that are recovered by the government.
