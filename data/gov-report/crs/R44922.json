Coal will likely remain an essential component of the U.S. energy supply, but how big will its footprint be?", "U.S. coal production had been strong since the 1990s (above or near 1 billion short tons per year until 2014), and reached its highest level of production in 2008 (1.17 billion short tons). But it declined precipitously in 2015 and 2016. The Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) current data and short-term projections show coal production remaining under 800 million short tons in 2017 and 2018. Long-term EIA projections show that coal production is likely to fall below 600 million short tons per year, assuming implementation of the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan (CPP). Without CPP, coal production is expected to remain relatively flat, at around 800-900 million short tons per year through 2050.", "As a result of societal concerns, among them the desire for cleaner air, coal consumption may have peaked. But in either case (declining or flat demand), coal is a smaller share of the total U.S. energy pie. Power generation is the primary market for coal, accounting for about 93% of total consumption. With the retirement of many coal-fired power plants and the building of new gas-fired plants, accompanied by lower electricity demand, there has been a structural shift in demand for U.S. coal\u2014one that may lead to reduced capacity over the long term for coal-fired electricity generation. In 2016, natural gas overtook coal as the top energy source for power generation. Also, the strength of renewables for electricity generation should not be discounted, as EIA projects annual growth at a rate of 2.6% through 2050. Thus, coal would very likely remain a smaller portion of total U.S. energy consumption for years to come, particularly as energy used for power generation.", "The trend in coal mining has been to improve labor productivity, or to make production more efficient, with the use of technology. There were sharp increases in labor productivity (more coal per man-hour) in the 1980s and 1990s, as labor productivity more than doubled from 1985 to 2000, particularly at coal mines in the West. There is no indication that the coal industry will see a reversal of these production trends, even if there are some short-term gains in employment.", "The coal industry is highly concentrated in the United States, with just a handful of major producers, operating primarily in four states (Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Illinois). In 2015, the top five coal mining companies were responsible for about 57% of U.S. coal production, led by Peabody Energy Corp. with 19.6% and Arch Coal Inc. with 14.6%. The coal majors made numerous acquisitions in 2011 during a period of increasing global demand but of slowing domestic demand, weak coal prices, and more competitive natural gas supplies. The debt load and coal overproduction during this period was not sustainable and led to the bankruptcy of many coal firms.", "Three of the top five coal producers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection beginning in August 2015 (Alpha in August 2015, Arch Coal in February 2016, and Peabody in April 2016).

Additionally, because of technical innovation and regulatory incentives, costs for renewable energy are declining, leading to a likely long-term growth trend in renewable energy capacity. Even though U.S. coal production remained consistent at over 1 billion short tons annually over the past two decades (until recently), coal is losing its share of the overall U.S. energy market, primarily to natural gas. Just a few years ago, coal production, consumption, and exports were at or near record levels, but 2015 and 2016 saw significant declines. One of the challenges for the industry is how to penetrate the overseas coal market, particularly for steam coal, to compensate for declining domestic demand. ", "Domestic and global concerns over the potential environmental impacts from burning coal, particularly around carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and climate change, are leading to clean coal alternatives and the greater use of natural gas and renewables.

If coal jobs do not come back in large numbers, what new employment opportunities could be created? ", "At the global scale, some emerging countries see coal as the primary path to electric generation in the short term, while at the same time more developed countries such as Canada and those in Europe are moving away from coal and toward renewable energy. China, which currently consumes over 50% of the world's coal and is expected to remain the largest coal consumer over the long term, is seeking to implement a more balanced energy strategy as a response to the environmental impacts of burning coal. ", "Beginning in the 1970s, U.S. coal operators were required to comply with numerous federal and state regulations including stream buffer rules, effluent guidelines, underground injection control, and siting and reclamation rules. As U.S. energy policy and environmental regulations are debated, there is ongoing congressional interest in the role of coal in meeting U.S. and global energy needs. The question may not be whether the domestic production of coal is here to stay but, rather, how much U.S. coal will be burned, what type (e.g., from which region), and under what regulatory framework.

The coal industry will be challenged to be profitable in the current environment whether or not the industry incorporates social and environmental costs.

There is no indication that the coal industry will see a reversal of these production trends, even if there are some short-term gains in employment. Any employment gains would be starting from a historically low level.

The EIA's reference case forecasts coal exports to continue declining in the short term (2016-2018) but increasing to 85 million tons annually by 2050. Exports to Asia are expected to increase, but potential bottlenecks such as infrastructure (e.g., port development and transportation) and significant global competition could slow export growth.

It occurs as seams in sedimentary rock strata as old as 300 million years, though the most abundant deposits in the United States were deposited during the geologic Carboniferous period between 210 and 250 million years ago. Coal mineral classification considers type, rank, and grade. The plant life that coal originated from determines its type, and the degree of metamorphosis determines its rank, grade, and the amount of inorganic mineral matter present. Qualities such as moisture, carbon, sulfur, and ash content contribute to a coal's heating value as a fuel (measured in Btus). ", "The content of sulfur is significant because of the sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions that occur during coal combustion. Under the Clean Air Act, there are federal limits on the amount of SO 2 , among other pollutants, allowed from coal-fired power plants. Western coal (which has low sulfur and low energy content), primarily produced in the PRB of Wyoming, is used generally for power generation, while eastern coal has been used domestically for power generation and exported for coking and metallurgical purposes. Moisture adds weight to the coal, increasing shipping costs while decreasing its heating value. Minerals deposited with the plants that formed coal create ash when coal burns. Figure A-1 below illustrates the various coal classifications.", "Coal Mining Methods", "There are two primary mining techniques used in the United States: underground mining and surface mining. About 69% of U.S. coal comes from surface mines, while the remaining 31% comes from deep underground mines. ", "Underground Mining", "There are two primary underground mining techniques: room and pillar (including conventional and continuous mining) and longwall. Room and pillar and continuous mining is practiced as follows: In flat-lying coal beds, conventional room and pillar techniques rely on cutting, drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, and roof bolting\u2014a labor-intensive process. Long steel bolts properly spaced and driven into the roof are required. In continuous mining, the cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading are performed by a mechanical excavator known as a continuous miner. The continuous miner cuts and loads the coal. Together, room and pillar and continuous techniques account for 50% (conventional, room and pillar 2%; continuous 48%) of underground mining.", "The most efficient technique in underground mining is the longwall method, which employs a large machine with a rotating drum that moves back and forth across a wide coal seam. Once coal is removed by a longwall miner or other method, it is then moved out of the mine with conveyor belts or shuttle cars. About 50% of underground coal is produced using the longwall technique. ", "Surface Mining", "Surface mining, also called \"open-pit\" or strip mining, entails blasting rock above the coal with explosives. This overburden (rock and soil) above the coal deposit is then removed with huge electric shovels and draglines to reveal the coal seam. The coal seam in a surface mine is worked in long cuts by uncovering and removing coal, then backfilling and reclaiming land in sequence. In other words, while coal extraction is taking place, as required by federal law, the reclamation work occurs in an adjacent area previously mined. Mountaintop removal mining is a form of strip mining. Mountaintop removal mining generally removes a coal seam from one side of a mountain to the other. This is typically done in \"steep-terrain\" surface mining. Some of the overburden or \"excess spoil\" from the top of the mountain can be placed in a valley fill. The placement of the excess spoil in valleys adjacent to mining areas remains controversial. ", "Appendix B. Selected Company Profiles", "Peabody Energy", "Peabody Energy, based in St Louis, MO, and established in 1883, is the world's largest private-sector coal company. Peabody has dominated U.S. coal production over the past two decades. The company grew from 11.5% of industry production in 1994 to 19.6% of production in 2015. Peabody has a majority interest in 23 coal mining operations and 6,700 employees in the United States and Australia. Its most productive mines are in the PRB in Wyoming, which include the North Antelope Rochelle, Caballo, and Rawhide mines (which account for 65% of its production in the PRB). Peabody also operates mines in Arizona and New Mexico. In Australia, Peabody operates three mine sites in New South Wales and six mining operations in Queensland. Peabody claims 6.3 billion tons of coal reserves (most of which is thermal grade). Peabody had $4.7 billion in revenue in 2016. ", "Peabody has experienced issues with its debt levels since its 2011 expansion into Australia (the acquisition of two mines). Peabody debt-financed its acquisition of Australian coal company Macarthur Coal for $5.1 billion in 2011. In 2015, Peabody had long-term debt of $6.3 billion and operational losses of $1.5 billion. Its stock price fell from $79.35 per share in April 2015 to $2.07 per share as of April 12, 2016. Peabody filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2016, stating that overproduction of natural gas led to low gas prices, making coal less competitive.", "The reorganization plan would eliminate over $5 billion in debt (with $2 billion in debt remaining) and cover future mine cleanups using third-party surety bonds estimated at $1.26 billion.", "Arch Coal Inc.", "Arch Coal was formed in 1997, with headquarters in St. Louis, MO. The company came about from a merger of Ashland Coal Inc., and Arch Mineral Corp. Arch Mineral began in 1969. Ashland coal was formed as a subsidiary of Ashland Oil in 1975. In 1998, Arch Coal acquired the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield.", "Arch Coal operated 11 mines in the United States and had $2.6 billion in revenue in 2015. The company made several acquisitions in 2009-2011, spending several billion dollars. Arch Coal debt-financed the acquisition of metallurgical coal producer International Holding Group for $3.4 billion in 2011. About 76% of Arch's coal comes from the PRB, primarily its Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming. Arch's revenue fell from $3.9 billion in 2011 to $1.65 billion in 2016 and had major losses in the interim (2011-2016).", "In 2015, Arch Coal was the leading metallurgical coal producer in the United States and the second leading thermal coal producer, accounting for 14.6% of total coal production. Arch was the third-largest producer in 2005, producing in every U.S. coal basin, with mining complexes in Wyoming, Colorado, Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia.", "Arch Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 9, 2016, as its shares fell from a high of $260 per share in early January 2011 to less than $1 in 2015. Arch Coal emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 5, 2016. The company restructured its debt and has a new entity trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (ARCH). ARCH \"streamlined\" its portfolio of large-scale, modern, low-cost mines with a new debt level of $363 million.

Gross revenues fell from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $1.1 billion in 2015. Cloud Peak avoided layoffs because of transfers and attrition. At current coal prices, no new mines are being developed, as it will take time to work through stockpiles and overcapacity. Cloud Peak believes that the outlook for 2017 is better than 2016. The company has reduced its practice of self-bonding for reclamation to $10 million in 2016 from $200 million in 2015. Its surety bonds accounted for $418 million out of $428 million in reclamation bonds. Cloud Peak exports coal to the Asian market.", "Alpha Natural Resources", "Alpha Natural Resources (ANR), formed from a private equity group in 2002, acquired the majority of Pittston Coal Co. (which was a subsidiary of the Brink's Co.). ANR made a number of acquisitions from 2003 to 2011, including Massey Energy Co., which was debt-financed for $7.1 billion in 2011. The Massey acquisition gave ANR more than 150 mines and 40 coal preparation plants and a huge metallurgical-coal reserve base. Because of its heavy debt and low demand for coal, ANR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 3, 2015.

Murray Energy continued to purchase mines in the Illinois Basin, Northern Appalachia, and Utah. Murray invested in Foresight Energy, LP, in 2010, after paying $1.4 billion for a 50% stake. In 2013, Murray took over CONSOL Coal for $3.5 billion (including $1.8 billion in employment obligations, such as pension benefits, workers compensation, and disability payments). Murray currently operates 12 active coal mines (11 in the United States and 1 in Colombia with 6,000 miners). According to Murray, it is the largest privately held coal mining company in the United States. Murray Energy did not file for bankruptcy protection.", "Standard & Poor's downgraded Murray's credit rating to the lowest possible level before default. There was particular financial stress among coal producers in the northern Appalachia region because of the Marcellus shale natural gas play.
