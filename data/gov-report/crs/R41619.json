It reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of a large group of federal officials, but for a more limited purpose. It rested the obligation to provide consumer reports, together with financial information and records, upon consumer reporting agencies, financial agencies, and financial institutions, or holding companies.

A FBI counterintelligence investigation involved examining a linear connection between a foreign intelligence officer (about whom much was known) and his contacts (potential spies). The information known about the intelligence officer was specific in nature, and could be readily used to meet the NSL legal standards.... Unlike the traditional linear counterintelligence case, in which the foreign agent tried to recruit the domestic spy using infrequent and highly secure forms of communication, many counterterrorism cases involved complex networks generating a much larger volume of communication and financial transactions. In counter-terrorism cases, the starting point was often not a clearly identifiable agent of a foreign power (as in counterintelligence); indeed, the relevant \"foreign power\" was itself an imperfectly understood terrorist organization that might defy precise definition. As a consequence, counter-terrorism investigators often had a far more difficult time meeting the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard.", "The language precluding NSL-related investigations grounded exclusively on the exercise of First Amendment rights would also have disappeared.

On the other hand, they provided the FBI with no explicit remedy should recipients violate the nondisclosure requirement.

Second, it amended the NSL statutes to make it clear that a recipient remained free to seek the advice of counsel before complying. These amendments, unlike the obstruction of justice amendment, would disappear should the NSL statutes return to their earlier versions.

S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 do not mention minimization. The change is apparently a response to intervening Justice Department action. Senator Paul's bills include specific NSL minimization proposals. ", "\"Minimization,\" in this context, refers to limitations on what information is acquired; how it is acquired; how it is maintained; who has access to it within the capturing agency and under what circumstances; to whom and under what circumstances it is disclosed beyond the capturing agency; how long it is preserved; and when and under what circumstances it is expunged. Minimization standards are drawn with an eye to the purposes for which information is acquired; the authority under which it is acquired; the legitimate interests which may be affected by its acquisition, use, or disclosure; and the governmental interests served by its acquisition, maintenance, use, and disclosure.", "Minimization standards ordinarily reinforce statutory and regulatory limitations that attend the use of possibly invasive means of acquiring information. For example, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides fairly rigorous statutory procedures that must be honored before electronic surveillance or physical searches may be authorized in a national security context. It also supplies statutory conditions under which information acquired using those techniques may be used, and both judicial and legislative oversight procedures. As an additional safeguard, it also calls for the creation and implementation of minimization procedures to protect private information relating to Americans consistent with the U.S. foreign intelligence interests.", "Section 119(f) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act directed the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on the feasibility of NSL minimization procedures \"to ensure the protection of the constitutional rights of United States persons.\" The Inspector General's reports noted the need for minimization standards or their regulatory equivalent:", "In our first NSL report, the OIG noted the proviso in the Attorney General's NSI Guidelines that national security investigations should use the \"least intrusive collection techniques feasible\" to carry out the investigations. The OIG reported that we found no clear guidance on how Special Agents should reconcile the Attorney General guidelines' limitations with the expansive authority provided in the NSL statutes. Our concerns over the lack of formal guidance were magnified because of the volume of NSLs generated by the FBI each year and because the information collected is retained for long periods in databases available to many authorized law enforcement personnel.", "The Justice Department convened a working group to study and make recommendations concerning possible NSL minimization standards in response to its statutory obligation and the Inspector General's initial report. ", "Attorney General Holder reported in a letter dated December 9, 2010, to Senator Leahy as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that the Attorney General had \"approved Procedures for the Collection, Use and Storage of Information Derived from National Security Letters on October 1, 2010\" and that, \"[t]he FBI's current practice is consistent with the procedures and the FBI is working on formal policy to implement them. In addition DOJ and ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] will shortly complete work on a joint report to Congress on NSL 'minimization' as required by the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act of 2005.\" ", "The Senate Judiciary Committee report noted that, in light of the Attorney General's action, S. 193 replaced a call for the promulgation of minimization standards with a section that would direct the \"Attorney General to periodically review the procedures, taking the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans into consideration.\" S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 adopt the same approach. Senator Paul's proposals would continue to call upon the Attorney General to promulgate minimization standards. His proposals, however, emphasize the need for standards that address when NSL-generated information should be disposed of, for example, \"including procedures to ensure that information obtained that is outside the scope of such National Security Letter or request, is returned or destroyed.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reports and Audits", "paragraphs": ["Some of the NSL statutes provide for periodic reports to various congressional committees.
