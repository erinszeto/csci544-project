Currently, DOE estimates the total project cost to be about$3.26 billion compared to the original estimate of $2.03 billion. GAO estimates the cost to be $3.9 billion. Theoverrun is due primarily to significantmanagement and technical problems that emerged during NIF construction. (1) DOE has not amended its FY2001 budget request for NIF, which was $74millionfor construction plus about $85 million in related costs. With the FY2000 appropriations, Congress had directedDOE to provide a new cost baseline by June 1,2000, or provide an estimate of termination costs. The House noted DOE's failure to meet the deadline, and statedthat it would reserve judgment about the NIFproject until September. In the meantime it approved funding the original DOE request for NIF for FY2001.", "The Senate bill included an amendment that would cap funding for NIF at $74.1 million until the results of a study by the National Academy of Sciences on theproject was delivered. The study was to be completed by September 1, 2001, and would, among other things,examine the contribution of NIF to the StockpileStewardship program (SSP) and determine whether existing technical problems are likely to add to the project's costand whether a smaller version of NIF wouldsuffice.", "In conference, the funding of $199 million for NIF for FY2001 was agreed to. Of this amount, $65 million would come from funds transferred from otherweapons programs and $134.1 million would be in new appropriations. The final appropriations bill limits theamount available to DOE for NIF to $130 millionat the start of FY2001, releasing the remaining funds after March 31, 2001 and only after certification by the NNSAthat several conditions have been met. Theseconditions include, among other things, a review of alternative construction options; certification that projectmilestones, schedule and costs are being met;completion of a study on whether a full-scale NIF is needed to meet the goals of the SSP; and a five-year plan forthe SSP that describes how NIF is to be paid forin the out years. In the meantime, DOE completed the new baseline on September 15, 2000, and now estimates thetotal NIF project cost at $3.45 billion.", "Another issue raised by the House concerned the amount and use of Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funds. For FY2000, the Congresshad reduced the LDRD funding level to 4% of funds appropriated for labs from 6%. DOE requested restoring thelevel to 6% for FY2001, but the House retainedthat 4% level and further directed DOE to submit a specific request for these funds within each program in futurebudget submissions. In an amendment adoptedon the floor, the Senate approved a level of 8% and included funds from the Environmental Management programs. The conferees adopted a level of 6% forLDRD for the laboratories and 2% for the weapons production plants. The House requirement that DOE producea financial accounting report of these funds wasalso adopted.", "Nonproliferation and National Security Programs. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programsprovide technical capabilities to support U.S. efforts to prevent, detect, and counter the spread of nuclear weaponsworldwide. Also included are CooperativeThreat Reduction programs to reduce nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon dangers in Russia and othercountries of the former Soviet Union, and armscontrol treaty verification programs. Some intelligence programs are also included. These nonproliferation andnational security programs are to be included inthe newly established National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Some of these activities are also fundedin the Department of Defense. (See CRSreport RL30505: Appropriations for FY2001: Defense.)", "The Administration's FY2001 request for these programs was $865.6 million, an increase of $36.5 million over FY2000. The House approved $861.5 millionfor DOE nuclear nonproliferation programs in the Energy and Water appropriations bill for FY2001. The Senatebill funded the activity at $909.0 million, and thefinal bill appropriated $874.2 million. ", "The FY2001 request for nonproliferation and national security programs included $100 million for a new long-term nonproliferation program with Russia. Thenew program, part of the Administration's Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, is the result of several years ofnegotiations aimed at ending Russia's continuing production of plutonium that can be used to make nuclear weapons. The funds would be used to store Russiannuclear waste instead of reprocessing it to recoverplutonium, and to accelerate efforts to improve the safety and security of nuclear materials in Russia. The Houseand Senate bills funded some of these activities,but included the funding in existing programs rather than as a new initiative. The final bill continued this pattern.", "Environmental Management. DOE's Environmental Management Program (EM) is responsible for cleaning upenvironmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at DOE nuclear sites. The FY2001 enacted levelfor the program is $6.4 billion, nearly the fullrequest, excluding the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The House had voteda $300 million reduction from the budgetrequest, and the Senate had cut about $100 million.", "The enacted measure cuts all but $65 million of the $539 million request for the \"privatization\" of major DOE waste management projects, primarily a project tosolidify high-level radioactive waste at Hanford, Washington. Because DOE decided in spring 2000 that theHanford project would not be \"privatized\" after all,the conferees transferred $377 million from the privatization account to the Office of River Protection at Hanford,where the waste solidification effort will bemanaged under a more routine DOE contract. The conferees also approved a rescission of $97 million that hadpreviously been appropriated for the contract.", "The FY2001 EM budget request was based on the program's accelerated cleanup strategy, which attempts to maximize the number of sites that can be completelycleaned up by the end of FY2006. DOE managers contend that substantial long-term savings can be gained byfocusing on completing work at those sites,allowing the earliest possible termination of infrastructure costs. Major sites scheduled for shutdown during thatperiod are included in the \"defense facilitiesclosure projects\" account, for which $1.1 billion is included in the enacted bill, the same as the Administrationrequest. The largest facilities under that accountare the Rocky Flats site in Colorado and the Fernald site in Ohio. Another $981.5 million is provided for\"site/project completion,\" about $65 million above therequest, for cleanup activities to be finished by 2006 at DOE sites that will remain in operation.", "Despite the 2006 cleanup goal, the bulk of EM's funding is in the \"post-2006 completion\" account, including the Office of River Protection at Hanford. Thisaccount includes cleanup projects that are expected to continue sometime after 2006. The FY2001 appropriationsact provides $3.46 billion for post-2006completion projects, including the $377 million transfer for the Hanford waste solidification project from theprivatization account. The Administration hadsought $2.97 billion.", "The Hanford waste project, called the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), consists of a pilot vitrification plant that would turn liquid high-level waste intoradioactive glass logs for eventual disposal. The $450 million sought by DOE for TWRS was by far the largest itemin EM's FY2001 privatization fundingrequest. TWRS suffered a severe setback in spring 2000 after contractor BNFL Inc. announced that costs wouldtotal $15.2 billion, more than twice thepreviously estimated level. DOE announced in May 2000 that it would select a new contractor and switch totraditional financing methods for the project. TheHouse had cut DOE's FY2001 appropriations request for TWRS to $194 million, and the Senate had voted $259million.", "Another major privatized project is a facility to treat \"mixed\" radioactive and hazardous waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory,for which $65 million was requested and included in the enacted bill. The Idaho project, the Advanced MixedWaste Treatment Project, is opposed by someresidents of Wyoming who are concerned about radioactivity from a planned incinerator. In response to thatopposition, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson haltedfurther work on the incinerator on March 27, 2000, and established a panel to recommend alternatives. However,the construction of the rest of the treatmentproject is to proceed.", "The EM privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting a portion of project risks from the federalgovernment to contractors. Profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules andholding down costs; potentially, profits could besubstantially higher or lower than under traditional DOE contracting arrangements.", "In a typical non-privatized DOE project, a contractor would be hired to build and operate a facility with government funds. DOE would approve and pay all thecontractor's costs, and then award the contractor a profit based on performance. Under the privatization initiative,a contractor would be expected to raise almostall funding for necessary facilities and equipment for a project. The contractor would recover that investment andearn a profit by charging previously negotiatedfees to DOE for providing services under the contract, such as solidification of radioactive waste.", "With a privatized project, the contractor could earn higher profits by reducing costs, but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expectedor the required services were not delivered. If DOE cancelled the project, the federal government would repay thecontractor's expenses to that date. To coverthat contingency, DOE needs enough funding to be appropriated as construction proceeds. If the project were tobegin operating as planned, the accumulatedappropriations would be used to pay for waste treatment under the contract. In the case of the Hanford TWRSproject, however, DOE concluded that the risksinvolved would cause the private sector to charge excessive prices to the government, negating the potential costsavings.", "DOE's $295 million request for decontamination and decommissioning of uranium enrichment plants and mill sites would have provided a 21% boost over theFY2000 appropriation, and the final bill provided a further increase to $345 million. Much of DOE's proposedincrease was targeted toward environmentalcleanup activities at DOE's uranium enrichment plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, which arecurrently leased to a private firm. Recentcontroversy has focused on environmental hazards posed by the plants, particularly contamination resulting fromthe past enrichment of reprocessed uranium atPaducah. The enacted measure provides an additional $42 million above the request for reimbursing the miningindustry for cleaning up uranium and thoriummill waste. The House had voted to cut the request to $260 million because of \"severe funding constraints,\"according to the Appropriations Committee report,while the Senate had approved $298 million. ", "Civilian Nuclear Waste. The enacted bill provides up to $401million for the civilian nuclear waste program inFY2001 - nearly $30 million below the budget request but a $50 million increase over the FY2000 level. The Househad voted to provide $413 million, while theSenate had voted $351 million. As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, DOE is studying Yucca Mountain,Nevada, as the site for a national wasterepository, currently scheduled to open in 2010. A final Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed YuccaMountain repository is to be completed inFY2001. DOE contends that increased funding will be needed to prepare a site recommendation report for thePresident in FY2001, and to work on a licenseapplication to be sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2002, but the House AppropriationsCommittee report contended that DOE could meet itsobjectives with a smaller increase.", "Funding for the program comes from two sources. Under the FY2001 budget request, $318.6 million was to be provided from the Nuclear Waste Fund, whichconsists of fees paid by nuclear utilities, and $112 million from the defense nuclear waste disposal account, whichpays for disposal of high-level waste generatedby the nuclear weapons program. The House voted to appropriate $213 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and$200 million for the defense disposal account. The House also voted to rescind $85 million appropriated in FY1986 for interim nuclear waste storage - fundingthat was contingent on the passage of legislationthat was vetoed by the President. The Senate approved $292 million from the defense disposal account and $59million from the Nuclear Waste Fund, and alsoincluded the rescission of $85 million for interim storage. The final act provides $191 million from the NuclearWaste Fund and $200 million from the defenseaccount. It also rescinds $75 million from the previously appropriated $85 million for interim storage, andauthorizes DOE to use the remaining $10 million if itis needed to complete the Yucca Mountain site recommendation report on time, for a total of $401 million.", "The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998, for DOE to begin takingwaste from nuclear plant sites. Nuclear utilities and state utility regulators, upset over DOE's failure to meet the1998 disposal deadline, have won two federalcourt decisions upholding the Department's obligation to meet the deadline and to compensate utilities for anyresulting damages. Utilities have also won severalcases in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, although specific damages have not yet been determined. In August2000, a U.S. appeals court ruled that utilities couldsue DOE for damages without first pursuing administrative remedies.", "Power Marketing Administrations. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) developed out of theconstruction of dams and multi-purpose water projects during the 1930s that are operated by the Bureau ofReclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Theoriginal intention behind these projects was conservation and management of water resources, including irrigation,flood control, recreation and other objectives. However, many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs. The PMAs were established to market theexcess power; they are the Bonneville PowerAdministration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA),and Western Area Power Administration(WAPA).", "The power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies \"at the lowest possible rates ... consistent with sound business practice,\" and priority onPMA power is extended to \"preference customers,\" which include municipal utilities, co-ops and other \"public\"bodies. The PMAs do not own the generatingfacilities, but they generally do own transmission facilities, except for Southeastern. The PMAs are responsible forcovering their expenses and repaying debt andthe federal investment in the generating facilities.", "The 104th Congress debated sale of the PMAs and did, in 1995, authorize divestiture of one PMA, the Alaska Power Administration. The future of the remainingPMAs may rest on decisions yet to be made about the treatment of public power in the broader context of electricutility restructuring.", "BPA receives no annual appropriation. The Administration's request for the other three PMAs for FY2001 was $199.6 million, a reduction of 25% from theFY2000 appropriation. The savings stemmed from the Administration's proposal that, beginning in FY2000,customers of SEPA, WAPA, and SWPA would beresponsible for making their own power purchases and transmission arrangements from any suppliers other thanthe PMA to satisfy their needs. Under thePurchase Power and Wheeling Program (PPW), the PMAs have purchased electricity and transmission capability,which is repaid by PMA customers, tosupplement federal generation. The premise behind the proposed elimination of the PPW program was thatderegulation should make it less expensive and lesscomplicated for PMA customers to make these arrangements. Another possible reason is that the moneyappropriated to the PMAs under PPW is repaid to theTreasury rather than to DOE. This means that the PPW appropriation is fully scored against the caps ondiscretionary domestic spending with which DOE mustcomply. Both the House and the Senate kept close to the Administration's proposed funding; the final billappropriated $200.7 million for the three PMAs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Title IV: Independent Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Independent agencies that receive funding from the Energy and Water Development bill include the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC), the AppalachianRegional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission.
