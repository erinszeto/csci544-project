The elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35% in 1959 to an all-time low of 9% in 2006, in large part because of Social Security.

The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, also provides benefits to the poorest elderly, many of whom do not qualify for Social Security benefits.

The Social Security Trustees project cash-flow deficits beginning in 2017 and trust fund insolvency in 2041. Many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce Social Security benefits in the future. Benefit reductions could affect the low-income elderly, many of whom rely on Social Security benefits for almost all of their income. Such potential benefit reductions could lead to higher rates of poverty among the elderly compared to those projected under the current benefit formula. Because the low-income elderly are especially vulnerable to benefit reductions, many recent Social Security reform proposals have included minimum benefits or other provisions that would mitigate the effect of benefit cuts on the elderly poor.", "This report analyzes the projected effects of four possible approaches to mitigating the effects of Social Security benefit reductions on elderly poverty in 2042, the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency. The options are compared to a payable baseline, which assumes current-law benefits would need to be cut across the board to balance Social Security's annual income and spending at the point of insolvency. The four options examined are (1) a poverty-line Social Security minimum benefit; (2) a sliding-scale Social Security minimum benefit; (3) a poverty-line SSI benefit; and (4) a poverty-line SSI benefit with liberalized eligibility.", "Major findings include the following:", "Each of the four options would reduce elderly poverty compared to the payable baseline\u2014ranging from a negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for the option to create a sliding-scale Social Security minimum benefit to a reduction of three percentage points for the poverty-line SSI benefit with liberalized eligibility.

For example, SSI was originally designed to benefit the poor and its strict income and asset limits restrict benefits to the poorest elderly. As such, expanding SSI eligibility or benefits would effectively target additional spending toward the elderly poor. Social Security, on the other hand, was not primarily intended to reduce poverty, but to replace the lost earnings of contributing workers of all income levels. Changing the Social Security benefit formula to mitigate the effects of changes on the elderly poor arguably would not target additional dollars as efficiently. It also might complicate the balance between adequacy and equity in the Social Security program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Scope of Changes", "paragraphs": ["Another possible subject for discussion is the potential scope of policy changes\u2014factors such as program participation rates and eligibility restrictions. Social Security participation among the elderly is nearly universal. SSI has strict eligibility criteria and its participation rates are far lower. As a result, changes to SSI would likely affect fewer of the elderly poor than would changes to Social Security. Some individuals prefer not to receive means-tested assistance and would not participate in SSI regardless of changes. Other individuals may not qualify even for a liberalized SSI program because of asset restrictions.

In recent years, major changes to Social Security and SSI have been rare. For example, the last significant amendments to Social Security were in 1983. SSI's income disregards and asset tests have stayed the same since 1981 and 1989, respectively, and are not indexed to inflation. There are also fiscal constraints on additional spending. The federal budget is currently in deficit and is projected to remain so in the future. In addition, Social Security faces long-term solvency problems.", "Ultimately, future elderly poverty rates depend largely on how policymakers choose to address Social Security's looming solvency problems.

This baseline illustrates how such options could work in a benefit-cut scenario. Some of the most commonly discussed solvency options are projected to result in poverty rates similar to the current law payable baseline in the year of analysis, as discussed above. Using a different baseline or different solvency option would lead to different results.", "Year of Analysis", "This report focuses on the effects of policy changes in 2042, the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency. Analyzing this year shows how various poverty-reduction options could mitigate the effects of an across-the-board cut to Social Security benefits at the projected point of insolvency, assuming no action was taken before then. This reduction is assumed to bring annual cash-flow balance to the system, cutting benefits by about 25% in 2042. The figures and accompanying analysis are essentially a snapshot of the projected beneficiary population in this single year. Focusing on a different year would lead to different results.", "It is also important to recall that initial Social Security benefits rise with wages over time, while SSI benefits and income limits as well as the poverty thresholds rise with prices. Since wages are projected to rise faster than prices over time, this means that in general, the projected prevalence of SSI receipt decreases each year under current law, as does the number of people in poverty.", "Start Year for Options", "All of the options in this report are assumed to be implemented in 2008. The year 2008 was chosen so that the analysis could rely as much as possible on near-term projections, which are more reliable than long-term projections. In addition, choosing an earlier start year means that almost all of the elderly beneficiaries in the analysis year, 2042, will be subject to the options.", "Measure of Income", "Many of the results presented in this paper focus on changes in income. For the purposes of this paper, income includes Social Security benefits, SSI benefits, pension payments, earnings, and the annuitized value of financial assets. In modeling these options, Social Security benefits were calculated before SSI benefits. This sequence is intended to mimic program rules, in which SSI applicants must apply for all other benefits for which they may qualify before applying for SSI. As a result, the interactions between Social Security and SSI benefits can be seen. Income is calculated on a per capita basis, which means that for married couples the income of both spouses is averaged together. However, in showing poverty status, a measure of family income is used since the official poverty threshold is calculated on a family basis.", "Poverty Thresholds", "In the U.S., poverty is officially defined using the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds. These thresholds reflect rough estimates of the amount of money individuals or families need per year to purchase a basket of goods and services deemed \"minimally adequate,\" according to the living standards of the early 1960s, when the poverty thresholds were developed. The thresholds are increased at the rate of inflation. The 2007 annual poverty threshold was $9,944 for an elderly individual and $12,533 for an elderly couple. A family is considered poor if its countable money income is less than the poverty threshold for its family type and size. This report uses the official poverty thresholds appropriate for each individual's family type and size (including the thresholds for elderly individuals and couples). The thresholds are projected using the intermediate assumptions about future inflation from the 2005 Social Security Trustees Report.", "Behavioral Changes", "This analysis assumes that no behavioral changes result from the modification of the Social Security or SSI benefit rules. Thus, policy changes will not automatically alter an individual's work patterns or age at benefit take-up. However, it's likely that if policy changes were implemented, individuals' incentives and behavior could also change. The model assumes that roughly two-thirds of individuals who qualify for SSI take up benefits. For policies with liberalized eligibility criteria (such as the SSI options analyzed in this report), the same proportion of qualifying individuals is assumed to take up benefits. However, it is possible that a more generous SSI program would also change the proportion of qualifying individuals taking up benefits, which is not captured in these projections. The analysis also assumes no changes in state policy as a result of policy changes at the federal level. However, it is possible that federal policy changes in SSI could result in adjustments to state supplements, for example."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
