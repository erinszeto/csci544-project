Nationally, home prices have been consistently increasing since 2012. Negative equity and mortgage foreclosure rates have been steadily decreasing, though both remain elevated. Home sales have begun to increase, with sales of existing homes approaching levels that were common in the early 2000s, though sales of new homes and housing starts remain relatively low.", "Mortgage originations have also remained relatively low despite ongoing low interest rates, leading many to argue that it is too difficult for prospective homebuyers to qualify for a mortgage. Some believe that this is because mortgage regulations put in place in recent years are restricting access to mortgages for creditworthy homebuyers, while others hold that these rules provide important consumer protections and suggest that other factors are limiting mortgage access. About two-thirds of new mortgages continue to be backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or insured by a government agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with the remaining mortgages mostly being held on bank balance sheets.", "In the rental housing market, vacancy rates have continued to decline and rents have continued to increase as more households become renters. Although the supply of rental housing has also increased, it has generally not kept pace with the increasing demand. Rising rents have contributed to housing affordability problems, which are especially pronounced for low-income renters.", "The 114th Congress considered a number of housing-related issues against this backdrop. Some of these issues were related to housing for low-income individuals and families, including appropriations for housing programs in a limited funding environment, proposed reforms to certain rental assistance programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), debate over funding for two affordable housing funds (the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund), and the possible reauthorization of the main program that provides housing assistance to Native Americans. Congress also took the occasion of HUD's 50th anniversary to reflect on the department's role through hearings and other actions.", "Congress also deliberated on certain housing finance-related issues, including possible targeted changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, oversight of mortgage-related rulemakings, and issues related to the future and financial health of FHA.", "Two fair housing issues were also active in the 114th Congress. HUD recently released a new rule updating certain HUD grantees' responsibilities to \"affirmatively further\" fair housing. Separately, the Supreme Court issued a decision affirming that disparate impact claims are allowable under the Fair Housing Act. Congress expressed interest in both of these developments.", "As in recent years, the 114th Congress considered several housing-related tax provisions as part of a broader tax extenders bill.

The bubble featured rapidly rising home prices in many areas of the country as well as looser credit standards for obtaining mortgages. The years of housing market turmoil that followed featured sharp declines in house prices, increased mortgage foreclosures, tighter mortgage credit standards, and lower levels of home sales and homebuilding.", "Since about 2012, many national housing market indicators have been improving from their performance during the years of housing market turmoil. For example, house prices have been rising and negative equity and foreclosure rates have been falling. However, foreclosure rates and negative equity continue to be higher than is generally considered to be normal, and home sales and mortgage originations have been relatively low. In addition, housing affordability continues to be an issue for many households in general, and for low-income renter households in particular. Rising home prices impact the affordability of housing for prospective homebuyers, while increasing numbers of renter households and the corresponding effects on vacancy rates and rents have implications for the affordability and availability of rental housing. ", "The 114 th Congress considered a number of housing-related issues against this backdrop. Some of these issues reflected larger questions about policies that could accelerate recovery in the housing and mortgage markets or factors that could be hampering recovery. For example, Congress considered legislation to modify certain mortgage-related laws and regulations that were put in place during the aftermath of the housing downturn, in response to concern that these new rules may be impeding access to mortgage credit. However, some feel that changes to the rules could weaken consumer protections. Congress also considered certain changes related to two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other housing finance-related issues. ", "In addition, the 114 th Congress considered a number of issues related to affordable rental housing and assisted housing programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These issues included appropriations for housing programs in a limited funding environment, certain reforms to some HUD-assisted housing programs, the reauthorization of the main program of housing assistance for Native American tribes, and debate about GSE contributions to two affordable housing funds that were created in 2008 but received GSE funding for the first time beginning in 2016.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Negative Equity", "paragraphs": ["During the housing market turmoil, falling house prices left many households in a negative equity position, meaning that they owed more on their mortgages than their homes were currently worth. Negative equity can contribute to foreclosures because it prevents households from selling their homes for enough to pay off their mortgages if they are having difficulty staying current on mortgage payments. Furthermore, negative equity can affect the housing market by making households less likely to put their homes up for sale, as many homeowners may be reluctant to sell their homes if the sales prices will not be enough to pay off their mortgage balances.", "With home prices increasing on a national basis, the number of households estimated to have negative equity has been falling. As shown in Figure 2 , in the third quarter of 2016 just over 6% of all mortgaged properties were estimated to have negative equity. In comparison, in the second quarter of 2011 the negative equity share was estimated at about 25%. ", "Although rising home prices have helped many households regain equity, it is estimated that over 3 million homes with a mortgage remain in negative equity across the country. Furthermore, although the overall rate of negative equity is improving, negative equity is not evenly distributed across the country. In particular, negative equity remains persistently high in many low-income and minority neighborhoods. Lower-priced homes also continue to experience negative equity at higher rates than higher-priced homes.

Existing home sales during that period peaked in 2005 at over 7 million before falling to a low of about 4.1 million in 2008.

Nevertheless, as housing markets have started to stabilize, there have been signs that housing starts are also beginning to increase. As shown in Figure 6 , which shows the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts for each month from January 1995 through December 2016, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts in one-unit residential buildings was generally between 1.2 million and 1.8 million each month from 2000 through 2007. Since that time, however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts fell to a rate of between 400,000 and 600,000 for each month until about 2013. More recently, housing starts have been trending upward, and were close to or exceeded a seasonally adjusted annual rate of over 700,000 for much of 2015 and 2016.

", "There are several possible reasons why home purchase mortgage originations, and home sales in general, may not be increasing more quickly. Economic pressures could be affecting both the supply of homes on the market and demand for those homes. For example, some current homeowners may be unwilling to sell their homes due to negative equity or other reasons, leading to lower numbers of homes for sale in many markets. Stagnant or declining incomes and factors such as rising student loan debt may be depressing the demand for home purchases, particularly among younger households who would traditionally be first-time homebuyers. ", "Demographic trends may also be playing a role. As the baby boomer generation ages, fewer households may be seeking to move since older households tend to move less frequently than younger households. At the same time, younger households, who traditionally make up a large share of first-time homebuyers, appear to be waiting longer to purchase homes. While this could be partly due to economic pressures, younger households are also more likely to delay major life events, such as marriage, compared to previous generations. This could also contribute to some households waiting longer to purchase a home.

Striking the right balance of credit access and risk management, and the question of who is considered to be \"creditworthy,\" continue to be subjects of ongoing debate. ", "A variety of organizations attempt to measure the availability of mortgage credit. While their methods vary, many experts agree that mortgage credit is tighter than it was in the years prior to the housing bubble and subsequent housing market turmoil. In particular, researchers note that a higher proportion of loans are made to the highest credit quality borrowers and that the mortgage market is taking on less default risk than it did in the years that preceded the looser credit standards of the housing bubble.

Funding for Section 8 vouchers makes up the largest share of HUD's budget, accounting for nearly half. The cost of the Section 8 voucher program has been growing in recent years. This is in part because Congress has created more vouchers each year over the past several years (largely to replace units lost to the affordable housing stock in other assisted housing programs or to provide targeted assistance for homeless veterans), and in part because the cost of renewing individual vouchers has been rising as gaps between low-income tenants' incomes and rents in the market have been growing. ", "The cost of Section 8 project-based rental assistance has also been growing in recent years as more and more long-term rental assistance contracts on older properties expire and are renewed, requiring new appropriations. Public housing, the third-largest expense in HUD's budget, has, arguably, been underfunded (based on studies undertaken by HUD of what it should cost to operate and maintain public housing) for many years. As a result, there is regular pressure from low-income housing advocates and others to increase funding for public housing. ", "In a budget environment featuring limits on discretionary spending, the pressure to provide more funding for HUD's largest programs must be balanced against the pressure from states, localities, and advocates to maintain or increase funding for other HUD programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, grants for homelessness assistance, and funding for Native American housing.

The majority of the proposed reforms are aimed at streamlining administration of the programs, although some have been farther reaching than others. Recent reform proposals, including those considered but not enacted in the 111 th and 112 th Congresses, have included a number of fairly noncontroversial administrative provisions, along with others that have proved more controversial.

Under the terms of those contracts, the property owners receive federal subsidies in exchange for agreeing to lease their units at affordable rents to eligible low-income tenants. Recent reform proposals have called for similar administrative streamlining (involving income eligibility and rent policies) as well as incentives to encourage owners to continue to participate in the program, and enhanced protections for tenants when owners exit the program.", "The public housing program has existed longer than either Section 8 program but is now smaller in size, with approximately 1 million units of low-rent public housing available to eligible low-income tenants. Public housing is owned by the same local PHAs that administer the Section 8 voucher program and those PHAs receive annual operating and capital funding from Congress through HUD. Much of the public housing stock is old and in need of capital repairs. According to the most recent study conducted by HUD, addressing the outstanding physical needs of the public housing stock would cost nearly $26 billion. The amount Congress typically provides in annual appropriations for capital needs has not been sufficient to address that backlog. In response, PHAs have increasingly relied on other sources of financing, particularly private market loans, to meet the capital needs of their housing stock, including by converting their public housing properties to Section 8 assistance through the Rental Assistance Demonstration. Like the two Section 8 programs, the public housing program has been criticized for being overly complex and burdensome to administer, especially in light of recent funding reductions.", "Recent reform proposals have included changes to the income eligibility and rent determination process for all three programs, designed to make it less complicated, and changes to the physical inspection process in the voucher program to give PHAs more options for reducing the frequency of inspections and increasing sanctions for failed inspections. Recent reform proposals have also sought to modify and expand the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration. MTW permits a selected group of PHAs to seek waivers of most federal rules and regulations governing the Section 8 voucher program and the public housing program in pursuit of three statutory purposes: reduce program costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness; provide work incentives and supports for families with children; and increase housing choices for families. The future of MTW and whether it should be expanded has proven to be one of the more controversial elements of assisted housing reform.

Supporters argue that these funds are necessary to address a pressing need for an increased supply of affordable rental housing for the poorest households. Supporters also argue that a benefit of these programs is that they are funded outside of the annual appropriations process, meaning that they are less likely to compete with other housing programs for funding. Critics raise a number of concerns, including arguing that these funds are duplicative of other housing programs and that providing funding outside of the appropriations process limits Congress's role in overseeing them.

Until implementation of the AFFH rule, program participants have satisfied their obligation to affirmatively further fair housing by certifying to HUD that they conducted an \"Analysis of Impediments\" (AI) to fair housing and were taking appropriate actions to overcome impediments. A Government Accountability Office analysis of a sample of AIs in 2010 found that many were outdated or lacked content, serving in part to prompt HUD to develop its AFFH rule. The AFFH rule defines more specifically what it means to affirmatively further fair housing, and requires that program participants submit an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) to HUD at least every five years.

", "Originally, the deduction was to be available only for 2007, but it was subsequently extended several times. Most recently, the PATH Act extended the deduction through the end of 2016.", "Two justifications for allowing the deduction of mortgage insurance premiums are the promotion of homeownership and, relatedly, the recovery of the housing market. Homeownership is often believed to bestow certain benefits to society as a whole, such as higher property values, lower crime, and higher civic participation, among others. Homeownership may also promote a more even distribution of income and wealth and establish greater individual financial security, though the experience in the recent housing downturn has caused some to question this. Last, homeownership may have a positive effect on living conditions, which can lead to a healthier population. ", "With regard to the first justification, it is not clear that the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums has an effect on the homeownership rate. Economists have identified the high transaction costs associated with a home purchase\u2014mostly resulting from the down payment requirement, but also closing costs\u2014as the primary barrier to homeownership. The ability to deduct insurance premiums does not lower this barrier\u2014most lenders will require mortgage insurance if the borrower's down payment is less than 20% regardless of whether the premiums are deductible. The deduction may allow a buyer to borrow more, however, because they can deduct the higher associated premiums and therefore afford a higher housing payment. ", "Concerning the second justification, it is also not clear that the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums is still needed to assist in the recovery of the housing market. As discussed earlier in the \" Overview of Housing and Mortgage Market Conditions \" section of this report, home prices have increased consistently since 2012, which suggests that the market as a whole is stronger than when the provision was originally enacted. Extending the deduction may, however, assist some individuals who are in financial distress because of burdensome housing payments.", "Last, economists have noted that owner-occupied housing is already heavily subsidized via tax and non-tax programs. To the degree that owner-occupied housing is over subsidized, extending the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums would lead to a greater misallocation of resources that are directed toward the housing industry.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low-Income Housing Tax Credit: The 9% Floor", "paragraphs": ["The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) to provide an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. Two types of LIHTCs are available depending on the nature of the rental housing construction: the so-called 9% credit for new construction, and the so-called 4% credit for rehabilitated housing and new construction that is financed with tax-exempt bonds. The credits are claimed annually over 10 years. The credit percentages do not actually equal 9% or 4%. Instead, the credit percentages are determined by a formula that is intended to ensure that the present value of the 10-year stream of credits equals 70% (new construction) and 30% (rehabilitated construction) of qualified construction costs. The formula depends in part on interest rates that fluctuate over time, implying that LIHTC rates fluctuate as well. ", "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) temporarily changed the credit rate formula used for new construction. The act effectively placed a floor equal to 9% on the new construction tax credit rate. The 9% credit rate floor originally applied only to new construction placed in service before December 31, 2013. The 4% tax credit rate that is applied to rehabilitation construction or new construction jointly financed with tax-exempt bonds remained unaltered by the act. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ) extended the 9% floor for credit allocations made before January 1, 2014, and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-295 ) extended the 9% floor through the end of 2014. Most recently, the PATH Act permanently extended the 9% floor, but left the 4% credit unchanged. ", "Historically, relatively low interest rates have resulted in the LIHTC rates being below the 4% and 9% thresholds. Because low interest rates persist, the floors would result in subsidies in excess of 30% and 70%. Specifically, the 4% floor would have resulted in a 37% subsidy and the 9% floor would have resulted in an 84% subsidy as of December 2015.", "The floors on the credit rates address a concern among some LIHTC participants that the variable rate method for determining the LIHTC rates discourages some investment because of the uncertainty it introduces over what the final credit rate for a particular project will be. The floors also indirectly address a potential problem in the original formula used for determining the variable credit rates. The original formula was designed to ensure that when the 10-year stream of tax credits is discounted, the present value subsidies of 30% or 70% are achieved. However, the interest rate used to discount the tax credit streams is based on U.S. Treasury yields, which are generally viewed as risk-free. Investing in LIHTC projects is not risk-free, which suggests that the interest rate used to compute the subsidy levels should be higher than the yield on U.S. Treasuries. Using a higher discount rate would result in higher LIHTC rates to achieve the 30% and 70% subsidies. The floors may result in credit rates that are closer to what using a higher discount rate would achieve.", "At the same time, the floors may lead to fewer projects receiving funding. A fixed number of credits are made available each year on a per capita basis, or in the case of the 4% credit are limited by a state's tax-exempt bond capacity. If the total number of credits available does not change but the number of credits each particular project receives is higher because of the floors, then fewer projects may get financing. Additionally, there may be other options for addressing issues about the LIHTC program. Specifically, the target subsidy levels of 30% and 70% could be increased, while still requiring that the variable rate formula for determining credits be used. This could be combined with a requirement that the discount rate used in the formula more accurately reflects the risk of investing in LIHTC projects.

Specifically, a tenant must have an income of either 50% or less of the area's median income, or 60% or less of the area's median income. Which threshold applies depends on an election made by the developer that determines the targeted low-income population. Both civilians and servicemembers are potentially eligible to live in LIHTC units. However, when calculating servicemembers' incomes for purposes of determining their eligibility, their annual pay and basic allowance for housing (BAH) must be included. The BAH is a tax-exempt form of compensation that is based on a servicemember's pay grade, location, and number of dependents. ", "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA; P.L. 110-289 ) temporarily excluded military housing allowances from the LIHTC income calculations for properties near rapidly growing military bases. This, in turn, should make more servicemembers eligible to live in LIHTC housing. The exclusion applies to LIHTC properties in a county with a military base that experienced military personnel growth of 20% or more between December 31, 2005, and June 1, 2008, or LIHTC properties located in an adjacent county. The HERA change was originally set to expire on December 31, 2011, but it was subsequently extended through the end of 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ). The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-295 ) extended the exclusion through the end of 2014. Most recently, the PATH Act permanently extended the exclusion. ", "The exclusion may help address a concern, held by some, that there is a lack of affordable housing near particular military bases. The exclusion increases the incentive for the development of affordable rental housing available to military families in these locations, and, as a result, may alleviate rising rents near particular military bases. A 2005 Government Accountability Office report, however, suggests that the exclusion may have a limited effect for several reasons. First, junior enlisted servicemembers and those without dependents typically live in barracks. Second, housing allowances are already intended to cover the area median cost of living, and are adjusted for changes in area rents. Third, Department of Defense officials can increase housing allowances if warranted. In addition, the exclusion could have the unintended consequence of displacing the construction of LIHTC properties for civilians.", "The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated the permanent extension included in the PATH Act would result in a 10-year revenue loss of $83 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lead Hazards", "paragraphs": ["The high levels of lead found in the City of Flint's drinking water, and the corresponding public health concerns raised by the elevated blood lead levels detected in children in Flint, raised a number of questions for federal policymakers.
