Of these, 126,5345 were serving on active duty as of January 17, 2006, while 406,005 had been demobilized prior to that date after completing their tours. Note, however, that the total mobilization and demobilization figures count reservists more than once if they have been mobilized more than once. The total number of individuals mobilized is therefore lower than stated above, and probably by a significant margin due to the number of people who have been called up more than once.", "These reservists were called to active duty under a mobilization authority known as Partial Mobilization. In time of a national emergency declared by the President, Partial Mobilization authorizes the Service Secretaries to order members of the Ready Reserve to active duty for a period not to exceed 24 consecutive months. Up to 1 million members of the Ready Reserve may serve on active duty at any one time under this provision of law. The President may declare a national emergency and mobilize reservists under this provision of law without approval from Congress. This authority was also used to mobilize reservists during the later part of the Persian Gulf War (1991).", "DOD's general policy has been to keep reservists on active duty for no more than one year; and in the majority of cases to date, mobilized reservists have not been required to serve more than one year. However, the policy does allow the Service Secretary to keep reservists on active duty for up to 24 cumulative months if they are needed to meet operational or other requirements. It should be noted that DOD's policy capping reserve service at 24 cumulative months is more restrictive than the 24 consecutive month cap specified in law. If DOD were to change its policy to mirror the law, reservists could be mobilized multiple times for tours of 24 consecutive months apiece.", "Also, some members of the National Guard have been called up to perform duties related to ONE in a non-federal status . Additionally, in 2001 and 2002, thousands of members of the National Guard were activated at the order of their respective governors to provide additional security at airports.

According to DOD's definition, a sole surviving son or daughter is the only remaining son or daughter in a family where the father or mother, or one or more sons or daughters, served in the Armed Forces of the United States and, because of hazards with such military service, either (1) was killed, (2) died as a result of wounds, accident or disease, (3) is in a captured or missing-in-action (MIA) status, or (4) is permanently 100-percent disabled, is hospitalized on a continuing basis, and is not employed gainfully because of such disability.", "The \"sole surviving\" son or daughter issue is different from the commonly cited, albeit fictional, \"Sullivan Act\" or \"Sullivan Law.\" The Sullivans were five brothers serving on board a single U.S. Navy ship (the U.S.S. Juneau ) during World War II. Their ship was sunk by the Japanese on November 13, 1942, and all of the brothers died. In response to this tragedy, some proposals were made to prohibit brothers from serving together on the same ship, but Congress did not pass any such law, nor did the President issue an executive order to that effect. In response to a similar tragedy which occurred the previous year (three brothers serving aboard the U.S.S. Arizona perished during the Pearl Harbor attacks) the Navy did issue a policy forbidding commanding officers from approving requests from brothers to serve together, but the policy was apparently not enforced and did not prohibit the Navy from assigning brothers to the same ship.", "Current DOD policy states that \"concurrent assigning of service members of the immediate family to the same military unit or ship is not prohibited, but requests for reassignment to a different unit or ship may be approved for all but one service member.\" Approval of such requests, however, are contingent upon military requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What policies govern the status of conscientious objectors?", "paragraphs": ["No statute governs the treatment of conscientious objectors currently serving in the military.

Nonetheless, some people volunteer to join the armed forces with every intention of fulfilling their military obligations, but later develop religious or moral objections to participation in war. Such people may apply for transfer to non-combat related duties or for an administrative discharge, depending on the nature of their convictions. Following application, a formal investigatory procedure is initiated by the military to ascertain the facts and nature of the applicant's claim. Based on this investigation and the criteria for granting conscientious objector status defined in the DOD policy, a determination is made to either grant or deny the applicant's claim.", "With respect to the criteria for granting conscientious objector status, a crucial one is the requirement that the individual be \"opposed to participation in war in any form.\" In other words, the objection \"must be to all wars rather than a specific war.\" This standard precludes those who are opposed to some wars, but not all wars, from being classified as conscientious objectors.", "In 2000, slightly over 100 servicemembers applied for conscientious objector status; in 2004 this number was over 400.

Since 1990, this authority has been delegated to the Secretary of Defense by executive order. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld delegated this authority to each of the individual military services on September 19, 2001, allowing those services to \"stop loss\" by keeping individuals on active duty beyond their normal date of separation or retirement.", "Stop-loss has usually been implemented to permit the military to retain people with critical skills during a time of crisis. Since September 11, 2001, all of the Services have implemented such \"skill based\" stop loss for various lengths of time, although none of the Services currently have such a policy in effect. However, the Army has implemented a stop-loss policy which delays the departure of personnel from units deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan until 90 days after the unit returns from its deployment. The purpose of this \"unit based\" stop-loss is to maintain unit cohesion and thereby maximize military effectiveness among units headed for a combat environment. The Army has both an Active Army and Reserve Component Unit Stop Loss program. Under both, soldiers are affected from 90 days prior to their unit's mobilization/deployment date through their demobilizatioin/redeployment date, plus a maximum of 90 days.

The purpose of this pay is to compensate servicemembers for physical danger. Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and many other nearby countries have been declared imminent danger zones. Military personnel serving in such designated areas are eligible for HF/IDP. To be eligible for this pay in a given month, a servicemember must have served some time in one of the designated zones, even if only a day or less. The authorizing statute for HF/IDP sets the rate at $225 per month.", "Military personnel serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, parts of the Persian Gulf region, and certain nearby areas are also eligible for Hardship Duty Pay (HDP). HDP is authorized by 37 U.S.C. 305. It is compensation for the exceptional demands of certain duty, including unusually demanding mission assignments or service in areas with extreme climates or austere facilities. The maximum amount of HDP was recently increased by Congress from $300 to $750 per month. The current rate of HDP for Iraq and Afghanistan is $100 per month.", "Military personnel participating in OEF and OIF may also be eligible for Family Separation Allowance (FSA). FSA is authorized by 37 U.S.C. 427, which provides a special pay for those servicemembers with dependents who are separated from their families for more than 30 days. The purpose of this pay is to \"partially reimburse, on average, members of the uniformed services involuntarily separated from their dependents for the reasonable amount of extra expenses that result from such separation....\" To be eligible for this allowance, U.S. military personnel must be separated from their dependents for 30 continuous days or more; but once the 30-day threshold has been reached, the allowance is applied retroactively to the first day of separation. The authorizing statute for FSA sets the rate at $250 per month.", "Another benefit available to those deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other designated areas nearby is eligibility for the Savings Deposit Program. This program allows service members to earn a guaranteed rate of 10 percent interest on deposits of up to $10,000, which must have been earned in the designated areas. The deposit is normally returned to the servicemember, with interest, within 90 days after he or she leaves the eligible region, although earlier withdrawals can sometimes be made for emergency reasons.", "Finally, there is a tax benefit for many of those serving overseas in OEF or OIF called the \"combat zone tax exclusion.\" Afghanistan and the airspace above it have been designated a \"combat zone\" since September 19, 2001. Military personnel serving in direct support of the operations in this combat zone are also eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion. Additionally, certain areas in the Persian Gulf region \u2014including Iraq\u2014have been designated combat zones since 1991. Military personnel serving in direct support of operations in this combat zone are also eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion. For enlisted personnel and warrant officers, this means that all compensation for active military service in a combat zone is free of federal income tax. For commissioned officers, their compensation is free of federal income tax up to the maximum amount of enlisted basic pay plus any imminent danger pay received.

Congress was especially concerned that these missions\u2014in Bosnia, Kosovo, Southwest Asia, the Sinai, and elsewhere\u2014might be producing personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO) levels high enough to have a negative effect on retention. As such, Congress passed laws requiring the services to track the PERSTEMPO of every servicemember, to monitor individual PERSTEMPO levels more closely, and to pay an allowance to servicemembers assigned lengthy or numerous deployments. Similar concerns about PERSTEMPO led General Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, to assert before the House Armed Services Committee in July, 2001, that \"Given today's mission profile, the Army is too small for the mission load it is carrying.\" During that hearing, both Shinseki and Secretary of the Army Thomas White endorsed a proposal to increase the Army's end strength from 480,000 to 520,000 soldiers.", "Since September 11, 2001, operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom have dramatically increased the manpower needs of the military services, especially for the Army, which has shouldered the bulk of the manpower burden associated with the occupation of Iraq. These manpower needs have been filled primarily through the call up of over 500,000 reservists, longer duty days and higher PERSTEMPO rates for many active duty personnel, and the use of contract personnel. So far, this response has enabled the military to perform its assigned missions, but some observers note that it could cause problems in the future\u2014for example, in unacceptably low retention rates, unacceptable performance levels, and difficulty responding to new crises\u2014if carried out over an extended period of time.", "In order to prevent such problems from occurring, Congress and the executive branch have taken a number of actions. For example, at the end of FY2003 and FY2004 the Department of Defense invoked a statutory provision which allowed it to exceeded its authorized end strength. Additionally, Congress recently authorized an increase of 20,000 to the size of the active Army and an increase of 3,000 to the size of the active Marine Corps in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005. A separate provision in that law gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to temporarily increase the size of the Army by another 10,000 people, and the size of the Marine Corps by 6,000 people.", "Most recently, the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act provides for an active duty end strength (as of September 30, 2006) of 512,400 for the Army (an increase of 30,000) and an end strength of 179,000 for the Marine Corps (an increase of 4,000). Furthermore, this legislation authorized additional annual increases of 20,000 for the Army and 5,000 for the Marine Corps for each FY2007 through 2009. However, the Army is having difficulty increasing its strength due to recruiting shortfalls.", "Another prominent initiative intended to reduce manpower strain is the Army's ongoing effort to reorganize itself, converting from a divisional structure to one based on brigade sized \"units of action.\" The Army believes that this reorganization will increase its pool of deployable units, which could help reduce PERSTEMPO rates. The Army is also shifting of some critical military capabilities from the reserve component to the active component, thereby reducing the need to call up reserve units to support military operations, and retraining personnel from skills in lower demand (such as air defense and artillery) to skills in higher demand (such as military police).", "Other alternatives which have been suggested include contracting out more functions to the private sector, increasing the use of technologies which reduce manpower needs, securing greater participation in Iraq and Afghanistan by allied military personnel, reducing U.S. involvement in missions such as the Sinai and Kosovo, and withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq in relatively large numbers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What would it take to reinstitute the draft? Is a return to conscription in the U.S. likely?", "paragraphs": ["Any attempt to reinstate the draft would require congressional approval. The legal framework for conscription is codified in law, but the law contains a provision which prohibits actual induction into the Armed Forces after July 1, 1973. To reinstate the draft, Congress would have to pass legislation reauthorizing inductions.", "At the present time, it appears unlikely that the U.S. will reinstate the draft to meet its manpower needs. While the Army and some of the Reserve Components are having difficulty making recruiting goals, the military is meeting its retention objectives and has a large pool of trained personnel in the reserves that it can draw on to augment its active forces. Additionally, while conscription is useful for producing large numbers of basically trained military personnel, it is not very useful for producing high skill specialists which the military often has the greatest need for: for example, intelligence analysts, linguists, special operations forces, civil affairs personnel, and pilots. These people need years of training and high motivation levels to become proficient in their military occupations. However, should reconstruction and counter-insurgency operations in Iraq require a major U.S. presence for a prolonged period of time, the utility of a draft might become a more active consideration. Such a mission could demand a large numbers of military personnel who do not require the more specialized skills. The draft might also be useful if Congress decided to dramatically expand the size of the Army over a short period of time.", "See also CRS Report RL31682, The Military Draft and a Possible War with Iraq , by [author name scrubbed] (pdf), for a more detailed discussion of arguments for and against a draft."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
