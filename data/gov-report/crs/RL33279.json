The Ryan White program currently serves more than half a million low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the United States; 29% of those served are uninsured, and an additional 56% are underinsured. The program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its statutory authority is Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, originally enacted in 1990.", "The Ryan White program is composed of four major parts and several other components. Part A provides grants to urban areas and mid-sized cities. Part B provides grants to states and territories; it also provides funds for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). Part C provides early intervention grants to public and private nonprofit entities. Part D provides grants to public and private nonprofit entities for family-centered care for women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS. The other components, sometimes referred to as Part F, include the AIDS Dental Reimbursement (ADR) Program, the Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs), the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program, and the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI).", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance and which, therefore, should increase coverage for people living with HIV/AIDS. ACA includes prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition, elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage, and eligibility for tax subsidies to assist low- and middle-income individuals in the purchase of coverage from state health insurance exchanges. ACA phases out the Medicare Part D doughnut hole for HIV/AIDS individuals who are Medicare eligible, and, at state option, Medicaid eligibility will be broadened to include single adults. There could be a significant impact on Ryan White ADAP clients in those states that decide to cover the new Medicaid eligible group; 56% of ADAP clients served in June 2011 would be eligible for Medicaid in 2014 if their states choose to participate in the expansion, and the remainder would likely receive assistance in purchasing health coverage on the exchange.", "In October 2009, the 111th Congress passed and President Obama signed the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-87), which reauthorized the Ryan White program through September 30, 2013. The long-range impact of ACA on the Ryan White program\u2014meaning the replacement of health and treatment services provided under Ryan White with access to such services through health coverage via ACA\u2014remains to be determined. In states that decide not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, the need for the full range of Ryan White services would remain. However, even if all states decide to cover the new Medicaid eligible group, there will be gaps that the Ryan White program could continue to fill, such as coverage of those individuals with HIV/AIDS who are undocumented immigrants. In addition, Ryan White provides dental care and support services, such as transportation, that may not be provided under Medicaid or private health insurance.", "For FY2013, the Obama Administration requested a total of $2.447 billion for the Ryan White program, an increase of $80 million compared with FY2012; most of the increase ($66.7 million) would go to the ADAP program. Congress provided temporary funding, through March 27, 2013, for the Ryan White program in P.L. 112-175, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013. Funding is at the FY2012 rate plus a very slight increase (less than 1%).

Prior to the 2006 reauthorization, formula grants had been distributed to EMAs in proportion to an estimate of the number of living AIDS cases in each EMA. P.L. 109-415 changed the funding distribution, basing it on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases in each EMA or TGA for states that use a name-based HIV reporting system. The requirement for name-based HIV reporting in P.L. 106-345 and P.L. 109-415 influenced states to change from code-based reporting to name-based reporting.

If in a given year the supplemental funds are insufficient to fund the hold-harmless in a year, the Secretary would reduce on a pro rata basis the grant amount for each EMA other than those eligible for the hold-harmless provision, though the reduction would not be allowed to result in any additional EMA becoming eligible for the hold-harmless provision. ", "In September 2009, GAO released a report on the impact of several funding provisions on Ryan White grant awards. One of the provisions the 2009 GAO report focused on was the distribution of hold-harmless funding among Part A EMAs. GAO found that 17 of 24 (71%) EMAs received hold-harmless funding in FY2009, compared with 21 of 51 (41%) EMAs in FY2004. The total amount of hold-harmless funding distributed among the EMAs was larger in FY2009 ($24,836,500) than in FY2004 ($8,033,563). GAO looked at the amount of funding (including hold-harmless) per HIV/AIDS case, which for FY2009 ranged from $645 in San Diego to $854 in San Francisco; for FY2004, the amount of funding per case ranged from $1,221 in most EMAs to $2,241 in San Francisco. GAO determined that the smaller funding range in FY2009 \"resulted from San Francisco receiving less hold-harmless funding in FY2009 than in FY2004. In both years, San Francisco received the most hold-harmless funding per case. However, in FY2009, San Francisco received $208 in hold-harmless per case while in FY2004 it received $1,020 in hold-harmless funding per case.\" ", "GAO also noted that \"hold-harmless funding accounted for a larger percentage of San Francisco's total base funding than it did for any other EMA in FY2009 and FY2004, but the percentage was smaller in FY2009 (24%) than in FY2004 (46%).\" However, GAO found that for FY2009, \"because of its hold-harmless funding, San Francisco, which had 17,173 HIV/AIDS cases, received a base grant equivalent to what an EMA with approximately 22,713 cases (32% more) would have received without hold-harmless funding.\" GAO stated that \"a significant portion of the difference in funding per case between San Francisco and the other EMAs results from how the San Francisco case counts are determined. The San Francisco EMA continues to be the only metropolitan area whose formula funding is based on both living and deceased AIDS cases.\" GAO explains that this is due to the hold-harmless calculations that in part, for San Francisco alone, refer back to case counts in FY1995 that included both living and deceased AIDS cases.", "The hold-harmless provision is funded with money that would have been distributed through Part A supplemental grants. Without the hold-harmless provision, in FY2009 most Part A grantees would have received more funding. GAO notes that \"although 17 EMAs received hold-harmless funding in FY2009, only 7 (New York, San Francisco, San Juan, West Palm Beach, Newark, New Haven, and Nassau-Suffolk) received more funding because of the hold-harmless provision than they would have received through supplemental grants in the absence of the hold-harmless provision.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stop-Loss Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Like the hold-harmless provision, stop-loss provisions in appropriations bills have had an impact on the funding of Ryan White grants.
