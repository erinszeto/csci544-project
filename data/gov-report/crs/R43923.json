The APST manages the National Science and Technology Council, an interagency body established by Executive Order 12881 that coordinates science and technology policy across the federal government. The APST also co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a council established by Executive Order 13539 and composed of external advisors who provide advice to the President.

The 114th Congress may continue congressional consideration of the extent to which OSTP oversees these activities.", "OSTP has taken actions to provide greater public access to the results of federally funded research and development. In February 2013, OSTP Director Holdren issued a memorandum requiring federal agencies investing at least $100 million per year in research and development to develop policies allowing the general public access to the results of this investment. These policies are in the process of being released and implemented and may spur additional congressional oversight.", "Finally, OSTP has inventoried federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education investments and developed a strategic plan for them.

Congress might establish guidance regarding how agencies should craft and implement scientific integrity policies. Alternatively, Congress might leave establishing and implementing such policies to agency discretion, and require regular reporting from agencies regarding scientific integrity issues and the effectiveness of policy enforcement.
