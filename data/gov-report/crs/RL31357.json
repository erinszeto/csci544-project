These entities, numbering in the hundreds, can be categorized among seven different types, which vary in significant ways. They raise competing rationales and objections; have been established and have evolved for different reasons and in different time periods; and differ in terms of their jurisdiction, authority, responsibilities, membership, leadership, and governmental location.", "This report and other related CRS and congressional documents provide information on, examinations of, and preliminary comparisons among federal interagency coordinative devices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rationales and Objections", "paragraphs": ["A number of rationales for and objections to interagency coordinative mechanisms might be offered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rationales", "paragraphs": ["The fundamental rationale for such mechanisms is to provide a basis for coordination among federal entities, located in different departments or agencies, that share responsibilities and jurisdictions in a policy area. This need is seen as more important and immediate in the contemporary era than in the past, because of changed conditions and governmental characteristics. These include, among other transformations, the increasing complexity and interrelated nature of public policies; the expansion of federal responsibilities, notably in law enforcement and public safety, national security, and environmental quality; the growth in the number of separate federal entities involved in policy-making and policy implementation; the resulting overlap of jurisdiction, sharing of responsibilities, and fragmentation of policy-making among agencies; and the establishment of new policy priorities that cross older policy lines and institutional boundaries.", "The support for new coordinative mechanisms also results from the inability to achieve (or delay in achieving) more fundamental changes, such as major reorganizations. Consequently, interagency entities are at least a possible, if not ideal, alternative to such other transformations. And because creating interagency coordinative mechanisms is less difficult than completing major reorganizations, the coordinative devices could be modified, replaced, or abolished more easily than new departments or agencies, if policy priorities, political demands, and societal conditions change.", "The development and implementation of public policies, arguably, are expected to benefit from formalized coordination mechanisms, both to eliminate or limit dysfunctions and to provide a support structure for enhanced effectiveness. Ideally, these coordinating devices should help minimize (or mitigate the impact of) rivalry among the entities, duplication of effort, avoidance of responsibility, and working at cross-purposes. They should also help improve policy effectiveness in a number of ways. These include increases or suggested improvements in various areas: the availability and concentration of resources for priority policies; cooperation among the involved units, which would be working on behalf of a common purpose and at the behest of a common leader; integration of distinct but reinforcing responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions among relatively autonomous agencies; recognition of responsibility (and credit or blame) for particular activities and operations; and accountability of the various components, by consolidating review and reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objections", "paragraphs": ["Objections to such devices might also be raised in several areas.", "First, interagency coordinative entities might be seen as adding another layer of bureaucracy to a policy area, thereby increasing costs and introducing new inefficiencies and organizational rivalries, rather than reducing them.", "The genesis of some interagency coordinative devices is the establishment of new policy priorities. Yet these new mandates might have only a temporary appeal, while the new mechanisms could survive indefinitely. As a corollary, the coordinative device may itself become an entrenched entity, thereby increasing future costs and difficulties in realigning relevant functions, duties, and responsibilities.", "Interagency coordinative mechanisms might also be criticized from two competing viewpoints: as being too weak or too strong.", "Some entities might be faulted for not being given enough power to accomplish their purposes. Their extent of authority, range of jurisdiction, and breadth of responsibilities may not be sufficient to provide meaningful coordination and (forced) cooperation among a number of separate agencies. Because of the device's establishment, expectations are raised; but because of its weaknesses, the expectations may remain unmet. This, in turn, could result in a loss of credibility for the interagency operation and support for the policy. Along these same lines, critics might contend that new interagency coordinative devices might function only as half-measures. What is needed, opponents might say, is a more complete, wide-ranging reorganization. This could include, for instance, transferring related components from various departments or agencies into an existing agency or merging these interrelated entities into an entirely new agency, which would consolidate responsibility for carrying out a policy.", "By contrast, other interagency entities might be accused of possessing too much power, thereby interfering with the responsibilities of department and agency heads. For instance, an interagency office with formal or informal power over the budgets and spending plans of outside units could conceivably undercut the priorities and operations of these constituent agencies and their parent agencies. This action, in turn, could erode the effectiveness of the parent agency and reduce its responsibility for carrying out its other missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Variations", "paragraphs": ["Interagency coordinative entities lack standardization and uniformity; consequently, no particular device is an identical match for another.

Three entities (i.e. the NSC, HSC, and USA Freedom Corps Council) consist of the President and Vice President, along with specified agency heads, while others are made up of department and agency heads, along with officials from the Executive Office of the President in some cases. Others, by comparison, are composed of sub-cabinet officials, such as deputy directors, deputy or assistant secretaries, and senior officials from various agencies and the EOP. Still others, especially working groups and operational task forces, consist of personnel from relevant agencies selected by a higher echelon agency official or an interagency unit. Several officers, including the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Director of the Secret Service, moreover, possess authority to direct the activities and operations of other agencies; and one (i.e, the DCI) has express authority to review, approve, and change their budgets and spending plans. By contrast, other coordinative devices lack these explicit, substantial powers, instead relying on their authority to review and report\u2014to the President, Congress, other agencies, and the public\u2014on relevant activities and operations, or in the case of working groups and task forces, carrying out the policies and projects assigned by higher level officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enabling Authority and Permanency", "paragraphs": ["The devices also differ in enabling authority and permanency.

Councils consisting of the President, who is the chairman, the Vice President, and specified department and/or agency heads, with only three in existence: the National Security Council, created by public law in 1947, and the Homeland Security Council and the USA Freedom Corps Council, each created by executive order, in 2001 and 2002, respectively. 2. Committees made up of department and agency heads , along with, in some cases, officials from the Executive Office of the President (EOP), including the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking [in people], the principals committees of the NSC and HSC, the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, and its predecessor, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Group. 3. Specially created positions or offices , with their own authority and resources, to cover a policy area that crosses a number of separate and independent agencies (e.g., Council on Environmental Quality and the directors of the offices of National Drug Control Policy, of Homeland Security, and of USA Freedom Corps). 4. Agency heads or other officers with qualified authority over other entities , particularly the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of the Secret Service, and inspectors general, who can enlist the assistance of or task other organizations in carrying out specific duties and assignments. 5. Sub-cabinet boards, committees, and councils , such as the NSC and HSC deputies committees, two inspector general coordinating councils, and the chief financial officers coordinating council. 6. Transfers of personnel, resources, or units among new or existing entities , by setting up interagency partnerships, joint operational task forces, and field working groups; by transferring specific units for temporary duty; and by detailing and redeploying staff. These are illustrated by a host of arrangements and mechanisms: U.S. Coast Guard transfer to the Navy in times of war or other emergencies, use of military personnel and resources in law enforcement efforts, FEMA's multiplicity of partnerships, the Secret Service's membership in nearly 50 working groups, NSC's ad hoc working groups, HSC's policy coordination committees, various anti-terrorism support teams and cybersecurity operational centers, and inspector general council committees, as well as numerous staff details for particular operations and redeployments to meet crisis situations. 7. Transfers of authority between and among agencies , principally through the cross-designation of agents from one agency to another with shared jurisdiction and related responsibilities (such as the Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service for border control) and through special deputation by the U.S. Marshals Service for personnel without their own law enforcement authority (such as criminal investigators in some offices of inspector general)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Coordinative Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Examples of federal interagency coordinative mechanisms, interspersed among the seven categories, are manifold.

The organization and operation of the HSC has been further developed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive-1, issued by the President on October 29, 2001. The enterprise is also accompanied by the President's Homeland Security Advisory Council (PHSAC), an advisory committee whose 21 members come from the private sector, and four Senior Advisory Committees for Homeland Security (SACs), whose members are selected by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security (that is, the director of the Office of Homeland Security)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Homeland Security and Director", "paragraphs": ["The new office and its director\u2014formally titled the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security\u2014have an exceedingly high profile and visibility, in light of the unique circumstances surrounding their origin and early development. These include their creation following the unprecedented terrorist assaults within the United States on September 11, which resulted in an unequaled loss of life, destruction of property, and adverse effects on the economy within the United States in a concerted, single-day attack. The power of the office and director is also enhanced by the overriding priority of the mission (to secure the United States against terrorist attacks and threats), and their lead role domestically in the \"war on terrorism,\" as the President has referred to it. Other important features attend the office: its establishment by the President, who announced this initiative in an address to a rare joint session of Congress (which was broadcast to the nation); its placement in the Executive Office of the President (EOP); the cabinet-level status of its director; and perhaps most important, the close relationship between the first incumbent and the President.", "In addition, the OHS director is in a position to guide the President's Homeland Security Advisory Council and Senior Advisory Committees; be aided by its authority, operating through him, to acquire relevant information from executive agencies; and benefit from its findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Consequently, the Council and its committees can be a source of influence for the director.", "Even before the office's establishment, significant changes in homeland security organization, structure, and capacity had already been advocated by several governmental commissions and the General Accounting Office (GAO), as well as other organizations. Although their specific proposals differed, sometimes significantly, these studies and recommendations laid the groundwork for a new coordinative function.", "Among other functions, the OHS is \"to coordinate the executive branch's efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.\" In performing this function and attendant duties, the office possesses a lengthy set of responsibilities connected with coordinating the government's response to terrorism, all of which cross a broad spectrum of agencies, a wide range of programs, and an array of activities.", "The homeland security office is given some, albeit limited, budget review authority. In consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the heads of departments and agencies, the chief of the homeland security office \"shall identify programs that contribute to the Administration's strategy for homeland security and, in the development of the President's annual budget submission, shall review and provide advice to the heads of the departments and agencies for such programs.\" (E.O. 13228, sec. 3). Along with this function, the new chief is to advise OMB as to the adequacy of the agency budgets and certify that the funding levels are appropriate and necessary. The director, however, does not hold formal veto or approval powers over these budget plans, does not have funds directly at his disposal to grant to agencies, and cannot transfer funds among agencies, all of which would require new statutory authority.", "The OHS director, moreover, is not confirmed by the Senate and has a relatively small staff (estimated to reach about 100), relying largely on details from constituent departments and agencies. And because the office was created by executive order, rather than by public law, its jurisdiction is confined to the executive branch, thereby not encompassing such organizations as the U.S. Postal Service and various independent regulatory commissions. Despite these limitations, the office and its director hold other formal and informal powers, as noted above, that give it substantial influence in meeting its interagency coordinative responsibilities.", "A dispute between the Executive and Legislature has arisen over whether the OHS director, given his position and powers, can be compelled to testify at a hearing before a congressional committee on homeland security budget matters. (This is separate from his testifying about the Administration's proposals affecting public policy or reorganization.) The chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, inviting the director to testify before the committee about the President's budget submission for fiscal year 2002, noted: \"President Bush gives you the responsibility to certify that the funding levels contained in the Budget transmitted to the Congress are necessary and appropriate for the homeland security-related activities of the Executive Branch .... Your views and insights on the policies necessary to meet these objectives [for homeland security] are critical to the committee and the nation.\" The administration has declined to send the director. President Bush, responding to a reporter's question about this matter, said: \"He doesn't have to testify; he's part of my staff, and that's part of the prerogative of the Executive Branch of government. And we hold that very dear.\" The director reiterated this stand, which would \"avoid the setting of a precedent that could undermine the separation of powers.\" He added that he, on 35 occasions, and his staff, an additional 100 times, have met informally with legislators. The director also offered to participate in a \"public briefing ... [in which] Senators and Members of Congress present would have the opportunity to ask questions of me and of those officers\" charged with operational authority for homeland security, a proposal, however, that falls short of testifying at a formal hearing. A spokeswoman for the director argued that he would not testify before a congressional panel, because the director is not a Senate-confirmed head of an agency that implements policy. In rebuttal, supporters of congressional prerogatives might argue that the OHS chief is more than an advisor to the President; that he does implement public policy; and that he holds cabinet-rank status, even though he is not a confirmed appointment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Homeland Security Council and Committees", "paragraphs": ["E.O. 13228 (sec. 5) created a Homeland Security Council, which is responsible for advising the President with respect to all aspects of homeland security.
