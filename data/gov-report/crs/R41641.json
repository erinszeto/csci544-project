Others, such as House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and the Obama Administration, have noted the importance of tax reform as part of deficit reduction plans. These plans, however, do not provide the same level of detail with respect to tax provisions as the Fiscal Commission, Debt Reduction Task Force, and President's proposal, and are therefore not reviewed in detail as part of this report.", "Large budget deficits, rising national debt, and the growth of entitlement spending have raised questions regarding fiscal sustainability in the United States. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts a FY2011 budget deficit of nearly $1.5 trillion, or 9.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Over the past three decades, budget deficits have averaged 3% of GDP. Large budget deficits have contributed to an increased level of federal debt, relative to the size of the economy. Increased debt levels are expected to lead to increased federal interest payments. If not addressed, the current fiscal situation could undermine economic growth.", "Reducing federal deficits will likely require reductions in spending, increased federal revenues, or some combination of spending cuts and revenue increases. Federal revenues in 2009 and 2010, relative to the size of the economy, were low by historical standards. Reduced federal collections may be partially attributable to the weak economy and the fiscal policy response. Historically low individual income tax collections may also be partially explained by the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Spending through the tax code, via tax expenditures, also reduces federal revenues. The use of tax expenditures may undermine economic efficiency and equity in the tax code.", "The primary sources of federal revenues are individual income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, and excise taxes. Additional income tax revenues could be raised with a broader tax base, which could be achieved by eliminating various exemptions, credits, and deductions. A broader tax base could also allow for lower tax rates, without a loss in federal revenues. Broadening the tax base could enhance the economic efficiency of the tax system.", "The Fiscal Commission, the Debt Reduction Task Force, and the President's proposal took different approaches in the tax reform components of their fiscal sustainability plans. The President's Fiscal Commission raised additional tax revenues primarily through comprehensive income tax reform. The Fiscal Commission chose to broaden the tax base, allowing for both lower tax rates and increased federal revenues. The Debt Reduction Task Force's proposal also recommended individual income tax reform. The individual income tax reforms recommended by the Debt Reduction Task Force were designed to enhance efficiency and increase progressivity in the income tax system. Additional revenues in the Debt Reduction Task Force's plan originate from the proposed 6.5% debt-reduction sales tax.

A balanced approach to deficit reduction could involve changes to both federal spending and revenues. This report addresses revenue options, highlighting proposals made by the President's Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force. Both of these groups offered bipartisan proposals for deficit reduction that provide a potential starting point for what is likely to be a process that involves many difficult policy choices. In addition to changes in revenue policy geared toward deficit reduction, fundamental tax reform has been an issue of interest in the 112 th Congress. It is possible for tax reform to complement deficit reduction goals. ", "This report begins by reviewing the current fiscal situation. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), revenues remain at historically low levels while spending remains elevated, contributing to budget deficits. The budget deficit in FY2011 is projected to be nearly $1.5 trillion, or 9.8% of GDP. Further, in recent years, the share of the federal budget devoted to mandatory spending has increased, making it difficult, if not impossible, for fiscal sustainability to be achieved through cuts in discretionary spending alone. Large budget deficits continue to contribute to a growing national debt, which, if left unchecked, could undermine future economic growth. ", "After examining the current fiscal situation, this report analyzes current federal revenues. The United States currently raises most federal revenues through the individual income tax and payroll taxes. Reforms to both types of taxes could result in additional revenues. Further, the United States could generate additional revenue by reforming the corporate income tax, levying additional consumption taxes, or by increasing excise taxes on certain items (e.g., gasoline, alcohol), among other options.", "In recent months, a number of groups and individuals have issued proposals for deficit reduction. This report provides a comparison of the tax reforms suggested in two of these proposals, the President's Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force. These two were chosen as each provided comparable specifics with respect to tax reform. ", "In addition to the Fiscal Commission and Debt Reduction Task Force plans, notable deficit reduction plans have been released by congressional leadership and the Administration. In April, 2011, Representative Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Committee on the Budget released The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise . This document accompanies the House-passed FY2012 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 34 . Chairman Ryan's Path to Prosperity proposes to reduce budget deficits and stabilize national debt using a combined strategy, including spending cuts, entitlement reforms (specifically, Medicare), and tax reforms. The Path to Prosperity suggests simplifying the tax code by reducing rates and eliminating tax expenditures. Specifics regarding which tax expenditures would be eliminated were not provided.", "The Administration has also outlined a broad framework for deficit reduction, in a fact sheet titled The President's Framework for Shared Prosperity and Shared Fiscal Responsibility . The President also supports eliminating tax expenditures. Eliminating tax expenditures might allow for reduced rates or deficit reduction.

The Administration also notes that reforms to Social Security should be considered. This potentially could include changes to the payroll tax base, however, specifics were not provided.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ) couples an increase in the debt ceiling with reduced spending, while also establishing a 12-member Joint Select Committee to identify additional policies to reduce the deficit. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, the debt ceiling is increased through multiple phases by $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion. The increase in the debt ceiling is matched with a decrease in projected federal deficits. Under the first phase, the debt ceiling is increased by $900 billion ($400 billion up front, with another $500 billion increase to occur in the absence of a joint resolution of disapproval). Under the second phase, the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction identifies an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the FY2012 - FY2021 budget window. If the Joint Select Committee fails to find at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, $1.2 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts would be enacted. As the Joint Select Committee evaluates policy options for achieving the additional $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, revenue options may be considered.", "On September 19, 2011, President Obama submitted recommendations for deficit reduction to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.

", "Over the past three decades (1980 through 2010), the average budget deficit was 3% of GDP. Figure 1 illustrates outlays, receipts, and deficits as a percentage of GDP. In years where outlays exceed revenues, the federal government runs a budget deficit. As can be seen in Figure 1 , outlays have increased while revenues have decreased, relative to GDP, in recent years. The increase in federal outlays coupled with a decrease in federal receipts has led to a rising budget deficit.", "Federal spending consists of mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and net interest payments. Generally, mandatory spending includes spending on entitlement programs and spending controlled by laws other than annual appropriations acts. Discretionary spending is the portion of spending controlled by annual appropriations legislation. Net interest includes the government's interest payments on debt held by the public, offset by interest income the government receives through loans made and investments. ", "Over the past few decades, mandatory spending has grown to dominate federal outlays. In FY2010, mandatory spending was 55% of total outlays, or $1,913 billion. In FY1980, mandatory spending was 44% of total outlays. Discretionary spending as a percentage of total outlays was 39% in FY2010, or $1,347 billion. Discretionary spending as a percentage of total outlays was 47% in FY1980. Discretionary spending can be further decomposed into defense-related and non-defense-related discretionary spending. In FY2010, non-defense discretionary spending was $658 billion, a sum equal to 49% of discretionary spending or 19% of total federal outlays. Non-defense discretionary spending was 24% of total outlays in 1980. Eliminating the FY2010 budget deficit using only cuts in discretionary spending would have required eliminating all discretionary spending, including defense-related discretionary spending.", "An evaluation of the federal budget deficit and appropriate policy responses requires examining anticipated longer-term deficits. The FY2010 budget deficit is partially due to fiscal stimulus and other policies enacted in response to the financial crisis and Great Recession which began in late 2007. Automatic increases in spending during the recession also contributed to budget deficits. While the budget deficit was 9% to 10% of GDP in FY2010, the CBO baseline has budget deficits at 3.0% of GDP in 2015. The President's FY2012 Budget projects deficits of 3.2% of GDP by 2015.

Between 1970 and the mid-1990s, debt as a percentage of GDP increased from less than 30% to nearly 50% of GDP. In the late 1990s, during a phase of federal budget surpluses and strong economic growth, the debt decreased to less than 33% of GDP in 2001. By 2009, debt relative to GDP had increased to 62%. By 2016, it is expected that debt relative to GDP will reach 76%. ", "Increasing debt can mean increased interest payments to service the debt. Figure 3 illustrates net interest payments as a percentage of GDP from 1970 through 2016. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP more than doubled between 1970 and the mid-1980s. After reaching 3.3% in the early 1990s, net interest payments as a percentage of GDP fell to 1.3% (1970 levels) by 2009. Net interest payments are predicted to increase to nearly 3% of GDP by 2015.", "While increasing national debt is generally associated with rising interest payments, interest rates are also a determining factor. Rising net interest payments in the early 1980s were largely driven by increasing interest rates. When interest rates fell towards the end of the 1980s, net interest payments remained around 3% of GDP as the national debt was increasing. In recent years, net interest payments have remained low, relative to historical levels, despite rising debt levels. Low interest rates in recent years have prevented interest payments as a percentage of GDP from increasing to date. If interest rates rise in the future, all else equal, then interest payments relative to GDP are projected to increase as well.

Deficit levels are considered unsustainable when deficits cause the national debt to grow faster than GDP (output) over a sustained period of time. As the national debt grows faster than output, an increasing share of national income must be devoted to servicing the debt (making interest payments). With an increasing share of government spending going toward debt service, investors holding the debt may begin to lose faith in the government's ability to continue making interest payments. When investors lose confidence in the government's ability to service debt, and become unwilling to hold the debt at normal interest rates, the government is left with two options. First, the government can default on its debt and fail to pay investors. Second, the government can monetize the debt, or finance debt repayment through money creation. The second option will result in rapid price inflation that will reduce the real value of the debt held by investors. ", "The continued ability of the Treasury to issue debt at historically low interest rates suggests that investors do not view the current U.S. fiscal circumstance as irreversible. Increasing federal deficits in 2009 and 2010 are largely attributable to the economic recession and subsequent policy responses. The policy response includes actions taken in response to the financial crisis, including fiscal stimulus and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Fiscal policy responses have included increased spending and tax reductions, enacted to stimulate a weak economy.

Another factor contributing to reduced income tax collections is the increased availability of income tax credits, exemptions, and deductions. Individual income tax collections have tended to be below historical averages, since the 2001 tax cuts. Social insurance tax collections were slightly above the historical average.

Closing this budget deficit using only increased income tax revenue would require income tax receipts to increase by 145%, using CBO's projections, or 141%, using OMB's projections. Increases in income tax receipts could be achieved through higher rates or by reducing various tax expenditures (this issue is discussed further below). Balancing the FY2011 budget through increases in both income and social insurance taxes would require an increase in receipts of 78%, using CBO's projections, or 72%, using OMB's projections. Increasing social insurance receipts could be achieved either through rate increases or by applying the tax to income above the social security cap.", "Balancing the budget through tax increases in FY2015 would require less in terms of increased revenues. Both CBO and OMB project increasing tax revenues and falling deficits over time as the economy continues to recover from the recent recession. Note that CBO's baseline is current law, meaning that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and the AMT patch, among other policies, are allowed to expire as scheduled in 2012. If tax cuts that are scheduled to expire are extended further, the tax increases required to eliminate the deficit would be even larger.

If both income and social insurance taxes were increased, revenue increases of 18% (using CBO's baseline) or 21% (using OMB's projections) would be necessary to achieve a balanced budget.

Generally, there is a trade-off between economic efficiency and equity. Tax systems that maximize economic efficiency oftentimes do not have desirable distributional consequences. Thus, policymakers may strive to balance these two objectives when implementing changes to the tax code. ", "Another challenge for policymakers is that tax reforms may create winners and losers. Eliminating targeted tax incentives may increase tax liability for some, even as rates across the board are reduced. While eliminating certain tax incentives targeted for low-income individuals may broaden the tax base, eliminating such tax preferences may raise equity concerns. Alternatively, eliminating tax preferences that tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers may enhance tax-code equity at the expense of economic efficiency, if the tax preferences were designed to address a market failure. For example, higher-income households are more able and more likely to benefit from education-related tax incentives. Thus, eliminating various education tax benefits could enhance tax code equity. Eliminating education tax incentives, however, could reduce economic efficiency. Tax subsidies for education can enhance economic efficiency if they are successful in increasing investment in education."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Efficiency and Tax Reform", "paragraphs": ["Generally, in the absence of market failures, economists believe that market outcomes maximize economic efficiency. Taxes may lead to inefficiencies when they result in changes in behavior. These behavioral responses, generally, occur when taxes change the price of goods or activities. For example, if an individual responds to an increase in income taxes by working less, the tax is said to generate an inefficiency. Not all taxes, however, are associated with market inefficiencies. For example, taxes on the production and consumption of goods associated with negative externalities can enhance economic efficiency. Take, for example, the federal excise tax on gasoline. The consumption of gasoline in motor vehicles may generate negative externalities, in the form of pollution and roadway congestion. Since consumers fail to take these negative external costs into account when making consumption decisions, markets may lead to overconsumption of gasoline relative to economically efficient levels. The federal excise tax on gasoline reduces consumption of gasoline, leading the market to more efficient levels of gasoline consumption. ", "Taxes generally lead to greater inefficiencies when market participants are highly responsive to tax-imposed changes in price. If market participants are responsive to price changes, this means they change their behavior in response to taxes, driving the level of economic activity away from the socially optimal level. In other words, market participants increase participation in low-tax activities while engaging in fewer high-tax activities. This logic is consistent with the economic theory of optimal commodity taxation, which suggests that taxes are more efficient when levied on goods with low demand elasticities (i.e., demand is not responsive to changes in price). While taxing goods with low demand elasticities may be economically efficient tax policy, such a policy may raise equity concerns. Demand elasticities\u2014or the responsiveness of demand for a product to changes in price\u2014for necessities, such as basic food, clothing, healthcare, and shelter, tend to be relatively low. Conversely, luxury goods tend to have relatively elastic demand. Thus, a tax system designed to minimize economic distortions and maximize economic efficiency would tend to tax necessities, even though necessities represent a larger share of household consumption among those with low income. However, placing higher tax rates on necessities relative to luxury goods may violate equity principles, which are discussed below. ", "Economic theory informs that the inefficiency of a tax is an increasing function of the tax rate. In other words, the inefficiency of a tax is not a linear function of tax rates. Instead, the economic inefficiency associated with higher tax rates is disproportionately large. Thus, to minimize distortions and economic inefficiencies from taxation, taxes should be levied at low rates. Broadening the tax base, while lowering tax rates, can yield the same amount of revenue with fewer inefficiencies. Broadening the tax base, to allow for reduced rates, was one of the major policy objectives of the last major overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 1986.

", "The principle of vertical equity suggests that groups with more resources, or a greater ability to pay, should pay more in taxes. Progressive tax structures, such as the current federal income tax system, are vertically equitable, as those with higher incomes pay higher rates. Consumption taxes, which tend to be regressive, are not vertically equitable.", "The principle of horizontal equity suggests that individuals who are similar should be treated similarly by the tax code. As an example, consider many homeowners are given tax incentives for housing, while renters are not. Two families, with similar incomes living in similar houses, may have different income tax liabilities if one family owns their house while the other rents.

Eliminating enough exemptions, deductions, and credits may allow policymakers to reduce tax rates and increase revenues generated through the income tax system simultaneously.

Further, if existing tax preferences tend to benefit higher income taxpayers, eliminating such preferences may enhance equity within the tax code.", " Table 2 lists the largest individual income tax expenditures, ranked according to federal revenue losses.

Given that tax expenditures have grown to nearly $1 trillion annually, eliminating or scaling back existing tax expenditure provisions could be a part of any deficit reduction proposal. ", "A closer look at the specific provisions listed in Table 2 highlights the various types of tax expenditure provisions as well as possible equity issues associated with using tax expenditures to deliver federal assistance. The first, third, and eighth provisions listed are exclusions from income. Under current law, employer provided healthcare, contributions to retirement accounts, and Medicare benefits are not included in taxable income. Excluding contributions to retirement accounts and employer provided healthcare from income reduces the cost of this form of compensation, encouraging employers to provide these benefits to employees. Delivering such benefits through the tax code, however, may raise equity concerns. Both the retirement contribution and healthcare exclusions are examples of \"upside-down\" subsidies, where higher income taxpayers receive a greater benefit. Generally, as a consequence of the progressive income tax structure, exclusions and deductions result in an upside-down subsidy.", "The mortgage interest deduction and reduced rates for dividends and long-term capital gains also raise equity concerns. The mortgage interest deduction is another example of an upside-down subsidy. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction would reduce after-tax income by an estimated 0.01% for individuals in the lowest income quintile. For individuals in the 90 th to 95 th income percentile, eliminating the deduction would reduce after tax income by an estimated 1.7%. Proponents of the mortgage interest deduction, however, cite benefits associated with homeownership as a possible rationale for retaining this tax preference. The reduced rates for dividends and long-term capital gains tend to disproportionally benefit higher-income households, as such households derive a larger proportion of income from these sources. One possible justification for reduced tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains may be a reduction in double taxation of corporate income. With respect to capital gains rates, the revenue raising potential of a tax increase is less than the tax expenditure, due to behavioral responses. ", "In contrast, the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the child tax credit both provide greater benefit to lower-income taxpayers. Both credits are at least partially refundable, allowing benefits to flow to those with limited tax liability. Eliminating these tax benefits would raise additional revenue, but decrease the progressivity of the current individual income tax system. ", "A full analysis of tax expenditures in the current tax code is beyond the scope of this report. The examples above serve to highlight the complexities associated with a deficit reduction plan that looks to reduced tax expenditures as a source of additional revenues. Many of the tax code's current tax expenditure provisions were adopted to encourage targeted behavior and enhance economic efficiency by addressing externalities or to promote equity and fairness in the tax code.

Accelerated depreciation allows firms to recover capital costs over a shorter period of time through larger depreciation deductions.

The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ) expanded and extended temporary bonus depreciation provisions, with an estimated revenue loss of $55 billion in 2011.

", "The third-largest corporate tax expenditure relates to the U.S. treatment of income earned abroad. Deferral of active income of U.S. subsidiaries operating abroad allows firms to delay the payment of U.S. taxes by not repatriating income. In addition to generating revenue losses, deferral provides an incentive for U.S. firms to invest in active business operations in low-tax foreign countries. One possible benefit to deferral is that it may help make U.S. firms more competitive when operating abroad. ", "Allowing state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds is the fourth-largest corporate tax expenditure. Corporate purchasers, and other purchasers, of tax-exempt debt are not required to pay taxes on interest earned from holding such bonds, thereby reducing their federal income tax liability. This allows issuers to borrow at reduced interest costs. In recent years, Congress has allowed for various other forms of federally subsidized debt (e.g., tax-credit bonds). Tax-exempt bonds provide a larger subsidy to high-income holders, and thus have been criticized for being inequitable. Tax-credit bonds provide a more equitable benefit to bond holders, as their value is not dependent on a taxpayer's marginal tax rate. The broader question is to what extent tax-subsidized debt is being used to provide public goods or address other potential market failures. ", "The fifth and ninth tax expenditures listed in Table 3 also relate to the tax treatment of inventories. Current tax rules governing the source of inventory sales interact with foreign tax credit provisions in a way that can effectively exempt a portion of a firm's export income from U.S. taxation (the fifth item in Table 3 ). Last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting methods result in a tax subsidy when prices are rising, by allowing for a higher measure for cost of goods sold, which reduces taxable income (the ninth item in Table 3 ). International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not permit LIFO inventory accounting methods. As U.S. accounting standards merge with IRFS, LIFO inventory accounting methods will no longer be an option. ", "The production activity deduction, the sixth-largest corporate tax expenditure in 2010 reduces the effective tax rate for domestic manufacturers. The provision was adopted in 2004, and is designed to encourage investment in manufacturing. The domestic production deduction is available for oil and gas extraction, at a reduced rate. President Obama's FY2012 budget proposes to eliminate this deduction for fossil fuels (oil and gas and coal), raising an estimated $18.7 billion over the 2012 through 2021 budget window. ", "The remaining corporate tax expenditures are designed to provide support for low-income housing investments and encourage spending on research and development. The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was introduced in 1986 to encourage development of affordable housing. The tax code also contains provisions designed to reduce the cost associated with research and experimentation expenses, such as the ability to expense certain research-related capital expenditures and tax credits for qualified research-related costs. These activities are viewed by many as generating positive externalities, and thus being underprovided by the market. These tax subsidies aim to correct these perceived market failures by encouraging additional investment in low-income housing and research and development.

With a territorial system, income earned abroad by U.S. multinationals is taxed where it is earned. The current U.S. tax system taxes U.S. based multinationals' worldwide income, allowing foreign tax credits to reduce domestic tax liability for tax payments to foreign governments. Foreign-chartered subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals can also defer U.S. tax payments until income is repatriated. To address concerns that passive foreign-source income could be easily shifted, deferral is restricted for some foreign-source income, which is taxed under Subpart F.

Portions of the tax code that are indexed for inflation would be adjusted using the chained-CPI rather than the currently used standard CPI. The Fiscal Commission notes that a chained-CPI is designed to more closely approximate cost-of-living changes. Applying a chained-CPI to the tax code would slow the increase in bracket thresholds, and overall lead to increased federal revenues.

Under the proposal, tax revenues would be limited to 21% of GDP. Historically, federal receipts have never exceeded 21% of GDP (see Figure 5 ). Over the 20-year period 1990 through 2009, total federal receipts as a percentage of GDP averaged 18.1%.

This is the so-called \"income sources\" method for allocating the distribution of consumption taxes. Another option is to allocate the distribution of the tax burden of a consumption tax using the ratio of current consumption to current income. This is the so-called \"consumption ratio\" method for allocating a consumption tax. A consumption ratio method of allocation leads to a more regressive distribution of consumption taxes. There is disagreement amongst economists regarding which method best represents the distributional impact of uniform consumption taxes.
