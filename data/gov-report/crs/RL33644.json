These provisions could help free up funds that Title X clinics have historically spent on serving the uninsured. For example,", "States can expand Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines, effectively 138% with the 5% income disregard. (In 2015, 66% of Title X clients had incomes under 101% of the federal poverty guidelines; another 14% had incomes between 101% and 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. ) ACA gives states the option, through a Medicaid state plan amendment, of providing targeted Medicaid family planning services and supplies to certain individuals who would otherwise be ineligible for Medicaid. ACA requires most private health plans that offer dependent coverage for children to continue to make such coverage available for young adult children under the age of 26. (In 2015, 45% of Title X clients were younger than 25 years old; another 22% were aged 25 to 29.) ACA provides certain individuals and small businesses with access to private health plans through health insurance exchanges and subsidizes premium expenses and cost-sharing out-of-pocket costs for certain individuals. To ensure access for low-income individuals, exchange plans are required to have a sufficient number and geographic distribution of \"essential community providers,\" which include Title X projects. ACA's individual mandate provision requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a penalty. ", "OPA established FY2017 Program Priorities to guide the project plans of family planning services grantees. In response to ACA, one of these priorities is demonstrating Title X clinics' ability to bill Medicaid and private health insurance. Project plans should have \"Evidence of contracts with insurance plans and systems for third party billing as well as the ability to facilitate the enrollment of clients into private insurance and Medicaid, optimally onsite; and to report on numbers of clients assisted and enrolled.\" A survey of publicly funded family planning clinics found that in 2015, 79% of Title X clinics had contracts to bill Medicaid plans (compared with 35% in 2010), and 69% had contracts to bill private health insurance plans (compared with 26% in 2010). ", "Title X clinics also provide enrollment assistance to clients eligible for Medicaid or exchange plans under ACA. OPA awarded one-year grants in FY2014 and FY2015 to help Title X clinics enroll uninsured clients in health coverage. According to the FY2017 HRSA Justification, the Obama Administration expected that Title X clinics would increase revenue, in part by raising the proportion of clients who have health insurance and by billing third parties.", "Title X supporters state that, although clinics funded by Title X could see increased revenues from Medicaid and private insurance, the Title X program is still necessary under the ACA:", "In addition to medical care, Title X supports activities that are not reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial insurance plans\u2026 Title X has made a major contribution to the training of clinicians; that need remains today\u2026 Title X helps to support staff salaries, not just for clinicians but for front-desk staff, educators and finance and administrative staff.

Title X also helps to support the infrastructure necessary to keep the doors open\u2014subsidizing rent, utilities and infrastructure needs like health information technology.", "Some Title X supporters argue that Medicaid and private health insurance reimbursements do not cover the full cost of providing care. Some advocates also argue that even with ACA's health coverage expansions, family planning services will still be sought by uninsured persons and dependents who, for confidentiality reasons, might not wish to bill reproductive health services to their parent's or spouse's health insurance. Advocates maintain that even with the ACA, there is still strong demand for safety net providers, such as many Title X clinics, that provide health care to underserved populations. ", "ACA requires most private health plans to cover certain preventive services for women without cost-sharing. HHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine to recommend preventive services to be included in this requirement. Adopting the IOM recommendations, federal rules and guidelines require that most health plans cover, without cost-sharing, \"All Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity,\" as prescribed. Some have stated that this requirement, by removing up-front cost barriers, could result in more women switching to longer-acting contraceptive methods, such as hormonal implants and intrauterine devices. OPA has identified \"patient access to a broad range of contraceptive options, including long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC)\" as one of the key Title X issues in FY2017. HHS has also added Title X clients' rate of LARC use to the list of outcome measures for assessing program performance.", "The Family Planning Annual Report: 201 5 National Summary contains Title X program data from 2015, the second year that ACA's major coverage provisions were in effect. Clients' insurance coverage rates have risen: 50% of Title X clients had health insurance in 2015, compared with 43% in 2014, and 35% in 2013. Projects that received Title X funds also reported increased revenues from private third-party payers such as private health insurance plans: $104.0 million in 2015, compared with $95.1 million in 2014, and $69.2 million in 2013.

As discussed above in \" Client Characteristics ,\" a decrease in demand might be explained in part by ACA coverage expansions, because newly insured clients can now seek care from private practitioners and other providers. Increased LARC use could also affect demand by reducing the frequency of client visits in the long run, compared with some other contraceptive methods (such as oral contraceptives that require refills). The number of female Title X clients using hormonal implants or intrauterine devices in 2015 was 11% higher than in 2014, 16% higher than in 2013, and 50% higher than in 2010.", "ACA has also impacted the Title X program in other ways. For example, because ACA increased the Medicaid rebate percentage paid by drug makers, Title X clinics receive larger discounts on drugs purchased through the 340B drug pricing program. As a result of receiving larger drug discounts through the 340B program, Title X clinics receive more revenue on drugs dispensed to clients. ", "ACA also increased funding for teen pregnancy prevention efforts, expanded health care workforce programs, and increased funding for community health centers (many of which are Title X providers). HHS contracted with IOM to convene a Standing Committee to advise the Title X program. Among other topics, the IOM Standing Committee was tasked with examining the roles of family planning, reproductive health, and Title X in health reform. OPA also awarded FY2014 research funding to \"conduct data analysis and related research and evaluation on the impact of the Affordable Care Act on Title X funded family planning centers.\" For Title X grantees and clinics, the Title X Family Planning National Training Centers compiled resources and provided training on how ACA may affect Title X."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislative and Executive Actions Potentially Impacting Title X", "paragraphs": ["The Trump Administration may use the executive branch to change ACA regulations, guidance, or enforcement activities.

For example, AHCA and BCRA have provisions that would potentially impact the insurance status of some Title X clients, including provisions to eliminate the ACA's individual mandate penalty, provisions to restructure ACA exchange subsidies, and provisions projected to reduce Medicaid enrollment compared with current law. Such changes would potentially affect demand for Title X's free and discounted services. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that AHCA and BCRA would reduce federal Medicaid spending compared with current law; thus they would also potentially impact Title X projects' Medicaid revenue. Federal regulations specify that no Title X projects may be 100% supported by Title X funds. That is, Title X projects must have some revenues from non-Title X sources. In 2015, Title X projects reported that Medicaid accounted for 40% of their total revenues. In comparison, Title X funds accounted for 19% of their total revenues.

It supports a wide range of outpatient health services, not just family planning. AHCA, BCRA, ORRA, and HCFA would provide an additional $422 million for FY2017 for the Community Health Center Fund, which appropriates mandatory funds to the Health Center program. Although the legislation does not require it, some health centers could opt to use the additional funds to provide family planning services. In 2015, 26% of clinics receiving Title X funds participated in the Health Center program as well.

For example, some states enacted laws to prohibit state and local agencies from giving Title X subawards to abortion providers. Some other states had established a priority system for allocating Title X subawards, for example by giving preference to state health departments, primary care providers, and community health centers over specialized family planning clinics. OPA argued that \"these policies, and varying court decisions on their legality, have led to uncertainty among recipients, inconsistency in program administration, and reduced access to services for Title X priority populations.\" ", "The rule would have limited the criteria a grantee could use to restrict entities from Title X subawards, disallowing \"reasons other than [the entity's] ability to provide Title X services.\" The preamble explained that applicants for new and continuing Title X grants would be required to describe their criteria for choosing subrecipients. The preamble stated that, under this rule, HHS would have reviewed these submissions for rule compliance and would have made \"every effort to help entities come into compliance, and will award replacement grants to other providers when necessary to minimize any disruption of services.\"", "Supporters of the rule argued that it would have protected funding to specialized family planning providers, such as Planned Parenthood, and that it would have protected vulnerable individuals' access to family planning services. Critics of the rule argued that states should have the discretion to administer Title X funds consistently with state policy, and that the rule would have violated the conscience rights of voters and states that object to public funding of abortion providers.

The major revision revoked the \"gag rule,\" which restricted family planning grantees from providing abortion-related information. The regulation at 42 C.F.R. \u00a759.5 had required, and continues to require, that abortion not be provided as a method of family planning. The July 3, 2000, rule amended the section to add the requirement that a project must give pregnant women the opportunity to receive information and counseling on each of the following options: prenatal care and delivery; infant care, foster care, or adoption; and pregnancy termination. If the woman requests such information and counseling, the project must give \"neutral, factual information and nondirective counseling on each of the options, and referral upon request, except with respect to any option(s) about which the pregnant woman indicates she does not wish to receive such information and counseling.\"", "According to OPA, family planning projects that receive Title X funds are closely monitored to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately and that funds are not used for prohibited activities such as abortion. The prohibition on abortion does not apply to all the activities of a Title X grantee, but only to activities that are part of the Title X project. The grantee's abortion activities must be \"separate and distinct\" from the Title X project activities. Safeguards to maintain this separation include (1) careful review of grant applications to ensure that the applicant understands the requirements and has the capacity to comply with all requirements; (2) independent financial audits to examine whether there is a system to account for program-funded activities and nonallowable program activities; (3) yearly comprehensive reviews of the grantees' financial status and budget report; and (4) periodic and comprehensive program reviews and site visits by OPA regional offices.", "It is unclear precisely how many Title X clinics also provide abortions through their non-Title X activities. In 2015, the Guttmacher Institute surveyed a nationally representative sample of publicly funded family planning clinics. Respondents included 535 clinics that received Title X funds.

Grantees were informed that responses were voluntary and \"without consequence, or threat of consequence, to non-responsiveness.\" The survey did not request any identifying information. HHS mailed surveys to 86 grantees and received 46 responses.

The Guttmacher Institute estimates that without Title X clinics' services, the 2015 U.S. teen pregnancy rate would have been 44% higher. Supporters of expanding family planning services argue that the United States has a higher teen pregnancy rate than some countries (such as Sweden) where a similar percentage of teens are sexually active, in part because U.S. teens use contraception less consistently.

Of those citing confidentiality concerns, 39% were under the age of 18. According to OPA, Title X clinics \"commonly forgo billing\" health insurers to maintain confidentiality.", "As for payment of services provided to minors, Title X regulations indicate that \"unemancipated minors who wish to receive services on a confidential basis must be considered on the basis of their own resources.\" Program requirements instruct that \"Eligibility for discounts for unemancipated minors who receive confidential services must be based on the income of the minor.\" ", "Supporters of confidentiality argue that parental notification or parental consent requirements would lead some sexually active adolescents to delay or forgo family planning services, thereby increasing their risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.", "Critics argue that confidentiality requirements can interfere with parents' right to know of and to guide their children's health care.
