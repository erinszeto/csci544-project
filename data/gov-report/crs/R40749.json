The IOM stated in 2001 that \"[c]rucial reports from disciplined review bodies document the scale and gravity of the problems. Quality problems are everywhere, affecting many patients. Between the health care we have and the care we could have lies not just a gap, but a chasm.\" Significant activity has been undertaken to improve the quality of care delivered in the United States over the past decade, but a number of concerning trends remain.", "The U.S health care system's quality problems are evidenced by a broad range of relevant quality indicators. These include high rates of medical and medication error; a high amenable mortality rate; overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services; and a lack of, and variation in, diffusion of evidence-based guidelines. ", "In its 1999 study, the IOM reported that between 44,000 and 98,000 people die each year because of preventable medical errors, at a cost of between $17 billion and $29 billion per year. Serious adverse medication events are estimated to occur in up to 15% of hospitalized patients, and more than 100,000 deaths are attributed annually to such reactions. A July 2008 study reports that despite spending two times more per capita than any other major industrialized country on health care, the United States has an amenable mortality rate\u2014deaths that are amenable to health care intervention and may have been prevented by that intervention\u2014of 110 per 100,000 (ranking 19 th out of 19 surveyed countries). ", "With respect to the problems of overuse, misuse, and underuse of health care services, a study conducted by the Midwest Business Group on Health in 2003 found that approximately \"30 percent of all direct health care outlays are the result of poor-quality care, consisting primarily of overuse, misuse and waste.\" Another study found that as many as 20% to 30% of patients received contraindicated care. In addition, a 2007 RAND study found that only 46.5% of children receive care recommended by evidence-based guidelines, and a similar RAND study conducted in 2003 concluded that adults receive only 55% of indicated care. ", "According to the IOM, an average of 17 years is required for findings from randomized clinical trials to be implemented into clinical practice, and when they are, it is done so in an uneven fashion. Taken together, these findings evidence significant shortfalls in the quality of care provided in the United States. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conceptualizing Health Care Quality", "paragraphs": ["Despite the fact that most experts agree that health care quality is a serious problem deserving of attention, a precise operational definition for the concept can be difficult to identify. Although there is no single universally agreed upon definition for quality of care, or health care quality, perhaps the most commonly cited definition is the IOM's definition, as follows: \"(t)he degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.\"", "The 2001 IOM report \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" further defines quality of care in terms of six domains: ", "Effective . Providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit. Efficient . Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. Equitable . Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics. Patient-centered . Providing care that is responsive to and respectful of individual patient preferences. Safe . Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is supposed to help them. Timely . Reducing waits and sometimes-harmful delays.", "Most health care quality efforts aim to improve one or more of these six domains of quality of care, and quality care is often colloquially defined as simply delivering the right care to the right person at the right time. However basic it may appear, operationalizing these six domains, and thus improving health care quality, has proven difficult.", "The effort to improve health care quality is operationally embodied by a wide range of quality activities. One way to consider these activities is by grouping them into one or more of the following four areas: (1) research (basic, translational, and health services); (2) quality measurement; (3) quality reporting (encompassing both increased transparency and incentive alignment); and (4) patient safety activities. Reliable and sound quality information plays a fundamental role in all of these health care quality activities, which may both use and generate such information. For those activities that rely on quality information, such as quality reporting, their effectiveness is directly dependent upon the quality of the information available. There are various types of quality information, including evidence syntheses, health technology assessments, clinical comparative effectiveness data, clinical practice guidelines, quality measure data, and medical error/near miss reports. In many cases, these different types of information are interrelated. For example, evidence syntheses are utilized as the basis for the development of clinical practice guidelines, which in many cases in turn serve as the basis for developing quality measures.", "Quality information may be broadly leveraged through the types of activities referenced above for a number of purposes, including to educate and inform providers about performance; for public reporting to inform consumer decision making; to create payment incentives; to inform accreditation or maintenance of certification; to inform internal quality assurance or improvement efforts; for public health surveillance efforts and activities; and to inform system-level changes to improve safety. Quality information may be fed back to inform the modification of quality measures, incentive programs, quality assurance activities, health care provider education, or the processes of delivering health care with the goal of improving quality.", "This report focuses specifically on quality measurement, one subset of quality activities, and will focus on the processes used to develop, endorse, select, and implement quality measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Quality Measurement", "paragraphs": ["Broadly, quality measurement focuses on assessing processes, structures, and outcomes of health care, and for this reason, quality measures are informally categorized as structural, process, or outcome measures. This model of quality measurement rests on the premise that a sound structure will support appropriate processes of care that in turn will result in good outcomes. Ideally, process measures are supported by research demonstrating a link to improved outcomes, and all measures will assess things that are under the direct control of the health care system. ", "Structural measures assess whether \"the resources and organizational arrangements are in place to deliver care,\" for example, staffing ratios or health information technology (HIT) implementation. Process measures assess whether the \"appropriate provider activities are carried out to deliver care,\" for example, percentage of indicated patients receiving mammograms within a given timeframe. Finally, outcomes measures assess \"the results of physician and other provider activities,\" for example, 30-day mortality rates post-hospitalization for pneumonia. Composite measures, which summarize performance across separate and discrete measures of quality, are a useful tool for certain end-users, such as policy makers and the general public. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now includes several Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-developed composite measures in its Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program (described later in this report).", "In addition, quality measures may be developed in order to collect patients' reports of system performance. An example of this type of measure may be found in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, both funded by AHRQ. While these measures may assess the delivery of evidence- or consensus-based clinical care, they also include an evaluation of the human aspects of how that care was delivered.", "Quality measures may attempt to assess or evaluate one of three broader breakdowns in health care quality: (1) overuse of health care services, (2) misuse of health care services, or (3) underuse of health care services. This approach encompasses variation in care patterns as well as disparities in quality of care received. The development of quality measures may be based either on existing clinical practice guidelines (evidence-based) or on consensus-based guidelines. Generally, utilizing an evidence-based guideline as a basis for a quality measure is preferred over using a consensus-based one; however, as there are significant gaps in the evidence base, in many cases, consensus-based guidelines are the only option available. Although the development of reliable and valid quality measures tends to be challenging, the development of structural and process quality measures may be less complicated than the development and specification of outcomes measures, which requires complex risk-adjustment manipulations to account for variation in patient case-mix. Data sources for quality measures vary, but include four primary sources: (1) administrative claims data, (2) medical records, (3) medical registries, and (4) patients' reports. ", "Quality measures may be used for a number of purposes. They may be used to assess performance at the level of a hospital (or other health care facility, for example, a nursing home or outpatient surgical center); a health care provider, group of providers, or practice group; or a health plan. They may be used by payers, purchasers, health care consumers, regulators, accrediting or licensure bodies, researchers, health care providers, or health care facilities. Finally, quality measures may be used as the basis for policies that realign payment incentives; to facilitate internal quality improvement or quality assurance efforts; to empower consumer decision making; or to provide feedback on performance\u2014for the purposes of self-improvement\u2014 to health care providers, health plans, or health care facilities.", "The life cycle of a quality measure is composed of three basic components: the creation and specification of the measure, the endorsement of the measure, and the selection and implementation of the measure. This process may not always be perfectly linear in all cases (for example, an entity may adapt an existing endorsed measure for use in one of its quality-related activities), but with respect to the creation of de novo quality measures, these are the ordered steps generally followed. Each stage is discussed in more detail in the following sections.", "There is a wide range of current efforts to develop quality metrics that may be used in performance measurement activities and, likewise, there are a number of different entities involved in the development, endorsement, selection, and implementation of quality measures. AHRQ reports in its 2008 National Healthcare Quality Report that the \"often opportunistic, incremental, and fragmented development of quality measures without detailed consideration of data sources, analysis and maintenance requirements, and user needs\" is a challenge, and that \"uncoordinated and isolated measure development can lead different groups to create and advocate competing and sometimes conflicting measures of the same process or outcome.\"", "In an attempt to better coordinate performance measurement and other quality activities, in November of 2008, the National Quality Forum (NQF) convened the National Priorities Partnership (NPP), a collaborative effort between 28 key health care stakeholders representing all major health care perspectives. The goal of the NPP is to rapidly improve quality in six priority areas, including patient and family engagement, population health, safety, care coordination, overuse, and palliative and end-of-life care. The NPP aims to achieve measurable progress in these six areas, specifically focusing on payment, public reporting, quality improvement, and consumer engagement.", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ) further emphasized the importance of \"an integrated national strategy and priorities for health care performance measurement in all applicable settings.\" MIPPA required the Secretary to enter into a contract with a consensus-based entity (and provided as an example the National Quality Forum) to help strengthen and better focus the nation's performance-measurement infrastructure, and specifically to synthesize evidence and convene stakeholders to provide recommendations on a national performance-measurement infrastructure; to endorse and maintain measures; and to report annually to the Secretary on these activities. The National Quality Forum was awarded this contract and recently released its first report, Improving Healthcare Performance: Setting Priorities and Enhancing Measurement Capacity , in fulfillment of this statutory requirement.

In this stage, measures are conceived of, created, specified, refined, and oftentimes field tested. Quality measures are developed by a number of different measure developers, including The Joint Commission, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and the American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI), for application in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and to evaluate health plans. ", "Measures may generally be developed in one of two ways: they may be created entirely anew, or de novo , or existing measures may be identified and adapted for a specific purpose (i.e., hospital accreditation). Traditionally, developers have focused on measures of process rather than outcomes, and they generally direct their efforts toward developing measures focused on a specific setting (e.g., hospital) or in a particular clinical area (e.g., pneumonia). Gaps have occurred in measure development where services span provider settings or where no single entity has sole responsibility for providing a service (e.g., coordination of care or end-of-life care). In addition, measure development may be guided by overuse or cost intensiveness, or rather, may be guided by explicit links to improved outcomes, regardless of cost or cost burden. From a value-based purchasing perspective, development would ideally be guided by both; however, from the consumer perspective, outcomes may be more important than costs. ", "This section details the processes used by measure developers to develop quality measures for evaluating the performance of hospitals, physicians, and health plans. An examination of these processes reveals that they share several attributes: they all solicit public input on measures, they all rely on panels or workgroups of technical and/or clinical specialists for guidance, and they all subject measures to some degree of field testing. In addition, both the Joint Commission and NCQA utilize a set of clearly delineated and specific attributes by which to assess and evaluate measures' value and thus guide their development activities. NQF has recognized the importance of testing quality measures by instituting a mechanism of \"time-limited\" endorsement for a period of 12-24 months for those measures that meet all of NQF's standards for endorsement, but that have not been subjected to rigorous field testing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hospital Measures", "paragraphs": ["The Joint Commission has one of the most well-developed and clearly specified processes of quality-measure development, and has been involved in developing performance measures since 1986 for hospitals (these measures may be used by other health care organizations, including home care, behavioral health care and long term care organizations). Reporting quality data was made a formal requirement for Joint Commission hospital accreditation in 1998.", "The Joint Commission, formerly the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or JCAHO, is a private, non-profit organization that establishes quality and safety standards and accredits health care organizations for participation in federal health insurance programs. For example, The Joint Commission accredits approximately 80% of hospitals for participation in Medicare by assessing their compliance with standards related to patient rights and education, infection control, preventing medical errors, medical staffing ratios, and data-collection processes. The organization describes its mission as \"continuously improving the safety and quality of care provided to the public through the provision of health care accreditation and related services that support performance improvement in health care organizations.\"", "When The Joint Commission began its work in the area of quality measurement in 1986, it focused on developing quality measures completely de novo , an involved and resource-intensive endeavor. However, while The Joint Commission was engaged in this work, many other measure developers began developing and implementing their own measures. For this reason, The Joint Commission changed course in the mid-1990s and redirected its efforts toward adapting (evaluating and testing) existing quality measures for its purposes. This shift resulted in the creation of a standardized process for adapting existing measures consisting of a series of specific steps. The Joint Commission focuses on developing its measures in sets, and defines a \"core measure set\" as \"a unique grouping of performance measures, carefully selected to provide, when viewed together, a robust picture of the care provided in a given focus area.\"", "Initial measure development requires significant preliminary work, including a review of the literature to evaluate the evidence base and identify existing measures in a particular topical area. The findings from this review are summarized and serve as the basis of a measurement framework, which is used throughout the development process. The first formal step in the process is the empanelling of a group of experts with balance as a key focus. This expert advisory panel includes representation from relevant medical, nursing, and pharmacy professionals, as well as state hospital associations, consumers, and CMS. Funders are not represented on these panels to avoid conflicts of interest, and full disclosure is required of all members. ", "After the panel has been convened, The Joint Commission issues a \"call for measures\" to solicit measures from all known measure developers. The measures received are vetted by staff, and evaluated against The Joint Commission's attributes of core performance measures and associated evaluation criteria. These criteria include the following:", "Measures target improvement in the health of populations. Measures are precisely defined and specified. Measures are reliable. Measures are valid. Measures are easily interpreted by users. Measures are risk-adjusted or stratified. Measures are under provider control. Measures have publicly available measure constructs. Measures are useful in the accreditation process. Measures rely on accessible data and low-cost data collection efforts. ", "There is significant overlap between The Joint Commission's measure attributes, NQF's measure evaluation criteria, and NCQA's desirable measure attributes. ", "Measures that meet these criteria are forwarded to the expert advisory panel, and final candidate measures are posted to The Joint Commission's website, where they undergo a 30-day comment period. Measures are adjusted according to the feedback received during the comment period, at which point general specifications may be formulated and field testing begun. The Joint Commission's field testing is well developed, and involves both alpha testing\u2014for feasibility and utility\u2014and beta testing\u2014for reliability, validity, and cost, among other things. There are opportunities for measure adjustment and refinement at all points in this process. Based on the results of the field testing, the expert advisory panel recommends implementation of a set of final measures, and the measures will then be integrated into ORYX, the performance measurement component of The Joint Commission's accreditation process.

The PCPI supports, and provides in-kind resources for, the establishment of topic-specific work groups that include both clinician specialists as well as technical methodological experts to develop disease- or condition specific-measures.

In addition, uses for these measures include integration into electronic health records (EHRs), Maintenance of Certification (MOC) for physicians, and CMS demonstration projects, and measures may be used for quality improvement purposes, as well as for accountability. ", "The process used by PCPI to develop measures is not as longstanding as are those employed by The Joint Commission and NCQA, simply by virtue of the fact that the organization is far younger. While The Joint Commission began developing hospital performance measures in 1986, and NCQA began developing its HEDIS measures in 1992, the PCPI was established in 2000 to help guide medical specialty groups in generating physician-level measures, at least partially in anticipation of a formal, statutorily established physician quality reporting system for Medicare-participating physicians. The scope and depth of PCPI's work was described in late 2007 as nascent; however, PCPI has had the advantage of being able to draw on existing work in this area, and quickly developed its own robust process for measure development (see Figure A -2 ).", "PCPI has been endeavoring to make strategic changes in emphasis as it matures. It has refocused its measure-development efforts, and requires the following three criteria be met by any topic prior to proceeding with development in the area: ", "1. The topic is an area designated as high impact (by the IOM, NPP, etc.). 2. The topic is a gap area or an area with high variation in care. 3. The topic has an adequate evidence base. ", "If these three criteria are met, PCPI evaluates whether the topic under consideration is likely to generate measures in the following four areas, which it terms \"high value\": care coordination, patient safety, appropriateness/overuse, and quality improvement collaboratives. The Consortium has also shifted its focus to developing a comprehensive \"core\" measure set.", "After a topic has been approved, an topic-specific expert work group is convened, consisting of two co-chairs with expertise in the clinical area as well as in measure-development methodology; clinicians in all relevant areas; methodologists; guideline experts; patients, purchasers, consumer groups and health plans; and sometimes coding experts, depending on the topical area. Importantly, representatives from The Joint Commission and NCQA are included in the composition of the work groups to ensure measure harmonization to the greatest extent possible. Prior to beginning its actual measure drafting, the work group conducts a literature review (and review of the existing evidence base) and identifies desired outcomes (with respect to either a certain condition or procedure). The work group meets once in person and conducts several conference calls to facilitate the measure-drafting process, after which public comment is solicited on the measures. The work group will then review the comments and incorporate them as necessary. The revised measures are then submitted for approval to PCPI.

Its programs, which focus on evaluating the performance of health plans, also include the development of report cards, public-policy documents, and educational activities.

There are several key groups involved in this process: Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) provide guidance on methodological considerations; the Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) provides guidance throughout the measure-development process and makes final decisions regarding adoption; and Measurement Advisory Panels (MAPs) report to the CPM and provide specialized guidance for measure development in a specific area.", "The process begins with the identification of a topic, a literature review, and measure identification. Measures are evaluated for inclusion in the development process against a series of three key criteria: relevance, scientific soundness, and feasibility. A MAP is created to guide development, and initial measure specifications are drafted by the TAG and then presented to the MAP. Measures are then field tested, revisions are made, and then the measures are presented to the CPM. The revised measures are posted on the NCQA website for a period of 30 days, with a request for public comment.

After the TEP reviews the candidate measures list, it is submitted to CMS for review and approval, and public comment may be solicited. Measures approved by CMS at this stage move forward to the specification-development stage. Once specifications have been created for the measures, they are approved by CMS, the measures are tested for both reliability and feasibility, and public comment is solicited.

", "While CMS does not carry out the technical process of specifying quality measures (this task falls to the measure contractor), it is a critical part of the process at many points. CMS helps to define the topic for which measures will be developed; provides approval of candidate measures for specification; determines whether public comment will be required in the early stages of measure development (pre-specification); approves measure specifications; determines whether measures with specifications will be submitted for consensus review prior to testing; and gives final approval of measures for use in its programs after completion of testing and formal public comment.

The Commission recommends the creation of a broadly represented, publicly administered\u2014Advisory Council for Health Care Quality\u2014and a privately administered\u2014Forum for Health Care Quality Measurement and Reporting.\" ", "The NQF is a voluntary consensus standards-setting organization, as defined in law by the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA) and by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119. According to OMB Circular A-119, the five attributes of a voluntary consensus standards-setting body are balance, openness, due process, consensus, and having an appeals process. Currently, NQF is the only body that meets these formal criterion as a voluntary consensus standards-setting body for health quality measures. In addition, the NTTAA requires federal agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their activities, unless doing so conflicts with existing law or is impractical. ", "NQF's most prominent and visible role has been in its capacity as a national-level quality measure endorser (it also endorses frameworks, reporting practices, and preferred practices), and it has to date endorsed more than 500 quality measures. Its decisions are highly respected and valued by all stakeholders; however, because the endorsement process is laborious and methodical, and tends to be lengthy, measure endorsement cannot keep pace with measure development. NQF has begun to emphasize the importance of harmonizing measures, and places value, for example, on setting neutrality and common conventions for measures related to a specific condition or targeted group.", "NQF utilizes a rigorous and methodical process by which it reviews and judges quality measures for potential endorsement, known formally as the consensus development process (CDP) (see Figure B -1 ). This process comprises seven formal steps: (1) the formation of a steering committee, (2) a call for measures, (3) measure evaluation, (4) public and member comment, (5) member voting, (6) consensus standards approval committee review, and (7) appeals. To begin the process, NQF puts out a public call for members for a steering committee. It is the job of the committee to guide the evaluation process and provide expert input and guidance. The next steps entail a call for measures, where measure developers (not necessarily NQF members) are asked to submit their measures for consideration for endorsement. Developers have a period of 30 days during which to submit their measures.", "Once measures have been collected, the steering committee begins the evaluation process. Measures are evaluated against four criteria, including the following: ", "whether the measure is linked to gains in quality and health outcomes, whether the measure is reliable and valid, whether the measure is usable (results are easy to understand and useful), and whether the measure is feasible (ease of access to required data). ", "A measure is initially evaluated against the first criterion\u2014the relationship between a measure and quality and health outcomes\u2014and if it is judged to pass this threshold, it will then be evaluated against the remaining three criteria. A measure may fail to gain endorsement, for example, if it is judged to assess a core competency, rather than high-quality care.", "For measures that survive this evaluation process, there is a 30-day public comment period, after which the public's comments are reviewed by the steering committee and incorporated as appropriate. At this time, the revised measures are posted and NQF members have a 30-day period during which they are invited to vote either in favor of or in opposition to endorsement. The final endorsement recommendation is made by the Consensus Standards Approval Committee (CSAC) to the NQF Board of Directors, which affirms the CSAC's recommendation. Appeals may be made for a 30-day period following ratification of endorsement by the NQF Board of Directors.

AQA is a consensus organization with broad stakeholder representation, which until recently \"adopted\" physician-quality measures, a status which served as AQA's recommendation that a measure is ready for implementation. During this process, AQA considered measures that were either NQF-endorsed, or would be going through the NQF-endorsement process, for adoption. If an AQA-adopted measure went through the NQF endorsement process but failed to gain endorsement, AQA adoption was rescinded. Although AQA focuses broadly on the three issues of performance measurement, data aggregation, and reporting, one of its key goals was to reach consensus on a set of physician-level quality measures that could be used by government purchasers or to guide private health insurance plan contracting decisions. This should help ultimately to standardize the performance measures used to assess and evaluate physician performance. AQA has now shifted its focus to identifying how quality measures are being used and implemented, as well as assessing where gaps exist in extant quality measures.", "AQA-adopted measures may be used by CMS in its Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI), and many AQA-adopted measures were also used in PQRI's predecessor program, the Physician Voluntary Reporting Program (PVRP). For the 2009 PQRI, the measures meet one of the four following criteria:", "they are measures that were selected from the 2008 measure set, they are NQF-endorsed measures, they are AQA-adopted measures, or they were not NQF-endorsed or AQA-adopted at the time the proposed rule was published by CMS, but received endorsement or adoption by August 31, 2008. ", "This allowed for a mechanism whereby measures were able to be implemented by CMS's PQRI without NQF endorsement, since AQA is recognized as a \"consensus organization per section 1848(k)(2)(B) of the (Social Security) Act.\" Given the lengthiness of NQF's endorsement process, the large number of quality measures needing to go through the process, and AQA's recognized status as a consensus organization under law, AQA adoption allowed for expedited implementation of physician measures.

This stage is especially consequential if the measures are being used for purposes of accountability, so the processes used by CMS to select measures for its pay-for-reporting programs (as part of its value-based purchasing initiative), and by CMS and other stakeholders for public reporting, are of particular import. The criteria used by CMS to select measures for its PQRI and RHQDAPU programs are discussed in more detail below.", "AQA has also played a prominent role in the measure selection stage for physician measures. The AQA encourages and facilitates health plans and physicians to collaborate in determining which quality measures developed by the PCPI or the NCQA should be recommended for implementation. These recommendations are directed primarily to CMS for measure inclusion in its PQRI program, but also to smaller private payers for use in pay-for-performance programs.

In response, CMS established the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) and began collecting physician-level quality data in July of 2007. PQRI was modeled on the Physician Voluntary Reporting Program (PVRP), which enabled physicians to voluntarily report quality data to CMS with no payment incentives, allowing the agency to establish a sound reporting infrastructure.

Section 101(c) of TRHCA provided for financial incentives for the PQRI program and allowed for the awarding of an incentive payment to physicians based on the reporting of certain quality measures to begin in 2007. PQRI was extended for 2008 and 2009 by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA, P.L. 110-173 ) and was made permanent by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ), which also allowed for incentive payments to continue through 2010.

Established in 2002 by the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH), the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC), and the American Hospital Association (AHA), HQA has recommended hospital quality measures much as AQA adopted physician measures. HQA also collects and publishes quality information in partnership with CMS, although there is not perfect overlap between the HQA and RHQDAPU measure sets.

Efforts at streamlining requirements have been initiated, for example, by The Joint Commission and CMS; however, reporting requirements still tend to be complicated and laborious, as well as fairly costly. In addition, reporting entities may not always be provided with timely and useful feedback on their performance, decreasing the potential utility of the activity. ", "As noted previously in this report, a lack of standardized quality measures, and the lack of a uniform approach to generating these measures, have presented both challenges and opportunities. The diversity of stakeholders involved in the quality-measurement enterprise has resulted in a high degree of innovation in terms of measuring quality and related activities. It has also allowed practices to be developed that best suit a particular setting (e.g., hospitals) or purpose (e.g., accreditation). However, it has also created challenges with respect to the development of a set of measures that apply uniformly across all clinical areas and conditions, and this has resulted in a situation where measures may be unavailable to assess certain areas, or where only measures of questionable quality may be available. Measure gap areas include, for example, end-of-life care.

These include the proliferation of generally similar, yet slightly different, quality measures that could be used to measure the same process, structure, or outcome. For example, a search of AHRQ's National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) identifies 10 quality measures related to receiving mammograms. This not only increases the burden of reporting on reporting entities, but also creates challenges with respect to drawing valid comparisons between measures. The problem of multiple similar measures is partially mitigated both by endorsement of measures and by the NQMC itself, which provides a uniform mechanism for comparing measures.

Health outcomes are influenced by a variety of variables that are not under the direct control of either the health care provider or the health care system, including environmental factors, access to health care services, and genetics. In addition, even though process and outcome are generally accepted to have a tighter linkage, issues have recently been raised regarding this relationship as well. In particular, it has been unclear whether strong performance on process of care measures is linked to decreased mortality rates. There is some evidence that in fact this relationship is not as tightly linked as it was believed to be.", "Ensuring reliability\u2014that is, that measured results are consistent across repeated measurements\u2014can also be technically challenging. Data sources must be appropriate and complete, as well as comparable across settings.
