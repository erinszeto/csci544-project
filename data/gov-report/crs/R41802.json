The international community has progressively recognized the humanitarian impact of these diseases, along with the threat they represent to economic development and international security. The United States has historically been a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; it is currently the largest single donor for global HIV/AIDS and has been central to the global response to TB and malaria. In its second session, the 112th Congress will likely consider HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs during debate on and review of U.S.-supported global health programs, U.S. foreign assistance spending levels, and foreign relations authorization bills.", "Over the past decade, Congress has demonstrated bipartisan support for addressing HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria worldwide, authorizing approximately $54 billion for U.S. global efforts to combat the diseases from FY2001 through FY2012. During this time, Congress supported initiatives proposed by President George W. Bush, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), both of which have demonstrated robust U.S. engagement in global health. Through the Global Health Initiative (GHI), President Barack Obama has led efforts to coordinate U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs and create an efficient, long-term, and sustainable approach to combating these diseases.", "Despite ongoing progress in fighting HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, these diseases remain leading global causes of morbidity and mortality. Many health experts urge Congress to capitalize on recent gains and bolster U.S. leadership and funding to combat these diseases. In contrast, some Members of Congress have proposed cuts to these programs as part of deficit reduction efforts.", "This report reviews the U.S. response to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria and discusses several issues Congress may consider as it debates spending levels and priority areas for related programs. The report includes analysis of:", "Funding Trends: Combined funding for the three diseases has increased significantly over the past decade, from approximately $911 million in FY2001 to $7.4 billion in FY2012. The bulk of the increase over time has been targeted toward HIV/AIDS, although in recent years funding for global HIV/AIDS has begun to level off. When compared to FY2011, funding in FY2012 included decreases for global HIV/AIDS, and slight increases for global TB and malaria programs. Some health experts applaud what they see as a shift toward less expensive efforts that maximize health impact. Other experts warn that divestment from HIV/AIDS could significantly endanger the lives of those reliant on U.S. assistance and could reverse fragile gains made against the epidemic and other diseases. Disease-Specific Issues: HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria each present unique challenges. Rising numbers of people in need of life-long HIV/AIDS treatment combined with reduced global HIV/AIDS funding have heightened concerns over the sustainability of treatment programs and incited debate over the appropriate balance of funding between antiretroviral treatment (ART) and other HIV/AIDS interventions. Growing rates of HIV/TB co-infection and drug-resistant TB strains have increased calls for escalating TB control efforts. Finally, growing resistance to anti-malaria drugs and insecticides threatens malaria control efforts, leading to calls for more attention to reducing resistance and developing new anti-malaria commodities. Cross-Cutting Issues: Several cross-cutting issues are currently being debated, particularly in relation to increased efficiency and sustainability of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs under the GHI. These include Health Systems Strengthening, Country Ownership in Recipient Countries, Research and Development, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Engagement with Multilateral Organizations.", "For details on particular characteristics of the HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria epidemics and the U.S. response, see the following CRS reports, by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report R41645, U.S. Response to the Global Threat of HIV/AIDS: Basic Facts CRS Report R41643, U.S. Response to the Global Threat of Tuberculosis: Basic Facts CRS Report R41644, U.S. Response to the Global Threat of Malaria: Basic Facts"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria are three of the world's leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

In many countries, HIV infection rates are outpacing access to treatment, rates of drug resistance are increasing for TB and malaria, and health systems in resource-poor settings are under growing pressure to address these diseases while struggling to provide basic health care.", "Over the last few years, Congress has debated the U.S. strategy to confronting these diseases, including how to best support a long-term approach to these diseases that generates positive outcomes for global health in general. In response, implementing agencies have begun to make programmatic changes, and the Obama Administration has called for a revised U.S. approach to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in the hopes of making related efforts more effective and efficient. This process has led to a broader discussion on how best to allocate global health funding, both within and between programs. The financial crisis and economic recession, and consequent calls to reduce the U.S. budget deficit, have led to decreased funding for these diseases in recent years, and have heightened the urgency of reevaluating U.S. global health investments. This report highlights some of the current challenges posed by HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, as well as several cross-cutting policy issues that the 112 th Congress may consider as it determines U.S. global health funding for these three diseases, including", "health systems strengthening, country ownership, research and development, monitoring and evaluation, and engagement with multilateral organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["In May 2011, results from a study demonstrated that early HIV treatment in couples with one infected partner reduced the risk of transmission by 96%.

This pledge represented the largest commitment ever by a single nation toward an international health issue, and established a new and central role for donor governments in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Of the $15 billion, the President proposed spending $9 billion on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services in 15 focus countries. The President also proposed spending $5 billion of the funds on existing bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in roughly 100 other countries and $1 billion of the funds for U.S. contribution to the Global Fund.", "The 108 th Congress authorized the establishment of PEPFAR in May 2003 through the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act, P.L. 108-25 ). The act authorized $15 billion for U.S. efforts to combat global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria from FY2004 through FY2008, including $1 billion for the Global Fund in FY2004. The act also authorized the creation of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the Department of State to oversee all U.S. global HIV/AIDS activities. Beyond increasing the scope of U.S. HIV/AIDS programs, the Leadership Act also shifted the focus of U.S. HIV/AIDS activities. In particular, while past U.S. global HIV/AIDS programs had primarily supported prevention activities, the Leadership Act set targets for extending anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and required that 55% of PEPFAR funds be spent on HIV/AIDS treatment.", "Building on the success of PEPFAR in harnessing resources to combat a disease, President Bush announced the establishment of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, which significantly increased U.S. funding for global malaria programs.

Until then, USAID's malaria programs had provided primarily technical assistance. Under PMI, a minimum of 50% of the budget was devoted to the purchase and distribution of malaria-fighting commodities. The design of PMI also took into account some of the criticism levied against PEPFAR in its first two years, including the need to strengthen the alignment of programs with country priorities and better integrate programs into national health systems.", "No analogous initiative was established for global TB. However, in 2007, the 110 th Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ), which markedly increased funding for TB control efforts.

These multi-year strategies also serve as guidelines for new coordination efforts between PEPFAR, USAID, and CDC, as they aim to reduce duplication between programs, integrate services where appropriate, and better align programs with the priorities of partner governments. Several outside studies have documented early signs of progress toward a more cohesive and coordinated approach to global health, including in relation to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Questions remain over how GHI will lend itself to significant innovation, whether early progress in coordination can be brought to scale, and whether efforts to better integrate global health activities can be sustained without significant additional resources.

Congress has also held a number of hearings in recent years to evaluate U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs and to debate various approaches to fighting the diseases. While congressional action (including legislation and hearings) has tended to group the three diseases together, the response to each has varied widely, with HIV/AIDS receiving considerably more funding and attention than either TB or malaria.", "Funding for each of the diseases has increased drastically since FY2001. Despite the marked increases in funding, there are significant differences in the percentage of the global health budget that each disease receives. Since the establishment of PEPFAR, HIV/AIDS programs have accounted for close to or over 50% of the global health budget, while TB programs have received between approximately 1.6% and 3.6%, and malaria programs have received between approximately 5.0% and 9.1% of global health funding, depending on the year ( Figure 2 ).

Some health experts have expressed concern over the leveling of global health funding, particularly for HIV/AIDS, over the past few years. Specifically, advocates have argued that any reductions in funding undermine recent scientific breakthroughs, which demonstrate that with adequate financial support, available prevention and treatment methods can be harnessed to significantly decrease new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. Others argue that given that HIV/AIDS funding tied to continuing lifelong treatment for people with HIV will likely be considered impervious, coupled with the new increased targets for treatment by 2013, the cuts made to HIV/AIDS programs may affect critical prevention and care activities, as well as broader HIV-related efforts in areas like health systems strengthening and country ownership.

At the same time, the new and long-term financial costs associated with expanded access to ART have increased concern over the sustainability of U.S. treatment programs, and have increased calls for considerable scale-up of prevention efforts. ", "The expansion of ART to treat HIV/AIDS has significantly reduced AIDS-related mortality. 2011 UNAIDS estimates suggest that 2.5 million deaths in low- and middle-income countries have been averted since the introduction of ART in 1995. Treatment has been a central component of PEPFAR programs. According to a 2010 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, from FY2006 to FY2009, 46% of PEPFAR funds were used to support treatment efforts, with the rest of the funds divided between prevention and care activities ( Figure 4 ). As of September 2011, PEPFAR was directly supporting ART for over 3.9 million individuals in 30 countries\u2014representing over half of the estimated 6.7 million people on treatment around the world. In 2009, the Administration committed the United States to treating an additional 4 million people infected with HIV/AIDS from FY2009 to FY2014. On World AIDS Day in December 2011, President Obama announced that the United States was committing to a new target of providing treatment to 6 million people by the end of 2013.", "In spite of the strides made in HIV treatment, the number of individuals newly infected with HIV exceeded the number of individuals placed on treatment by almost a 2 to 1 margin in 2010. At the end of that year, the 6.7 million people receiving treatment represented 47% of those in need. The number of people newly infected with HIV and requiring treatment is projected to grow significantly in coming years. Expanding access to ART for new patients who will require lifelong treatment will increase long-term treatment costs. Compounding this challenge is the potential for increased rates of drug resistance and consequent need for second-line therapies, which cost 5-10 times more than first-line drugs.", "The logistical and fiscal challenges of scaling up treatment have led some experts to argue that prevention efforts must be rapidly scaled up so that HIV incidence can be reduced. In 2011, the results of an HIV prevention trial indicated that early initiation of ART in discordant couples reduced HIV transmission by 96%, by lowering the viral loads of infected people and therefore reducing the possibility of transmission. These findings have confirmed the preventative implications of HIV treatment and have reduced what was previously seen by some as a dichotomous choice between increasing funds for treatment versus increasing funds for prevention. At the same time, these findings raise new questions related to the appropriate distribution of limited\u2014or decreasing\u2014funding for global HIV/AIDS, including how funds should be divided between ART as treatment, ART as prevention, and other non-treatment-based forms of prevention. Some also argue that the United States must consider how to make more efficient use of available treatment resources, including in relation to earlier versus later initiation of treatment and the distribution of resources between first-line and second-line drugs. The President's FY2013 budget request, which proposed decreased funding for bilateral global HIV/AIDS programs while also reaffirming the Administration's commitment to the new goal of treating 6 million HIV-positive individuals by 2013, demonstrated the importance of evaluating how to best allocate global HIV/AIDS funds. ", "Many HIV/AIDS experts stress that ART, as a tool of both treatment and prevention, must not only be used increasingly, but also in tandem with increased support for other \"combination prevention\" options, including biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions (efforts to address the social, political, and economic factors impacting vulnerability to HIV). In 2009, prevention-specific activities accounted for 22% of HIV/AIDS spending in low- and middle-income countries by all sources. According to UNAIDS, several methods of prevention have demonstrated clear success. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has led to reductions in children infected with HIV, and male circumcision has led to reduced likelihood of uninfected men acquiring HIV from HIV-infected female partners. At the same time, UNAIDS has argued that global prevention interventions are often not adequately directed at the populations most in need, including people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and men who have sex with men (MSM). A major factor limiting the success of ART-based prevention efforts, including early initiation of ART and PMTCT, is that more than 60% of people living with HIV are unaware of their HIV status. Many experts argue that to improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention, there must also be efforts to expand HIV testing and counseling. ", "In recent years, PEPFAR has placed new emphasis on prevention. For example, it committed to preventing more than 12 million new infections from FY2009 to FY2014. PEPFAR's five-year strategy emphasizes scaling up combined interventions tailored to the key drivers of individual country epidemics, and puts particular emphasis on PMTCT and male circumcision activities. Despite this commitment, many health experts call for increased U.S. support of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in general, and efforts targeting high-risk groups in particular. Many experts also urge the United States to increase its support for new methods to measure and evaluate infection trends and prevention program impact, in order to effectively tailor prevention programs to specific country epidemics and better assess the efficacy of various prevention programs.", "While many Members of Congress agree that prevention must be a priority of HIV/AIDS programs, there is less congressional consensus over which prevention activities are most effective and should receive support. In particular, some in Congress express reservation at U.S. support for prevention activities that they feel could be seen as supporting sex work or that may be integrated with family planning and reproductive health services that could be connected to abortion provision. Many health experts argue that in order for prevention efforts to be successful, programs must be driven by data that indicate the needs of specific countries.

Since the Gates announcement, key global health actors have compared and debated the merits and practicality of malaria control, elimination, and eradication efforts.

Also, by 2010, only a handful of the 36 high-burden TB and MDR-TB countries had met the WHO recommendation of having at least one laboratory per 5 million people capable of culturing samples, the most definitive method for detecting TB. USAID documents also cite inadequate clinical management and unavailability of drugs as common causes of fatality among hospitalized malaria patients. These concerns have led many in the global health community to assert that health systems strengthening (HSS) must be considered an essential ingredient of a long-term approach to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. HSS is one of the GHI target areas and has been integrated as a key goal in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria strategies ( Appendix B ). At the same time, there is a lack of clarity over what HSS means and how it can be put into practice.

The clearest direction comes from WHO, which maintains that six \"building blocks\" are critical for a health system: service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership/governance. The GHI consultation document cites the following goals in the U.S. approach to HSS:", "Improve financial strategies that reduce financial barriers to health care (for example, increase government and/or private sector funding for health services); Decrease disparities in health outcomes by providing essential health services, such as skilled birth attendance and voluntary family planning; Increase the number of trained health workers and community workers and ensure their appropriate use throughout the country; and Improve the health management, information, and pharmaceutical systems to reduce stock-outs.", "Despite identifying these components for HSS, the Administration has not yet identified specific indicators for meeting these goals. The GHI consultation document states that specific HSS targets will vary according to country-specific needs, demographics, epidemiology, and structural conditions (such as the socioeconomic and political environment). GHI agencies including the Department of State, USAID, and CDC are working on producing indicators for HSS; however, as of early 2012 these have not been released. While some applaud the plan to align HSS activities with individual country needs, others argue that in the absence of more precise targets and ways to measure impact, the concept of HSS has the potential to be more rhetoric than reality.", "PEPFAR, PMI, and USAID TB programs have been integrated into national health systems to varying degrees. Since its establishment, PEPFAR has been progressively integrated into national health systems, but it has also supported the establishment of many stand-alone systems and has funded a number of activities through international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), rather than local networks (including government, private, faith-based, and NGO groups). For example, PEPFAR has supported country health information systems for some of its programs, but has also set up some of its own information systems to collect data. Similarly, while PEPFAR has used some national distribution systems for AIDS treatment, it has also financed its own supply chain systems to procure antiretrovirals in a number of countries. ", "Given that PMI was established after PEPFAR, it was able to learn a number of lessons from PEPFAR's first few years in operation, including its relationship to the broad functioning of national health systems. As a result, PMI activities have historically been better integrated than PEPFAR into established clinics and laboratories. PMI services have also been frequently combined with other maternal and child health care services. Like PMI, USAID's TB programs have largely been integrated into general health services. USAID's TB programs are often implemented by local groups and USAID works closely with WHO TB initiatives to support the implementation of WHO's strategy for detection and treatment of TB known as \"directly observed treatment, short-course for TB\" (or DOTS), which emphasizes involvement of national governments in TB control.

Some have argued that U.S. single disease initiatives, particularly PEPFAR, have had a detrimental impact on national health systems. For example, some critics argue that such initiatives have led to duplicative planning, operations, and monitoring systems that have often bypassed existing public institutions, doing little to strengthen country capacity. Likewise, some maintain that single disease programs have usurped resources and personnel out of general health services, leading to reduced care in other health areas. On the other hand, some argue that single disease initiatives have had a positive impact on broader systems. Advocates point to the role of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria funding in increased training of health care workers and improvements in health supply chain mechanisms, equipment, information systems, and health facilities.

Sub-Saharan Africa, home to the majority of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and HIV/TB co-infection cases, boasts only 1.3% of the world's health workforce. Shortage of health workers limits the number of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria patients that can receive testing, counseling, treatment, and care. Health worker shortages lessen the likelihood of proper diagnosis and supervision once a patient is receiving medication, increasing the potential for poor adherence and eventual drug resistance. The reasons for the limited workforce are myriad, but experts point to factors such as \"brain drain\"; chronic underinvestment in health workforces, including frozen recruitment and salaries; and work environments with few supplies and limited support. Resource-poor countries with the highest disease burdens also suffer from widespread lack of educational and training opportunities.", "In light of these challenges, U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs have supported a range of efforts to build health worker capacity. Between FY2004 and FY2009, PEPFAR supported 5.2 million training and retraining encounters for health care workers. These efforts have largely addressed health worker shortages through HIV/AIDS-specific training for existing health workers and \"task-shifting\" through which less technical tasks are transferred to others, including community health workers. In FY2009, USAID-funded programs provided training to an estimated 63,000 health care works in DOTS and other TB interventions. These efforts have included pre-service and in-service training on TB to health care professionals and training of community health workers. According to the U.S. TB Strategy, support is provided to health-related academic institutions in partner countries to ensure that TB is a standard component of health worker curriculum. In FY2010, PMI reported the training more than 36,000 health workers in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria with ACTs. PMI programs sponsor malaria-specific trainings for health workers, particularly those working in maternal and child health, and for community health workers.", "As with the general question of health systems strengthening, there has been debate over the impact of single disease initiatives, particularly PEPFAR, on the health workforce capacity. Critics argue that PEPFAR's role in workforce development has primarily benefited HIV/AIDS programs, with little impact on broader health systems. Moreover, observers maintain that in some countries compensation to health workers through PEPFAR programs has drawn staff away from other public health needs. Several experts also assert that the short-term contractual agreements that PEPFAR programs often used to hire health workers can cause disruptions in treatment and care.

The GHI consultation document includes the goal of training 140,000 new workers through HIV/AIDS programs, but extends the time period to 2014. To meet this goal, PEPFAR launched the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI), which provides support through grants to foreign institutions in African countries to expand or enhance models of medical education.", "Advocates applaud the new attention to health workers, although many argue that the United States should adopt a much higher goal for training new health workers if it is to adequately confront shortages.

At the same time, a number of questions about the realization of this goal remain, particularly in relationship to HIV/AIDS. Some experts question whether recipient countries are in fact ready and willing to assume greater responsibility when few African countries spend 15% of their national budgets on health care, as they committed to do at the 2001 Abuja Summit. Alternatively, some analysts doubt Congress will prefer to have recipient countries manage the substantial resources aimed at addressing these diseases, given the possibility that funds may not be spent as efficiently or effectively as possible, along with the potential for misuse of funds by government officials.

In 2008, of all global funds spent on global health R&D, 34.9% went to HIV/AIDS, 15.1% to TB, and 18.3% to malaria ( Table 2 ). The United States is the largest funder of global health R&D in the world, contributing approximately 45% of total global investment and 70% of all government investment each year. Of the U.S. R&D global health funding over the past decade, 57% has done toward HIV/AIDS, 12% toward TB, and 10% toward malaria. Five U.S. agencies conduct global health R&D: NIH accounts for the vast majority of U.S. global health R&D efforts and leads a range of basic and clinical research activities on global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; USAID, DOD, and CDC each conduct field research related to these diseases; and the FDA supports product development by facilitating the regulatory process. As the United States reforms its HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs to better support sustainable approaches to health, spending levels for R&D and the areas of R&D priority are up for debate.

There have also been several important recent R&D accomplishments. In 2011, results from an HIV prevention study found that early use of ART in discordant couples led to a 96% reduction in HIV transmission. A 2010 trial also demonstrated that HIV treatment used as prophylaxis reduced the risk of HIV infection by 44% in men who have sex with men. Results from another 2010 study in South Africa, funded in part by the United States, showed that a microbicide gel was 39% effective in reducing a woman's risk of contracting HIV during sex. In December 2010, WHO endorsed the rollout of a new rapid diagnostic test for TB and MDR-TB, funded in part by NIH. The test provides a diagnosis within 100 minutes, while existing tests can take as much as three months to produce results. Finally, while no vaccine for malaria exists, research has been promising. There are currently over a dozen vaccine candidates in clinical development and one, produced by GlaxoSmithKline, is in clinical trial. If these are successful, the vaccine could be available as early as 2014.", "In many cases, however, the impact of these advances have been compromised by outdated or inadequate technologies. Despite progress made in AIDS treatment, even the most recent forms of ART include potentially severe side effects and many of the newer drugs, particularly second- and third-line therapies, are prohibitively expensive for many developing countries. Likewise, available HIV/AIDS treatment requires increased nutritional intake, which is often challenging for poor individuals and families. Many of the current TB diagnosis and treatment tools were developed decades ago and have had uneven success. The most common method of TB diagnosis, sputum smear microscopy, is labor intensive and does not consistently detect TB. Also, current treatment regimens require people with active TB to take medicines for a period lasting 6 to 12 months and to be monitored during their entire treatment cycle. The emergence of drug-resistant forms of TB and malaria highlight the need for even more advanced diagnostic and treatment tools, appropriate for resource-poor environments. Treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB is considerably more expensive than basic TB treatment and can take up to two years, including significant time spent in a hospital with special facilities. Growing malaria drug and insecticide resistance threaten the success of the most effective available methods to control the disease.", "Many health experts believe that U.S. funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria research and development lags behind what is needed. In particular, experts point to the need for increased R&D related to basic TB diagnostics and treatment, new drugs to tackle TB and malaria drug resistance, and an AIDS vaccine. Some argue that the long-term nature of R&D complicates efforts to raise financial support for the work, and the low incomes in the most affected countries provide little incentive for private companies to invest in expensive research. In recent years, the international community has taken some innovative steps to address this challenge. For example, in the absence of viable commercial markets for some health technologies for developing countries, a number of new nonprofit ventures, known as Product Development Partnerships (PDPs), have begun to support research and the development of drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics. PDPs working on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria includes groups like the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, the TB Alliance, and the Medicines for Malaria Venture. Similarly, in 2008, WHO supported the establishment of the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation (ANDI), an initiative that aims to build Africa-based research capacity to respond to diseases on the continent. The United States is one of the largest public financiers for these efforts, but many experts advocate increased support of innovative approaches to R&D.", "Many also argue that the United States should significantly increase its support for what is known as operations, or implementation, research. Operations research is the study of how technology is used in the field, and aims to identify factors that affect service delivery and impact implementation or scale-up of interventions. Advocates applaud the support for operational research in the GHI consultation document and argue that it should be seen as necessary for improving prevention and treatment outcomes and for addressing strategies in support of more sustainable HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs.

M&E requires collection of a variety of data from multiple sources, including household surveys, birth and death registration, census, and national surveillance systems. Resource-poor countries often have limited ability to produce data that is timely, standardized, and of a high enough quality to use for routine tracking and assessment of health programs. Malaria M&E efforts are particularly challenged because many resource-poor countries have weak health information systems necessary to track childhood health and many people infected with malaria, especially children, do not seek treatment in official health facilities. Similarly, gaps in TB coverage, treatment, and case detection impede effective and comprehensive M&E. Drug-resistant forms of TB pose new challenges to M&E efforts, as many resource-poor countries do not have the capacity to test for second-line drug resistance. Efforts to monitor and evaluate HIV/TB co-infection rates and activities are also precluded by limited information sharing between distinct TB and HIV programs.", "U.S. M&E efforts are also challenged by the interaction in the field between U.S. global health programs and those of other donors, including the Global Fund and a range of private and NGO actors, which make it difficult to evaluate the outcomes of any one program. Finally, given the number of factors that influence the functioning and capacity of health systems and national governments, effective ways to measure the progress and impact of activities related to issues such as health systems strengthening and country ownership remain contentious. Indeed, PEPFAR has yet to develop specific indicators for measuring the effectiveness of activities related to HSS, country ownership, and HIV prevention.", "Many have called for the United States to mandate regular and comprehensive M&E of its HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs and increase support for in-country capacity to collect and assess health data. Some have also called on the United States to improve its data transparency and its dissemination of results to international and local partners. Experts have encouraged the alignment of health indicators used by the United States (through programs like PEPFAR and PMI) and those used by multilateral organizations and national governments. Some also urge the United States to support the use of national information systems for M&E as a way to strengthen these systems and increase country ownership of M&E. At the same time, other observers caution that additional measurement and reporting requirements have the potential to overburden already strained countries and programs and may reduce the time and money available for programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Engagement with Multilateral Organizations", "paragraphs": ["The United States supports global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts through bilateral programs as well as partnerships with and contributions to multilateral organizations. Over the last decade, Members of Congress have debated the appropriate balance between funding bilateral and multilateral global health efforts. This debate frequently focuses on the extent to which the United States should support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund), a multilateral public-private partnership established in 2002 to provide financial support for global responses to the three diseases. The Global Fund estimates that in 2009 it provided approximately 21% of all funding for global HIV/AIDS, 65% of all funding for global TB, and 65% of all funding for global malaria. Donors to the Global Fund include a number of governments as well as private and multilateral organizations. The United States is the single largest donor to the Global Fund, though U.S. bilateral spending on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria far outweighs contributions to the Global Fund and other multilateral groups ( Figure 6 ).", "The Obama Administration has indicated support for increased engagement with multilateral organizations, including the Global Fund. In October 2010, the President pledged $4 billion to the Global Fund over the course of three fiscal years\u2014the first multi-year pledge to the Global Fund from the United States. While requesting decreased funding amounts for all bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, the FY2013 budget request includes a 27% increase in funding for the Global Fund over estimated FY2012 levels, fulfilling the President's multi-year pledge. The Administration has also emphasized nonfinancial ways in which the United States can support multilateral organizations, including better coordination in-country with multilateral organizations, increased technical assistance to multilaterally funded field programs, and demonstrated leadership in shaping the policies of multilateral organizations (for instance, as a member of the Global Fund Board).", "Despite this support, in November 2011, the Global Fund announced that due to limited resources available from donor countries, it would cancel its 11 th round of funding. In order to prevent any gaps in services, the Global Fund has instituted a \"Transitional Funding Mechanism\" (TFM), which will secure funding for programs facing disruptions in services currently supported by the Global Fund between 2012 and 2014. Documents released by the Global Fund have made clear that in this same time period, it will be unable to support any new interventions, nor will it support the scale-up of services, including provision of ART.", "A number of experts contend that the Global Fund's decision demonstrates the critical need for increased multilateral funding from donors like the United States. Some argue that a reduction\u2014or leveling\u2014of funding to the Global Fund could imperil lives and cause significant losses in the progress made against the three diseases. Some experts argue that the U.S. fight against the three diseases would be better waged through increased support to multilateral organizations rather than to bilateral programming. Specifically, advocates argue that multilaterals cede greater control of the programs to recipient countries, which supports the goal of country ownership. Some also argue that multilateral programs have more flexibility than bilateral programs, allowing them to better respond to locally defined needs. Likewise, some assert that funds are more effectively spent through multilateral mechanisms because donors can pool their resources and achieve economy of scale. Also, multilateral groups are capable of extending multi-year support. Some argue that this is particularly useful when addressing diseases that require long-term funding, like HIV/AIDS. Finally, some contend that U.S. engagement in multilateral organizations offers the United States opportunities to demonstrate its leadership in global health and encourage other countries to share in the global fight against the three diseases. As a result, some of these advocates applaud the President's decision to request significantly increased funding for the Global Fund in the FY2013 budget.", "Advocates of limited support for multilateral organizations argue that bilateral assistance increases the United States' ability to target health assistance to specific countries and determine funding priorities. In addition, others assert that bilateral assistance allows for better oversight of the use of funds by recipient governments and organizations. Some experts also contend that bilateral assistance is easier to track and measure than multilateral assistance, allowing for more effective monitoring and evaluation. Ongoing concerns about the capacity of multilateral groups like the Global Fund to detect and respond to corrupt practices propel this debate.

Discussions may focus on a number of critical disease-specific and cross-cutting issues, measurement of the effectiveness of the U.S. response, and tradeoffs the United States might consider as it sets priorities. As Congress reflects on these challenges, several overarching issues may also be considered:", "Ways to assess impact and efficiency of global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs: As Congress debates funding the fight against these three diseases, it will likely consider which methods to use in determining the distribution of finite global health and overall foreign assistance resources. The United States might face decisions over whether it should invest in the lowest-cost interventions, such as anti-malaria bednets, versus the higher-cost interventions that high-burden countries may be unable to afford, such as antiretroviral therapy. Similarly, the United States might consider whether it should support programs tackling the high-mortality issues, such as drug-resistant TB, or the more widespread and commonplace issues, such as malaria infection. The United States may also consider how it should balance its funding between high-impact activities, such as ART programs, with dramatic results and areas like health systems strengthening, which may yield few immediate results but which could result in significant long-term progress. More broadly, policymakers may weigh support for these programs against other foreign policy priorities. Role of the United States in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria: The United States is a central leader in combating HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Some Members of Congress have targeted global health funding for cuts as a way to reduce the U.S. deficit. Many supporters of these cuts have argued that the United States has played an overly generous role in combating issues like global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, especially since these investments do not necessarily have direct implications for the wellbeing of U.S. citizens. Alternatively, many supporters argue that U.S. leadership in the fight against these diseases remains critical, particularly as new tools for treatment and prevention become available. Many of these advocates assert that given the prominence of the United States, any U.S. divestment could have significant negative consequences for some of the most vulnerable people in resource-poor countries. Some also point out that while the United States has been a key donor for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, several European countries give more for these diseases as a share of their country's GDP. Finally, advocates assert that U.S. leadership is vital for sustaining the activities of the Global Fund, a key financial player in the fight against these diseases. Many advocates and critics of expanding U.S. global health assistance call for other countries, including a number of European countries, as well as emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, to begin playing a larger role in combating global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Advocates argue that increased efforts among other donors could help achieve the United Nations (U.N.) Millennium Development (MDG) goal \"to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases,\" a goal which to which all U.N. member states have committed. At the same time, there is disagreement over the ways in which U.S. leadership can and should motivate this kind of engagement. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria assistance, economic development, and security: Congressional consideration of U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs may be affected by debate over their role in the broader U.S. foreign policy agenda. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria have undeniable humanitarian consequences. At the same time, many argue that these diseases also have important implications for economic development and security. Development experts argue that disease can threaten political and economic stability in fragile areas of the world, undermining U.S. interests abroad. Health experts believe that U.S. citizens are threatened by the spread of infectious diseases across borders. Furthermore, foreign policy experts contend that global health efforts like PEPFAR have become critical diplomatic tools (often referred to as medical diplomacy) and have bolstered the image of the United States abroad, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Alternatively, others caution against overly emphasizing the security and diplomatic implications of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, and warn that doing so could lead to allocation of funding according to U.S. interests rather than human need.", "Appendix A.
