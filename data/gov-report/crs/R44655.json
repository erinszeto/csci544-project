Gun control advocates generally view the prevalence of firearms in the United States as causing more harm than good. In their view, guns intensify violence by escalating the chances that a crime victim will die in a robbery, aggravated assault, or domestic dispute. They observe that most American gun violence involves \"attacks on intimate partners,\" \"gang and drug beefs in disadvantaged neighborhoods,\" and \"suicides,\" not necessarily in that order. They observe further that there is considerable overlap between mental illness and suicide, and the use of a gun in a suicide attempt nearly always proves fatal. They contend that level of gun violence in the United States is out of line with other industrialized nations and that those nations' experience shows that progressive gun control laws have successfully reduced crime and other forms of gun violence. Gun control supporters, moreover, often view the use of firearms for self-defense or to resist a tyrannical government as impractical and unnecessary, especially in countries with well-developed democratic institutions and rule of law like in the United States.

Indeed, many gun rights supporters view armed self-defense with a firearm as a \"natural right\" that precedes but is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. In short, they view the prevalence of firearms in the United States as a guarantor of freedom and security for individuals, as well as the wider civic body, and as a means to deter oppressive or tyrannical governments. In addition, gun rights supporters often pursue and enjoy hunting, marksmanship, and other shooting sports.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gun Trafficking and Straw Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Criminal \"gun trafficking\" essentially entails the movement or diversion of firearms from legal to illegal markets. Therefore, it follows that the entire GCA is arguably a statutory framework designed to combat gun trafficking domestically, particularly interstate gun trafficking. ATF has developed a nationwide strategy to reduce firearms trafficking and violent crime by preventing convicted felons, drug traffickers, and juvenile gang members from acquiring firearms from gun traffickers. Gun trafficking cases include, but are not limited to, the following activities:", "straw purchasers or straw purchasing rings; trafficking in firearms by corrupt federally licensed gun dealers; trafficking in firearms by unlicensed dealers (i.e., persons who deal in firearms illegally as the principal source of their livelihood); trafficking in stolen firearms; and trafficking of secondhand firearms acquired from unlicensed persons at gun shows, flea markets, and other private venues.", "Unlike other forms of contraband, almost all illegal firearms used criminally in the United States were diverted at some point from legal channels of commerce. ATF works to reduce firearms-related crime with two approaches, industry regulation and criminal investigation. ", "A \"straw purchase\" occurs when an individual poses as the actual transferee, but he is actually acquiring the firearm for another person. In effect, he serves as an illegal middleman. As part of any firearms transfer from an FFL to a private person, the GCA requires them to fill out jointly an ATF Form 4473. In addition, the FFL is required to verify the purchaser's name, address, date of birth, and other information by examining a government-issued piece of identification, most often a driver's license. Among other things, the purchaser attests on the ATF Form 4473 that he is not a prohibited person, and that he is the \"actual transferee/buyer.\" Hence, straw purchases are known as \"lying and buying for the other guy.\" Straw purchases are illegal under two provisions of the GCA.", "If the purchaser makes any false statement to a FFL with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of a prospective firearms transfer, it is a federal offense punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(a)(6). This provision also captures misrepresentations such as presenting false identity documents. Violations are punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(2). ", "It is also illegal for any person knowingly to make any false statement with respect to the records that FFLs are required to maintain under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). This provision, however, also captures misrepresentations related to licensure and other benefits under the GCA. Violations are punishable by up to five years of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(1)(D).", "Straw purchases, however, are not easily detected, because their illegality only becomes apparent when the straw purchaser's true intent is revealed by a subsequent transfer to the actual buyer (third party). In many cases, the actual buyer may be a prohibited person, who would not pass a background check. Under such a scenario, if the straw purchaser knew or had reasonable cause to know the actual transferee was a prohibited person, he would also be in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(d), for which the penalty is up to 10 years of imprisonment. It would also be a violation for the prohibited person to possess or receive the firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(g), for which the penalty is also up to 10 years of imprisonment. ", "Alternatively, the actual buyer may not be a prohibited person, but may be seeking to acquire firearms without any paper trail linking him to the acquisition of the firearm. Under such a scenario, however, the straw purchase and subsequent illegal transfer would be even less apparent for several reasons. Under federal law, it is legal for an unlicensed, private person to purchase firearms and then resell them or give them away, as long as the", "transferees are not prohibited or underage persons; transferors do not deal in firearms in a volume that would require licensing; and transfers are intrastate , as generally only federally licensed gun dealers can legally transfer firearms interstate .", "Hence, individuals may buy several firearms at a time with the intention of giving those firearms away as presents to anyone, as long as they do not present those firearms to persons who are underage; out-of-state residents; or prohibited persons. They may also buy firearms and, then, sell those firearms at any time, as long as selling firearms is not the principal objective of their livelihood and profit, in which case they would be required to be federally licensed to deal in firearms. Furthermore, no federal background checks are required for recipients of subsequent intrastate firearms transfers.", "On the other hand, if the suspected straw purchaser were observed departing the licensed gun dealer's place of business and traveling immediately to another locale, where he transferred the firearm(s) to another person, there would be a reasonable suspicion that he was a straw purchaser. However, the actual buyer would not have committed a crime unless it could be proven that he had sponsored the straw purchase. Usually, such illegal arrangements become clear when the straw purchaser is interviewed by agents and admits to having bought the firearms for the third party, non-prohibited person. Moreover, depending on the time that elapses between the initial straw purchases and subsequent transfers to the actual buyer (third party), the illegality of the transfers may not become apparent until the actual buyer's true intent is revealed, when he either transports those firearms across state lines to be sold or bartered, attempts to smuggle them across an international border, or engages in some other illegal act. ", "Sometimes, the behavior of the prospective transferee (straw purchaser) may raise reasonable suspicions. For example, during a controversial ATF Phoenix-based investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" several of the individuals under indictment made multiple purchases from the same FFL of multiple semiautomatic firearms. Raising suspicions further, they paid for these firearms with thousands of dollars in cash. Indeed, FFLs contacted ATF about these suspicious transfers, prompting the investigation. They did so, in part, because they realized that these firearms might be traced back to their businesses and they probably wanted to avoid any negative attention that those traces might bring back on them. It is notable that if an FFL believes a firearms transfer to be suspicious, he may choose not to sell those firearms to the individuals in question. If he should proceed with the transfer, however, as long as he had conducted the required criminal background check on the prospective buyer, and he and the prospective buyer had filled out the proper paperwork, his obligations under federal law would have been fulfilled. ", "In summation, with regard to interstate transfers, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to transport or receive a firearm into his own state of residence that was obtained in another state. In addition, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to deliver a firearm to another unlicensed person who resides in a state other than the transferor's state of residence. Violations of either provision are punishable by a fine and/or not more than five years of imprisonment. It is also unlawful to smuggle firearms, or any other merchandise contrary to U.S. law from the United States.

As part of NICS checks, the system will respond to an FFL or state official with a NICS Transaction Number (NTN) with one of three outcomes: (1) \"proceed\" with transfer or permit/license issuance, because a prohibiting record was not found; (2) \"denied,\" indicating a prohibiting record was found; or (3) \"delayed,\" indicating that the system produced information that suggested there could be a prohibiting record.

The FBI, meanwhile, would continue to work the NICS adjudication for up to 90 days, during which the transaction is considered to be in an \"open\" status. If the FBI ascertains that the person is not in a prohibited status at any time during the 90 days, then the FBI would contact the FFL through NICS with a proceed response.

The Veterans' Medical Administration has rarely submitted any disqualifying records on VA medical care recipients to the FBI for inclusion in NICS for any medical/psychiatric reason (like PTSD). While veterans with PTSD or any other condition, who have been involuntarily committed under a state court order to a VA medical facility because they posed a danger to themselves or others, are ineligible to ship, transport, receive, or possess a firearm or ammunition under federal law, the Veterans' Medical Administration would not always make a related referral about that ineligibility to the FBI. Instead, the state in which the court resides would submit the disqualifying record to the FBI, if such a submission would be appropriate and permissible under state law. ", "Also, under the GCA, there is a provision that allows the Attorney General (previously, the Secretary of the Treasury) to consider petitions from a prohibited person for \"relief from disabilities\" and have his firearms transfer and possession eligibility restored. Since FY1993, however, a rider on the ATF annual appropriations for salaries and expenses has prohibited the expenditure of any funding provided under that account on processing such petitions. As a result, except for as provided under P.L. 110-180 , the only way a person can reacquire his lost firearms eligibility is to have his civil rights restored or disqualifying criminal record(s) expunged or set aside, or to be pardoned for his crime. Consequently, prior to P.L. 110-180 , a mental defective-related NICS referral by the VA to the FBI related to PTSD or any other condition could have been considered a life-long prohibiting factor with regard to firearms eligibility. ", "Under P.L. 110-180 , Congress included provisions that require the VA to inform veterans and other beneficiaries (surviving spouses and dependents) beforehand that by having a fiduciary appointed on their behalf they will be considered \"mentally incompetent\" and, as a consequence, will lose their firearms eligibility under federal law. In addition, the act requires the VA to establish a process under which veterans or other beneficiaries who have been deemed mentally incompetent may file for administrative relief and possibly have their gun rights restored if they are able to demonstrate that they are no longer afflicted by a disqualifying condition. The act makes the same requirement of any other federal agency that makes such a referral to the FBI. As a condition of federal assistance, the same requirement is made of states as well. ", "According to the BJS, as of June 1, 2012, there were 153,298 files in the NICS mental defective file, which had been referred to the FBI by the VA. Those VA files accounted for 99.3% of mental defective files (154,458) referred to the FBI by a federal department or agency. According to the FBI, as of December 31, 2015, there were 263,492 files, a 71.9% increase over the early count, or 98.8% of the mental defective files (260,381) referred to the FBI by a federal department or agency. ", "In the view of some Members of Congress, it is questionable that other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, that provide similar disability and income maintenance benefits to persons who are mentally incapacitated, refer relatively few, if any, firearms-related disqualifying records about beneficiaries whom they serve to the FBI. Moreover, there are other individuals in the U.S. population who are similarly incapacitated due to their age-related infirmities or mental disabilities, but in many cases there are no mechanisms for state or local authorities to make similar referrals to the FBI. As a consequence, even with the changes put in place by P.L. 110-180 , those Members of Congress may view the VA's continued referral of firearms-related disqualifying records on veterans who have had a fiduciary appointed on their behalf, but who had not behaved in a threatening or dangerous manner, to be an unwarranted indignity placed on individuals who had served their country honorably in the Armed\u00a0Forces. ", "Other Members of Congress would maintain that the VA has dutifully complied with the law and that public safety is enhanced by making those referrals to the FBI. They might also argue that opposition to the VA policy waned between November 1998 and the 2007 congressional debate, demonstrating that veterans who were \"adjudicated mental defective\" rarely, if ever, sought to acquire and were subsequently denied firearms in a manner that could be described as an injustice. Those Members would likely underscore that, in their view, the VA's current policy does not diminish national recognition of those veterans' honorable service. Rather, the VA's policy has been implemented to protect those veterans and others from the harm that might result if they acquired a firearm and used it improperly due to reasons possibly related to their mental incompetency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manchin-Toomey Amendment", "paragraphs": ["The Manchin-Toomey ( S.Amdt. 2908 ) to H.R. 3762 would have amended veterans law to prohibit the VA from turning records on veterans or other beneficiaries who had been determined mentally incompetent over to the FBI for inclusion in NICS index unless certain notification and review conditions were met.

As mentioned above, a VA beneficiary would have had the option to request such a review from this board or from a court of competent jurisdiction. Under the Manchin-Toomey provision, the board would have been able to consider the individual's honorable discharge or decoration in determining whether he or she \"cannot safely use, carry, possess, or store firearms due to mental incompetency.\" A beneficiary who receives a determination from the board also would have been permitted to seek judicial review in federal court of the board's decision. It appears that until this review process is complete, a person would not have been considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for purposes of firearms eligibility. As such, it appears that the Secretary, by implication, would not have been permitted to make a NICS referral during this period of time.", "If a beneficiary did not request review by a board or court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after receiving the initial notification from the Secretary, then the beneficiary who was to be determined mentally incompetent would have been considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for purposes of the GCA.
