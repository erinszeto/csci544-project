In a class action, a plaintiff (known as the \"class representative,\" the \"named representative,\" or the \"named plaintiff\") may sue the defendant not only on his own behalf, but also on behalf of other entities (the \"class members\") who are similarly situated to the class representative in order to resolve any legal or factual questions that are common to the entire class.", "Courts and commentators have recognized that class actions can serve several beneficial purposes, including economizing litigation and incentivizing plaintiffs to pursue socially desirable lawsuits. At the same time, however, class actions can occasionally subject defendants to costly or abusive litigation. Moreover, because the class members generally do not actively participate in a class action lawsuit, class actions pose a risk that the class representative and his counsel will not always act in accordance with the class members' best interests. In an attempt to balance the benefits of class actions against the risks to defendants and class members, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 establishes a rigorous series of prerequisites that a federal class action must satisfy. For similar reasons, Rule 23 also subjects proposed class action settlements to the scrutiny of the federal courts.", "This report serves as a primer on class action litigation in the federal courts. It begins by discussing the purpose of class actions, as well as the risks class actions may pose to defendants, class members, and society at large. The report also discusses the prerequisites that a class action must satisfy before a court may \"certify\" it\u2014that is, before a federal court may allow a case to proceed as a class action. An Appendix to the report also contains a reference chart that graphically illustrates those prerequisites for class certification. The report then discusses Rule 23's restrictions on the parties' ability to settle a certified class action. The report concludes by identifying ways in which Congress could modify the legal framework governing class actions if it were so inclined, with a particular focus on a bill currently pending in the 115th Congress that would effectuate a variety of changes to the class action system."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Class action lawsuits\u2014that is, lawsuits by representative parties on behalf of a group of similar plaintiffs that have aggregated their claims in a single action\u2014are frequently in the forefront of debates over the American private law system. According to the Supreme Court, class actions are the \"most adventuresome\" innovation in American law. To some commentators, the class action device is the tool that \"gives American workers and consumers the power and ability to level the playing field, even when facing the most powerful corporations in the world.\" To others, class actions are typically brought \"to essentially shakedown a defendant\u2014hurting businesses and the American economy.\" Unsurprisingly then, class actions have been a frequent subject of debate in Congress.", "This report serves as a primer on class action law and analyzes areas that have been the focus of congressional discussions concerning class actions. The report first discusses the broader public policy debate over class actions, including why class actions exist and what risks they pose to the American system of civil justice. The report then details what a plaintiff is required to show under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in order to achieve class action \"certification\"\u2014that is, in order to pursue an action on behalf of an entire class. Throughout, the report addresses the ways in which the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have attempted to balance the benefits of class actions against their potential drawbacks.", "Lastly, this report discusses key aspects of class action litigation that have been the focus of recent congressional legislative debates. In particular, the report focuses on three areas which have been of particular concern: (1) the cohesiveness (or lack thereof) of the class; (2) ascertainability and administrative feasibility of the class action; and (3) divergent incentives and fees for class counsel compared with the benefits received by class members. The main lens for considering these areas is the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017 ( H.R. 985 ), which passed the House of Representatives in March 2017. Accordingly, this report considers how H.R. 985 would modify existing law, along with other potential avenues for change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background on Class Actions", "paragraphs": ["The default rule in American litigation is that a lawsuit is conducted by, or on behalf of, the named parties only. Class actions, however, are an exception to this rule. A class action is a procedure by which a large group of entities\u2014that is, a \"class\" \u2014may challenge a defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct in a single lawsuit, rather than through numerous, separate suits initiated by individual plaintiffs. Class actions have an ancient pedigree; analogues to class actions \"have been recognized in various forms since the earliest days of English law,\" and class actions have \"been a fixture\" of federal litigation in the United States \"for over seventy-five years.\" Under the modern version of the class action, a plaintiff (known as the \"class representative,\" the \"named representative,\" or the \"named plaintiff\") may sue the defendant not only on his own behalf, but also on behalf of other entities (the \"class members\") who are similarly situated to the class representative in order to resolve legal or factual questions that are common to the entire class. To illustrate, if, for example, a large number of consumers all purchased a product that turned out to be defective, one of those consumers could potentially bring a single class action against the manufacturer on his own behalf as well as on behalf of all others who purchased the product, thereby eliminating the need for other plaintiffs to join that consumer's lawsuit or initiate their own separate lawsuits.", "Importantly, a class action differs from other forms of litigation involving large numbers of injured persons. In ordinary multiparty litigation, everyone seeking relief from the defendant is a party to the lawsuit and directly participates in the litigation. In a class action, by contrast, the class representative is \"the only plaintiff[] actually named in the complaint\"; the class members are not formal parties to the lawsuit and typically do not directly guide the litigation. The class representative therefore \"acts on behalf of the entire class.\" The class members, by virtue of not being directly \"present before the court,\" are often referred to as being \"absent\" from the litigation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Purpose of the Class Action Device", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court has recognized that the class action device serves several purposes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economizing Litigation", "paragraphs": ["First, as the Supreme Court has explained, a \"principal purpose\" of class actions is to advance \"the efficiency and economy of litigation.\" By consolidating what would normally be multiple suits or a multiple-plaintiff litigation into a single suit sharing common questions, the class action is \"designed to avoid . . . unnecessary filing of repetitious papers and motions.\" If every plaintiff had to independently prove and answer the same common questions, it would typically be \"grossly inefficient, costly, and time consuming because the parties, witnesses, and courts would be forced to endure unnecessarily duplicative litigation.\" Class actions thereby potentially economize litigation by consolidating every class member's claim into a single proceeding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aggregation of Individual Claims", "paragraphs": ["A class action also enables large numbers of persons injured by a defendant's unlawful conduct \"to obtain relief as a group\" when each class member's individual claim is \"too small to justify the expense of a separate suit.\" Oftentimes, when a defendant inflicts comparatively small injuries to a large number of people, no plaintiff standing alone has a sufficient financial \"incentive . . . to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.\" As the Supreme Court has noted, a class action resolves this \"problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's (usually an attorney's) labor.\"", "To illustrate, suppose a defendant injures a million consumers for $30.00 in damages each. If each plaintiff had to file a stand-alone suit to recover the money he lost, few would take the trouble to do so. As former federal Judge Richard Posner once colorfully noted, \"Only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30\" because the costs of prosecuting the lawsuit would far exceed the maximum award each victim could recover. Thus, some legal observers have argued that absent some other deterrent, like a successful criminal prosecution, the defendant's $30 million wrong would go unpunished, and the victims would remain uncompensated. If, however, an individual plaintiff could bring a single class action lawsuit on behalf of everyone the defendant wronged to resolve the common questions, then the plaintiff could potentially aggregate each class member's $30.00 loss, resulting in a potential $30 million recovery. That $30 million potential award would then make it economically rational for attorneys to expend time and resources to pursue the class's claims. Then, if the plaintiff ultimately prevailed in his class action, the resulting award could be divided among the plaintiff, his counsel, and the other class members. In this way, class actions compensate victims who might otherwise go uncompensated and punish wrongdoers who might otherwise go unpunished. However, as explained in greater detail below, a court's decision to not allow a particular lawsuit to proceed as a class action can effectively \"sound the 'death knell' of the litigation on the part of the plaintiffs\" because the individual plaintiff's claim will often be \"too small to justify the expense of\" prosecuting a non-class action lawsuit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protecting Defendants from Inconsistent Adjudications", "paragraphs": ["Lastly, the Supreme Court has stated that the class action serves to protect defendants from repeated and possibly inconsistent adjudications. By consolidating all potential plaintiffs' claims in a single proceeding, a defendant can obtain finality with respect to all future actions, rather than be subject to an unknown number of repeated suits and possibly inconsistent judgments. Finality benefits defendants by freeing them from \"the distraction of litigation\" and by allowing them to \"proceed with [their] business affairs more clearly.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risks of Class Actions", "paragraphs": ["While the Supreme Court has recognized that the class action device serves several useful purposes, the procedural mechanism also poses risks for the U.S. civil justice system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Abusive and Costly Litigation", "paragraphs": ["First, because a class action permits thousands or millions of class members to aggregate their claims, a defendant who opts to defend rather than settle a class action may face \"potentially ruinous liability.\" Consequently, \"even if a class's claim is weak, the sheer number of class members and the potential payout that could be required if all members prove liability might force a defendant to settle a meritless claim in order to avoid breaking the company.\" Thus, without effective legal safeguards, class actions could potentially encourage plaintiffs to file lawsuits that have minimal chances of success in order to extract settlements from defendants. While it would of course be inaccurate to conclude that all class actions are meritless or abusive, it is fair to say that plaintiffs have sometimes attempted to bring class action lawsuits that could charitably be described as fanciful or humorous. To name one example, a resident of California sued the manufacturer of Cap'n Crunch cereal for deceptive advertising, contending that the defendant had unlawfully misled consumers to believe that \"Crunchberries\" were made of fruit. The court presiding over that case, rather than permitting the case to proceed as a class action, dismissed the case in its entirety, opining that \"the survival of the [plaintiff's] claim would require th[e] Court to ignore all concepts of personal responsibility and common sense.\"", "Additionally, even though class actions may economize litigation in some respects, class action litigation still \"place[s] an enormous burden of costs and expense upon parties.\" As one federal district judge has maintained, almost \"all class action law suits involve complex issues, which are costly to resolve and often result in protracted proceedings.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Absent Class Members", "paragraphs": ["Secondly, the fact that a class action permits a named plaintiff to represent absent class members raises the concern that the named plaintiff may not always zealously represent the class's interests. As noted above, class action litigation \"is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.'\" \"Class members who are not parties to a class action suit\" are generally \"bound by the judgment in the suit,\" even if they have not actively participated in the case in any way \u2014and, indeed, even if the parties and the court do not (and cannot) know the specific identities of each and every class member. Class actions thereby effectively \"delegate\" the \"class members' right to a day in court . . . to the named plaintiff.\" Because class members usually do not control or actively participate in the litigation, class action litigation poses a risk that, without effective safeguards, the class representative may \"'sell[] out' the interests of absent class members in favor of his or her own\" self-interest or otherwise fail to fairly represent the class."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lawyer-Driven Litigation", "paragraphs": ["Just as class members usually have no direct control over the class representative, class members also typically \"have no control over class counsel.\" Because each class member's interest in the case is typically small, class members may have relatively little financial interest in the outcome of the litigation for the class as a whole. For instance, if class counsel obtains a favorable result for the class in the $30 million fraud example described above, each class member may win a maximum of only $30, but class counsel could potentially receive a sizable award of attorney's fees. For this reason, courts and commentators have expressed concern that plaintiffs' attorneys may not always act in the best interests of class members, particularly when negotiating a settlement with the defendant. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (\"Seventh Circuit\") explained,", "Class counsel rarely have clients to whom they are responsive. The named plaintiffs in a class action, though supposed to be the representatives of the class, are typically chosen by class counsel; the other class members are not parties and have no control over class counsel. The result is an acute conflict of interest between class counsel, whose pecuniary interest is in their fees, and class members, whose pecuniary interest is in the award to the class. ", "The structure of class actions may thereby give class counsel \"an incentive to negotiate settlements that enrich themselves but give scant reward to\" the class members \u2014who, by virtue of being nonparties, may lack a meaningful opportunity to safeguard their interests against enterprising plaintiff's attorneys."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "How Class Actions Work", "paragraphs": ["Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs the initiation and maintenance of class actions in federal court.

On the one hand, a court's decision to deny class certification may effectively \"sound the 'death knell' of the litigation on the part of the plaintiffs\" \"because the representative plaintiff's claim is too small to justify the expense of\" initiating and litigating an individual suit. On the other hand, a court's decision to grant class certification \"may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability,\" even if the class's claims have only a minimal chance of success. Because the decision to grant or deny certification is so momentous, the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed federal courts to conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" confirming that the prerequisites of Rule 23 are satisfied before certifying a class. The \"court 'must resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to class certification, even if they overlap with the merits'\" of the class members' claims against the defendant. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \"merits questions may\" only \"be considered to the extent . . . that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\"", "The court must conduct the class certification analysis at \"an early practicable time\" after the commencement of the class action. \"The word 'practicable' imports some leeway in determining the timing of such a decision\" by the court. Although \"the issue of certification should generally be resolved prior to addressing the merits of the plaintiff's claims,\" there is no categorical rule prohibiting courts from ruling on case-dispositive motions before deciding whether to certify the proposed class.", "\"A party seeking class certification\" bears the burden to \"affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with\" each of the requirements described below, and he must satisfy that burden \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" It is not sufficient to merely \" plead compliance with the . . . Rule 23 requirements\"; the plaintiff must instead introduce \" evidence that the putative class complies with Rule 23.\"", "If a court determines that the class satisfies the requirements for certification, then Rule 23 directs the court to issue a certification order that defines the class and appoints class counsel. As explained later in this report, a court can certify \"subclasses\" with separate legal representation in a single action, and should do so where interests within the proposed class might diverge. Lastly, the court should then direct notice to the class members as required by Rule 23. The notice required depends on the category under which the class which is certified.

Courts give \"classes with between 21 and 40 members . . . varying treatment\"; \"these midsized classes may or may not meet the numerosity requirement depending on the circumstances of each particular case.\" While the number of class members is the \"starting point\" of the numerosity analysis, \"the number of members in a proposed class is not determinative of whether joinder is impracticable.\" Courts also consider a variety of other factors when evaluating numerosity, the most common of which include (i) whether the class members are geographically dispersed; (ii) the financial resources of the class members; (iii) the burden that multiple individual actions would place on the judiciary; and (iv) the ease with which class members may be identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commonality (Rule 23(a)(2))", "paragraphs": ["The plaintiff must then show that \"there are questions of law or fact common to the class.\" This prerequisite is known as the \"commonality\" requirement, and it exists to ensure that the claims of the full class are \"limit[ed] . . . to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff's claims.\"", "In its 2010 decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , the Supreme Court explained that the commonality prerequisite requires more than an incidental common question within the class; rather, the plaintiff must establish that the claims \"depend upon a common contention\" that is of such a nature that \"determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" Commentators generally agree that Wal-Mart expanded the significance of commonality. There, the Court reviewed a decision certifying a proposed class of approximately 1.5 million former and current female Wal-Mart employees. The plaintiffs asserted a sex discrimination against Wal-Mart under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that local Wal-Mart supervisors favored men over women when exercising their discretion over pay and promotion. The plaintiffs presented statistical evidence that local managers were disproportionately using their discretionary authority to favor men, but they did not present any evidence of an express corporate policy against women. The question before the Court was whether this proposed class met the requirement of commonality, given the different nature of the alleged discrimination faced by each class member. As the Court observed, the class members certainly raised \"common questions\"\u2014for example, \"[d]o all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?\" or \"[d]o all of our managers have discretion over pay?\" or even \"[i]s that an unlawful employment practice?\" Nevertheless, these sorts of questions were, in the view of the Court, insufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement, as \"any competently crafted class complaint literally raises common 'questions.'\"", "Instead, the Court explained that, to satisfy the commonality requirement, a plaintiff must \"demonstrate that the class members 'have suffered the same injury.'\" \"This does not mean merely that\" all of the class members have allegedly \"suffered a violation of the same provision of law.\" Rather, the claims must depend on a common contention that is \"capable of classwide resolution\"; a classwide proceeding must \"generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\" The Court explained that the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart could not satisfy that requirement because, due to the nature of the underlying Title VII claim, \"it w[ould] be impossible to say that examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question of why was I disfavored .\" Because the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart had presented no evidence of a general corporate policy of discrimination, there was no reason to believe that every class member could point to the same common answer. Lower courts have since affirmed that, as in Wal-Mart , a plaintiff generally cannot satisfy the commonality requirement \"where the defendant's allegedly injurious conduct differs from plaintiff to plaintiff.\"", "Nevertheless, \"commonality does not require perfect identity of questions of law or fact among all class members,\" and there is no requirement \"that every question be common\" to the class. To the contrary, \"even a 'single common legal or factual issue can suffice'\" to satisfy the commonality requirement, provided that all class members have suffered from the same injurious conduct. For example, in Su chanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc. , the Seventh Circuit concluded that the district court erred in finding that there was no commonality in a consumer class action involving Keurig-style coffee pods. The defendant in Suchanek sold a product which outwardly resembled the original Keurig-brand coffee pods, but which contained instant coffee rather than fresh coffee grounds. Plaintiffs argued that the packaging was deceptive and sought to certify a class on behalf of all consumers of the defendant's product in several states to resolve the common question of whether the packaging was in fact deceptive. The district court refused to certify the class action due to variation within the class members claims. For example, in the view of the district court, some class members may have purchased different versions of the packaging in question. However, the Seventh Circuit vacated the district court's order denying class certification, explaining that these differences within the proposed class did not preclude certification. The Seventh Circuit explained that all that mattered for commonality was the existence of a question decisive to all class members that was capable of a common resolution. The court concluded that the question of whether the packaging in question was materially misleading to a reasonable person satisfied the commonality requirement because the success of each class member's state law fraud claim depended, at least in part, on the basis of the answer to that question. Nor did it matter for the appellate court that some members of the proposed class were uninjured because, for example, they did not rely on the allegedly deceptive packaging. For the Seventh Circuit, \"[h]ow many (if any) of the class members have a valid claim is the issue to be determined after the class is certified.\" In sum, although Wal-Mart reinforces that Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement is rigorous, cases like Suchanek indicate that the commonality requirement is not an insurmountable barrier to class certification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Typicality (Rule 23(a)(3))", "paragraphs": ["Third, the proposed class representative must satisfy what is known as the \"typicality\" requirement \u2014that is, that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" The primary purpose of the typicality requirement is to ensure that \"the interests of the class and the class representatives are aligned 'so that the latter will work to benefit the entire class through the pursuit of their own goals.'\" A proposed class will generally satisfy the typicality requirement if the class representative's claim against the defendant is based on roughly the same legal and factual basis as the claims of the absent class members that the class representative seeks to represent. \"Representative claims are 'typical' if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.\" Thus, \"even relatively pronounced factual differences\" between the named plaintiff's claims and those of the class members \"will generally not preclude a finding of typicality where there is a strong similarity of legal theories.\"", "Many courts, when evaluating whether a proposed class action satisfies the typicality requirement, also inquire whether the proposed class representative's claim \"arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members.\" In this respect, the typicality requirement \"tend[s] to merge\" with the commonality requirement, which likewise examines whether \"the same conduct or practice by the same defendant gives rise to the same kind of claims from all class members.\" Other courts have suggested that typicality overlaps with the \"adequate representation\" requirement discussed below, which similarly seeks to ensure that representative parties \"adequately protect the interests of the class.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adequate Representation (Rule 23(a)(4))", "paragraphs": ["Fourth, a plaintiff must demonstrate that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" This prerequisite is alternatively known as the \"adequacy of representation\" requirement, the \"adequate representation\" requirement, or just the \"adequacy\" requirement.

Importantly, however, a conflict between the class representative and the absent class members will defeat class certification only if the conflict is \"fundamental to the suit\" and goes \"to the heart of the litigation.\"", "The Supreme Court's opinion in Amchem Prod ucts v. Windsor illustrates this concept. In that case, the plaintiffs sought to certify a settlement-only class consisting of all persons who had either been exposed or who had a family member who was exposed to the defendant's asbestos\u2014a class of unknown size that may well have contained tens of thousands of persons. The action sought to settle all present and future asbestos-related claims that might be brought against the defendant, once and for all, on behalf of this untold number of class members, some of whom were already sick and others of whom were presently uninjured and might never be injured in the future.", "The Supreme Court concluded that this proposed class action could not proceed for a number of reasons, one of which was that the class could not satisfy the adequacy requirement. The proposed class contained both the currently injured and those who might manifest an injury only in the future, leading to a \"serious intra-class conflict.\" In particular, the uninjured plaintiffs had an interest in an \"ample, inflation-protected fund for the future,\" while currently injured plaintiffs had the diametrically opposed interest of \"generous immediate payments.\" Because of these conflicts of interest, the Court concluded that structural assurances of fairness, like separate subclasses with separate representation, were needed to ensure adequate representation. After Amchem , the lower courts have avoided similar conflicts of interest by certifying separate subclasses, each with their own counsel and class representative.", "Not all conflicts, however, require such treatment. Some conflicts are not fundamental, and therefore do not threaten class certification on adequacy grounds. For instance, most courts have agreed that a named plaintiff's eligibility for \"incentive awards that are intended to compensate class representatives for work undertaken on behalf of a class . . . do not, by themselves, create an impermissible conflict between class members and their representatives,\" even if those incentive awards will result in the named plaintiff receiving more money than the absent class members. Because such awards do not dull the named plaintiff's motivation to \"prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class,\" a named plaintiff who stands to receive an incentive award at the conclusion of the litigation will generally be able to adequately represent the class.", "In addition to assessing whether a fundamental conflict renders the named plaintiff unable to adequately represent the absent class members, a few courts also consider whether the proposed class representative \"possess[es] a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding to be capable of 'controlling' or 'prosecuting' the litigation.\" Many other courts, however, \"disfavor . . .

As the Seventh Circuit explained in Eubank v. Pella Corporation , \"[c]lass representatives are . . . fiduciaries of the class members, and fiduciaries are not allowed to have conflicts of interest without the informed consent of their beneficiaries.\" In that case, the court reversed an order certifying a class because the class counsel was the son-in-law of the class representative, leading to a \"grave conflict of interest\" because the class representative had less reason to attempt to constrain the fee to counsel. Other courts have found that representation is inadequate where the named plaintiff was a friend and former business partner with class counsel, or where the named plaintiff was an employee of class counsel.", "However, not every preexisting relationship between class counsel and the named plaintiff is fatal to class certification. In Levitt v. Southwest Airlines Co. , for example, the Seventh Circuit upheld a class where one of the two class representatives was co-counsel with lead class counsel in a separate case. Although the Levitt court reduced the attorney's fee award by $15,000 because the attorney had failed to disclose the conflict, the court nonetheless affirmed the class certification order in part because counsel had successfully obtained a favorable settlement for the class."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)\u2014Additional Requirements for Various Types of Class Actions", "paragraphs": ["\"In addition to the[] four general requirements\" for classes established by Rule 23(a), \"there are additional requirements that must be met depending on the type of class [action] the [plaintiff] seeks to certify.\" \"There are three types of class actions that can be maintained, and Rule 23(b)(1)-(3) specifies the additional requirements that apply to each of them.\" If the proposed class action does not satisfy the requirements of any of those three categories, the court must deny class certification.

not set forth a clear methodology for determining whether a proposed class action satisfies the predominance requirement. Most courts agree that \"[t]he main concern of the predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3) is the balance between\" the \"individual and common\" questions raised by the proposed class action. \"An individual question is one where 'members of a proposed class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member.'\" A common question, by contrast, \"is one where 'the same evidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing [or] the issue is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.'\" A plaintiff may satisfy the predominance requirement if the \"issues that are 'susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof' are 'more prevalent or important'\" to the case than the issues that require individualized proof.", "The Supreme Court has provided general guidelines on predominance. The most significant Supreme Court case on predominance is Amchem , discussed above. There, the Court rejected a class containing all persons who had either been exposed or who had a family member who was exposed to the defendant's asbestos. In considering whether to certify this class, the Court, explaining that the purpose of predominance is to test \"whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,\" held that there were too many questions of too great a significance which were peculiar to the categories of class members and to individual class members for predominance to be met. Specifically, the Court noted the following:", "Class members were exposed to different asbestos-containing products, for different amounts of time, in different ways, and over different periods. Some class members suffer no physical injury . . . each has a different history of cigarette smoking . . . . Differences in state law . . . compound these disparities.", "Amchem thus stands for the proposition that divergent questions on the facts or on the law within the class can defeat predominance. So, for example, many lower courts have held that a proposed class action may violate the predominance requirement if each class member's claim is governed by a materially different set of substantive laws, which can occur when class members who live in different states sue the defendant under different state laws. Where \"variations in state law raise the potential for the application of multiple and diverse legal standards and a related need for multiple jury instructions\" or \"multiply the individualized factual determinations that the court would be required to undertake in individualized hearings,\" those variations may \"overwhelm the ability of the trier of fact meaningfully to advance the litigation through classwide proof\" and thereby defeat predominance.", "However, the lower courts have not concluded that any difference of circumstance or damages within the class automatically means a failure to meet the predominance requirement. For example, the Seventh Circuit suggested that predominance could be satisfied in Suchanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc. , also discussed above. In that case, involving consumers in eight different states who had purchased instant-coffee coffee pods, the class of consumers would have encountered the allegedly deceptive advertising necessarily in a particularized context based on the individual's circumstances, leading to individualized questions on reliance and causation. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the question of whether the advertising was materially misleading could still be resolved on a class basis. The court explained that, because it \"would be a straightforward matter\" to resolve the individualized issues of reliance and causation in \"individualized follow-on proceedings,\" class certification was likely appropriate.", "Similarly, courts have generally confirmed that individualized damages inquiries generally do not preclude class certification. Because \"individual issues of damages\" are often \"easy to resolve because the calculations are formulaic\" and \"district courts have many tools to decide individual damages\" in an efficient manner, individualized damages calculations will rarely eclipse the issues common to all class members. Thus, in most jurisdictions, the plaintiff \"need not show that each member's damages . . . are identical\" in order to obtain class certification.", "Lastly, a few federal appellate courts have held that \"[e]ven if the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these particular issues.\" However, the Fifth Circuit, in its oft-cited opinion in Castano v. American Tobacco Co. , disagreed, stating that Rule 23(c)(4) may not be used to sever particular issues in order to avoid the application of predominance to the entire claim; according to the Fifth Circuit, Rule 23(c)(4) is simply a \"housekeeping rule\" which permits courts to certify particular issues when the class as a whole meets the other requirements of the Rule.

Splits have arisen between the federal courts as to a number of questions, such as the importance of individualized damages to the predominance inquiry and the use of the issue class to segregate the common issues notwithstanding predominance for the claim as a whole. Some commentators and judges (including some Supreme Court Justices in dissent) have argued that the courts have failed to strike the correct balance. Some have maintained that some courts have expanded class action certification beyond the bounds of what should be permissible particularly with respect to classes including both injured and uninjured parties, impermissibly broadening the traditional power of courts. Others disagree and argue that the courts have placed too much emphasis on cohesiveness at the expense of judicial efficiency, suggesting that the class action should be expanded further.", "As passed by the House, FICALA proposes to add several sections to Title 28 of the U.S. Code that would alter this area of class action law. Proposed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716 would bar federal courts from certifying a class seeking monetary relief for personal injury or \"economic loss\" unless the plaintiff demonstrates that \"each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative.\" Every certification order in federal court would have to contain a determination \"based on a rigorous analysis of the evidence presented\" that the plaintiff certified this requirement.

In particular, the Committee Report notes a goal of ensuring that \"similarly injured people\" are grouped in a single class action. The alleged purpose is to prevent \"uninjured class members\" receiving money that could go to those with actual injuries, in order to create \"classes in which those who are most injured receive the most compensation.\" The Committee Report cites Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes as the source of the principle, particularly the Supreme Court's statement that \"a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\" With respect to proposed Section 1720, the Committee Report suggests that the purpose of this provision is to codify the approach to issue classes announced by the Fifth Circuit in Castano v. American Tobacco Co. , discussed above, that a \"district court cannot manufacture predominance\" by segregating the issues it wishes to certify into a separate predominance inquiry\u2014rather, the court must evaluate predominance for the cause of action as a whole.", "Critics of FICALA, including those cited in the Committee Report, have argued that far from protecting absent class members, these provisions would simply lead to fewer individuals being able to obtain relief through class litigation. As these critics point out, the term \"scope of injury\" in proposed Section 1716 is undefined. Furthermore, these critics argue that at the early stage of litigation when class certification is supposed to occur, the exact \"scope\" of an injury cannot be measured with any precision, and the proposed section would effectively require \"a decision on the merits before trial and before appropriate class members can even be identified.\" Because of this structure, FICALA critics argue that uninjured class members, or class members with different injuries, are an inevitable component of class actions, as membership in a class has never equated to an \"entitlement to damages.\" Further, the critics argue that proposed Section 1720 would particularly threaten certain types of civil rights class actions, which can be maintained only as to particular issues such as liability because, as demonstrated in cases like Wal-mart v. Dukes , individualized questions tend to predominate in such suits.", "In some ways, the arguments above echo larger disputes. On the one hand, a relatively broader view of cohesiveness enables courts to provide resolutions for injured class members where they might not otherwise exist. For example, in Nassau County Strip Search Cases , the Second Circuit approved class treatment in a case involving an allegedly unconstitutional blanket strip search policy for Nassau County misdemeanor detainees. By approving class action treatment on the issues of whether the defendants had implemented the policy and whether they were liable for it, the court sidelined the individualized questions relating to whether some class members might have been appropriately searched. Nassau County serves as an example of a case where few of the class members would have had an incentive to seek redress individually for injury they had sustained\u2014in this case, an allegedly unlawful strip search. As such, supporters of relaxation of cohesiveness would likely argue that Nassau County is indicative of why it is necessary to permit otherwise noncohesive classes to proceed and why the change proposed by Section 1717 to issue classes would harm plaintiffs.", "On the other hand, some commentators have argued that resolving the rights of absent class members without a strong element of cohesion threatens the constitutional values of individual rights and separation of powers. According to these commentators, individual rights are threatened because noncohesive class actions undermine an individual's right to a \"day in court.\" Where large classes resolve questions on behalf of absent class members on the basis of an opt-out system, absent class members may be deprived of the individual autonomy rights and the right to control their own cases, a problem that is less severe when classes are highly cohesive. Further, these commentators argue that separation of powers is undermined because the proper role of the courts is to resolve claims that are in front of them\u2014it is the role of legislatures to devise solutions to generalized problems affecting large swaths of society. Where a class action is certified and the class members are not truly cohesive, especially where the damages are small and class members are unlikely to receive a meaningful benefit, courts, in the view of these commentators, act more like legislatures or administrative agencies by disciplining corporations and handing out bounties to class counsel, rather than by redressing individual rights and handing out relief to injured persons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Codifying the Ascertainability Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["The circuit split over ascertainability discussed above has likewise captured the attention of policymakers.

It would also largely codify the words of the Seventh Circuit in Levitt v. Southwest Airlines Co. : \"Our message to the class action bar is short and simple: when in doubt, disclose [potential conflicts].\"", "Proposed Section 1718, on the other hand, proposes significant limitations on the fees that class counsel would be able to obtain. This provision would work a major change. Currently, Rule 23(h) provides that a court may award \"reasonable\" attorney's fees following a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2), which provides that the motion for fees must be made within 14 days after judgment. Class counsel is ordinarily entitled to fees only in cases involving either a common-fund created by the attorney's effort or in cases where substantive law provides for fee shifting. Case law states that a \"reasonable\" fee is determined by a number of factors, which include the benefits obtained by the class. Where the fee is based on a common fund created by the litigation, generally, a reasonable fee extends to a percentage of the fund that is created, including any unclaimed portion. Proposed Section 1718 would change that rule, insofar as percentage recoveries would have to be based on only the recovered portion of the funds actually received, rather than the total fund including any unclaimed portion.", "Further, this section apparently ensures that class counsel cannot collect fees until monetary recovery has been completed. This provision, if enacted, could raise issues in cases where fee awards would potentially be difficult to administer or in class actions where funds are created but the potential beneficiaries are unknown or their injuries are uncertain. An example of such a case is the National Football League's (NFL's) concussion settlement. In that case, the court approved a settlement covering 20,000 retired NFL players, even though the injuries sustained by some of the claimants are not likely to become apparent for some time (if ever), meaning the payment owed to those claimants is unknown. The FICALA provision prohibiting the collection of fees until recovery has been completed raises the question of whether attorneys in such a case would be effectively unable to receive payment from the fund, because it would likely never be known when the distribution to class members is completed. A court may interpret the language in the section\u2014\"until the distribution of monetary recovery to class members\"\u2014in such cases to mean \"until the fund is created,\" but this interpretation is not necessarily obvious.", "The problem that these provisions seek to resolve is a mismatch between the incentives possessed by class counsel and class representatives, particularly with respect to settlements. Once the class is certified, class counsel and defendants could be united in the desire to obtain a quick settlement that resolves all of the claims and pays class counsel. The defendant wants finality and class counsel wants its fees; neither the defendant nor class counsel particularly has an incentive to care if absent class members, at the end of the day, receive any benefit from the funds that are being distributed on their behalf. Unlike in a traditional lawsuit where the client is an active participant, class members are usually absent and unavailable to check class counsel for the same reason that class actions are needed\u2014class members often have a negligible individual stake in the recovery. Sponsors of FICALA assert that consumer class members take the offered compensation in only .023 percent of cases and that class counsel nonetheless frequently obtains seemingly large fee awards. It is this mismatch between the reward obtainable by the attorney and that which flows to his ostensible client which creates the problem.", "Critics of FICALA, however, argue that this mismatch of incentives is an issue that courts have already recognized and attempted to curtail. Current law, as noted above, requires courts to scrutinize class action settlements for fairness to class members. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, courts are aware that \"[t]he structure of class actions under Rule 23 of the federal rules gives class action lawyers an incentive to negotiate settlements that enrich themselves but give scant reward to class members.\" Courts therefore attempt to ensure \"that the settlement secures an adequate advantage for the class in return for\" absent class members giving up their \"litigation rights against the defendants.\" As the Seventh Circuit has colorfully explained, \"a class settlement that results in fees for class counsel but yields no meaningful relief for the class 'is no better than a racket.'\"", "Following this case law, courts have struck down the occasional settlement as unfair. However, some commentators argue that district courts are too lenient and too inclined to approve unfair settlements that pay the attorneys but leave little to nothing for the class. Whether courts have struck the right balance on this question is an open debate, but there is no question that courts are aware of these issues and do scrutinize class action settlements for fairness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
