He defeated the candidate of the long-ruling Colorado Party, Blanca Ovelar, who received 31%, and former military commander Lino Oviedo, who ran as the candidate of the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE). The election was historic, and will end more than 60 years of Colorado Party rule when Lugo is inaugurated on August 15, 2008. For some observers, Lugo's victory is a chance for Paraguay to further strengthen its democratic transition, breaking a link with its authoritarian past.", "While victorious at the polls, President-elect Lugo will face tough challenges when he takes office in August. Most significantly, his ability to govern could be affected by his coalition's lack of a majority in Congress. Another potential difficulty for President Lugo is his ability to deal with entrenched government bureaucracy that essentially been controlled by the long-ruling Colorado Party. Most observers expect that Lugo will govern as a moderate since the electoral alliance that brought him to power is dominated by a center-right party.", "U.S.-Paraguayan relations have been strong, with extensive cooperation on counterterrorism and counternarcotics efforts. After Lugo's victory, U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay James Cason congratulated Lugo and the APC on their victory and expressed a commitment to work and strengthen bilateral relations. The United States remains concerned about illegal activities in the tri-border area with neighboring Argentina and Brazil, such as money-laundering, drugs and arms trafficking, and trade in counterfeit and contraband goods. The protection of intellectual property rights has been a U.S. concern, especially piracy, counterfeiting, and contraband. The United States provided about $12.5 million in aid to Paraguay in FY2007, an estimated $11.6 million in FY2008, and an FY2009 request for $11.8 million, including $3.4 million for a Peace Corps program.

Paraguay's per capita income was $1,400 in 2006, according to the World Bank, one of the lowest in South America, while about 60% of the people live in poverty and 32% live in extreme poverty, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Situation2", "paragraphs": ["The current political context in Paraguay has been shaped by the country's turbulent political history. In the late 19 th century, a two-party system emerged with the formation of the Colorado Party and the Liberal Party, but the Colorado Party soon became the dominant political force, ruling between 1887 and 1904. Paraguay was defeated in the War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870) against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and lost 25% of its territory and over half of its population. This defeat led to an extensive period of political instability, with three civil wars in the first half of the 20 th century and a war with Bolivia between 1932-1935, the Chaco War, that further weakened political institutions and hindered economic development. The Liberals ruled from 1904 until 1940, until the military assumed control with a succession of authoritarian leaders.", "The Colorado Party returned to power in 1946, and has remained in power until the present day, making it the longest-ruling political party in the world. In the late 1940s, the party began to assume greater control over state institutions and the bureaucracy to the point where party membership was a prerequisite for civil service positions and promotion in the military, further perpetuating the Colorado Party's dominance.", "General Alfredo Stroessner, who was a member of the Colorado Party, staged a coup in 1954, and consolidated power in a repressive military dictatorship that lasted 35 years. The key to the Stroessner regime's longevity was an alliance among the military, dominant economic groups, and the Colorado Party. The military regime was characterized by strong political repression, the personalization of authority, ultra-nationalist and anti-communist rhetoric, and widespread corruption. With democratic advances occurring in other South American countries, Stroessner ultimately was overthrown in a 1989 coup and fled to Brazil, where he lived until his death in 2006. In 2004, a Truth and Justice Commission ultimately was set up to investigate human rights abuses that occurred under the Stroessner regime.", "The overthrow of the Stroessner regime initiated a process of democratization, with the enactment of a new constitution in 1992 and competitive elections held for the first time in 1993. Despite the democratic transition, however, many characteristics of the country's extensive period of military rule have persevered. Although opposition parties have held a majority in Congress, the dominance of the Colorado Party has remained intact, including its control over the state apparatus. The political culture has remained a product of the country's authoritarian past with pervasive corruption and clientelism. Nascent democratic institutions have been weak and almost every post-Stroessner President has faced some legal troubles.", "In 1996, Army Commander General Lino Oviedo revolted after President Juan Carlos Wasmosy ordered him to step down. Oviedo resigned, but attempted to run in the 1998 presidential elections as the Colorado Party's candidate. Oviedo's candidacy was nullified after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction and ratified a 10-year prison term for his barracks revolt. Oviedo's running mate, Ra\u00fal Cubas, was elected President in 1998 and defied the Supreme Court by freeing Oviedo from prison as one of his first acts in office. This action led to the initiation of impeachment proceedings against the President, and intensified the rivalry between Vice President Luis Maria Arga\u00f1a and President Cubas and Oviedo. Arga\u00f1a was assassinated in March 1999 and blame was placed on both Cubas and Oviedo, sparking widespread demonstrations and violence in Asunci\u00f3n. President Cubas was forced to resign, and both he and Oviedo fled the country. As a result, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, the president of the Senate, completed the presidential term and attempted to establish a government of national unity, but constant infighting within the coalition led to a weak government that was marred by corruption and inefficiency.", "Nicanor Duarte Frutos of the Colorado Party (National Republican Association or ANR) was elected president on April 27, 2003, defeating Julio C\u00e9sar Franco of the opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA, related to the original Liberal Party) as well as three other candidates in an election that observers judged to be free and fair. The Colorado Party also captured 37 seats in the 80-member Chamber of Deputies, the largest block, and 16 of 45 seats in the Senate, while the largest opposition party, the PLRA, won 21 seats in the lower house and 12 seats in the Senate. Three smaller parties won the remaining seats. During the campaign, Duarte portrayed himself as a strong leader, and he promised to implement widespread institutional reforms, prioritize the fight against corruption and establish a transparent government. As discussed below, President Duarte has enacted reforms that tackle tax evasion and corruption.

President Duarte's measures to combat corruption have included increased penalties for tax evasion and other measures to increase tax revenue, greater oversight of government spending, and a crackdown on the trade of contraband and counterfeit goods. He also removed members of the Supreme Court after corruption allegations surfaced against them. These measures were partially successful, as evident in Transparency International's 2006 corruption perceptions index in which Paraguay ranked 111 out of 163 countries. This ranking was an improvement from 2004 when the country was classified among the six most corrupt countries in the world and the second most corrupt in the Western Hemisphere. For the 2007 index, however, Paraguay dropped to 138 out of 180 countries.

The opposition strongly contested the President's move, however, and he abandoned his re-election efforts.", "There were three major candidates in the presidential race: former minister of education Blanca Ovelar of the long-ruling Colorado Party; Fernando Lugo, the former Roman Catholic Bishop of an impoverished rural diocese, running on an electoral coalition known as the Patriotic Alliance for Change (APC); and former military commander Lino Oviedo, the leader of a failed 1996 coup who was released from prison in early September 2007, running as a candidate of party that he founded, the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE).", "President Duarte supported Ovelar in the fiercely contested Colorado Party's primary elections in December 2007 against former Vice President Luis Castiglioni, a contest that caused deep divisions within the party. After an outbreak of yellow fever in Paraguay, which highlighted the government's inability to attack endemic poverty and health issues, Ovelar's position in the race was seriously weakened, but received a boost, however, when the Colorado Party's well-oiled electoral machinery supported her candidacy and she appeared to gain the reluctant support of some who had supported Luis Castiglioni in the primary. Ovelar received strong support from the Progressive Colorado Movement, and she maintained that her election as the first woman president would be a radical step for Paraguay that would bring real change to the country. Ovelar made combating corruption a central campaign theme, and vowed to create an independent judiciary.", "Lino Oviedo, who returned to Paraguay in 2004 to serve his 10-year prison sentence, was granted conditional release in September 2007, and indicated his desire to be a presidential candidate if court rulings permitted him. In a controversial November 2007 ruling, the Supreme Court absolved Oviedo of plotting a coup to oust then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in 1996, and also annulled any other pending charges against him by the military tribunal that was set up by Wasmosy. Some observers believed that Oviedo's release from prison, followed by these subsequent court decisions, were part of a pact between President Duarte and Oviedo to split the opposition vote in the elections and improve the Colorado Party's chances of retaining power. Oviedo is the founder and leader of UNACE, a political party that he ran from prison. In the presidential campaign, he was viewed as a populist and appealed to the same rural poor constituency that has supported Lugo.", "From February through the election in April 2008, most polls showed Fernando Lugo as the frontrunner, although support for his candidacy decreased gradually. He was endorsed by several left-wing labor unions and social organizations and parties, and most significantly by the conservative Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA), Paraguay's main opposition party. In the aftermath of Oviedo's release, Lugo announced the new APC electoral coalition, which included the PLRA and seven smaller parties. PLRA member Federico Franco became Lugo's vice-presidential running mate.", "In the campaign, Lugo's political discourse emphasized empowering the poor, agrarian reform, health reform, and putting an end to endemic corruption, which he views as emanating from decades of Colorado Party dominance. Lugo also stated that he was open to private capital and a consensus-based development model. As a cornerstone of his candidacy, he also pushed for renegotiating the Itaip\u00fa and Yacyret\u00e1 hydroelectric dam treaties with Brazil and Argentina and wants to raise the price of Paraguay's hydro-energy supplies to these countries. Some of Lugo's opponents accused him of maintaining close ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a charge that Lugo has denied. These accusations resurfaced in 2007 when Paraguayan media reported the existence of a document detailing Ch\u00e1vez's plans for increasing his influence in Paraguay, which included seeking out political leaders that were sympathetic to the \"Bolivarian\" vision for South America.", "Just before the election, it appeared that a high turnout could favor Lugo, although only a few percentage points separated the three major candidates. A poll from April 13, which assumed a turnout of 65%, showed Lugo with 34.5% support, followed by Ovelar with 28.9% and Oviedo with 28.5%. In contrast, a far lower voter turnout was thought to likely favor Ovelar over Lugo, with Oviedo once again in third place. In the lead up to election day, some concerns about potential electoral fraud were voiced by the opposition. They maintained that there the electoral registry had not been comprehensively updated in years, and that the electoral tribunal was dominated by the ruling Colorados.

Most significantly, his ability to government effectively could be affected by his coalition's lack of a majority in Paraguay's Congress. At this juncture, it is unclear what the final party make up will be, but no party or bloc has a majority in either house of Congress, so that Lugo's Patriotic Alliance for Change (APC) will have to work with other parties in order approve legislation. Oviedo's UNACE party could play a pivotal role in the Congress by aligning with either the APC or the Colorados. Lugo will also have to contend with satisfying competing interest within the APC coalition; the conservative PLRA, the party of Vice-President elect Federico Franco, holds the largest bloc of APC seats in Congress. A split within the Colorado Party, between those who supported Ovelar and those who supported Castiglioni, could bode well for Lugo's ability to secure a working coalition in Congress.", "Preliminary results indicate that in the 45-member Senate, the Colorados (National Republican Association or ANR) will have 15 seats; Lugo's APC coalition will have 17 seats, including the largest bloc of 15 seats for the PLRA and 2 for smaller parties in the coalition \u2013 the Party for a Country of Solidarity (PPS) and the Movement for Popular Equality (MPT or Tekojoja); Lino Oviedo's UNACE party will have 10 seats; and the Dear Fatherland Party (PPQ) will have 3 seats.

Other observers, however, stress that Lugo's victory as a chance to further strengthen Paraguay's democratic transition and break its link with the authoritarian past of the Stroessner dictatorship.", "Most analysts expect that Lugo will govern as a moderate. The largest party in Lugo's electoral coalition, the PLRA, is a well-established conservative party. Lugo has described his political views as somewhere between those of Presidents Ch\u00e1vez (Venezuela) and Morales (Bolivia) and the more moderate stances of Presidents Lula (Brazil) and Bachelet (Chile). While Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and other leftist leaders in the region such as Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Ecuador's Rafael Correa welcomed Lugo's victory, most observers contend that Lugo will have to govern more moderately than these leaders since the electoral alliance that brought him to power is dominated by a center-right party. Lugo himself has said that \"I am not of the left, nor of the right. I'm in the middle, a candidate sought by many.\"", "In terms of foreign policy, Lugo, in a post-election interview, asserted that he wants to maintain good relations with all countries, including the United States and Venezuela.
