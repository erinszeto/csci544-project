It proposed that more than40% of the global health budget be spent on HIV/AIDS activities, up substantially from the previousfiscal year. USAID emphasized that HIV/AIDS affects all sectors of societies, and thus it is apriority in global health.

Inits FY2003 global health budget proposal it dedicated more than 40% of its funding to HIV/AIDSactivities, while decreasing spending in most of the other health programs. Some Members ofCongress expressed concern that reserving a significant portion of the global health budget forHIV/AIDS activities without increasing overall global health funding would have left other healthprograms without enough funds. Meanwhile, USAID maintained that in practice the increase in theoverall global health budget was more important than the program in which the funding changesoccurred. (1) Additionally, it asserted that itsintegrative approach would minimize the impact of thelower budget allocations on the other health programs. This report examines U.S. global healthfunding trends since 1999, reviews issues surrounding USAID's decision to funnel much of itsmoney into HIV/AIDS activities, and analyzes current global health spending priorities.", "Global health activities have become a major component of U.S. foreign aid, partially due to growing concern among some policy makers that health could significantly impact economic growth,national security, and political stability in many parts of the world. According to a 2000 CIA report, The Global Infectious Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States , the persistentinfectious disease burden is likely to increase the risk of economic decay, social fragmentation, andpolitical destabilization in the hardest hit countries in the developing and former communist worlds. (2) The report further indicates that the economic costs of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS andmalaria, are already significant and will take a heavy toll on productivity, profitability, and foreigninvestment, possibly reducing GDP by as much as 20% or more by 2010 in some sub-SaharanAfrican countries. (3)", "Infectious diseases could significantly affect not only those abroad, but also Americans at home. According to the CIA report, over the last 30 years, twenty well known diseases, including TB,malaria and cholera, have reemerged or spread geographically, often in more virulent anddrug-resistant forms. Furthermore, at least 30 previously unknown incurable diseases have emergedsince the 1970s. Although infectious diseases do not pose as great of a threat to American securityas they do for other countries they could still have a significant impact. Many infectious diseases,most recently, the West Nile virus, originate outside U.S. borders and are introduced by internationaltravelers, immigrants, returning U.S. military personnel, or imported animals and foodstuffs. TheCIA report predicts that the most dangerous known infectious diseases likely to threaten the UnitedStates over the next two decades will be HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, TB, and new, more lethal variantsof influenza. (4)", "U.S. health programs, for many years, have included programs that aim to thwart the spread of infectious diseases, address the disastrous effects of HIV/AIDS, and bolster the crumbling healthinfrastructures of many developing countries. Members of Congress have become increasinglyaware of the potential dangers of the spread of infectious diseases. Consequently, the priority placedon global health funding within the broad scope of foreign aid has increased significantly since themid 1990s. Congress has been especially supportive, and in many cases the initiator, of increasedhealth spending.", "USAID is the U.S. agency primarily responsible for implementing international health programs.

USAID argued that funding the global healthprograms through the development assistance account would give it greater flexibility in projectimplementation. As in past years, the Administration requested the FY2003 UNICEF contributionthrough the international organization contributions rather than global health funds. Congress haschallenged both of these decisions.

During that hearing Mr. Natsios stated,", "There are a number of things we do in HIV/AIDS which is also something we do in maternal health and in child survival. For example, a mother that has asexually transmitted disease that is pregnant has a very high risk of the kid dying when the child isborn. The survival rate dramatically drops if the woman has an STD when she's pregnant. So partof our child survival strategy is STD strategy. That's also part of our HIV strategy. So a lot of theseprograms in the field are actually integrated together and they have to be or they don't work... Theimportant factor I would point out here in all of these health accounts is the bottom line is up $60million.

USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios noted that while agriculture is vital in countering poverty andsupporting health programs, the trend has been to reduce funding to agricultural programs as otherissues, such as HIV/AIDS and famines demand immediate responses. \"[T]he only way you're goingto reduce poverty in the world and reduce hunger is not by constant humanitarian programs, but byteaching people how to grow more food. And we're not doing that because all of the money hasbeen shifted to accounts where there is more and legitimate interest.\" (15) \"If you have child survivalprojects and you keep kids alive until they're 5 years old - you know what happens after 5? Theybecome malnourished, because the parents are still so poor they can't provide for them. We shouldlook at the countries where we have child survival programs for older kids to see what themalnutrition rates are. They have been disturbingly high.\" (16) U.S. Representative Jerry Lewisconceded that agriculture does impact poverty reduction, good governance, and a host of otherdevelopment issues. \"[I]ndeed, I've felt for many, many years it's very difficult to talk to developingcountries about democracy and freedom and peace, and indeed terrorism, if their children go to bedwith their stomachs hurting every night.\" (17)", "Although some may like to see some of the foreign assistance money spent on other development assistance activities, Chairman Kolbe described the difficulty that many in Congressfaced while considering the President's request. \"If Congress fully funds the HIV/AIDS request thatthe president has made, it's going to have to be something reduced somewhere else: economicgrowth, agriculture, trade. That happens, the advocates of trade promotion, basic education,microcredit, all of which are represented before this committee, are going to face some toughchoices.

It has maintained its support for infectious diseases, and has funded the programs aboverequested levels. In FY1998, the Senate and House Subcommittees on Foreign Operations expressedconcern that USAID had not placed enough emphasis on combating the spread of infectiousdiseases. (20) Recognizing the correlation betweenHIV/AIDS and TB, in FY2001, the House andSenate Subcommittees on Foreign Operations urged USAID to increase its activities related toHIV/AIDS and TB prevention, as well as those that seek to treat and prevent sexually transmitteddiseases. They also recognized the promising results of microbicide research and urged USAID toincrease its work in that area. (21) Still later theHouse Subcommittee on Foreign Operations expressedconcern in FY2002 that USAID had not placed enough emphasis on halting emerging epidemics.

RepresentativeJesse Jackson stated, \"I am concerned with what the Administration has proposed to thissubcommittee regarding international health. The Administration's budget cuts funding for TB,malaria, and child survival programs, all programs I believe Congress strongly supports, and wrapsup the stand-alone child survival and health account, created by my good friend from Alabama,Sonny Callahan, into development assistance accounts. I think some of the increases we are makingin our bilateral contributions for HIV/AIDS is a good first step. But, it seems to me that we aresimply robbing Peter to pay Paul. Could you explain to us why we're not growing all the globalhealth accounts equally?\" (24)", "Although many in Congress also deem countering the spread of HIV/AIDS a priority, they differ from the Administration in that they do not want to boost HIV/AIDS funding at the expenseof other health programs. Congressional support for HIV/AIDS programs is illustrated by theinclusion of additional funding for HIV/AIDS through the FY2002 supplemental, H.R. 4775 .

(26) At aneconomic forum held in Waco, Texas on August, 13, 2002, the President announced that he wouldnot obligate the contingency funding because he felt that the government needed to practice fiscaldiscipline. Some Democrats reportedly said that they perceived the action as \"a White House effortto portray the withholding of the funds as a struggle between the President and Democrats, eventhough the appropriations had broad Republican support.\" (27) Critics also accused the President ofblocking funding to his own programs. The President acknowledged that he supported some of theinitiatives in the contingency package, however he said that he would request support for hispriorities, including HIV/AIDS from the FY2003 appropriations.

The President requested that the money be shared equally between HHS and the USAID. Congressfunded this initiative in FY2003.
