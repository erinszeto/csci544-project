As part of recent concerns, a December 2008 Intelligence Community Assessment highlighted global threats posed to U.S. citizens and interests by increasing infectious diseases and other health problems originating outside U.S. borders, including in Eurasia. The assessment and estimate warned that increased political, military, social, and economic disorder in the Eurasian states could be worsened by the spread of disease and declining health, thereby setting back their democratic and free market reforms, and that such instability might further complicate U.S. arms control cooperation, efforts to contain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and trade relations. In addition, the assessment and estimate cautioned that Eurasian militaries and populations could face increased ill-health, harming the national security of the Eurasian states and diminishing the effectiveness of the militaries in international peacekeeping.

The report warned that U.S. joint missions with the armed forces of Russia could be compromised if Russian troops were not able to perform adequately because of poor health. Faltering healthcare and rising levels of infectious disease and non-infectious conditions could contribute to economic decline, increased authoritarianism, and regime instability in Eurasian and other developing countries.

The House Congressional Global Health Caucus was founded in 2005 to provide a bipartisan forum for discussions. Much attention in Congress has been focused on the threat infectious diseases pose in Africa, but attention has broadened to include health problems in Eurasia and other regions. Members of the House Banking Committee ( H.Rept. 106-548 ), in reporting the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-264 ), cited the January 2000 NIE to the effect that increases in HIV/AIDS were threatening Eurasia and Asia as well as Africa. On the appropriations side, Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2001 ( P.L. 106-429 ) for the first time allocated a small amount ($6 million) from the Child Survival and Disease Programs (CSD) fund to combat infectious diseases in Eurasia, and these amounts have since increased.

Total U.S. aid budgeted for FY1992-FY2010 for health programs in Eurasia was less than 5% of about $35.3 billion of all aid for Eurasia (excluding the value of privately-donated cargoes). Health aid has been dwarfed by that provided for democratization, economic reform, and arms control. However, after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and other events heightened U.S. concerns about U.S. vulnerabilities, including global health issues, a somewhat greater percentage of foreign assistance for Eurasia has consisted of health aid.

The health of Soviet citizens lagged behind that of U.S. and other Western populations in terms of access to many new medical procedures and medicines and even in terms of prosaic measures such as the number of hospitals with plumbing and heat. The healthcare system emphasized a large number of specialized medical facilities with large staffs and prolonged hospitalizations, rather than primary and preventive care, including regular check-ups. The healthcare system was isolated from changing world standards of treatment of diseases such as TB, it followed secretive practices that prevented the operation of a competent disease surveillance system, and it suffered from a lack of medical supplies and equipment outside of the major medical centers. The emphasis on specialized and hospital care meant that primary care and early diagnosis were starved of funds. After the Eurasian states gained independence, the new international borders separated many medical industries from their customers in other countries and required the re-negotiation of business relations that are still not wholly satisfactory.", "Despite this shared legacy, the Eurasian states emerged from the Soviet collapse with varying health situations. Some of the Eurasian states had better healthcare facilities and healthier populations than others. Many observers have viewed Central Asia's population as having suffered the most from inadequate healthcare during the Soviet period. The Western Eurasian states had older populations than the Central Asian states at the time of the Soviet collapse, reflecting differences in fertility and mortality. Environmental catastrophe affected health in several regions, including the Chernobyl area (radiation fallout in Ukraine and Belarus), Chelyabinsk area (radiation contamination in Russia and Kazakhstan), Semipalatinsk (radiation from nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan) and the Aral Sea area (desertification in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan). The Eurasian states also differed in their rates of economic decline during the 1990s. The extent to which decreases occurred in related areas varied as well, such as healthcare funding, the diets of the people, and living conditions, all of which affected morbidity and mortality. Conflicts in Eurasia also damaged health, leading to casualties, injuries, orphans, and displaced persons who suffered physically and psychologically.", "In the post-Soviet era, demographers have been able to scrutinize previously suppressed health data and conduct analyses that suggest that some aspects of the health crisis in Russia and other Eurasian states can be traced back to the 1960s. A major indicator of overall health, life expectancy, peaked in the 1960s and began a downward trend in Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union by the late 1960s. This downward trend has been linked by research to an increase in alcoholism, violence, tobacco use, and poor diets. Another peak occurred in the mid-1980s, mostly attributed to government restrictions on alcohol consumption. ", "Most observers agree that in the early years after the Soviet Union collapsed, there were major declines in health in virtually all Eurasian states in terms of such measures as infant mortality, alcoholism, and cardiovascular disease. The Central Asian states suffered the greatest declines in Eurasia in life expectancy, increased morbidity, deterioration of conditions in hospitals and other health facilities, and failures to control and prevent infectious diseases. In the late 2000s, health conditions have improved in some respects, but by many measures\u2014including life expectancy, under-5 and maternal mortality, TB rates, HIV/AIDS rates, and alcoholism (in the Western NIS), the Eurasian countries continue to lag behind most developed countries.", "According to one USAID report that ranked Eastern European and Eurasian states in terms of various health factors, all the Eurasian states except Belarus ranked among the bottom one-half of the 28 countries considered. The most vulnerable countries were Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Such poor health conditions, USAID warned, \"diminish society's productive capacity, deteriorates the strength of civil society, and tarnishes people's perceptions of the benefits of democracy and free-market economies. Poor health is, therefore, not only a threat in its own right; it is a threat to economic and democratic progress.\"", "Health challenges in all the Eurasian states loom larger because of the very low percentages of gross domestic product (GDP) they have devoted to healthcare. Table 3 shows GDP per capita in the Eurasian states and the percent going to health. Health spending levels are low in the Eurasian states in comparison to the 8.5% on average spent in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (OECD; composed mostly of European countries and the United States), except for Georgia, where the percentage of spending virtually matches the OECD percentage. ", "Soon after he came to power in Russia in 2000, then-President Putin began dedicating more budgetary resources to address health problems. A National Health Project, one of four National Priority Projects, was launched in 2005 as the centerpiece of his effort to improve healthcare. Pay for doctors and nurses was boosted, new equipment for medical centers was provided, and the number of ambulances was increased. With the injection of added funds from the National Priority Health Program, healthcare spending in Russia in 2006 finally rose above the level of such spending during the Soviet period.", "In late 2007, President Putin issued a decree to implement a Concept for a Demographic Policy for the Russian Federation up to 2025 that called for an increase in life expectancy to 75 years of age and increases in childbirth and immigration. Through these means, it is hoped that Russia's population will stabilize at 142-143 million by 2015 and will increase to 145 million by 2025. These hopes may be unrealistic, since even Russia's State Statistical Agency forecasts that the population will decline to less than 136 million by 2025. The Concept may be relying on an unlikely surge in non-ethnic Russian immigration, which many ethnic Russians oppose. In late 2008, a Russian government commission released an associated Healthcare Development Concept to 2020 that called for improving the quality of medical care; educating people to adopt healthy lifestyles; reversing the decline of the population; and increasing life expectancy. To achieve these goals, the Concept called for increasing the provision of medicines; reducing out-of-pocket expenses for medical care; boosting the qualifications of healthcare personnel and creating a system of incentives to ensure high-quality work; and providing exercise and sports facilities and taking other measures to facilitate healthy lifestyles. Summing up the 2009 results of the National Health Project, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov announced in early 2010 that the size of the population for the first time in fifteen years grew slightly; that life expectancy increased by 1.2 years to over 69 years for both sexes; that mortality rates for most diseases decreased; that the number of deaths caused by alcohol poisoning fell by 32%; that a pilot program had resulted in fewer road deaths; and that healthcare for infants had improved. ", "At a government meeting in mid-April 2010, Prime Minister Putin stated that he had \"dramatically increased\" healthcare spending from 225.4 billion rubles in 2000 to 1.5 trillion rubles in 2009. He stressed, however, that healthcare problems still existed, as indicated by the low level of public satisfaction with healthcare, regional disparities in the funding and availability of healthcare, inefficient spending on unnecessary hospitals, out-of-pocket expenses for necessary procedures, and inadequate outpatient and preventative care. In his state of the government address to the legislature on April 20, 2010, Putin announced that he was boosting funds for the National Health Project.", "Faltering healthcare in Central Asia has been reflected in decreasing life spans, high infant and maternal mortality rates, and increases in cardiovascular/circulatory, parasitic, infectious, and respiratory diseases. While the spread of TB and hepatitis in Central Asia is most worrisome, the U.N. office coordinating U.N. interagency and international aid efforts on HIV/AIDS (the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS) has pointed to rising HIV prevalence (the number of people living with HIV) in Kazakhstan and elsewhere in Central Asia as a global concern. Poor sanitation and increasing drug abuse, tobacco and alcohol use, malnutrition, diet deficiencies, and tainted blood supplies contribute to declining health. Healthcare reforms have focused on making the healthcare system more efficient by closing excess hospitals and on obtaining more funding through taxes and payroll deductions. The latter efforts have faltered, resulting in a heavy reliance on user fees for service. Kyrgyzstan has made the most progress in healthcare reform (though its fragile economy places them at risk), and Tajikistan and Turkmenistan the least.

There are large gaps between average life expectancy for males and females in Eurasia and life expectancy in OECD countries. There is a twelve-year deficit between the average male lifespans in Eurasian and OECD countries, and a ten-year deficit between female lifespans in Eurasian and OECD countries. According to most demographers, major factors accounting for these deficits in life expectancy in the Eurasian countries include higher rates of heart-related disorders, cancers, and injuries, while infectious diseases account for a smaller portion in most of the states. Alcoholism underlies many diseases and injuries, and helps explain the large gap in mortality rates between men and women. Accidents or violence and alcohol poisoning accounted for the most alcohol-related deaths, but alcohol contributed to many diseases as well, such as heart disease, liver disease and certain cancers.", "USAID estimates that mortality rates over the period from 1990-2007 for children under five years of age declined significantly in Moldova and Tajikistan and somewhat less in the rest of Eurasia. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan had the highest rates of under-5 child mortality in Eurasia.

Rates of maternal mortality\u2014the death of women during pregnancy, childbirth, or in the immediate period after delivery\u2014also are much higher in the Eurasian states than in most other European countries. Maternal mortality rates have declined in recent years in all the Eurasian states except Georgia. Causes of maternal mortality likely would include poor nutrition, lack of maternal care, and high rates of abortion. According to the World Bank, the Eurasian countries are unlikely to meet Millennium Development Goals (targets for development from 2000 until 2015) for child and maternal mortality.

In 2006, the Russian government launched a plan to budget $1.3-1.7 billion annually for ten years to boost the birthrate and reduce abortions, including by providing free care at maternity hospitals, increasing childcare benefits, permitting 18 months of partially paid maternity leave, and building new prenatal centers.

In an effort to strengthen regional responses to the continued increase in HIV prevalence, the CIS prime ministers in November 2008 approved a 2009-2013 program that called for all CIS countries to establish single national AIDS programs with unified monitoring and evaluation systems. The program also urged greater efforts to enhance access to free, voluntary, and confidential HIV counseling and testing and to bolster prevention programs for young people and populations at higher risk. The CIS program is supported by UNAIDS.", "Seeming to illustrate problematic data reporting, Turkmenistan's deputy minister of health reportedly boasted in October 2009 that the country had opened an HIV prevention clinic, but that \"to our great happiness, not a single case of HIV has been reported anywhere in the country.\" In Uzbekistan, the chairman of the trustees' council of the Sen Yolgiz Emassan (You Are Not Alone) state child foundation, President Karimov's daughter Lola Karimova, has directed HIV prevention efforts for youth. UNICEF has supported some of these efforts.

In all of the Eurasian states, demand reduction efforts are inadequate, according to the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, because of inadequate budgets, inadequate treatment services, and a lack of focus on drug use prevention by officials. ", "Drug treatment is poor or lacking in most of Eurasia, and where available, often entails involuntary confinement after arrest. Laws are mostly aimed at interdiction and punishment of drug traffickers and users, and drug users avoid seeking treatment out of fear of arrest. Where available, treatment mostly consists of detoxification with little or no follow-up rehabilitation efforts. For instance, OST pilot programs have been introduced in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, and partially scaled-up programs have been implemented in Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine, but access remains limited. Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan still do not provide OST. ", "Since 2000, drug use in Russia has increased steadily, dominated by heroin and other opiates. In 2004, Russia enacted a new law\u2014which amended a 1998 Russian narcotics law that mandated the involuntary commitment of drug users\u2014to in principle permit drug treatment options to imprisonment. However, law enforcement has continued to emphasize imprisonment and the healthcare system resists OST. In late 2005, the government launched a program to reduce the total number of drug users by up to 20% by 2010 by cracking down on drug traffickers, but these efforts have appeared to fail. The U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime stated in late 2009 that the rate of heroin and opium use in Russia is the second highest in the world (first is China), about 1.7 million users, and that one out of three overdose deaths worldwide occurs in Russia. In March 2010, Russia's Federal Narcotics Control Service reported that there were 550,000 registered drug addicts, and that 30,000 Russians die each year from overdoses. It termed the addiction and overdose rates a national security problem. Russia increasingly has demanded that the United States and NATO combat drug production in Afghanistan as a primary mission.", "In Eurasia, drug treatment programs have struggled to meet burgeoning needs. According to the State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report :", "In Armenia, a Drug Detoxification Center, part of the Narcological Clinic, provides short-term drug treatment. Two new drug treatment facilities opened in 2009, one of which is part of the prison hospital system. These new facilities should help alleviate the lack of long-term treatment and counseling that previously limited the success of treatment efforts. In 2009 the Narcological Clinic began offering methadone substitution treatment. In Belarus, drug addicts are generally treated in psychiatric hospitals or at 21 outpatient narcotics clinics, either as a result of court remand or self enrollment. Addicts are also treated in prisons. On the whole, treatment emphasizes detoxification over stabilization and rehabilitation. Three OST clinics are operated by the Ministry of Health, and serve several hundred addicts. There are at least twelve small-scale NGO-run rehabilitation centers. On the whole, availability and quality of services have improved somewhat. NGO-run centers provide fee rehabilitation services to both registered and anonymous drug addicts, while government-run centers provide similar services for free, but only to registered addicts. Because the official drug addict registry is readily available to Belarusian law enforcement agencies, drug addicts still often avoid seeking treatment. In Georgia, demand for detoxification and substitution therapy far outstrips supply. In addition to current NGO-supported OST centers, which treat approximately 450 patients, the government opened six new treatment centers in 2009. These centers co-finance OST with clients and serve approximately 1,200 patients. A pilot methadone program began in the penitentiary system in 2008. In Kazakhstan, a pilot project to test methadone therapy was launched in two cities in 2009, and 29 heroin addicts, including 11 that were HIV-positive, took part. In Kyrgyzstan, insufficient funding is hampering prevention and treatment programs and training of professional staff. Programs providing treatment for drug users are conducted by state institutions in partnership with civil sector organizations. UNODC also supports a number of drug treatment assistance programs. In Moldova, there is no formally structured, integrated approach to treatment for drug addiction. The after-care and reintegration system is underdeveloped. Detoxification is available in two government medical institutions on an out-patient basis. A few private healthcare institutions are also authorized to offer detoxification treatment. Detoxification services are included under the National Health Insurance Fund for insured people. Uninsured persons must pay for detoxification. If anonymity is desired, insured patients must go to private healthcare institutions and pay out-of-pocket. Some NGOs offer rehabilitation and reintegration programs free-of-charge on an anonymous basis. In Turkmenistan, the Ministry of Health operates seven drug treatment clinics. Addicts can receive treatment at these clinics without revealing their identity and all clinic visits are kept confidential. Drug addiction is a prosecutable crime and persons convicted are subject to jail sentences, although judicial officials usually sentence addicts to treatment. In Ukraine, the government has implemented pilot OST programs using buprenorphine and is shifting to methadone treatment and is expected to cover up to 20,000 addicts in 111 clinics countrywide by 2013.

Declining health in the military and security forces can harm their ability to combat terrorism and drug trafficking, to ensure the safety and security of weapons of mass destruction, and otherwise to defend the territorial integrity of the states. If the military forces are less capable of carrying out these missions, then U.S. border, customs, and security aid (recently boosted by the Administration and Congress), may be less effective than anticipated, according to this argument.

Also, there may be a need to consider longer-term health aid commitments, particularly if U.S. assistance is targeted more to healthcare institution-building and reform efforts that aim to bolster the ability of the Eurasian states to meet their own needs. ", "In recent years, FREEDOM Support Act authorized health assistance has been supplemented by funding from other accounts, seemingly reflecting a greater recognition of specific health needs in Eurasia. The regional states have received $84.2 million from the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund (CSH) account since FY2001 and $13.5 million from the Global HIV/AIDS initiative since FY2005. In addition, Russia and Ukraine received $2.2 million in Economic Support Funds devoted to healthcare improvements in FY2004. ", "Other analysts urge Congress to alter the distribution of aid among the Eurasian states. Between FY1992 and FY2008, the largest aid amounts have gone to Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Much less health assistance has been provided to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, and Turkmenistan. Some experts maintain that this distribution of aid is not clearly matched to the health status of the states. Instead, a number of considerations seem to influence decision-making on the distribution of aid besides targeting it to the most needy Eurasian states, including the degree to which aid should be targeted to the closest or most strategic U.S. friends or to the most democratic and market-oriented states. Such determinations are complicated by the added desirability of targeting U.S. aid to Eurasian states where governments are receptive, honest, and efficient at carrying out healthcare reforms, although these conditions are scarcely met in any of the Eurasian states. In Russia and other Eurasian states, many critics charge, the governments are highly corrupt, inefficient, and not focused on health budgets, policies, and stewardship. In such conditions, U.S. and international medical assistance to the Eurasian states risks being undermined or redirected for political purposes. In some cases, Eurasian governments have blocked medical as well as other humanitarian aid to civilians for political and military purposes (such as in Chechnya), using it as a weapon to bring populations and separatist movements into line. To help circumvent problems with governments, some observers have argued that U.S. health aid should focus more on high-quality indigenous health-related NGOs in Eurasia, to ensure that aid is used properly and to strengthen long-term self-help capabilities, while others caution that in most of Eurasia, such local NGOs are still hard to find.", "Among possibly clashing U.S. aid objectives, U.S. health aid shifted to disaster assistance or to IDPs and refugees in an Eurasian state may shortchange health aid support for the rest of a country's population. This problem was avoided in the wake of the August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict by providing supplemental funding for Georgia and directing that already allocated aid could not be reprogrammed without notification. USAID family planning programs in Eurasia must comply with policy promoting maternal health and the provision of modern contraception methods that counteract the inordinately high rates of abortion throughout the region. ", "USAID has argued that while most Eurasian states have made at least some progress in health sector reform in recent years, a few have witnessed worsening health conditions since the early 1990s, and it will take several more years before they are ready to have such aid phased out. In a 2007 report analyzing the health situation in Europe and Eurasia, USAID judged Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia as the countries where health status was the poorest and where democratization and the transition to free markets appeared to be most vulnerable to setbacks because of health problems. Although public expenditures on health had increased in Eurasia over the years, they were still low relative to needs and contributed to a low supply of medicines, low quality of services, and low salaries for health workers, according to USAID."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
