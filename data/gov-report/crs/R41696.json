Unless the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense is greater, the organization's base fine is pegged at one of 33 levels corresponding to its offense level \u2013 from $5,000 for an offense level of 6 or less to $72.5 million for an offense level of 38 or more. ", "The applicable fine range is then ascertained by multiplying the amount of the base offense level by minimum and maximum factors determined by the organization's culpability score. The lowest multiplier range is .05 to 0.2, and the highest 2.0 to 4.0. The Guidelines then articulate 11 factors to be considered when deciding where within the applicable range a corporation ought to be fined. The existence of an ethics and compliance program is perhaps the most distinctive factor on the list. The program, whose specifics are detailed at great length in an earlier guideline, is designed to demonstrate an organization's managerial commitment to operate in a lawful manner.", "Guidelines insist upon disgorgement when this calculation is insufficient to account for the entity's financial gain after restitution and remedial costs have been paid. A court may reduce the fine called for by the Guidelines in light of a defendant organization's inability to pay. It may also adjust the fine to be imposed in consideration of a number of other factors, some aggravating, others mitigating. For instance, the fines of a closely held entity may be offset by fines imposed upon its owners. Other mitigating factors include the extent of organizational assistance to prosecutors; the fact the entity is a governmental body; the extent to which the innocent members or beneficiaries of the entity will have to bear the burden of the fine; the fact that the applicable remedial costs greatly exceed the gain associated with the organization's offense; and an exceptionally low level of culpability, marked for instance by the presence of a compliance program. Factors that may warrant an increase in the amount of the fine to be imposed include the risk of physical injury; the threat to national security, the environment, or a particular economic market; the involvement of official corruption; and the absence of a prior compliance program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Example", "paragraphs": ["The PSI [Presentence Report]: (1) assigned PUGH [Roland Pugh Construction, Inc.] a base offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a72c1.1(A)(2003); (2) added 2 levels because the offense involved more than one bribe, pursuant to \u00a72c1.1(b)(1); and (3) added 22 levels because the net profit to PUGH was between $20 million and $50 million, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a72C1.1(b)(2)(A) and 2B1.1, yielding a total offense level of 34. Under the \u00a7 8C2.4(d) table, this total offense level of 34 required a base fine amount of $28.5 million.", "However, the PSI determined PUGH's pecuniary gain under \u00a7 8C2.4(a)(2) was its $47.92 million profit from the County contracts. Under \u00a7 8C2.4(a), the base fine amount became $47.92 million, because PUGH's $47.92 million pecuniary gain was greater than the $28.5 million amount from the \u00a7 8C2.4(d) fine table and greater than the pecuniary loss of $319,425 suffered by the victim County.", "The PSI determined PUGH's culpability score was 7 under \u00a7 8C2.5, because (1) PUGH had 50 or more employees and (2) individuals with substantial authority (Board Chairman Roland Pugh, CEO Grady Pugh, and President Yessick) participated in the offenses. This culpability score of 7 resulted in a minimum fine multiplier of 1.4 and a maximum multiplier of 2.8, under \u00a7 8C2.6. Based on these multipliers and the base fine of approximately $47.92 million, the PSI calculated the guidelines fine range to be $67,089,446.48 to $134,178,892.96.", "The statutory maximum fine was $95,842,066, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a73571(b), (d) ( i.e., double the pecuniary gain of $47.92 million). Thus, the PSI concluded PUGH's advisory guidelines fine range was $67,089,446 to $95,842,066.", "The PSI stated PUGH appeared unable to pay a fine within that $67 million to $95 million guidelines range and recommended the district court reduce the fine if it determined PUGH was unable to pay the minimum fine amount. The PSI noted that, under \u00a7 8C3.4, the guidelines fine could be offset by 67.75%, because (1) PUGH was a closely held organization, (2) three of PUGH's owners (Roland Pugh, Yessick, and Grady Pugh) whose total interests amounted to 67.75% had already been fined for the same offense conduct, and (3) one owner (Andy Pugh) had a 32.25% interest and was not convicted in the bribery scheme....", "The district court found that PUGH made its first bribe in August 1999 and its final bribe in September 2002. The court found that (1) from September 1, 1999 to December 31, 2002, PUGH benefitted from the bribes, (2) during this 1999-2002 period PUGH generated from its County contracts a total profit of $43,985,869, and (3) given PUGH's $107,887,832 in revenues, this $43,985,869 profit was a 40.77% profit margin during that period. Using that profit to calculate the base fine amount, the district court determined the guidelines fine range was $61,580,216 to $87,971,738. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a78C2.5, 8C2.7. After considering PUGH's ability to pay, the district court reduced the fine to $21 million. The district court then gave a $1.6 million offset for fines paid by individuals who owned at least 5% of PUGH, which resulted in a final fine of $19.4 million.
