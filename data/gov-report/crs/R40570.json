One of the reasons why a foreign national might be deemed inadmissible is on health-related grounds. The diseases that trigger inadmissibility in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) are those communicable diseases of public health significance as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "Currently there are seven diseases deemed a communicable disease of public health significance: chancroid, gonorrhea, granuloma inguinale, infectious leprosy, lymphogranuloma venereum, active tuberculosis, and infectious syphilis. Other diseases incorporated by reference are cholera; diphtheria; infectious tuberculosis; plague; smallpox; yellow fever; viral hemorrhagic fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American, and others not yet isolated or named); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); and \"[i]nfluenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic.\" The INA also renders inadmissible foreign nationals who are not vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccinations are statutorily required for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza type B and hepatitis B. Vaccinations against other diseases may also be required if recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP).", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in HHS take the lead in protection against communicable diseases among foreign nationals who come to the United States.

The physicians enter into written agreements with the consular posts to perform the examinations according to HHS regulations and guidance. Foreign nationals in the United States who are adjusting to legal permanent resident status are tested by civil surgeons designated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). CDC, in conjunction with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in DHS, operates 20 quarantine stations and has health officials on call for all ports of entry.", "From an immigration standpoint, an outbreak of an infectious disease places substantial procedural and resource pressures on CBP, which is charged with screening admissions of all travelers at land, sea, and air ports of entry (POE). CBP officers screened approximately 362 million individuals in FY2013 for admissions into the United States. CBP works in conjunction with the CDC to monitor travelers and attempt to contain any diseases that may be spread by travelers coming from abroad. In the current context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas with Ebola, and not screening at POEs in the United States. At this point, CDC assures that Ebola poses little risk to the U.S. general population.", "Congress has acted legislatively on the health-related grounds for exclusion several times in the recent past.

Moreover, they must also not be deemed inadmissible according to specified grounds in the INA. One of the reasons why a foreign national might be deemed inadmissible is on health-related grounds.", "While grounds for exclusion based on health-related criteria have long existed in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), some have questioned whether these provisions are sufficient to deal with a potential pandemic situation. Potential issues for Congress are at least three-fold: (1) Are the health-related grounds for exclusion updated to ensure public safety in regards to contagious diseases? (2) Would increasing restrictions on foreign travel (even temporarily) during potential pandemics inflict more of an economic harm than a benefit? (3) Are the resources provided for frontline agencies charged with screening foreign travelers adequate to identify potentially infected travelers?", "The Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) each play key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens.

When the various immigration and citizenship laws were unified and codified as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), the health-related grounds were seven of 31 grounds for exclusion. One of these seven health-related grounds specified that aliens \"afflicted with any dangerous contagious disease\" would be excluded from the United States.", "The Immigration Amendments Act of 1990 streamlined and modernized all of the grounds for inadmissibility into nine broad categories.

This revision does not, however, entitle foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS to receive visas to enter the United States. On September 29, 2008, the DHS announced the publication of a final rule that grants consular officers the authority to grant nonimmigrant visas to otherwise eligible applicants who are HIV-positive and meet certain requirements. Visas issued under the final rule do not publicly identify any traveler as HIV-positive. The HIV-waiver final rule applies to foreigners who are HIV-positive and seek to enter the United States as visitors for up to 30 days.

These developments have caused agencies such as the CDC to implement instructions and preparedness plans for screening and handling travelers to the United States infected with TB. About one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis , the bacterium that causes TB. The vast majority have so-called \"latent TB\" infections and are not contagious. A small percentage (approximately 9 million people) have \"TB disease;\" more than 1 million of them die from the disease each year. Many but not all persons with TB disease are contagious and can transmit the disease to others. Many persons with latent TB infections never experience TB disease, although latent infections can progress to disease at any time. ", "The processing of Hmong refugees located in Thailand was temporarily halted in 2005 to ensure that the refugees had completed treatment for infectious tuberculosis before they came to the United States. Additional concerns were raised in Spring 2007 when two individuals with drug-resistant TB disease were requested flagged by HHS for CBP interdiction. Despite this call for interdiction, both individuals were able to enter the United States through ports of entry. These incidents resulted in a reassessment of federal coordination and response regarding TB and other contagious diseases. ", "Almost 10,000 cases of TB disease were reported in the United States in 2013. Almost 65% of these cases were among foreign-born persons; the case rate among foreign-born persons was approximately 13 times higher than among U.S.-born persons. Although the number of cases of TB disease has been on the decline among both U.S.-born and foreign-born persons, the proportion of cases among the foreign-born has risen steadily since 1993.", "As discussed below, medical screening for tuberculosis is required of all refugees and foreign nationals seeking LPR visas to live in the United States. However, CBP does not currently have any special provisions outside of its general procedures for TB screening at ports of entry. The majority of TB disease cases reported in the United States among foreign-born persons have been attributed to reactivation of latent TB infection acquired previously, with the rate reflecting TB incidence in their countries of origin. Therefore, most of these persons would not have been ineligible for visas on health-related grounds, and would not have been symptomatic of the disease at the time of their arrival at a port of entry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medical Examinations for Visas", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in HHS take the lead in protection against communicable diseases among foreign nationals who come to the United States.

Foreign nationals are generally tested at their own expense, though the costs for refugees are covered by the U.S. government. If there is reason to suspect an infection, applicants for temporary admission as nonimmigrants (such as tourists, business travelers, temporary workers, and foreign students) are tested at the discretion of the consular officer or admitting CBP inspector.

In general, the medical reports are valid for one year.", "Mere presence of one of the designated diseases does not always lead to exclusion. After a visa applicant is found to be afflicted with TB disease, for example, the consular officer or USCIS adjudicator is to request the medical examiner to determine whether the tuberculosis is Class A (infectious), Class B-1 (clinically active, not infectious) Class B-2 (not clinically active) or Class B-3 (old or healed tuberculosis).

The vast majority of admissions into the United States occur at the land border, where local and regional economies are dependent upon the movement of goods and people across the border to maintain economic viability. From the perspective of the CBP, the most significant challenge in screening for infectious diseases comes at the land border. Even without medical screening or other special circumstances, land borders can build up inspection lines that are several hours long due to the high demand for crossings and inadequate infrastructure at most POEs to accommodate such crossings.", "As noted above, the CDC is the lead agency charged with protection against communicable diseases and is responsible for providing the technical instructions to civil surgeons and panel physicians who conduct medical examinations for immigration. CDC officials are not present at the border on a day-to-day basis, but there are quarantine stations located in a number of international airports and near a few land ports of entry (for a full list, see Appendix A ). However, these 20 stations constitute a small fraction of the 329 ports of entry operated by CBP. Even fully staffed quarantine stations are not in a position to perform routine health screening on all passengers crossing the border as a standard operating procedure.", "Rather than staffing all the POEs, the CDC, through their Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), train CBP inspectors to watch for ill persons and items of public health concern.

CBP officers suspect an individual may need medical attention or may pose a public health risk to others (e.g., individual exhibits obvious signs and symptoms of illness, such as fever, weakness, or both, as observed by officers). CBP officers encounter an individual who is an exact match to a public health alert in Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS II) and may pose a public health risk to others.

Each port of entry, according to GAO, is supplied with personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and inspecting officers must use this equipment in dealing with travelers suspected of having communicable or quarantinable illnesses, as well as while handling the individuals' documents and belongings. CBP officers are responsible for coordinating with CDC to provide assistance in identifying arriving individuals from areas with known communicable disease outbreaks.", "In the context of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas of the source, not POE screening in the United States. \"When this has been evaluated, the yield is much, much greater to try to control the disease at the source, and control the screening and right close to the source.
