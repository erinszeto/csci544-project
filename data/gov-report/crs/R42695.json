Enhanced coordination among this network is critical to make the most of scarce resources available for small firms. It can also ensure that best practices are shared amongst providers that have similar goals but work within different contexts.", "The bill was designed to enhance oversight and coordination of the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs by requiring the SBA to coordinate these programs \"with State and local economic development agencies and other federal agencies as appropriate\" and to \"report annually to Congress, in consultation with other federal departments and agencies as appropriate, on opportunities to foster coordination, limit duplication, and improve program delivery for federal entrepreneurial development activities.\"", "In a related development, as mentioned previously, the Obama Administration formed the Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development by executive order on April 26, 2010.

The SBA's self-evaluation of its success in assisting veterans access capital has focused primarily on the agency's efforts to streamline the loan application approval process (e.g., minimizing paperwork requirements and reducing the time necessary for the SBA to review and approve applications submitted by local lenders) and aggregate lending amounts (e.g., the number and amount of loans approved). In contrast, veteran service organizations focus primarily on program outcomes, especially the likelihood of a veteran being approved for a SBA loan by a local lender.

Other performance-oriented measures that Congress might also consider include requiring the SBA to survey veterans who participate in its business development programs or who have received a SBA guaranteed loan.
