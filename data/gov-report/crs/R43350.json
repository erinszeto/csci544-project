Sometimes these claims are backed with historical examples of job losses in the alcohol industry following past increases in excise tax rates, although there are few academic studies of this potential effect. However, these claims have been criticized both based on expectations of behavior under economic theory and empirical analysis of past alcohol excise tax increases.", "Economic theory suggests that excise tax increases could be borne by producers or consumers in the short run, but are generally passed on to the consumer in the long run. For competitive markets with constant marginal costs of production, excise taxes are predicted to be fully passed through to prices, but in imperfectly competitive markets a one-cent increase in taxes may increase prices by less than or more than one cent, depending on the responsiveness of producers and consumers. Multiple empirical studies suggest that previous alcohol excise tax increases are usually passed along to consumers at least in full (and sometimes more) and within a relatively short timeframe.", "Past analyses suggest that even if producers bear some of the economic burden of the tax in the short run, it is unlikely that this cost would be sufficiently large to result in employment losses in the industry, much less on a macroeconomic level. Recent history also suggests that past changes in excise tax rates do not have a clear relationship with employment levels in the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry. A significant decline in the number of employees in the industry began in the mid-1980s and only began to reverse in the mid-1990s. An increase in the spirits tax rate and a doubling of the rate on wine and beer in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) does not appear to have had a clear effect on these pre-existing trends. The decline of industry employment in the 1980s could have been due to a general slowdown in the overall economy, but it is also unclear to what extent technological advances contributed to these trends (i.e., \"labor-saving\" increases in productivity).

Economists call these spillover effects, \"externalities.\" Products with positive externalities (i.e., spillover benefits to society) tend to be undersupplied in the market while products with negative externalities (i.e., spillover costs to society) tend to be oversupplied, from a societal perspective, in the market \u2014absent policies that adjust individual prices to reflect these spillover effects.", "The negative externalities associated with alcohol consumption has been studied by researchers in a variety of fields, including economics, health, and public safety and crime. Examples of the externalities most often featured in studies include the effects of alcohol consumption on: motor vehicle crashes, public health, domestic violence, and other crimes. In addition, many researchers have studied these effects among youth, as some of these effects are disproportionately concentrated among younger consumers of alcohol (e.g., involvement in motor vehicle crashes and violent crime).", "Understanding the externalities is important because of the possible social cost of alcohol consumption that is not accounted for in the market. Some economists concluded that excise tax collections on individual alcohol consumers are less than the total external costs alcohol imposes on society. This is not to say that researchers are unanimous in advocating for higher alcohol excise taxes; the findings of a wide range of studies indicate that the social issues related to alcohol consumption are quite complex from a public policy perspective. This section of the report attempts to highlight several of the key findings and debates.", "One of the most prominent studies on the external costs associated with alcohol consumption was conducted by Manning et al. (1991), and is hereafter referred to as the \"Manning study.\" Unlike many other studies estimating the \"total costs\" of alcohol consumption, the Manning study focused solely on external costs, and also incorporated some offsets against some of these costs that are associated with excessive drinking (defined as averaging more than two drinks per day). The Manning study acknowledges that most of these costs could be due to heavy drinkers, but they also understand that it is difficult to differentiate between excessive and non-excessive drinking for any one individual. Thus, the Manning study averages the external costs over all alcohol consumption to arrive at an estimate of 48 cents per ounce (in 1986 dollars) of alcohol consumed.", "Even if it is accepted that more could be done to compensate for the social costs of alcohol consumption, some might be skeptical as to whether across-the-board increases in federal excise tax rates are the most appropriate remedy.", "For example, some could argue that casual drinkers rarely impose the types of negative externalities tabulated by Manning et al., and thus efforts should be targeted toward prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse. To some extent, this notion is supported in the research. Studies from Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse find that over half of inmates in prison for either committing a violent crime or for property damage had a history of alcohol treatment or had an alcohol-use disorder. Still, researchers have not come to the consensus that heavy drinkers are the primary source of these negative externalities.", "In addition, non-tax alternatives could mitigate some of these externalities. In the past, many of these non-tax alternatives have been implemented at the state and local level. For example, changes to state-based minimum legal drinking age laws have been credited with reducing youth-related incidents related to alcohol abuse. Similarly, some researchers have found that severe legal deterrents and fines have reduced drunk driving. Overall though, empirical evaluations of some non-tax alternatives to address specific externalities are subject to some debate among researchers.", "In contrast to policies that try to reduce specific externalities (e.g., drunk driving), research indicates that increases in tax rates have the broadest ability to affect the negative externalities of alcohol consumption mostly because changes in taxes affect the widest range of alcohol consumers. Elasticity measures of changes in the symptoms of alcohol dependence and abuse in response to changes in price are generally high enough (generally more than one in value) in the literature to suggest that alcohol price increases provide a significant reduction on the societal effects of problematic drinking (even amongst youth and underage drinkers). Federal rate increases could be preferable to state increases as the former reduces opportunities for consumers to seek across-the-border purchases as a means to reduce their exposure to the tax.", "Some could argue that alcohol taxes should be increased at different levels across alcoholic beverage categories, based on their respective contributions to overall social costs. According to this logic, beer would bear the largest share of any excise tax increases as research indicates that it is most linked with various outcomes related to excessive drinking. There could be diminishing returns to such a policy if consumers adjust their preferences to substitute spirits and wine for beer. Beer is often linked to excessive drinking because of its lower price, relative to wine and distilled spirits. Beer also generally accounts for the largest share of alcoholic sales in the United States, as shown in Table 3 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equity", "paragraphs": ["Economists generally measure tax equity using two criteria: vertical equity and horizontal equity.

A tax system is progressive if higher-income households pay a greater share of their income in tax than lower-income households, whereas the converse is true in a regressive tax system.

Although lower-income households tend to spend a higher share of their pre-tax income on alcoholic beverages, average household spending on alcoholic beverages is more evenly distributed than spending on non-alcoholic beverages or food.

Based on estimates of the combined government tax rates at the federal, state, and local level are less than the level that could account for all external economic costs of alcohol consumption. After adjusting for inflation and assuming that these costs remain constant over time, Manning's 1986 estimate of 48 cents per ounce of alcohol would equal $1.02 in 2013 dollars. A rough estimate in the Appendix of this report measures the combined federal, state, and local taxes between 25 cents and 28 cents per ounce (in 2013 dollars) of alcohol compared with Manning's inflation-adjusted rate of $1.02 per ounce (in 2013 dollars). In other words, current combined taxes on alcohol are roughly one-quarter of the Manning study's calculations of the external costs of alcohol consumption (adjusted for inflation).", "As one option to raise revenue and address concerns over horizontal equity, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has regularly included an option to equalize alcohol tax rates in its periodically-published report on deficit reduction. CBO estimated in 2013 that increasing all taxes on alcoholic beverages to a $16 per proof gallon equivalent (or 25 cents per ounce of alcohol) would raise $64 billion in revenue over 10 years. Table 5 illustrates how this option would affect per-unit prices, based on the type of alcoholic beverage. ", "The differences in tax rates on beer and wine under this option would be quite large, in percentage terms. However, consumers could interpret these excise tax increases differently based on the product. Although there are bottles of wine that are priced comparatively to a six-pack of beer, many bottles of wine are priced much higher than a six-pack of beer. Put differently, a 48 cent-price increase (33 cents to 81 cents) is generally a larger price markup on a six-pack of beer than a 49 cent-price increase (21 cents to 70 cents) is on a bottle of wine."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
