The space industry is a subset of the U.S. aerospace industry and U.S. strength in aerospace has helped to provide U.S. strength in space. The space industry was originally developed by government entities, and government policies and spending continue to exercise a strong influence on commercial space activities in the United States and elsewhere. Space-oriented manufacturing, which includes launch vehicles, spacecraft, satellites, and parts and equipment, has created a large space-industrial infrastructure that enables a much larger space services sector that includes satellite telecommunications and broadcasting services, and satellite remote sensing, among others. Together, these are an important part of the U.S. industrial and technology base. The focus of this report is the global commercial space manufacturing sector (launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites). Although relatively small, accounting for less than $6 billion of expenditures in 2010, it enables an estimated $276 billion in spending for ground equipment and satellite services.", "The United States manufactures more launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites than any other country, but the relative U.S. competitive position has eroded as other countries have made large investments in commercial and government space activities. The U.S. government remains the world's largest customer for space equipment and services. With the end of the Space Shuttle era, the government will increasingly depend on the U.S. commercial space industry for transport of humans and cargo, and on commercial satellites for communications and data. The extent and nature of government demand are likely to be significant factors shaping the U.S. commercial space industry. U.S. policy has gradually shifted toward encouraging more competition among firms that manufacture launch equipment, spacecraft, and satellites, encouraging the participation of smaller, entrepreneurial firms in an industry segment traditionally dominated by large aerospace firms.", "Several policy issues appear to have significant effects on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. space manufacturing industry:", "In 1998, Congress passed legislation that reclassified all satellites and satellite parts and equipment as weapons under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, limiting the ability of U.S. manufacturers of commercial space equipment to sell abroad and encouraging foreign rivals to increase their global market share at the expense of U.S. manufacturers. On April 18, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of State issued a congressionally mandated report that assessed risks associated with removing satellites and related components from the United States Munitions List (USML). Bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress to reauthorize and amend U.S. export control laws (H.R. 2122, H.R. 2004, H.R. 1727, H.R. 3288). The rapid growth in technologies that consume large amounts of bandwidth threatens to destabilize the current system that allocates spectrum and orbital position to specific users. Spectrum is a scarce resource, but increasingly, commercial satellite operators are developing technological solutions to increase capacity. DOD is now a major user of commercial satellites. From a surge related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it now places greater reliance on commercial satellites. Hosted payloads are also likely to become a more common feature of the commercial satellite industry in the future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The space industry refers to economic activities related to the manufacture and delivery of components that go into Earth's orbit or beyond.

It then lays out a number of federal policy issues that may affect the industry's growth.", "The U.S. commercial space manufacturing sector is small, but the companies that manufacture commercial satellites also manufacture satellites for the U.S. government. U.S. commercial satellite manufacturing generated estimated revenues of $3.4 billion (of $5.6 billion in total U.S. satellite manufacturing revenues ) and employed 26,611 private sector workers in 2010, while the U.S. commercial launch industry generated revenues of $307 million (of $1.2 billion in total U.S. launches) and employed 49,195 private-sector workers. ", "In 2010, global revenues from satellite-enabled activities (i.e., the commercial products and services that are created using satellites) totaled $101.3 billion. Major products include direct-to-home television ($79.1 billion), satellite communications ($17.3 billion), satellite radio ($2.8 billion), consumer broadband ($1.1 billion), and Earth observation ($1.0 billion). Satellite services also generated worldwide sales of ground equipment that totaled $51.6 billion, including all of the infrastructure and technology needed to communicate with and manage satellites ($7.5 billion), as well as all of the end-user consumer equipment (satellite radios, satellite phones, satellite TV receivers and dishes, and satellite navigation equipment) ($44.1 billion). (See Figure 1 .)", "The U.S. government is by far the largest consumer of space products and services, accounting for 23% of global spending. The commercial space sector overlaps the government (civil and military) space sector in a number of different ways. Many manufacturers sell to both commercial and government customers, making use of common systems (for instance, satellites use standard buses ), common launch vehicles, and interdependent supply chains. Many of the largest commercial aerospace companies play a major role in the space industry, and some are almost entirely dependent on government space programs for their space-related work. ", "Military and civil (i.e., non-military government) space programs provide economies of scale and scope to companies that are federal contractors. During the post-Cold War period, numerous mergers resulted in industry consolidation, with fewer firms spanning multiple sectors. Because of the size of government space programs, some of the largest U.S. space companies, especially those engaged in launch activities, withdrew from the commercial space sector to focus nearly exclusively on government contracts that are not open to foreign competitors. Nevertheless, the international commercial launch industry has continued to develop even as some of the largest U.S. space companies ceased to compete for those launches. ", "During the last decade, the United States increasingly offered opportunities to smaller private companies to encourage entrepreneurial approaches to space activities as a means of spurring innovation, reducing costs, and promoting commercial engagement in space manufacturing and service provision. Orbital Sciences Corporation and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) are two newer American companies that have successfully competed for commercial and government contracts. ", "Launch vehicle, spacecraft, and satellite manufacturing is highly competitive internationally, with European, Russian, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese companies vying with U.S. firms for contracts to provide launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites to commercial customers. Some manufacturers of launch vehicles specialize in the manufacture and launch of those vehicles, while others also make spacecraft, satellites, and civil and defense aviation products, in addition to building and launching rockets. The supply chain for launch vehicles is moderately globalized, while satellites vary according to customer: military (low level of globalization), civil (moderate level of globalization), commercial (moderate to high level of globalized components).", "The major policy issues discussed in this report are limited to those that appear to have large effects on the competitiveness of the U.S. space manufacturing sector: classification of commercial satellites as munitions subject to stringent U.S. export controls laws and regulations; domestic and international spectrum regulations that may not have kept pace with the emergence of new technologies that appear to require much greater flexibility in terms of spectrum use; and the dramatically increased use of commercial satellites for Department of Defense communications needs.", "One major caveat regarding the statistical data used in this report needs to be mentioned. Publicly available U.S. government data for the manufacture of launch vehicles, spacecraft, satellites, and electronic components (especially search, detection, and navigation systems and instruments) are deficient in many respects. In some cases, data are suppressed because they would make it possible to identify a specific company; in others, data are aggregated to a level that makes it virtually impossible to distinguish between manufacturing for space activities, aviation, and telecommunications. Missiles, space launch equipment, and spacecraft cannot be differentiated using government data sources: for example, satellites, which are grouped with terrestrial telecommunications and broadcasting, are invisible in the data. CRS has used government data when available, but draws on reports by Futron Corporation, the Space Foundation, and others that provide estimates of the size of the global market and, in some cases, the U.S. market.

Many commercial launch vehicles are also used for, or can readily be adapted for, government purposes, both civil and military. The main driver of commercial launch activity is commercial satellites, although many government-owned satellites also are launched with the same vehicles.

In 2010, Boeing Launch Services placed two non-commercial payloads into orbit using ULA-built Delta launch vehicles: a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellite that was manufactured by Boeing and an Italian radar satellite built by Thales Alenia Space. One factor that may prevent Boeing and Lockheed Martin from more aggressively pursuing commercial launch opportunities has been a heavy U.S. government launch schedule that may crowd out commercial cargos.", "In 2011, U.S. launches were conducted by ", "ULA, with 11 launches for the U.S. government; United Space Alliance (a Boeing/Lockheed Martin joint venture), with three successful Space Shuttle launches; and Orbital Sciences Corporation, with four launches.

U.S. aerospace industry groups assert that the decline in U.S. satellite market share has been exacerbated by 1998 legislation classifying all satellites and satellite parts and equipment as weapons subject to licensing under more stringent arms export control rules (see discussion below). The aerospace and satellite manufacturing industry believes that other countries have looked to non-U.S. manufacturers for satellites that do not contain U.S. parts or components that are subject to U.S. arms export controls.

The Space Foundation uses six broad categories that are defined in the North American Industry Classification system (NAICs) (see Table 2 ), some of which may contain non-space industry workers (e.g., search, detection, and navigation instruments) or include service sector (information technology) workers or NASA civilian employees engaged in launch or satellite operations.", "Other NAICS categories that contain space industry workers are omitted because they do not provide enough information to determine the number of space industry jobs. Another issue is that workers in three of the NAICS categories involving production of guided missiles and space vehicles are combined so that it is impossible to distinguish between workers who manufacture weapons from those who make launch equipment and/or spacecraft.

ITAR designation means that satellites were placed on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and thus became subject to a much higher degree of scrutiny because of a presumption that the export of munitions potentially threatens U.S. national security. In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2012, Patricia Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, noted that the reclassification of satellites \"arose from concerns in the late 1990s that U.S. technology was not protected after two failures of Chinese launches of U.S.-made satellites.\" Cooper testified that a blanket imposition rather than a country-specific one had harmed the U.S. satellite industry.", "The reclassification of commercial satellites as munitions was highly controversial within the U.S. aerospace industry, due in part to the decision by the United States to impose unilateral export controls on commercial satellites without corresponding actions by European and Japanese governments. Foreign competitors immediately grasped the competitive disadvantage facing U.S. satellite exporters. In the early 2000s, Alcatel, a French company, announced that it would produce \"ITAR-free\" satellites for export and by 2004 had doubled its market share. Leading firms joined a European Space Agency (ESA) initiative in 2004 to develop technologies and systems hitherto available only from U.S. companies in an effort to boost European market share.

According to SpaceNews.com , for more than three years the State Department has been conducting a so-called \"Blue Lantern\" inquiry into whether sales of the Spacebus, a satellite produced by Thales Alenia Space, violate U.S. export control laws. The company and the State Department are reportedly at an impasse over a State Department request for the complete design of the Spacebus and a list of all components. In a January 5, 2012, interview with Space News International , Edgar Buckley, Thales Group senior vice-president for Europe and NATO, said that the company could not provide the satellite design: \"We will give an outline of the design.

The United States also participates in a number of multilateral export control regimes that are focused on chemical and biological weapons (the Australia Group); missile technologies (the Missile Technology Control Regime); nuclear materials, equipment, and technology (the Nuclear Suppliers Group); and the promotion of regional and international security and stability (the Wassenaar Arrangement). None of these international regimes control satellites as munitions.

On April 18, 2012, the Departments of Defense and State issued a report to Congress that found that \"if authorized by the Congress, the risks due to removing space-related dual-use items from the USML could be acceptably managed through controls and licensing policies under the CCL [Commodity Control List].\" The report identified two types of satellites and related items \"that are not purely defense-related\": communications satellites that do not contain classified components and remote sensing satellites with performance parameters below certain thresholds, as well as the systems, subsystems, parts, and components associated with those satellites and with performance parameters below certain thresholds.

That bill would continue the prohibition on satellite sales to or launches by China, or to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism (Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria) and North Korea. ", "In remarks to the Defense Trade Advisory Group on November 9, 2011, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro said, \"Our work is focused now on the removal of the majority of parts and components from the USML to the Commerce Control List (CCL) in these categories.\" However, as Shapiro pointed out, unlike the other items on the U.S. Munitions List, which can be reclassified by the President, satellites were placed on the list by law and congressional action would be required to remove them. Although there have been numerous discussions in committees about the issue of commercial satellites, export control legislation has generally been difficult to pass. ", "The Aerospace Industries Association, representing the majority of U.S. aerospace firms, published a study in January 2012 that contends that the United States' space and defense industrial base is weakening as exporters large and small encounter difficulties exporting commercial communications satellites and parts and components that are incorporated in commercial satellites.

However, both spectrum and satellite orbital position are scarce resources and governments regulate and allocate the use of radio spectrum on earth and in space. Spectrum allocation is intended to prevent signal interference, but it also imposes a limit on the amount of capacity available to satellite and terrestrial service providers. Domestic and international regulatory regimes are limited in terms of their ability to respond to capacity problems that affect satellite operators and consumers. But satellite network operators and their customers have increasingly sought technological solutions to the challenge of limited spectrum. With the increasing use of high-power Ku- and Ka-bands, larger amounts of data can be transmitted without increasing the number of transponders.", "U.S. regulations provide for government approval of the allocation of bandwidth and the use and positioning of satellites for communications (under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission) and for remote sensing (for which NOAA regulates commercial operators). Other countries also have varied laws and regulations for communications, navigation, and remote-sensing satellites. The United Nations, through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), manages an international treaty, known as the Radio Regulations, to \"ensure the rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of the radio-frequency spectrum by all radio communication services, including those using satellite orbits.\" One problem that is widely acknowledged is that some countries file an excessive number of applications for orbital locations and frequency assignments in order to reserve space, even though they are unlikely to deploy satellites that would use the frequencies or orbits. This practice deters other users from expanding their services or entering the market. Although there are rules that allow for periodic review of underutilization of spectrum and orbital placement, the process is time consuming. Conflicts over satellite spectrum and positioning also occur, and the ITU lacks enforcement mechanisms for resolving such disputes.", "The rapid evolution and proliferation of new bandwidth-intensive consumer, civil, and military technologies (such as broadband Internet services; satellite television and high definition television [HDTV] channels; growth in corporate enterprise networks; and military purposes such as airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, satellite links to ground troops, and intensified use of unmanned aerial vehicles) threatens to destabilize existing regulatory regimes that have been characterized as \"command and control\" models that award a specific amount of bandwidth to specific users. Once placed in its specified orbit, a satellite is limited to the bandwidth allocated to it and the option to switch transmission to a different bandwidth is not feasible. From the perspective of bandwidth-hungry consumers, this leads to a less than optimal allocation of spectrum and underutilization of existing capacity. Greater use of fiber to transmit signals could mitigate this problem slightly by reducing demand to some degree. Fiber costs are not trivial, however.", "In Europe, the demand for capacity has outpaced the available spectrum, and regulators are under pressure to adapt to more flexible systems that allow for greater and more efficient use of fixed satellite services, but there appear to be limits to finding a solution to the problem. European satellite operators are unwilling to cede their exclusive frequency bands, and they see the Radio Regulations as a bulwark against a move to a more liberal regime. ", "In its most recent forecast of satellite services demand, Futron concluded that \"ongoing debates regarding spectrum allocation could result in operators facing a constrained or reduced ability to maintain certain types of supply and to meet the needs of certain markets effectively in the future.\" But Futron also points to the adoption of operating efficiencies and fleet optimization strategies that have allowed satellite operators to better meet demand, and while the number of satellites or transponders may be limited by spectrum or orbital locations, technical solutions allow greater throughput for a given number of transponders per satellite. The shift to multiband payloads (using high-power frequency bands that are capable of carrying much higher capacities) and the use of higher power applications produce higher levels of throughput that\u00a0overcome some of the\u00a0limitations imposed by\u00a0spectrum scarcity. Futron forecasts that the supply of fixed satellite capacity of major operator fleets will decline slightly through 2019 (with capacity measured in terms of transponder equivalents) even as demand continues to grow in terms of throughput capacity. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased DOD Use of Commercial Satellites", "paragraphs": ["Unlike the previous section, which focused on the challenges posed by limited spectrum and orbital position, this section discusses the shift by the Department of Defense from a near total reliance on military-owned and -operated satellites to a reliance on leased commercial communications satellite capacity to meet its needs for additional satellite bandwidth. ", "With increased satellite efficiency and the ability to increase the amount of throughput per transponder, the Department of Defense, which has experienced dramatic increases in demand for satellite bandwidth, has turned to commercial satellites to handle a significant portion of military communications, thus preserving capacity on military satellites for high-level intelligence data. Military satellites are much more expensive than commercial satellites. Military satellites also take much more time to build and launch than commercial satellites. ", "Futron has estimated that global demand consumed approximately 79% of fixed satellite service (FSS) capacity in 2011. In part, the spare capacity serves as a reserve in the event of a loss of one or more satellites. But even with some surplus capacity, the U.S. Department of Defense has run up against capacity constraints in the Middle East, in part because of a shortage of satellites that meet DOD requirements. ", "The increased use of commercial capacity by the military has provided a stimulus to private-sector investment in satellites. In part, short-term sales of satellite capacity or bandwidth, for contractual periods of up to a year, have allowed satellite operators to command premium prices. Demand has risen steadily for nearly a decade. However, the unplanned and unbudgeted demand for commercial satellite bandwidth does not provide a stable business model for satellite service providers if that demand is temporary and subject to termination years before a satellite's effective lifespan is up. Satellites are typically built to meet the specific requirements of long-term customers and few, if any, satellite operators will buy and launch a satellite unless long-term customers have contracted for most of the available capacity of the satellite. With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, satellite operator Eutelsat has warned investors that its sales of short-term capacity to DOD will not continue to increase as rapidly as in the recent past, although the company has taken the position that DOD demand will likely remain strong as satellite capacity for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan is switched over to data-intensive streaming of videos from unmanned aerial vehicles.", "One of the issues of concern to the military and to commercial satellite operators has been the shift from a need for surge capacity to increased reliance on commercial satellites for core communications capabilities that meet military requirements. This shift has been the focus of a debate within DOD and among commercial satellite service providers and satellite manufacturers about a more integrated approach to the acquisition of commercial satellite services. According to one observer, \"Current estimates are that more than 80 percent of DOD's satellite bandwidth is purchased from commercial [satellite communication] companies. With increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in theatre, as well as high-definition video, that bandwidth allocation is expected to very quickly grow to more than 90 percent.\" Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers noted at a November 2011 conference that the volume of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data collected in Afghanistan increased from a single terabyte (a terabyte of data equals 1,000 gigabytes) of data per day at the start of the war to 53 terabytes of data per day\u2014an amount equivalent to 2.5 million full-length films.", "Because of the high level of demand for commercial satellite communications by DOD and other government agencies, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) established the Future Comsatcom Services Acquisition (FCSA) program in 2009 and extended and expanded it in 2012. The FCSA program allows commercial satellite providers to bypass a small group of middlemen and resellers who previously were the only authorized agents for commercial satellite contracts. This will allow satellite operators to expand their military customer base and better utilize capacity by allocating satellite capabilities between military and commercial users, while providing government agencies with greater efficiencies and costs that are similar to those for commercial users. ", "GAO and DOD conducted studies that found that the cost of acquiring commercial bandwidth increased from 2003 through 2010 (GAO) and 2005 through 2009 (DOD). With the new FCSA program, the number of satellite service vendors will not be limited (previously there were only three eligible vendors), and satellite operators will also be allowed to compete to provide bandwidth. GAO and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division expect that increased competition under FCSA will result in lower bandwidth prices. However, one major impediment to competition in the satellite sector is the cost of manufacturing, launching, and insuring a fixed service, or geosynchronous, communications satellite. According to GAO, the cost of manufacturing, launching, and insuring a fixed service satellite runs $200 million to $500 million. A basic network requires three or more satellites, so the high cost of satellites is a barrier to entry for new operators. ", "The Department of Defense is a large user of geosynchronous satellites, and it could potentially play a significant role in encouraging more competition in the commercial satellite sector\u2014especially if it is successful in deploying hosted payloads on commercial satellites. A hosted payload provides the military with the ability to include transponders and specialized military equipment on a commercial satellite, including observation, communications, space situational awareness, and space weather forecasting payloads that can be operated by the specific DOD customer. In March 2011, seven satellite manufacturers and operators formed a coalition to promote the use of hosted payloads. Some concerns have been raised about allowing satellites with hosted payloads containing extremely sensitive U.S. military technologies to be launched anywhere but in the United States. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The outlook for the United States commercial satellite sector is generally positive, notwithstanding the regulatory challenges mentioned in the last section. In 2010, the United States commercial satellite industry launched a total of 34 satellites for commercial and government customers\u2014more than Russia (26) or Europe (24). According to Futron, the United States also claims four of the five largest space manufacturers, in terms of revenue (see Table 4 ). Even with the rise of countries such as China, India, and Brazil, the United States continues to enjoy a significant, albeit slowly diminishing, advantage in space, at least in part because the United States has a dynamic private sector that produces most of its output. ", "The drawn-out transition from NASA's Space Shuttle program to a successor program may delay government procurement of the commercial equipment intended to replace the shuttle. Nonetheless, as military and NASA programs become more reliant on the private sector for transportation into space, U.S. commercial space equipment manufacturers will have access to a market that is largely closed to foreign competitors.", "The prospects for the U.S. space equipment manufacturing industry in markets that are open to international competition are less certain. The rapid expansion of new consumer technologies and services that are space-enabled has led to the emergence of new competitors from many countries. U.S. manufacturers of launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites have a number of distinct advantages over many foreign competitors, including a very large aerospace industrial base capable of supporting commercial and government demand for space technologies and equipment. Additionally, the United States is pursuing policies that support and encourage competition, and numerous entrepreneurial firms are investing and developing launchers and spacecraft that may open new avenues for space exploration and travel. The United States also has a well-educated workforce and higher education system that is highly competitive internationally. ", "In its analysis of space competitiveness, Futron ranked the relative position of the United States, compared to other countries, and found that the U.S. decline in recent years is mainly attributable to advances achieved by Russia, China, Japan, and India. As the U.S. government's role in promoting human spaceflight has transitioned from the Space Shuttle to a strategy that relies on the private sector to develop products that are competitive and serve the broad U.S. goals and activities that were identified in the National Space Policy of June 2010, the U.S. launch industry has become dependent on government payloads and has continued to face stiff competition from Russia and Europe. U.S. industry still maintains a wide lead in manufacturing for space. Although there are some vulnerabilities in the space industrial base (primarily in areas where some critical products are available from only one supplier or from limited foreign sources), the sector as a whole generates significant revenues and value-added and tends to be more entrepreneurial than in most other countries engaged in space activities. ", "A major weakness, however, that has been identified by some Members of Congress and a number of analysts is the general lack of public support for government funding of civil and military space programs. The authors of the Futron study, for instance, have observed that the U.S. space program may be perceived as not providing sufficient value to the nation. One consequence could be a further loss of competitiveness as other countries continue to strengthen their own space manufacturing capabilities and programs."], "subsections": []}]}}
