However, the FY2000 Consolidated appropriations act, P.L. 106-113 , calls for an across-the-boardrescission of 0.38% from each agency's discretionary budget authority and obligation limits. Thiswill result in a reduction of approximately $179 million from the level enacted in P.L. 106-69 . TheFederal Highway Administration (-$105.3 million), the Airport Improvement Program (-$54.4million), the Federal Transit Administration (-$17.6 million), and the Coast Guard (-$1.6 million)together absorb all but about $0.5 million of the DOT reductions.

The Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) received a more modest increase of just under 3%. The FY2000 Act fundsthe entire FAA budget out of the airport and airway trust fund. Historically, a significant portion ofthe FAA operations budget has been provided from general fund revenues.", "Much of the debate over the Department's budget focused on allocating resources raised by user fees and deposited in specific transportation trust funds. A debate arose between those in favorof a unified budget vs. those seeking to protect individual programs either by taking them off budgetor using fiscal boundaries or \"firewalls\" to ensure a minimum level of financing. This policy ofcreating discretionary spending guarantees originated with the provisions of the TransportationEquity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), legislation that placed \"firewalls\" around certaincategories of the Federal Highway Administration's programs. The House version of the FederalAviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, H.R. 1000 , proposes also changingthe budgetary treatment of the airport and airway trust fund by taking the fund off budget.", "For the highway trust fund, TEA-21 provided for the disposition of actual receipts above those forecast and authorized. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) provisions requireadditional trust fund receipts to be redistributed to individual states based on the formula used toapportion highway dollars. The enacted version of H.R. 2084 narrows the scope ofRABA distribution to certain core highway programs, thereby reducing the allocations to a numberof smaller TEA-21 programs and increasing the funds flowing to the states.", "Key Policy Staff", "Division abbreviations: RSI = Resources, Science, and Industry Division."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["The President signed the Department of Transportation and Related AgenciesAct, 2000 ( P.L. 106-69 ), hereafter referred to as the FY2000 Act, on October 9,1999.

Most highway, and the majority of transit, programs arefunded with contract authority derived by the link to the highway trust fund. This isvery significant from a budgeting standpoint. Contract authority is tantamount to, butdoes not actually involve, entering into a contract to pay for a project at some futuredate. Under this arrangement, specified in Title 23 U.S.C., authorized funds areautomatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may beobligated without appropriations legislation.

That is, the authority to spend for the largest programs under their controlalready exists and the mechanism to obligate funds for these programs is also inplace. ", "Prior to the FY1999 Appropriations Act changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process bycombining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations onobligations. The principal function of the limitation on obligations is to controloutlays in a manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements.", "The authority to set a limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in allocating funds between the variousfederal transportation activities in function 400, which includes agencies such as theCoast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration. In addition, the inclusion ofthe highway and transit programs and their trust fund generated revenue streams inthe discretionary budget provided appropriators with additional flexibility as part ofthe annual process by which available funds were allocated amongst the 13 standingappropriations subcommittees in the House and the Senate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Transportation Appropriations as a Result of TEA-21", "paragraphs": ["TEA-21 changed this budgetary procedure in two ways.

The Act further amends thebudget process by creating a statutory level for the limitation on obligations in eachfiscal year from FY1999 to FY2003. In addition, TEA-21 provides a mechanismto adjust these amounts in the highway account, but not the transit account, tocorrespond with increased or decreased receipts in the highway generated revenues(see revenue aligned budget authority - RABA- under key policy issues).", "The net effect of the creation of these budget categories is a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, referred to in TEA-21 as adiscretionary spending guarantee. These categories are separated from the rest of thediscretionary budget in a way that prevents the use of funds assigned to thesecategories for any other purpose. These so called \"firewalls\" are viewed, in theTEA-21 context, as guaranteed and/or minimum levels of funding for highway andtransit programs. Additional funds above the firewall level can be made available forhighway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process. ", "TEA-21 changes the role of the House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting anannual level of obligations. In addition, it appears that the House appropriationscommittee is precluded, at least in part, from exercising what some Members viewas their traditional option of changing spending levels for any program or project.", "The TEA-21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process, because they can onlyadjust the DOT agency/program budgets outside the firewalls. Hence, any reductionin spending for Function 400 must be allocated to these agencies/programs. This hasraised special concern for supporters of the FAA, the Coast Guard, and Amtrak,which are the largest DOT functions without firewall protection. See the key policyissues section for further amplification.", "On June 15, 1999, the House completed action on H.R. 1000 , the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR21). H.R. 1000 contains provisions that take the aviation trust fund off budget. Off budgetdiffers from firewalls and would give the trust fund status similar to the SocialSecurity trust fund as far as the annual budget debate is concerned. TheSenate-passed version of H.R. 1000 contains no changes in thebudgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund.

This situation, combined with the belief in some quartersthat protected spending within the TEA-21 firewalls constrains FAA spending in theannual appropriations process, has heightened interest in providing some sort ofbudgetary protection for aviation.", "Supporters of the Coast Guard are also concerned about the new transportation appropriations environment. The Coast Guard is not funded by a trust fund, andhence cannot claim a user-fee base to support an argument for its own budgetfirewalls. The Coast Guard has a unique status within the transportation budgetcategory because of its wartime role in national defense. It is not unusual for theCoast Guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during the annualappropriations process. It is possible that the Coast Guard will seek additionalfunding from the military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds from transportation appropriations do not become available.

Monies have been allocated for adiverse array of purposes, for example, to pay for the expenses of the U.S. CoastGuard, to improve safety throughout the various modes of transportation, and to helpfinance various infrastructure needs. In the DOT and Related AgenciesAppropriations Act, monies are also provided to support the National TransportationSafety Board (NTSB), the Surface Transportation Board (STB), and several othertransportation-related independent agencies.

Throughout its budget request, the DOT continues to emphasize several prioritiesincluding: safety, infrastructure, innovative financing, environmental enhancement,technology, and national security.", "Much of the appropriations process must take place within the framework created by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), signed intolaw on June 9, 1998 ( P.L. 105-178 , H.R. 2400 ). The Act authorizedappropriations for key surface transportation programs through fiscal year 2003. Thegeneral sense of Congress appears to be that, although transportation trust funds arenot sacrosanct, proceeds from the Federal fuels taxes must be targeted toward thecapital and recurring needs of the vast U.S. highway and transit network and notviewed as a source of general revenue. Although attempts to move highway andtransit programs off budget prior to the 106th Congress were unsuccessful, Congressdid insert language within TEA-21 to protect specific funding by creating firewallsaround selected programs. The firewalls effectively created minimum funding levelsfor the selected programs. However, their creation has caused a congressional debatebetween the authorizers and appropriators over who should exercise ultimateauthority for spending levels. Firewalls established by authorizing committeesguarantee minimum funding for selected programs, but in the process, are seen bysome as reducing the funding that might have been allocated to other (unprotected)programs. Thus, unprotected programs must compete for finite amounts, generallycapped by the budget resolution. A similar initiative is underway for airtransportation through H.R. 1000 , although it drops the firewallprovision while retaining off-budget provisions.", "TEA-21 also contained a provision (Section 1105, Revenue Aligned Budget Authority -- RABA) that authorizes DOT to redistribute trust funds, in excess ofprojected receipts, to the various states for Title 23 highway programs. Accordingto RABA, the additional revenues are to be allocated to the states using the formulasspelled out in the law. However, the FY2000 DOT request proposed redirection ofthese funds from highway programs to other DOT initiatives, predominantlyenvironmental activities associated with the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality(CMAQ) program and transit.

There are a number of provisions in the Act, however, that waiver from theformula guidance found in TEA-21. The principal change is in the distribution ofRevenue Enhanced Budget Authority (RABA) funds for programs under the directcontrol of the FHWA (these are the so called \"allocated\" funds and include programssuch as the federal lands highway program and the highway beautification program). The effect of the Act's provisions is to transfer a significant portion of the RABAfunds designated for the allocated funds to core highway programs (surfacetransportation program, national highway system program, etc.) for distribution to the states on a formula basis. The other major change in the Act is a significant increasein the number of specific projects and funding levels detailed in the legislation. Thisearmarking is a common feature in other parts of the transportation appropriationsAct, but has been absent from the highway section of the act for several years.", "The earmarking and the RABA reallocation, are the most contentious featuresof the FY2000 Act and were opposed by the leadership of the House Transportationand Infrastructure Committee which viewed these changes as constituting legislating(i.e. authorizing) in an appropriations act. Opposition in the House, however, wasinsufficient to defeat the Conference Report on final passage.", "The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 (formerly S. 1143 ) honored the TEA-21-created program structure and spending guaranteeprovisions and provided a small additional increase in spending over the ClintonAdministration proposal. The legislation as reported included total budgetaryresources for FHWA of just under $29 billion. Almost all of the programmaticchanges proposed in the bill affected research programs and intelligent transportationsystems (ITS) programs that will be discussed later in this section. The majordifference between the Senate Act and the Clinton proposal was in the treatment ofRABA funding. The Senate Act distributes RABA funds of $1.46 billion on thebasis of TEA-21 formulas, thereby rejecting the Administration's attempt to use thesefunds for non-highway activities. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 differs from the House version in that it narrows the scope of RABAdistribution to certain of the core highway programs instead of allocated programs,thereby excluding a number of smaller previously mentioned programs. During floordebate, this provision was challenged on a point of order as violating the Senate ruleagainst legislating in an appropriations bill. The point of order failed. ", "H.R. 2084 as passed by the House also honored the TEA-21 guarantee levels. Federal aid highway funds and RABA funds are identical to theSenate levels. Total budgetary resources available to FHWA were slightly lower inthe House-passed version. The House bill also rejected the Clinton AdministrationRABA redistribution proposal. ", "The FY2000 budget proposal submitted by the Clinton Administration requested FHWA funding at the TEA-21 firewall level, $27.3 billion. In addition, a RABAdistribution of $1.46 billion in additional highway funding was forecast. TheAdministration chose to make the very controversial suggestion that the RABAdistribution be reprogrammed to a number of transportation programs outside thehighway program firewall. These changes were designed to complement VicePresident Gore's proposals concerning the Administration's \"livability agenda.\" Forexample, the Administration proposed $250 million in additional funding forhighway research activities, which are outside the highway firewall. RABA fundingwould also have been used for highway safety, transit, and rail related activities. TheAdministration proposal failed to gain congressional support and, as detailed above,was not seriously considered as part of the FY2000 appropriations process.", "The TEA-21 Funding Framework. TEA-21 created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history. For themost part, however, it did not create new programs. Rather, it continued most of thehighway and transit programs that originated in its immediate predecessor legislation,the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA, P.L.102-240 ). Programmatically, TEA-21 can be viewed as a refinement and update ofthe ISTEA process. There are a few new funding initiatives in the Act, such as aborder infrastructure program, but the vast majority of funding is reserved forcontinuing programs. ", "There are several groupings of highway programs within the highway firewall. Most of the funding is reserved for the major federal aid highway programs, whichcan be thought of as the core programs. These programs are: national highway system(NHS), interstate maintenance (IM), surface transportation program (STP), bridgereplacement and rehabilitation, and congestion mitigation and air qualityimprovement (CMAQ). All of these programs are subject to apportionment on anannual basis by formula and are not subject to program-by-program appropriation. ", "There is a second category of highway funding within the firewalls. This so called \"exempt\" category consists of two elements, an additional annual authorizationof minimum guarantee funding ($639 million per fiscal year) and emergency relief($100 million per fiscal year). These funds are not subject to the annual limitationon obligations.", "A further set of programs, which are also within the firewall, are known as the allocated programs. These programs are under the direct control of FHWA or othergovernmental entities. These programs include: the federal lands highway program,high priority projects (former demonstration project category), Appalachian roads(formerly ineligible for trust fund contract authority), most minimum guaranteefunds, the national corridor planning and border infrastructure program, and severalother small programs.", "TEA-21 provides a link between the highway generated revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending. The Act requires that the Secretary ofTransportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into the highway accountduring the previous fiscal year vis-a-vis spending authorized within the highwayfirewall for the new fiscal year. If revenues go up, program spending is increased. Conversely, spending can go down if revenues go down. The Act specifies a formulato determine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment. Thismechanism, known as the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA), is employedbeginning in FY2000.", "FHWA Research, Development, and Technology Programs. For FY2000, the FHWA requested $641 million tosupport its research, development, and technology-related (RD&T) activities; this isan increase of $268 million over the FY1999 estimate of $373 million. The requestconsisted of $370 million to conduct RD&T related to FHWA's traditional highwayprograms and $271 million to support the National Intelligent TransportationSystems (ITS) program.", "An important issue associated both with the traditional highway component and, particularly, with the ITS deployment program component of the RD&T program, is the earmarking of funds. The appropriators, historically, have designated asubstantial portion of the incentive funds used to accelerate ITS deployment. Forexample, in FY1999 the appropriators earmarked the entire deployment account byspecifying which cities or states would receive those funds and the amounts to beobligated. (9) Both the House AppropriationsCommittee and the Senate Committee onAppropriations again earmarked the entire ITS deployment program in their FY2000recommendations. The conference agreement accompanying P.L. 106-69 earmarkedalmost all of the deployment account. Many Members and proponents of ITS wouldprefer to have the deployment funds competitively awarded. ", "The FY2000 budget request poses other issues regarding highway RD&T programs, but one is of particular note. This issue pertains to the use of RABAfunds. As previously stated, the Administration has been seeking the flexibility toallocate those monies according to its priorities instead of the distribution specifiedin TEA-21. The Administration proposed allocating $250 million of the RABAfunds to supplement both components of the RD&T program. If highway RD&Tprograms had received only their proportional share of the RABA funds now allowedunder TEA-21, the funding for those activities could have been increased up to about5% (plus any increase now specified in TEA-21 for FY2000), instead of the 72%increase proposed by DOT. (10) This would haveupset the agreements forged inTEA-21 regarding how the RABA funds would be distributed. The Senate and theHouse did not accept the Administration's proposal to use RABA funds to increaseRD&T activities by 72%.", "Motor Carrier Safety Operations. In FY2000 FHWA requested approximately $55.4 million for the motor carrier safety(MCS) program that is managed by the newly established Office of Motor Carrierand Highway Safety. In an amended request, FHWA asked for an additional $5.8million for that program. The requested funds are used primarily to pay for thesalaries and expenses of some 630 staff who conduct audits or reviews of motorcarriers, write and revise the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, and conductmany other activities intended to improve commercial motor vehicle safety. InFY1999, $53.4 million was appropriated for those functions. For FY2000, the Senatespecified about $57.4 million for motor carrier safety operations, and the Houseappropriated about $70.5 million for that function. The conference agreementspecified the amount recommended by the House.", "Various congressional committees have recently conducted hearings on the truck and bus safety program administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation(DOT). Two of the key issues that were discussed include: How effectively is thecurrent program being conducted? Is a new administrative structure needed toimprove its implementation? The debate on the future administrative structure of thefederal truck and bus safety program appears to have affected the FY2000 DOTAppropriations Act. P.L. 106-69 prohibits the use of any funds to carry out certainmotor carrier safety functions and operations by the FHWA, and would transfer thosefunds to any DOT entity other than the FHWA to carry out those activities. OnOctober 9, 1999, FHWA's motor carrier safety functions were transferred to a newlyestablished entity, the Office of Motor Carrier Safety, outside of FHWA but stillwithin the DOT. ", "In addition to the funds used to conduct FHWA's motor carrier safety program,the FHWA budget request included $105 million of contract funds authorized byTEA-21 to support the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) andvarious information systems used to promote truck and bus safety, and an amendedrequest of another $50 million to fund additional MCSAP activities and other safetyinitiatives. MCSAP provides grants to the states to implement inspection and reviewprograms affecting both interstate and intrastate commercial vehicle operations. InFY1999 $100 million was made available for MCSAP and related informationsystems. The House-passed H.R. 2084 appropriates $105 million forthose activities.

However, TEA-21 authorized $6.8 billion for FY2000, of which, $5.8billion was guaranteed under the so-called firewall provisions. The additional amountof $291 million over the guaranteed level of $5.8 billion under the Administration'sproposal for transit would have come from highway gasoline tax revenues derivedfrom the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority Act (RABA) funds designated byTEA-21 for highway programs. The reallocation of RABA funds to transit wasopposed by highway proponents. The American Public Transit Association (APTA)also opposed the Administration's use of RABA funds for transit purposes. APTAbelieved that the additional funds proposed by the Administration over theguaranteed funding level could be found within the discretionary budget category.

Duringconsideration in the Senate, a deadlock occurred over a provision that the would havelimited a state's total transit funding to 12.5% of total formula grant transit funding.The provision was controversial not only because it entailed changing the grantdistribution formula enacted in TEA-21 but also because all of the reductions wouldhave come out of the projected distribution of transit funds to the two states, NewYork and California. After a vote to invoke cloture failed, the provision waswithdrawn in the face of the certainty of a filibuster by the delegations from NewYork and California and opposition from those who were against changing any ofTEA-21's provisions in general.", "The FY2000 Act provides a total of $5.8 billion for FTA.
