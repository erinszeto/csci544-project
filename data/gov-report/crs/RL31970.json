U.S. officials say they are active globally to ensure that national andinternational standards for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are consistent, transparent, basedon scientific principles, and compliant with international trade rules (e.g., those administered throughthe World Trade Organization).

For example, a number of leading lawmakers pressed hard for the Administration to aggressively challenge the EU moratorium. Following theAdministration's decision to do so, the Senate and House passed resolutions ( S.Res. 154 ; H.Res. 252 ) in support of the action. Several House hearings have been held toreview barriers to the adoption of, and trade in, GE agricultural products; and to review challengesand opportunities for plant biotechnology development in Africa.

(2)", "U.S. crops where GE varieties are common are highly dependent upon export markets. According to USDA, approximately 40% of all U.S. soybeans, 20% of all corn, and 45% of allupland cotton production is exported. These crops and their major products accounted for more thana fourth ($13.3 billion) of the total annual average annual value of $52.6 billion for all U.S.agricultural exports during calendar years (CY) 2000 to 2002. Not all of these soy, corn, and cottonexports were GE varieties, but the U.S. marketing and regulatory systems do not distinguish between(approved) GE and non-GE varieties. Commingling bulk commodity shipments provides animportant cost competitive advantage for U.S. handlers in domestic and world markets, accordingto industry analysts. ", "These analysts observe that U.S. adoption of agricultural biotechnology has been facilitated bythe current U.S. regulatory system. The basic federal guidance for regulating biotechnology productsis the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (51 Fed. Reg. 23302) published in1986 by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). One of its keyprinciples is that genetically engineered products should continue to be regulated according to theircharacteristics and unique features -- not according to their method of production. Thus, if a foodproduct produced through biotechnology is determined to be substantially equivalent to oneproduced by more conventional means, that food is subject to no additional (or no different)regulatory processes. Once approved, food products do not have to be labeled as to whether or notthey contain any genetically modified organisms (GMOs), except to the extent a GE food issubstantially different (e.g., contains an allergen or has a changed nutritional content). However,marketers are free to make such claims, one way or the other, so long as the labeling is truthful. Theframework maintains that new biotechnology products are regulated under existing federal statutoryauthorities, all of which were conceived and enacted before the advent of commercial agriculturalbiotechnology. (3)", "The problem for U.S. agriculture is that many countries remain wary of agricultural biotechnology, including those in the European Union (EU), where consumer and environmentalorganizations have been vocal in expressing concerns about the safety of GE crops and animals. TheEU and other important U.S. trading partners have adopted widely divergent approaches toregulating biotechnology. As a result, U.S. exporters are encountering barriers to their products inthese markets.", "For example, since 1998, the EU, the fourth largest foreign market for U.S. agricultural products, has maintained a de facto moratorium on approvals of new GE crop varieties. In May2003, the United States, Canada, and Argentina began a formal challenge of the EU policy in theWorld Trade Organization (WTO), contending that it violates international trade agreements and alsohas fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world(see page 9 ). The EU counters that it must protect its consumers by exercising the so-calledprecautionary approach, which says that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusiveregarding a practice's or product's potential dangers to human or environmental health, it should bemore vigorously regulated or even prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern, thusproviding a safeguard against future unforeseen problems. Under this approach -- which is alsobeing emulated somewhat in other important U.S. markets such as Japan and South Korea, forexample -- the products of biotechnology are deemed to be inherently different than theirconventional counterparts.", "Even some countries that grow GE crops are imposing their own approval and labeling regulations for GMOs. For example, China is planting its own GE cotton and other crops, but hasimposed a temporary GMO import regime while it develops permanent new rules for approval andlabeling of GMO farm products. This has created uncertainty about continuing access to thisimportant U.S. export market.", "Some U.S. producers, who otherwise generally have supported biotechnology, have expressed trepidation about expansion to more GE varieties due to such foreign market uncertainties. Theirconcerns have been evident as biotechnology companies work toward government approvals of GEwheat. Although some growers are eager to plant the new varieties when they become available,others do not want commercialization approvals until there is wider global acceptance. (4) Wheatgrowers, too, depend heavily on exports; USDA reports that 56% of production is exported. Theaverage annual value of U.S. wheat exports was $3.6 billion (7% of all agricultural exports) inCY2000-2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Oversight of Agricultural Biotechnology", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Regulation (5)", "paragraphs": ["Around the world, countries have taken widely divergent approaches to regulating the products of agricultural biotechnology.

Althoughmultilateral attempts to harmonize GMO regulation have been under way for several years,internationally recognized standards still are evolving.", "The disparity of national regulatory responses has been characterized as a \"renationalization\" of agri-food safety regulation, and \"a sharp break from the international food safety system thatevolved over the past 100 years, where importers tended to accept the food and environmental safetyjudgments of regulators from those countries developing and exporting the products.\" (7) Others arguethat scientific knowledge about biotechnology's effects on food and environmental safety is stillincomplete. In the meantime, they argue, countries have a right and obligation to take the\"precautionary approach\" to regulation.

The United States,Canada, Japan, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa are among the countries where developersseeking approvals of new GE products have found a relatively flexible regulatory environment. Tothis list might be added India and China, where considerable research has been conducted onagricultural biotechnology and domestic approvals appear to be increasing, but where, nonetheless,imports of GE crops may face obstacles.

In Argentina, Canada, Hong Kong, and the UnitedStates, labeling products as to whether or not they are from GE-derived crops generally is voluntary. However, the EU and more than 20 countries have either adopted, or announced plans for,mandatory labeling of GMO products. A number of them, for example, Australia, Brazil, China,Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom (an EUmember), have formally implemented their mandatory labeling regimes. Many others, however,have not fully outlined their proposals or indicated when they might take effect; some also apparentlylack implementing structures.

Its main objectivesare to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade, and promote coordination of food standards workundertaken by governmental and non-governmental organizations. Codex standards are used toevaluate national food regulations and to settle sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) related tradedisputes in the WTO. ", "In 1999, the Codex established the ad hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Foods Derived from Biotechnology. The task force was charged with considering health and nutritionalimplications, and with developing standards, guidelines or recommendations, as appropriate, for suchfoods. The task force held its fourth and final meeting in March 2003, when it completed work onthe last of three framework documents, Draft Principles for the Risk Analysis of Foods Derived fromRecombinant-DNA Microorganisms . The task force's documents were to be presented for approvalby the full Commission at its July 2003 meeting. ", "U.S. officials expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the final session, althoughdeliberations over the guidelines often were contentious. At the last meeting, for example, an opendiscussion was held on rules for traceability of GE products. The EU led by France was advocatingthat they encompass rules for full traceability of GE products. The United States was arguing thattraceability is acceptable only for food safety/public health purposes, not merely to preserve theidentity of specific products, including those resulting from biotechnology. The U.S. view is thatthese types of questions should be considered in other Codex committees because they are notunique to biotechnology.

U.S. agricultural interests contend that not only have these policiesblocked their exports to the EU, but also fueled unwarranted concerns about thesafety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world.", "EU officials say they have been moving as quickly as possible to reinstate biotechnology approvals while trying to reassure their consumers regarding safetyissues. There is concern among some policymakers that the filing of a WTO casewill only escalate trade tensions between the United States and the EU, where thevalue of two-way agricultural trade amounts to more than $14 billion annually.", "Background. With minor exceptions, the EU has approved no agricultural biotechnology products since 1998, even thoughit has an elaborate approval process in place, and, in October 2002, implementedrevisions to that process aimed at reassuring its member states and the public aboutthe safety of its regulatory system. Approximately 13 products in early 2003 wereawaiting approval, some for as long as 6 years. A majority of EU states haseffectively blocked the release of any new GE crops into the environment. Thesestates -- France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy,Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Finland -- say they will not implement theEU-wide legislation for approvals until new, stricter, regulations for labeling andtracing GM-containing products also are adopted. Although the EuropeanCommission first approved these separate proposals in July 2001, the lengthy EUdecision-making and implementation process make it unlikely that these proposalswill come into force any earlier than some time in 2004. ", "In the 3 years before the de facto ban, U.S. corn exports to the EU averaged approximately $300 million annually (Spain and Portugal were the largest EUimporters). Since then, they have declined to less than one-tenth of that valueannually -- the result, according to analysts, of the EU's moratorium on the approvalof new corn varieties already approved in the United States. Although one varietyof biotech corn was approved by the EU prior to the moratorium, other approvedvarieties are being grown in the United States, making exports of any U.S. corn(which is not separated as to GM or non-GM varieties) to the EU impractical. U.S.soybean exports to the EU have declined, too, from an average value ofapproximately $2.2 billion in the 3 years before the ban to about $1.2 billion annually (2000-2002), according to USDA data. Unlike biotech corn, only onevariety of biotech soybeans has been widely grown in the United States; the EU hadapproved this GE crop under its regulatory process prior to the moratorium.

In addition tothe three main filers, Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico,New Zealand, Peru, and Uruguay expressed their support for the case. On June 19,2003, a USTR spokesman issued a statement announcing that the consultations werenot successful, and that the WTO will now be asked to establish a dispute settlementpanel, the next step. At any rate, resolution of the dispute could take up to 18months.", "The United States and its allies argue in part that the EU moratorium violates the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS)Measures. The SPS agreement permits countries to regulate crops and food productsto protect health and the environment, but their rules must be scientifically justifiedand approval procedures must be operated without undue delay. U.S. interestscontend that there is no scientific evidence that GM-derived food and feed crops aresubstantially different from, or any less safe than, conventional varieties, a conclusionthey say even European scientific authorities have reached. The moratorium has notonly impacted U.S. exports to the EU, but also caused other countries -- particularlyin the developing world -- to shun biotechnology, which, the United States hasargued, holds great promise for vastly improving agricultural productivity andfeeding growing populations (see also page 12 ).", "EU officials counter that they have shown good faith in moving as quickly as possible to restart the approval process. In early April 2003, the EC threatened totake legal action at the European Court of Justice against the 12 member states if theyfail to implement the GE approval legislation once the new labeling and tracing rulesare approved. Nonetheless, EU officials have told the United States that theircautious approach to regulating agricultural biotechnology is necessary to restoreconfidence among European consumers, who may be more wary of changes in howtheir food is produced due to a series of recent food safety crises. (13)", "It is unclear how a WTO dispute panel might rule on the U.S.-EU case, in part because agricultural GMOs are not explicitly recognized in the Uruguay Round tradeagreements, which were concluded before the advent of widespread agriculturalbiotechnology. If the United States wins, it would validate the basic principles of theSPS agreement and could discourage other countries from emulating the EUregulations. The United States has pointed out that many EU farmers themselveswould like to be planting and selling GE crops. However, a win might not open EUmarkets to more GE imports; the United States might simply have to settle for someform of alternate compensation.

These regulations, if approved as proposed, would require allfood, feed and processed products from GMOs to be labeled, even if they no longercontain detectable traces. A tolerance level for non-GMO foods, feeds, andprocessed products of 0.9% is set for allowable \"adventitious presence\" (AP) -- thatis, unintended, low-level presence -- of an EU-approved GE substance. All productswith more than 0.9% must be labeled as GM. The allowable level for unapprovedGE varieties that received a positive EU risk assessment during the moratorium is0.5% for 3 years, after which it drops to 0%.

U.S.agricultural interests argue that, even if the GMO approval moratorium is lifted, thenew labeling and traceability rules are themselves unworkable and unnecessary, andwill continue to discriminate against U.S. exports. Compliance with the EU labelingrule would require segregation of GE crops and foods derived from them from thetime they are planted all the way through the processing and marketing chain. Thiswould entail prevention of pollen drift from GE to non-GE fields; and difficult andcostly handling procedures such as using separate equipment, storage, and shippingcontainers, or at least painstakingly cleaning them. U.S. interests argue that foodcompanies forced to label accurately all GE products could face huge risks andliabilities. All of these problems would discriminate against U.S. shipments, theyadd. Material from Virginia Cooperative Extension asserts:", "Segregating crops at every step during growth, storage, transportation, processing, and exporting would be very difficult andcostly to implement. Dr. Susan Harlander, a former vice president of PillsburyCompany, illustrated the situation with the following example: a medium-sized foodcompany can have more than 6,000 products that contain 8,000 ingredients from1,000 suppliers that move through 30 processing plants on their way to beingexported to as many as 100 countries. Implementing a system to track all of theseingredients from their source (as far back as the farm) to the final destination is adaunting task that would cost billions of dollars and even then it may not beinfallible.

It enables countries to obtain information about biotechorganisms (i.e., \"living modified organisms\" or LMOs) before they are imported intothose countries. It recognizes each country's right to regulate such organisms so longas they are consistent with existing international agreements, and provides for aninternational clearinghouse for the exchange of LMO information.", "The Protocol establishes the use of \"Advance Informed Agreements\" (AIA) between the importing and exporting parties that cover the first transboundarymovement of any GMO. The purpose of AIAs is to ensure that recipient countrieshave the opportunity to assess environmental risks associated with the importationof biotechnology products. The Biosafety Protocol creates the procedure by requiringexporters to seek consent from importers before the first shipment of a GMO isintroduced into the environment (applies to seeds for planting, fish for field release,and microorganisms for environmental bioremediation).

Policymakers in Europe recognize,as do those in the United States, the need for an assessment of risks based onaccepted scientific facts. However, critics worry that adopting the precautionaryprinciple in formal agreements like the Protocol may create false public expectationsof absolute safety and the demand for zero environmental risks.

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is generally regarded as the lead agency onbiotechnology trade issues as part of its overall mandate to coordinate U.S. tradepolicy, including negotiating trade agreements and dealing with major disputes. USTR leads the U.S. delegation of agency representatives at quarterly SPS and TBTmeetings convened by the WTO, where biotechnology matters generally are covered.Back home, biotechnology questions pass through the USTR staff-level offices thathandle agricultural, SPS, and TBT matters. USTR convenes and coordinates aninteragency SPS Trade Policy Staff Committee consisting of representatives fromagencies throughout government. This committee meets frequently, but on an\"as-needed\" basis, on biotechnology trade issues, some of which may arise fromongoing bilateral or multilateral negotiations, and others from disputes with tradingpartners. USTR also convenes a higher-level SPS Trade Policy Review Group,composed of more senior agency officials, to discuss and resolve more controversialSPS questions, including those on biotechnology. (22)", "However, other agencies take the lead on specific biotechnology issues. The State Department, for example, is at the forefront in dealing with countriesimplementing the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol. FDA, supported by USDA's FoodSafety and Inspection Service (FSIS), leads on Codex matters (see Table 1 ).", "On occasion, particularly thorny issues and/or jurisdictional disputes must be resolved at the White House level, which ultimately decides overall U.S.biotechnology policy with input from its Office of Science and Technology Policy(OSTP). The President's Special Assistant for Agricultural Trade and Food Aid, anda biotechnology working group composed of high-level officials under the aegis ofthe White House National Economic Council (NEC), periodically may be calledupon to discuss or referee such issues. The National Security Council also has beeninvolved in discussions, e.g., those concerning whether to challenge formally the EUover its de facto moratorium on new GMO approvals.", "Some critics assert that the U.S. response to biotechnology remains largely reactive, ad hoc, and not well coordinated. Thus, on any issue, jurisdictionaldiscussions may precede substantive action, they contend, arguing that a morecomprehensive long-term strategy is needed. The Biotechnology IndustryOrganization (BIO) has reported on its website that USTR has circulated amonginterested agencies a draft paper spelling out such a strategy. However, as of earlyJune 2003, the paper had not emerged publicly.
