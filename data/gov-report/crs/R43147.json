At a hearing on the issue, ICE Director John Morton stated that although the CR had funded 34,000 beds, ICE's average daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including many who were not required to be detained under law. However, critics responded that the release was purely political and a way to pressure Congress to make a deal with the President to avert the sequestration reductions.

That adjustment, if used, would make additional budget authority available for the federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act beyond what is allowed in the regular discretionary budget allocation. Without an adjustment to the discretionary budget caps, federal spending over the allocation could trigger a sequestration.", "It is useful to note that \"disaster relief\" funding under the BCA and the Disaster Relief Fund are not the same. The BCA defines funding for \"disaster relief\" as funding for activities carried out pursuant to a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. This funding comes not only from FEMA, but also from accounts across the federal government.

In previous years, when a large-scale disaster occurred, the DRF balance was generally low due to smaller regular appropriations to the account. As a result, there may have been more pressure in previous years to pass a supplemental appropriation quickly to meet the needs of the disaster.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was enacted by Congress. Budget authority may also be indefinite in amount, as when Congress enacts language providing \"such sums as may be necessary\" to complete a project or purpose. Budget authority may be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year; any unobligated funds at the end of that year are no longer available for spending. Multi-year budget authority specifies a range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending; no-year budget authority is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time.", "Obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel, enter into contracts, receive services, and engage in similar transactions in a given fiscal year. Outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year. Because multi-year and no-year budget authorities may be obligated over a number of years, outlays do not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year. Additionally, budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year, especially with certain contracts.", "In sum, budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. Discretionary agencies and programs, and appropriated entitlement programs, are funded each year in appropriations acts.", "Discretionary and Mandatory Spending", "Gross budget authority, or the total funds available for spending by a federal agency, may consist of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority, but it excludes appropriations for entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year. However, some funds for mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending.", "Offsetting Collections", "Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, as part of a business-type transaction, such as offsets to outlays or collection of a fee. These funds are not counted as revenue. Instead, they are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority, or the total funds that are appropriated by Congress each year, consists of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending.", "Some collections offset a portion of an agency's discretionary budget authority. Other collections offset an agency's mandatory spending. These mandatory spending elements are typically entitlement programs under which individuals, businesses, or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts (pensions). Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, others by annual appropriations. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation and as such is not annually appropriated, whereas the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. In addition to these entitlements, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds. These funds are not appropriated by Congress. They are available for obligation and included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority.", "302(a) and 302(b) Allocations", "In general practice, the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations (including DHS) is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. Subsequently, these amounts are allocated among the appropriations committees, usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution. These amounts are known as the 302(a) allocations. They include discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the development of the bills. In the second stage of the process, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills. These amounts are known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must add up to no more than the 302(a) discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline, since any bill reported with a total above the ceiling is subject to a point of order. The House or Senate Appropriations Committee may adjust its 302(b) allocations during the year by issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the various appropriations bills progress towards final enactment.", "The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first appropriations bills affected by the Budget Control Act (BCA), which established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 through FY2021. For FY2014, the BCA initially set a separate cap for security spending, defined to include the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, Budget Function 150 for all international affairs programs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Intelligence Community Management Account that funds the offices of the Director of National Intelligence. With the failure of the supercommittee process to produce $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction and amendments made by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, the BCA now expresses its discretionary spending caps in terms of defense ($497 billion for FY2014) and non-defense ($469 billion for FY2014). DHS is included in the latter category. ", "In addition, the BCA allows for adjustments that would raise the statutory caps to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, emergency spending, and, to a limited extent, disaster relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and for controlling health care fraud and abuse. ", "When no agreement is reached between the House and Senate on a budget resolution to provide a common 302(a), each body generally takes its own approach to developing 302(b) allocations. In the House, 302(b)s were developed based on the House-passed budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 25 ), while in the Senate, they announced 302(b)s based on the non-sequester-adjusted allocations under the BCA.

The Administration has requested $5,785 million in disaster relief through DHS and the Small Business Administration (SBA) to be subject to the cap adjustment. P.L. 113-76 included $5,626 million in appropriations through DHS to be paid for by the allowable adjustment, but not the requested disaster relief funding for the SBA.

The Office of Management and Budget, as originally directed by the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, has published an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism. Beginning with the June 24, 2002, edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table B-1 is presented in such a way as to allow year-to-year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not account for all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 accounted for over 51% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense accounted for the next highest proportion at nearly 26% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice at 6%, and the Department of State at nearly 4% rounded out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. ", "It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security-related. Therefore, while the enacted FY2012 budget bills and existing law included total homeland security budget authority of $35.1 billion for DHS, the total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion. Moreover, the amounts shown in Table B-1 will not be consistent with total amounts shown elsewhere in the report. This same inconsistency between homeland security budget authority and requested total budget authority is also true for the budgets of the other agencies listed in the table. ", "Due to the fact that the Administration's FY2014 budget request was released without an estimate for FY2013 that accounted for P.L. 113-6 or the impact of sequestration, no authoritative data for FY2013 are available as of March 1, 2014."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
