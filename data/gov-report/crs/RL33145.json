The virus has since spread to more than 50 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, where it has killed millions of birds and infected more than 270 people, killing more than 160 of them. The virus bears some similarity to the deadly 1918 Spanish flu, which caused a global pandemic estimated to have killed more than 50 million people worldwide. The current spread of avian flu raises concerns about another human flu pandemic.", "Global pandemic preparedness and response efforts are coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Domestic preparedness efforts are led by the White House Homeland Security Council, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) playing a major role. Domestic response efforts would be carried out under the all-hazards blueprint for a coordinated federal, state and local response laid out in the National Response Plan, overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). HHS officials would have the lead in the public health and medical aspects of a response. The federal government has released several pandemic flu plans to govern federal, state, local and private preparedness activities.", "There are concerns about how a domestic public health and medical response would be managed during a flu pandemic. There is precedent, under the Stafford Act, for the President to declare an infectious disease threat an emergency (which provides a lower level of assistance), but no similar precedent for a major disaster declaration (which provides a higher level of assistance). In any case, many of the needs likely to result from a flu pandemic could not be met with the types of assistance provided pursuant to the Stafford Act, even if a major disaster declaration applied.", "Vaccination is the best flu prevention measure. But because of continuous changes in the genes of flu viruses, vaccines must be \"matched\" to specific strains to provide good protection. A pandemic flu strain would, by definition, be novel. Stockpiled vaccine would not match, so stockpiling in anticipation of a pandemic is of limited value. In addition, global and domestic capacity to produce flu vaccine is limited. The U.S. government, primarily through HHS, has launched an aggressive effort to expand domestic vaccine production capacity, and to develop technologies to support more rapid production of a matched vaccine at the onset of a pandemic.", "Since matched vaccine would not be available at the outset of a flu pandemic that occurred within the next several years, planning efforts focus on measures to slow the spread of disease, and mitigate its effects. These include stockpiling of antiviral drugs to prevent or treat flu infection, planning for medical surge capacity, and continuity planning for businesses and utilities.", "This report discusses pandemic flu in general, WHO and U.S. preparedness and response plans, and a number of relevant policy issues. The focus of this report is U.S. domestic public health preparedness and response planning, and the projected impacts of an influenza pandemic on Americans.

Most people have some immunity, and a vaccine is available. Avian (or bird) flu is caused by flu viruses that occur naturally in wild birds. The H5N1 strain of current concern is highly pathogenic in birds, deadly to domestic fowl, and can be transmitted from birds to humans. There is no human immunity, and no human vaccine is available. Pandemic flu is virulent human flu that causes a global outbreak, or pandemic, of serious illness. Because there is little natural immunity, the disease can spread easily from person to person. Currently, there is no pandemic flu.", "In this report, unless otherwise noted, the term pandemic will be used to refer to pandemic influenza.", "In 1997 a new strain of avian flu jumped from poultry directly to humans in Hong Kong, causing several human deaths. This was the first documented occurrence of direct transmission of an avian flu virus from birds to people. Despite efforts to contain the virus through culling of poultry flocks, the virus (designated as H5N1 for specific proteins on its surface) re-emerged in 2003. It has since been reported in domestic poultry and/or wild birds in more than 50 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. Also since 2003, it has infected more than 270 people (and killed more than 160 deaths) in ten countries. As of yet the virus has not developed the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person. Were that to occur, a global influenza pandemic could ensue.", "The high lethality of the H5N1 strain and its tendency to affect healthy young people remind health authorities of the deadly 1918 Spanish flu, which is estimated to have killed up to 2% of the world's population, and was a substantial cause of mortality in U.S. military personnel in World War I. The World Health Organization (WHO) says, \"If an influenza pandemic virus were to appear again similar to the one that struck in 1918, even taking into account the advances in medicine since then, unparalleled tolls of illness and death could be expected.\"", "U.S. and world health authorities believe that while periodic influenza pandemics are inevitable, their progress may be slowed, and their impacts blunted, by rapid detection and local control efforts. The added time would allow affected countries to better manage the situation, and countries not yet affected to better prepare. To realize these benefits, countries affected by avian flu must be able to track the spread of the virus in birds, and quickly detect and investigate suspected human cases. Hence, a country's capabilities in epidemiology, laboratory detection and other public health services affect the welfare of the global community as well as the country itself. This presents developed nations with novel policy challenges. For example, should they reserve scarce health resources such as antiviral drugs for themselves, or deploy them to other countries at the center of an emerging pandemic?", "WHO released an updated pandemic preparedness plan in early 2005. The United States released a draft pandemic plan in August 2004, and has since released a number of documents addressing government-wide planning, public health and medical preparedness, planning for critical infrastructure readiness, and others. (See the subsequent section, \"Pandemic Influenza Planning,\" for plans and descriptions.) States were required to prepare pandemic plans as a condition of their federal bioterrorism preparedness grants. The Administration has created a government-wide public website to disseminate information on pandemic flu preparedness and response activities.", "A recurring theme in planning documents and consultations is the need to engage sectors beyond healthcare and public health in planning. The Secretary of HHS, Michael Leavitt, has said, \"If a pandemic hits our shores, it will affect almost every sector of our society, not just health care, but transportation systems, workplaces, schools, public safety and more. It will require a coordinated government-wide response, including federal, state and local governments, and it will require the private sector and all of us as individuals to be ready.\" A 1918-style pandemic could be so severe that non-health-related essential services would be impaired by high absenteeism or supply chain disruptions, and health services could be in such short supply that law enforcement protection might be required for them. Though WHO does not recommend it, except in some narrow circumstances for pre-pandemic control, countries might seal their borders or take similar measures, with impacts on trade and commerce.", "If a flu pandemic were to occur in the next several years, the U.S. response would be affected by the limited availability of a vaccine (the best preventive measure for flu), as well as by limited availability of certain drugs used to treat severe flu infections, and by the general lack of surge capacity within our healthcare system. The U.S. healthcare system is largely private, while the public health system is largely based in state, rather than federal, authority. This structure creates numerous challenges in assuring the needed response capacity, and coordinating the various response elements. Planning is further complicated by the fact that while periodic influenza pandemics have been seen over the years, their timing and severity have been unpredictable.", "Domestic planning efforts presume that the National Response Plan (NRP), an all-hazards plan developed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), would be activated if needed to streamline the federal response to a pandemic. Pandemic flu is unlike most other threats, though. Since flu is communicable, there is no scene to secure, and all states might be affected nearly simultaneously. Thus, while a pandemic could cause catastrophic levels of illness and death, the nation's traditional disaster response mechanisms\u2014using geographical declarations of emergency and disaster, and state-to-state mutual aid\u2014may be ill-suited for this threat.", "This report discusses pandemic influenza in general, previous pandemics and their global and domestic impacts, and the possible impacts of another pandemic caused by the H5N1 avian flu strain. It also discusses WHO and U.S. preparedness plans and their context in broader emergency preparedness efforts. Finally, the report looks at a number of policy issues in pandemic influenza preparedness and response.

Though it does so with some regularity, influenza is not the only pathogen that can cause pandemics. A pandemic of the \"Black Death,\" which affected most of Europe in the 14 th century, is generally attributed to plague (technically Yersinia pestis) . The global spread of HIV/AIDS is often referred to as a pandemic. Literature offers numerous examples of such episodes of widespread contagion.", "Influenza is a virus that causes respiratory disease in humans, with typical symptoms of fever, cough, and muscle aches, and, rarely, pneumonia and death. Though primarily a human pathogen, influenza viruses also circulate and cause illness in swine, horses, mink, seals, and domestic poultry, and may be carried without apparent illness in these species as well as a number of species of waterfowl. Influenza is highly contagious in humans, spreading through direct contact and airborne exposure. The virus can also persist for several hours on inanimate objects such as toys or doorknobs. In addition, influenza is infectious before symptoms appear in its victims, which also enhances its spread.", "Influenza viruses have a genome composed of eight segments of RNA. In addition to random mutation, flu viruses also undergo change by shuffling or reassorting these gene segments among different strains. Human flu viruses are of two types: Influenza A and B. Influenza A strains are further identified by two important surface antigens (proteins) that are responsible for virulence: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Fifteen different H antigens and nine different N antigens have been identified in birds and mammals. Not all possible combinations of H and N antigens have been documented, and very few combinations have been shown to cause human illness. The avian flu strain causing great concern at this time is designated as H5N1 for its surface antigens.", "New influenza strains typically circle the globe within three to six months of emergence. New strains circulate each year, changing slightly from prior strains (called antigenic drift) . Each year the virus, its genome in constant flux, typically makes healthy people sick, but is generally not deadly. Healthy adults typically have partial immunity to new strains, but a newly formulated vaccine is required each year to provide full immunity. Now and then, often several times in a century, the virus changes enough through mutation or reassortment (called antigenic shift) that there is no partial immunity in the population. This event, an influenza pandemic, results in severe illness and death, even in healthy people. The extent and severity of illness, and the disabling impact on healthy young people, could cause serious disruptions in services and social order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pandemic Phases", "paragraphs": ["According to WHO, the hallmarks of an influenza pandemic are: (1) the emergence of a novel influenza virus strain; (2) the finding that the strain can cause human disease; and (3) sustained person-to-person transmission of the strain. Novel influenza viruses typically acquire these characteristics in phases. Table 1 shows the phases of an influenza pandemic as described by WHO. In the interpandemic period , there is no human circulation of novel viruses. During this period, there is annual circulation of common influenza viruses, which cause outbreaks each winter. In the pandemic alert period, a new strain is present, with increasing ability for human-to-human spread. During a pandemic period there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the new strain. Table 1 also shows the public health goals WHO recommends to slow the development and spread of novel virus strains as much as possible.

Federal officials mounted a vaccination campaign, and Congress provided liability protection for the manufacturer and federal injury compensation for those harmed by the vaccine. Ultimately, the virus did not spread, but the vaccine was linked with a rare neurological condition that affected more than 500 people and killed 32.

The WHO describes pandemic influenza and the situation with H5N1 as follows:", "... outbreaks ... caused by H5N1 are of particular concern because of their association with severe illness and a high case fatality. Of even greater concern is the uniqueness of the present H5N1 situation in Asia. Never before has an avian influenza virus with a documented ability to infect humans caused such widespread outbreaks in birds in so many countries. This unprecedented situation has significantly increased the risk for the emergence of an influenza pandemic.", "... The risk (of a pandemic) ... remains so long as H5N1 is present in an animal reservoir, thus allowing continuing opportunities for human exposure and infection. ... Most experts agree that control of the present outbreaks in poultry will take several months or even years. ... The recent detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds adds another layer of complexity to control.", "... The world may therefore remain on the verge of a pandemic for some time to come. At the same time, the unpredictability of influenza viruses and the speed with which transmissibility can improve means that the time for preparedness planning is right now. Such a task takes on added urgency because of the prospects opened by recent research: good planning and preparedness might mitigate the enormous consequences of a pandemic, and this opportunity must not be missed.", "The H5N1 strain now circulating has been especially virulent in both human and avian hosts. Studies suggest that the virus prompts an over-reaction of the inflammatory response in some human victims, causing rapid and severe damage to the lungs. This primary damage cannot be remedied with antibiotics or antiviral drugs. Victims may require mechanical ventilation, and may succumb despite swift and capable care. In 2004, scientists published the results of research in which they sequenced several genes from the 1918 pandemic strain. These genes, when inserted into flu viruses and used to infect mice, were found to have a similar property. Recently, scientists re-created and published the entire genome of the 1918 strain, reinforcing this finding. This property may explain the high lethality of both the 1918 and H5N1 strains in apparently healthy young people.", "The H5N1 avian flu may never slip its moorings as a bird pathogen and become a serious human threat. But that possibility is a worst-case scenario for the world's public health experts. Should H5N1 become a pandemic strain, scientists are concerned that it may retain much of its virulence as it changes to a more transmissible form.

In 2004 in the Canadian province of British Columbia, an H7N3 avian influenza strain in commercial poultry was found to have infected at least two people. While both recovered, WHO issued a pandemic alert for the Canadian outbreak.

These projected impacts would occur over a compressed time frame of several weeks or a few months, rather than spread over a full year.", "Simple extrapolations of health effects from events in 1918 do not account for advances in medical care that have occurred since then. Antibiotics are now available to treat bacterial pneumonia that often results from influenza infection, and sophisticated respiratory care is now available to treat those with severe pneumonia. Experts caution, though, that the H5N1 avian flu virus can cause severe primary damage to the lungs. If this strain were to launch a pandemic and retain this trait, large numbers of victims may require intensive care and ventilatory support, likely exceeding national capacity to provide this level of care.

To accomplish that when resources are scarce, resources would be given to those most likely to survive or to have better outcomes as a result, to the extent that one could determine who those people were. Conversely, treatment would be withheld from those who were unlikely to benefit, so that others may. The HHS proposal has prompted considerable debate about strategies for withholding resources during a pandemic, and shown that rationing schemes to optimize one goal (e.g., equity and fairness) may conflict with schemes to optimize another (e.g., slowing disease transmission).

Individuals of any age alleging injury from any covered vaccine must seek compensation through the program first, though they may decline a proposed award and then sue in court. In the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), Congress added trivalent flu vaccine\u2014the annual vaccine that contains three flu strains\u2014to the Vaccine Injury Table, a list of vaccines covered under VICP.

Division C of the act limits liability with respect to countermeasures (including vaccine) for pandemic flu and other public health emergencies. Specifically, upon a declaration by the Secretary of HHS of a public health emergency, or the credible risk of such emergency, the act would, with respect to a \"covered countermeasure,\" eliminate liability (except in the case of willful misconduct) for the United States, and for manufacturers, distributors, program planners, persons who prescribe, administer or dispense the countermeasure, and employees of any of the above.", "On February 1, 2007, HHS Secretary Leavitt made a declaration of emergency pursuant to P.L. 109-148 , saying he had \"determined there is a credible risk that the spread of avian influenza viruses and resulting disease could in the future constitute a public health emergency,\" triggering liability protections solely for \"pandemic countermeasure influenza A (H5N1) vaccine....\" The declaration is effective from December 1, 2006 through February 28, 2010.", "P.L. 109-148 also called for the establishment in the Treasury of the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund\" to provide compensation to eligible individuals for covered injuries (i.e., serious physical injury or death) directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure during a declared public health emergency, depending upon an appropriation to the fund.

In January 1976, a novel influenza strain (\"swine flu\") emerged in New Jersey. In March, the Ford Administration announced a campaign to vaccinate the U.S. population by December. On August 18, Congress passed P.L. 94-380 , the National Swine Flu Immunization Program of 1976. Among other provisions, the law shielded manufacturers, distributors, and public or private organizations that would administer the vaccine, from claims of injury or death that might result, and established that all such claims would be asserted directly against the United States. More than 40 million civilians were vaccinated against swine flu between October 1 and December 16. The campaign was suspended at that time due to several cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a potentially serious neurological condition causing paralysis and sometimes death, suspected to have been caused by the vaccine. Meanwhile, a flu pandemic never emerged. The worrisome virus from New Jersey never led to a global pandemic, or even to localized outbreaks. The federal government ultimately paid out $93 million to individuals injured by the vaccine.", "Analysts have commented that delays in indemnifying manufacturers threatened the availability of swine flu vaccine in 1976, while delays in providing for injury compensation compromised voluntary participation in the civilian smallpox vaccine campaign in 2003.

The program, which is administered by CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was expanded in statute following the anthrax attacks of 2001. An interagency working group determines which pathogens to place on the list of Select Agents. Once an organism is listed, those individuals and facilities working with it must be registered, undergo background investigations, and follow various guidelines in facility maintenance and management, shipping, recordkeeping and other practices. The list does not include common human strains of influenza, though it does include highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, i.e., strains which are shown to cause disease in commercial poultry. As such, H5N1 influenza is a listed pathogen. When scientists from the CDC and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology recently re-created the 1918 pandemic flu virus, since it was a human influenza virus, it was not on the Select Agent list. It was subsequently added by HHS Secretary Leavitt on October 20, 2005. Other flu strains that typically affect humans (rather than birds) remain unregulated at this time.", "When asked about the possibility that influenza viruses could be used deliberately as biological weapons, CDC Director Julie Gerberding replied, \"... we recognize that influenza has some of the important characteristics of an excellent threat agent. It's easily transmissible, it's relatively easy to produce and it's very easy to modify or engineer. So it does have characteristics that if a person was intent on modifying ..., it is not beyond our imagination to consider that beyond our preparedness efforts.\" Dr. Gerberding also noted the natural behavior of the virus, which constantly shuffles its genes to produce new combinations, saying that \"mother nature herself is a very effective terrorist.\"", "If H5N1 avian flu were to cause a human pandemic, it would be reasonable to assume it was a natural event. Nonetheless, since influenza viruses are amenable to intentional manipulation, the Implementation Plan states that in the event of a pandemic, \"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will closely monitor events through coordination with the [CDC] and take appropriate action in the event that it is suspected that there was deliberate human intervention in the spread of the pandemic.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
