The legislation funds all U.S. bilateral developmentassistance programs, managed mostly by the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), together with several smaller independent foreign aidagencies, such as the Peace Corps and the Inter-American and African DevelopmentFoundations. Most humanitarian aid activities are funded within Foreign Operations,including USAID's disaster program and State Department's refugee relief support.

Congress has not enacted a foreign aidauthorization bill since 1985, leaving most foreign assistance programs withoutregular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees. As aresult, Foreign Operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largelythrough Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States has modified aidpolicy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War.

A dominant characteristic of ForeignOperations funding trends in the most recent years has been the degree to which foreign policy contingencies and international disasters have created demands foradditional resources beyond those originally requested by the President. Congress approved substantial amounts for FY1999 and FY2000 through \"emergency\" orsupplemental appropriation mechanisms, amounts that are over and above what isenacted in \"regular\" Foreign Operations bills.", "After peaking at $20.7 billion in FY1985, Foreign Operations appropriations began a period of decline, falling to about $12.3 billion in FY1997. Foreign aidspending cuts were especially sharp in FY1996 when Congress cut funding by $1.15billion, nearly 9% from the previous year. Many government and non-governmentexperts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined U.S. foreign policyinterests and limited the ability of American officials to influence overseas events. ", "After Foreign Operations funding levels fell again in FY1997 -- although by much smaller amounts -- the State Department and other executive agencieslaunched an aggressive campaign to reverse the decade-long decline in the foreignpolicy budget. This effort coincided with congressional approval of a near $1 billionincrease for FY1998, setting Foreign Operations appropriations at $13.15 billion. Foreign Operations funds rose again to $15.4 billion in FY1999 when lawmakers, atthe urging of the White House, added nearly $900 million in the final days of the105th Congress and another $2.1 billion for Central American hurricane relief andKosovo emergency assistance in supplemental funding.", "Amounts enacted for FY2000 - $16.5 billion - were also augmented by late-year \"emergency\" add-ons recommended by the President, including $1.8 billionfor the Wye River/Middle East peace accord and $1.1 billion supplementalassistance, mostly for a new counternarcotics initiative in Colombia. As shown in Table 2 , the amount for FY2000 is the highest in six years and the largest fundinglevel, in nominal terms, for Foreign Operations since FY1985. Nevertheless, whencalculated using constant dollars - taking into account the effects of inflation -FY2000 Foreign Operations amounts are 47% less than the high point of FY1985,15% less than the annual average appropriation during the late 1980s, and 3% lessthan FY1992, a year that might be considered the first post-Cold War foreign aidbudget. FY2000 Foreign Operations spending level represents 0.91% of the entirefederal budget and 2.8% of total discretionary budget authority. By comparison,these same figures in FY1985 were 2% and 4.6%, respectively.", " Table 2.

Following this, House and Senate Appropriations Committees separately decide howto allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees, staying within thefunctional guidelines set in the budget resolution. This second step is referred to asthe Section 302(b) allocation. As noted above, foreign policy funds are appropriatedwithin four bills with Foreign Operations having the largest share of around 67-70%in most years.", "How much foreign policy money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees, and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs remain decisionsexclusively reserved for the Appropriations Committees.

In the House,Foreign Operations programs received $13.28 billion, sharply below the President's$15.1 billion request ($14.8 billion if Plan Colombia funds were enacted, as theywere, in FY2000; see footnote 3).

In 1999, forexample, House and Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittees received allocationsof $12.6 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, levels which established the ceilingfor House and Senate passed bills ( H.R. 2606 and S. 1234 ). Nevertheless, following a Presidential veto of H.R. 2606 because of lowfunding levels and continued White House pressure to raise foreign aid spending,during end-of-the session negotiations, Congress agreed to $15.3 billion for ForeignOperations. Much of the additional funds were designated as \"emergency\"appropriations, amounts that did not count against allocation limits.", "Although the early 302(b) allocation for Foreign Operations resulted in House and Senate bills of around $13.3 billion, the Administration pressed for additionalfunding throughout the process. Between June and October House and SenateAppropriations Committees filed numerous revisions to the original 302(b)allocations, culminating on October 25 in a new Foreign Operations level of $14.9billion.

Using these reference points, the FY2001 budget recommendation wasabout $1.4 billion, or 8% less than total FY2000 appropriations.

Officials argue that U.S. aid is justified until countries reach a point of sustainabilitythat no longer requires external aid.

In the followingyears, when Congress deadlocked over abortion-related restrictions and U.S.population aid policy, a situation that blocked movement of the entire ForeignOperations bill, lawmakers adopted interim provisions that, among other things,strictly limited the amount of funding for USAID family planning programs. Theappropriation cap of $385 million enacted in each of FY1997-FY2000 is roughlytwo-thirds the amount provided in FY1995.", "The principal dispute over population assistance, however, goes well beyond funding issues, centering more directly on abortion-related activities of foreignrecipients of USAID grants. For over 15 years, Congress has engaged in contentiousdebates over U.S. international family planning policy, often as part of the ForeignOperations Appropriations.", "Family Planning and Abortion Restrictions. The debate over international family planning policyand abortion began nearly three decades ago when Congress added a provision to theForeign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. appropriated funds forabortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. During themid-1980s, in what has become known as the \"Mexico City\" policy (because it wasfirst announced at the 1984 Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan, andlater the Bush, Administrations restricted funds for foreign non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions incountries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S.funds . Several groups, including International Planned ParenthoodFederation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support. Insome years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition, butWhite House vetoes kept the policy in place. President Clinton in 1993 reversed theposition of his two predecessors, allowing the United States to resume funding forall family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money was used by thoseinvolved in abortion-related work.", "During the past five years, the House and Senate have taken opposing positions on the Mexico City issue that in each case held up enactment of the final ForeignOperations spending measure. The House position, sponsored by RepresentativeSmith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policy restrictingU.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or inlobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. The Senate, on theother hand, has rejected in most cases House provisions dealing with Mexico Citypolicy, favoring a position that leaves these decisions in the hands of theAdministration. Moreover, Administration officials routinely said that PresidentClinton would veto any bills that included the House-passed Mexico City restrictions,a threat he carried out in October 1998 when he rejected legislation authorizingfamily planning programs that included Mexico City policy ( H.R. 1757 ).", "Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-FY1999 that did not resolve the broad populationprogram controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure to moveforward. The annual \"compromise\" removed House-added Mexico City restrictions,but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in several years, \"metered\"the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385 million per month.", "The FY2000 debate, however, concluded far differently than the previous four years. As Congress and the White House searched in November 1999 for a finalFY2000 budget agreement, international family planning and population aid issuesbecame one of the last and most contentious aspects of the negotiations. Congressional leaders insisted that if the President wanted Congress to approvelegislation authorizing the payment of nearly $1 billion of U.S. arrears owed to theUnited Nations, the White House must also accept revised Mexico City languageadding abortion restrictions to U.S. population assistance policy. In order to removethe obstacles to U.N. arrears payments, a reluctant President Clinton agreed to theabortion restrictions, marking the first time that Mexico City conditions had beenincluded in legislation signed by the President.

A key issue has been whether the $15 million intotal grants allowed under the waiver authority was sufficient to cover all foreignorganizations that declined to certify regarding their involvement in abortion-relatedactivities. Although there is still some uncertainty about how many groups have notresponded because they disagree with the certification terms, IPPF-London and theWorld Health Organization have refused. At some point, USAID will review thecases of all foreign organizations that have not responded or declined to certify - ninecurrently - and decide how to allocate the $15 million available to such groups. Agency officials believe that they will not exceed the $15 million cap. ", "Critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds. From an administrative standpoint, they say it will increase USAID costs to manage familyplanning programs because of the additional paperwork and will delayimplementation of projects. (USAID has contracted with John Snow, Inc. to trackthe certification process.) They further believe that family planning organizationswill cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of therestrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for USAID funding. Opponentsalso believe the new conditions will undermine relations between the U.S.Government and foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, creating a situation wherethe United States challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money andimposes a so-called \"gag\" order on their ability to promote changes to abortion lawsand regulations in developing nations. The latter, these critics note, would beunconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the United States. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent lawbans USAID funds from being used to perform or promote abortions, money isfungible; that organizations receiving American-taxpayer funding can simply useUSAID resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from othersources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations. Thecertification process, they contend, stops the fungibility \"loophole.\"", "President Clinton said he would oppose any attempt to extend the abortion restrictions beyond September 30, 2000. Supporters of his position introducedseveral bills in 2000 that would effectively reverse the Mexico City language, byeither:", "making the eligibility requirements for NGOs and multilateral organizations no more restrictive than those that apply to foreign governments( H.R. 3634 and S. 2380 ); ", "subjecting foreign groups (concerning the use of non-USAID funding for advocacy and lobbying activities) to the same restrictions imposed onU.S. NGOs, and maintaining their eligibility so long as these groups do not engagein health or medical services in violation of the laws of the country in which theyoperate or which would violate U.S. law if provided here ( H.R. 4211 ).", "Supporters of the certification process pressed for continuation of the restrictions in the FY2001 funding bill in order to further institutionalize them.", "UNFPA Issues. Congress further enacted for FY2000 restrictions on U.S. contributions to the U.N. Population Fund(UNFPA). During the Reagan and Bush Administrations the United States did notsupport UNFPA, a policy reversed by President Clinton in 1993. At issue areUNFPA programs in China, a country where there have been continuing reports for many years of coercive family planning practices. During the mid-1990s, Congressreduced UNFPA contributions by the amount the organization spent in China, butwhen UNFPA ended its China program in 1997, the controversy subsided. UNFPA,however, reinstituted activities in China soon thereafter, resulting in the withholdingin FY1998 of $5 million for UNFPA and the enactment for FY1999 of a totalprohibition on the U.S. $25 million contribution, so long as the organizationremained active in China. Congress restored the $25 million earmark for UNFPA inFY2000, but under terms that required a deduction of $3.5 million (the cost ofUNFPA's 2000 program in China).", "Coercive Family Planning Practices and Peru. A new element in the family planning issue added during theFY1999 debate emerged following reports that Peru, where USAID has populationaid programs, had established national targets for tubal ligations and vasectomies. There were also allegations that some Peruvian health workers may have conditionedthe receipt of food and medical care on the acceptance of sterilizations. USAIDmaintains a policy of strict voluntarism for family planning programs it supports, andopposes the use of performance-based quota systems. The Agency says that Peru'sgovernment has instituted significant reforms in its family planning programs,including criteria that ensure voluntary informed consent. To reinforce U.S. policiesopposing programs based on coercive practices or quota systems, Congress adoptedfor FY1999 an amendment by Representative Tiahrt that more precisely defines theterm voluntary family planning programs, and establishes criteria for USAID to applyregarding the voluntary nature of its population projects. These same provisionswere continued in the FY2000 appropriation. (14)", "Congressional Action. S. 2522 earmarked $425 million for population assistance out ofdevelopment assistance funding, a level which, when combined with resources fromother accounts, would provide about $482 million for family planning activities.

Specifically,the conditions stipulated that such organizations:", "shall not be subject to requirements regarding how they use non-U.S. Government funds for advocacy or lobbying activities that are morerestrictive that those that apply to U.S. NGOs which receive economic aid grants;and", "shall not be ineligible for USAID grants solely on the basis ofhealth or medical services provided with non-U.S. Government funds so long as suchservices do not violate the laws of the country in which they are provided or wouldnot violate U.S. Federal law if provided in this country.", "It is generally held that under the Constitution, U.S. NGOs cannot be restricted from using their own funds to advocate policy positions they support. The first newcondition would essentially extend that protection to foreign NGOs and multilateralorganizations. The second condition would not disqualify an organization fromreceiving USAID grants for performing abortions with its own money if abortion orwhatever medical service it provided was legal in the country in which it operated,and that the service would be legal in the United States if performed here.", "H.R. 4811 made no change in current law, allowing the restrictions established in the FY2000 appropriations to continue. Duringsubcommittee markup, the Foreign Operations panel rejected (7-8) an amendment byRepresentative Lowey to remove the abortion restrictions from the bill. A similaramendment during full Committee mark-up also failed 26-34, and, on the Housefloor, another amendment was rejected (Greenwood, 206-221) that would haveremoved the restrictions. H.R. 4811 further continued currentconditions on UNFPA contributions. The bill provided $385 million for populationassistance, far below the President's $542 million request.

None of the $425 millionappropriation could be obligated until after February 15, 2001, a provision thatallowed the new President to decide which policy to apply. On January 22, 2001,two days after taking office, President Bush issued a Memorandum to the USAIDAdministrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from President Clinton anddirecting the Administrator to \"reinstate in full all of the requirements of the MexicoCity Policy in effect on January 19, 1993.\" The President further said that it was his\"conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocateor actively promote abortion, either here or abroad.\" (15) A separate statement from thePresident's press secretary stated that President Bush was \"committed to maintainingthe $425 million funding level\" for population assistance \"because he knows that oneof the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planningservices.\" The press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that anyrestrictions \"do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused bylegal or illegal abortions, for example, post abortion care.\" (16) On February 15, the dayon which FY2001 population aid funds became available for obligation, USAIDissued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the President'sdirective.

Others argued that not enough has beenreallocated to Africa to meet the region's unmet needs and to promote futureU.S.-African trade opportunities.", "When the share of bilateral Foreign Operations funding for the Middle East exceeded 60%, some in Congress began promoting the view that there should besome limits to the amount provided. If the Administration wanted to pursue newMiddle East peace initiatives using foreign aid as an implementing tool, they argued,resources should be found either within existing Middle East programs or providedon top of overall aid appropriations, rather than being taken from other regions.", " Table 6. Regional Allocations of U.S. Aid (In millions of dollars; % of bilateral total in ForeignOperations)", "Source: USAID. Amounts in the this table exclude food aid funded in the Agriculture Appropriations measure.", "* FY1999 includes Central America hurricane reconstruction ($613 million). ", "** FY2000 includes supplemental funding for Plan Colombia ($1.1 billion), Balkanaid ($50 million), and southern Africa flood relief ($25 million).", "Accordingly, for FY1998 Congress took steps to legislate a cap on Foreign Operations resources for the Middle East. At the initiative of RepresentativeCallahan, Chairman of the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, lawmakersstipulated in the FY1998 funding measure (Section 586 of P.L. 105-118 ) that selectedMiddle East nations and regional programs could not receive more than $5.4 billionof the total appropriation. For FY2000, the Middle East aid cap was lowered to $5.3billion. Shortly after Congress initiated a Middle East aid ceiling, Israel put forth inJanuary 1998 a plan to cut aid received from the United States over the next 10 to 12years. Under the Israeli plan, the United States would reduce economic aid by $120million each year for about ten years, while increasing military assistance by $60million annually. At the end of the period, Israel would be receiving an annualappropriation of $2.4 billion in military aid but no longer receiving any economicassistance. If done over a 10-year period, U.S. aid to Israel would fall $60 millioneach year in net terms, with a total savings of $600 million by 2009. Since FY1999,Congress has supported the $60 million net reduction of aid to Israel, also adding asimilar $40 million economic aid cut for Egypt.", "The President's FY2001 Foreign Operations request reflected several of these regional allocation views expressed by Congress in recent years. Highlights of theAdministration's recommendations included the following.", "Creation of the Development Fund for Africa Account. (18) After a 5-year absence, thePresident proposed tore-establish a separate Foreign Operations account for African aid and to increasebilateral funding (including economic and military assistance) by 16% over FY2000levels. In the late 1980s, Congress and the Administration launched a joint initiativeto create special legislative authority for U.S. economic aid to Africa. TheDevelopment Fund for Africa (DFA -- authorized in Chapter 10 of the ForeignAssistance Act of 1961) was intended to extend more flexibility to USAID programmanagers and to protect aid resources for Africa from being transferred to otherregions as new foreign policy crises unfolded. At its peak, the United Stateschanneled about $800 million annually through the DFA. ", "Although the DFA authorization law remained in force, Congress ended the practice of a direct DFA appropriation in FY1996, funding Africa's assistance out ofworldwide development aid and child survival accounts. Following PresidentClinton's visit to Africa in 1998, during which he pledged to restore U.S. aid tohigher levels provided in previous years, the Administration proposed a direct DFAappropriation account for FY2000. Congress rejected the DFA recommendation butapproved sufficient development funds so that Africa's level grew from $703 millionin FY1999 to $737 million estimated for FY2000. ", "The FY2001 request once again sought the restoration of the DFA account, that when combined with child survival funds would allocate $836 million to Africa, anincrease of $99 million. Although some of the additional assistance would supportthe HIV/AIDS initiative, family planning and other health activities would receivesubstantial increases. The request for activities financed under the Economic SupportFund, an aid account used for political and security purposes, rose by one-third overFY2000, largely for democracy and economic growth initiatives for countries intransition. Military aid would have grown from about $20 million in FY2000 to $27million, with the largest increase for stabilizing regional security situations throughthe promotion of democratic transition within the militaries of countries such asNigeria, and to assist African forces participate in regional peacekeeping operations. Nigeria, which is one of the State Department's four worldwide aid \"focus\" countriesfor FY2001 (along with Ukraine, Indonesia, and Colombia) would be the largest ($81million) African recipient of economic and military assistance (excluding food aid),followed by Uganda ($54 million), Mozambique ($47 million), and Ethiopia ($41million).", "Increased Funding for Asia. The FY2001 foreign aid budget proposed significant increases in assistance programsthroughout the Asian region. The $568 million requested was nearly $137 million,or 32% higher than allocations for FY2000. This follows a 17% increase in FY2000year for Asia compared with FY1999. The higher amounts would be drawn inroughly equal levels between development and ESF accounts. Of particular prioritywere economic growth programs aimed at helping economic recovery in southeastAsia. Indonesia, another of the Administration's four aid \"focus\" countries, wouldbe by far the largest recipient of U.S. economic assistance ($130 million). Another$10 million was scheduled for East Timor. India ($72 million), Bangladesh ($69million), and the Philippines ($45 million) follow as other leading economic aidrecipients in the region. For each of these three, the FY2001 proposed allocationswere roughly 50% higher than those for FY2000.", "Modest Increases for Most Latin America Programs; Major Counternarcotics Initiative for Colombia. Aidallocations for Latin America surged in FY1999, largely due to the $613 millionemergency relief package approved to aid the victims of Hurricane Mitch that struckCentral America in late 1998. Assistance to the region increased again for FY2000due to a $1.1 billion add-on for counternarcotics in Colombia. For FY2001, regulareconomic, anti-drug, and military assistance for Latin America would total $754million. Counternarcotics aid continued to be a primary focus of assistance to LatinAmerica, accounting for 29% of total resources in the FY2001 request.", "Overshadowing continuing Latin American aid programs has been the FY2000/2001 $1.1 billion counternarcotics initiative for Colombia and other drug-producing nations in the region. (Including resources requested from Defense andJustice Department budgets, \"Plan Colombia,\" as the initiative has been labeled,totals $1.272 billion over two years.) The major, and arguably most controversial,component ($600 million) of the initiative is \"Push into Southern Colombia,\"designed to help the Colombian government extend anti-drug efforts throughoutsouthern Colombia where coca cultivation is expanding and where Colombianguerrillas operate. This would include training and equipping two new armycounternarcotics battalions and purchasing Black Hawk and Huey helicopters totransport them. On June 29, Congress cleared for the White House ( P.L. 106-246 )a $1.3 billion supplemental for Colombia ($1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds)that closely matched the President's funding request but imposed a number of policychanges and conditions on the assistance. (19)", "Peru and Bolivia, each scheduled to receive $98 million in FY2001, top the list of Latin American aid recipients. Haiti ($51 million) and Guatemala ($50 million)were also prominent aid recipients planned for FY2001. Colombia, however, hasemerged in recent years as one of the main benefactors of U.S. assistance worldwide,representing the fifth largest recipient in FY1999 behind Israel, Egypt, Jordan, andUkraine. With passage of the counternarcotics initiative, Colombia has become thethird top aid recipient worldwide for FY2000.", "Middle East Aid Reduced Slightly for FY2001. The President's FY2001 foreign aid request for theMiddle East reduced slightly - from $5.278 billion to $5.216 billion - U.S.assistance to the region when compared with regular programs for FY2000(excluding Wye River accord funding). This is largely the result of continuing forthe third year a ten-year plan to downsize aid to Israel and Egypt. The $2.82 billionfor Israel would be $60 million less than earmarked for FY2000, and the $1.996billion for Egypt was $40 million below FY2000 levels. (20) Enactment for FY2000 ofa one-time, $1.8 billion Wye River/Middle East peace accord aid package supportingIsrael, Jordan, and the Palestinians, pushed total Middle East aid levels far higher inthat year. No equivalent initiative was proposed for FY2001. (21) Palestinian assistancein FY2001 was scheduled for $100 million, up from the FY2000 $85 million regularprogram.", "Another element of the FY2001 Middle East recommendation concerned Egypt's request to receive part of its military assistance early in the fiscal year ratherthan over a much longer period of time as payments become due for defensepurchases. For a number of years, Congress has directed that economic and militaryaid for Israel be disbursed within the first month of a new fiscal year, allowing Israelto invest the funds and earn interest prior to using the money to service debt owed tothe United States and make payments on military procurements. Last year, theAdministration asked Congress to allow Egypt to receive $475 million in \"earlydisbursements,\" an action that would have increased Foreign Operations outlays byan equivalent amount. With extremely tight limits on outlays for FY2000, theAppropriation Committees could not accommodate the request. Instead, however,Congress added $25 million for Egypt under the Wye River aid package, an amountroughly equal to the interest Egypt would have gained from an early disbursement. For FY2001, the Administration proposed a somewhat different mechanism toachieve the same purpose: that Egypt receive by October 31, 2000 (or within 30 daysof enactment of the appropriation, whichever is later) the amount of military aid thatOMB estimates will be disbursed to Egypt throughout FY2001. Egypt would placethe funds in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve, and earn about $25to $30 million during the course of the year. The advantage of this plan from abudget standpoint was that it would not increase outlays over current projections.", "Flat Budget Request for Russia and Other Former Soviet States; Increase for Kosovo. After several years of disputesbetween Congress and the President over proposals to sharply increase assistance toRussia and the other nations comprising the former Soviet region, theAdministration's FY2001 request of $830 million for economic assistance was nearlyidentical to amounts allocated for FY2000. Distribution among recipients, however,changed somewhat from FY2000. Russia's bilateral aid would fall from $178million to $162 million, while Ukraine, another Administration aid \"focus\" country,would see its assistance rise from $160 million to $171 million. U.S. assistance toArmenia and Georgia, countries which have received higher levels in the pastbecause of congressional earmarks, would be cut in FY2001, to $75 million and $86million, respectively.

At the Cologne Summit in June 1999, G-7 leaders endorsed asubstantial expansion of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative largelyalong the lines of policy changes recommended by the United States and Britain. TheWorld Bank and IMF, institutions that manage HIPC debt relief, adopted theseenhancements in September. In late 1999, Congress approved some of the legislationrequested by the Administration for full U.S. participation in HIPC, but left severalmatters incomplete, primarily those associated with the cancellation of multilateraldebts. In 2000, the White House sought congressional approval for authorizing andappropriating issues left over from 1999.", "For the past decade, the United States has engaged in various forms of debt relief for developing nations, resulting in the cancellation of about $14.7 billion offoreign debt. Much of it -- $10.1 billion -- resulted from special cases involvingkey U.S. national interests: for Egypt in 1990 ($7 billion), for Poland in 1991 ($2.5billion), and for Jordan in 1995 ($635 million). U.S. debt reduction policy for othernations based strictly on need has been guided by the principle that eligible countriesmust have demonstrated a strong and sustained commitment to economic policyreforms prior to receiving debt relief. Under budget rules instituted in 1992,Congress has had to appropriate funds in advance representing the costs of cancelingdebt. The cost determination methodology is based on a complicated formula thattakes into account, among other things, the loan's net present value, its interest rate,and the likelihood the loan will be repaid. For especially poor countries withparticularly large debt overhangs, the appropriation requirement may be quite smallrelative to the loan's face value -- perhaps 10% or less.", "When it was introduced in 1996, HIPC was hailed as the first arrangement that included relief from debts owed to the World Bank, the IMF, and other internationalinstitutions, organizations that hold over 25% of debt owed by the most heavilyindebted nations. Previously, multilateral organizations had declined to participatein debt cancellation, arguing that it would increase their costs of raising new moneyto lend, expenses that would have to be passed on to borrowers. Forty-one countries-- mostly in Africa -- are eligible for HIPC, although only those determined to have\"unsustainable\" debt would qualify for HIPC terms.", "The initial HIPC framework came under heavy criticism in early 1999, especially among non-governmental organizations and religious groups working indeveloping countries. They charged that HIPC terms were not deep enough -- that90% or 100% of bilateral debt owed should be canceled, and that six years was a fartoo long qualification period for full HIPC relief. They further believed that thenon-sustainable debt criteria, based largely on a ratio of a country's debt-to-exports,was too high and therefore excluded many countries that were also in need of debtrelief. Some critics opposed the economic reform requirements and argued forunconditional debt reduction. A number of organizations further advocatedinstituting mechanisms that would ensure that savings realized by debtorgovernments would be channeled into spending on basic services, such as health andeducation, that would improve the quality of life of the very poor. Many of thesearguments were reflected in legislative initiatives launched in 1999, including H.R. 1095 (Debt Relief Poverty Reduction Act of 1999), H.R. 772 (Hope for Africa Act), H.R. 2232 (Debt Reliefand Development in Africa Act of 1999), and S. 1690 (Debt Relief forPoor Countries Act of 1999).
