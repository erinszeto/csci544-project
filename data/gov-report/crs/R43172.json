TVA currently has approximately $24.1 billion in indebtedness in outstanding bonds and notes which counts toward the statutory cap of $30 billion (which has been in place since 1979). TVA's debts are paid solely from TVA's net proceeds for the sale of electricity. TVA's debts are not guaranteed by, nor are they obligations of, the federal government.

Congress may want to consider various options for TVA, which range from allowing TVA to continue as it does, funding its capital needs from operating revenues and power program financings, to modifying TVA's missions. Congress may also opt to redefine TVA's status and designation as a government corporation. Since TVA debt securities are not obligations of the U.S. government and do not carry a government guarantee, TVA's current indebtedness has arguably little or no real impact on the federal budget. Congress may also wish to examine the issue of TVA's indebtedness and investigate potential options. These may include raising the statutory limit thus allowing TVA to fund the projected investment, examining TVA's capital investment plans and process, investigating ways to reduce TVA's statutory cap with an eye to reducing the impact on the federal deficit, or looking at ways to restructure TVA's indebtedness, with a goal of either reducing or paying off TVA's indebtedness.", "TVA's principal mission is arguably the minimization of flood damage and stewardship of water resources and navigation, with the dams on TVA's system being key to this mission and power generation arguably being a secondary concern. The operation of multiple use dams must be designed to accommodate several objectives, and releases of water for hydroelectric generation can also contribute to other water uses.
