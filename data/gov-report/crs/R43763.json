For example, the maximum value of the credit in 2014 is $496 for claimants with zero children; $3,305 for claimants with one qualifying child; $5,460 for claimants with two qualifying children; and $6,143 for claimants with three or more qualifying children. In addition, tax filers who have no qualifying children must be between 25 and 64 years of age to be eligible for the EITC. Childless taxpayers under 25 and older than 64 years of age are not eligible for the credit.
