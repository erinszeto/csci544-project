Tank owners, EPA, states, and industry are concerned that a new wave of leaks could occur as the amount of ethanol blended in gasoline increases to meet EISA renewable fuel requirements.

As these standards are finalized, the states will face a need to expand their monitoring networks, identify nonattainment areas, and develop and implement plans for bringing nonattainment areas into attainment.", "EPA's diesel emission reduction grants program also generated interest during debate of EPA's FY2011 appropriations. The FY2011 appropriation of $49.9 million was below the $60.0 million FY2010 appropriation and the same amount in the President's FY2011 request. The ARRA ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided an additional $300.0 million in supplemental funds for these grants in FY2009 for a total of $360.0 million in FY2009, much of which was awarded in FY2010 (see Table B -1 in Appendix B ). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $200.0 million annually for these grants from FY2007 through FY2011. EPA was authorized to award grants on a competitive basis to assist regional, state, and local governments, tribes, and non-profit organizations in funding projects that would reduce emissions from diesel-powered vehicles, engines, and equipment. Port authorities and school districts have been among the major grant recipients. EPA has reported that every dollar spent on diesel emission reductions generates up to $13.00 in health benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Climate Change/Greenhouse Gas Reduction60", "paragraphs": ["A prominent issue of debate related to air quality had relatively little budgetary impact, but received a great deal of attention as EPA proceeds with its response to a 2007 Supreme Court decision. The decision, Massachusetts v. EPA , found greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be \"air pollutants\" within the Clean Air Act's definition of that term, and required EPA to consider whether GHGs endanger public health or welfare, the first step in promulgating emission standards. In December 2009, EPA formally responded to the Court decision by promulgating a finding that greenhouse gases endanger both public health and welfare. The agency also found that emissions of four specific GHGs from new motor vehicles contribute to that air pollution and must be controlled. Pursuant to these findings, EPA promulgated standards for light-duty motor vehicles, including cars and SUVs, in May 2010. The implementation of these standards, in turn, triggered permitting and Best Available Control Technology requirements for new major stationary sources of GHGs on January 2, 2011.", "The motor vehicle standards promulgated in May 2010 have not been particularly controversial, as they were negotiated with the automobile manufacturers and other interested parties. Besides setting emission standards, the negotiated agreement requires California and 13 other states that had been proceeding to implement motor vehicle GHG standards of their own to instead adopt standards that are essentially identical to the federal standards.", "It is the triggering of standards for stationary sources (power plants, manufacturing facilities, and others) that has raised the most concern, resulting in efforts by many in Congress to prevent EPA from implementing stationary source GHG emission requirements. These efforts have taken several forms, including the introduction of resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act in both the House and Senate, and stand-alone legislation in both bodies that would forestall EPA action. The path to enactment of either of these forms of legislation is a steep one. The Obama Administration has made the reduction of GHG emissions an important goal; as a result, many believe that legislation restricting EPA's regulatory authority, if enacted by Congress, would encounter a presidential veto.", "In its FY2011 budget submission, EPA requested $43.0 million for \"additional regulatory efforts aimed at taking action on climate change,\" $25.0 million \"for state grants focused on developing technical capacity to address greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act,\" and $13.5 million \"for implementing new emission standards that will reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from mobile sources\" including \"developing potential standards for large transportation sources such as locomotives and aircraft engines, and analyzing the potential need for standards under petitions relating to major stationary sources.\" Whether to modify these amounts or to prevent EPA from developing or implementing GHG emission standards for stationary sources were among the prominent areas of debate and amendments considered during the debate of the FY2011 appropriations.", "EPA is one of 17 federal agencies that received appropriations for climate change activities in recent fiscal years. Issues that have emerged within the context of appropriations by Congress include (1) how different agency programs may be complementary or duplicative, (2) how these programs may together constitute an effective strategy to achieve U.S. objectives, and (3) whether there are gaps or opportunities for efficiencies that may be addressed. Most U.S. funding is aimed at energy technology development, and at Earth observations to support the science enterprise. ", "Within the S&T account, the $20.5 million in FY2011 appropriated funding for climate change research was less than the FY2010 appropriation of $20.8 million and the President's request of $22.0 million. EPA reported that the FY2011 request would support investigation of potential health or ecosystem impacts of climate change, and options for adaptation. According to EPA the research funding was to be used to assess whether modifications to EPA's air and water pollution control programs or regulations may be warranted as part of U.S. strategies to adapt or respond to the anticipated impacts of climate change. An additional $16.8 million was provided for FY2011 within the S&T account for the development of advanced vehicle technologies under the Climate Protection Program, less than the FY2010 enacted appropriation of $19.8 million and $16.9 million requested for FY2011. This aspect of the program funds technologies that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy in the transportation sector.", "In addition to the adequacy of funding for specific climate change activities, a larger issue has been the overall role of EPA as interagency discussion continues over whether to establish a National Climate Service, the scope of which may include but be potentially broader than the climate services being established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Appropriations to fund EPA's role may be affected by views on whether and how EPA should engage in providing climate services, including observations (e.g., monitoring); development of forecasts and decision tools; the providing of information to states, localities, and sources; and other similar services. As discussed in the \" Air Quality \" section of this report, EPA's role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act also has been an issue.", "The FY2011 enacted appropriations included $107.5 million for the Climate Protection Program activity, less than the $113.0 million FY2010 appropriations and the $123.1 million included in the President's request for FY2011. A more detailed breakout of the allocation of the FY2011 enacted appropriations is not readily available. According to the EPA FY2011 Justification $20.8 million of the funding as requested was to be use to carry out the Mandatory Reporting of GHG Rule, $4.1 million more than the FY2010 enacted appropriation of $16.7 million. EPA action to establish mandatory GHG reporting was required by Congress in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-161 ). Reliable GHG data would be critical to informing the development of efficient policies. Experience in the European Union has demonstrated the adverse consequences of inadequate emissions data as a baseline for setting regulatory requirements in allocating allowances in its Emissions Trading System. FY2011 enacted funding levels for climate change protection implementation and research activities comparable to each of those activities as requested for FY2011 are not readily available.

These programs include Energy Star and Methane-to-Markets, as well as other analytical (e.g., economic analysis) and other efforts that encourage and assist the private sector, schools, hospitals, and other enterprises to inventory and reduce their GHG emissions at a profit. Comparable FY2011 enacted amounts for these programs are not readily available.", "For FY2011, Congress did not specify and the Administration did not submit a request for funding specifically for international efforts to address climate change. For several years, previous requests proposed funding for international capacity building and for the Asia-Pacific Partnership, though funding for the latter was never appropriated for EPA. Congress may consider whether and at what level EPA has resources to engage in assisting governments in other countries to establish effective GHG monitoring and control programs in the context of international cooperation to address climate change. U.S. policy has emphasized the responsibilities of other major emitters also to reduce their GHG emissions, and EPA has been engaged historically in building institutional infrastructure and expertise that may help to realize reductions and to establish peer-to-peer networks that may assist in verifying results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Geographic-Specific/Ecosystem Programs67", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account includes funding for several geographic-specific/ecosystem programs to address certain environmental and human health risks in a number of identified areas of the United States.

Some Members and stakeholders expressed concern about the reduced funding level proposed for FY2011.

The FY2011 enacted appropriation of $54.4 million for EPA to implement the executive order and related activities to accelerate pollution reduction and aquatic habitat restoration efforts in the Bay was an increase compared to the FY2010 enacted appropriation of $50.0 million, but was below the President's FY2011 budget request of $63.0 million (see Table 8 ).", "The President's FY2011 budget request had included nearly $17.0 million within the Geographic-Specific/Ecosystem Program area to address certain environmental issues in the Mississippi River Basin.

Congress has enacted an increasing number of environmental laws, as well as major amendments to these statutes, over three decades following EPA's creation. Annual appropriations provide the funds necessary for EPA to carry out its responsibilities under these laws, such as the regulation of air and water quality, use of pesticides and toxic substances, management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and cleanup of environmental contamination. EPA also awards grants to assist state, tribal, and local governments in controlling pollution in order to comply with federal environmental requirements.

Levels of agency budget authority prior to FY1976 were not reported by OMB in the Historical Tables. In Figure B -1 , the levels of discretionary budget authority are presented in nominal dollars as reported by OMB, and are adjusted for inflation by CRS to reflect the trend in real dollar values over time. EPA's historical funding trends generally reflects the evolution of the agency's responsibilities over time, as Congress has enacted legislation to authorize the agency's programs and activities in response to a range of environmental issues and concerns. In terms of the overall federal budget, EPA's annual appropriations have represented a relatively small portion of the total discretionary federal budget (just under 1% in recent years).", "Without adjusting for inflation, EPA's funding has grown from $1.0 billion when EPA was established in FY1970 to a peak funding level of $14.86 billion in FY2009.
