Thermoelectric cooling represented 38% of freshwater withdrawn nationally and 45% of all water (fresh and saline) withdrawn in 2010, and the broader energy sector's water use (including biofuels) represented around 14% of water consumed nationally. Energy-related water consumption is anticipated to continue to increase in coming decades as the result of more domestic biofuel and unconventional onshore oil and natural gas production. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels are faced with deciding whether to respond to the growing water needs of the energy sector, and if so, which policy levers to use (e.g., tax incentives, loan guarantees, permits, regulations, planning, or education). Many U.S. energy sector water decisions are made by private entities, and state entities have the majority of the authority over water use and allocation policies and decisions.", "For fuel production, water is either an essential input or is difficult and costly to substitute, and degraded water is often a waste byproduct that creates management and disposal challenges. U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas production has expanded quickly since 2008, and U.S. natural gas and coal exports may rise. This has sparked interest in the quantities of water and other inputs \"embedded\" in these resources, as well as the wastes produced (e.g., wastewaters from oil and natural gas extraction) and how they are reused or disposed (e.g., concerns over induced seismicity from injection of oil and natural gas wastewaters). Much of the growth in water demand for unconventional fuel production is concentrated in regions with already intense competition over water (e.g., tight gas and other unconventional production in Colorado, Eagle Ford shale gas and oil in south Texas), preexisting water concerns (e.g., groundwater decline in North Dakota before Bakken oil development), or regions with abundant, but ecologically sensitive surface water resources (e.g., Marcellus shale region in Pennsylvania and New York).", "Conventional hydropower accounts for approximately 8% of total U.S. net electricity generation, and more than 80% of U.S. electricity is generated at thermoelectric facilities that depend on cooling water. Water availability issues, such as regional drought, low flow, or intense competition for water, can curtail hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation. An assessment of the drought vulnerability of electricity in the western United States found broad resiliency, while also identifying the Pacific Northwest and the Texas grid at higher risk. Future withdrawals associated with electric generation may grow slightly, remain steady, or decline depending on a number of factors. These include reduced generation from facilities using once-through cooling because of compliance with proposed federal cooling water intake regulations or shifts in how electricity is generated (e.g., less from coal and more from certain natural gas technologies and wind).", "Energy choices represent complex tradeoffs; water use and wastewater byproducts are two of many factors to consider when making energy choices.

The U.S. energy sector's use of water is significant in terms of water withdrawals and water consumption. ", "Energy Sector: While agriculture dominates U.S. water consumption (71%), the energy sector (including biofuels, thermoelectric, and fuel production) is the second-largest consumer at 14%, and domestic and public uses are third at 7%. Multiple factors contribute to the energy sector being the fastest-growing water consumer. Biofuels produced from irrigated feedstocks play a significant role, as well as expanding production of onshore unconventional oil and natural gas and hydro-stimulation of aging wells. Electric Generation: Water dependence is a risk for hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation. During low-flow or high-heat events, water intakes and high water temperatures may harm or limit thermoelectric cooling. Thermoelectric cooling water represented 38% of freshwater withdrawn nationally in 2010 and almost 6% of water consumed nationally. Also, the withdrawal and discharge of cooling water can harm aquatic organisms. Fuel Production: Water is either an essential input or is difficult and costly to substitute; degraded water is often a waste byproduct. The potential for human-induced seismic events is receiving scientific and political attention because of concerns over the possible connection between oil and gas wastewater injection and the recent increasing frequency of earthquakes, particularly in the central and eastern United States. Efficiency and Conservation: Reducing energy demand through energy and water efficiency and more water-efficient generation (e.g., electricity from wind, photovoltaics, or natural gas) can reduce water demand. Current water efficiency incentives in fuel production include minimizing water management costs and reducing operational disruptions. Embedded Water: U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas production has expanded quickly due to the combined use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques for well development. This expansion has sparked interest in the quantities of water and other inputs \"embedded\" in energy resources.

The cumulative water needs of multiple drilling and fracturing operations may be locally or temporally significant. Often many shale gas, tight gas, and tight oil wells are located in close proximity to each other as a formation is developed, with many wells being drilled and fractured from the same location. Water use for these wells is concentrated in the early stages of well development, usually in the first few weeks. Once the well is producing, little or no water is required unless refracturing is performed. How much water is used for well development is highly variable both across and within formations. Data on source water remain sparse. Groundwater often is used for shale operations when it is available and access is permitted. Surface waters also are used, but may require transport by truck. In cases of limited water access, well developers also have obtained water by purchasing it from municipalities or paying individual land owners for their supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data on Water Use Remain Problematic", "paragraphs": ["As of mid-2013, gaps remained in the availability of authoritative and recent data on the amounts of freshwater consumed and wastewater produced in fuel production. Available data indicate the following: ", "The amount of water needed per unit of fuel produced\u2014referred to as the water intensity of a fuel\u2014ranges from conventional natural gas at the lowest end (less than 1 gallons of water per MMBtu); coal, unconventional gas, and uranium mining and enrichment next (roughly 1 to 10 gallons per MMBtu); oil next (10 to 100 gallons per MMBtu); and irrigated biofuels at the upper end (100 to 1,000 gallons per MMBtu). The water intensity of conventional and unconventional oil produced using different techniques remains poorly documented. The water intensity for hydraulically fractured wells often is less notable than the concentrated, simultaneous demand for water for hydraulic fracturing in a region where many wells are being developed concurrently. Despite the recent increase in water demand for hydraulic fracturing, water use for stimulating oil production from conventional wells through water flooding and enhanced oil recovery have represented the largest water use by the oil and gas sector in the United States. The use of these techniques is anticipated to increase; to what extent saline, wastewaters, or freshwater will be used is less clear. Limited data on production rates and quantities for many saline aquifers can be a disincentive to their use. Each fuel and production technique presents its own risks, potential water quality impacts, and wastewater issues; also, some techniques may be more water-efficient but less efficient at recovering energy resources. Data remain poor on the range of wastewater quantities and qualities derived from conventional and unconventional fuel production.

No analysis is available of the risk posed by a multi-year drought in areas of intense water use for energy (e.g., North Dakota) and how to manage the risk. Fossil fuel transport also may be disrupted by water conditions, such as flood-induced pipeline breaks resulting from riverbed scouring, flood- or storm-related refinery or distribution system disruptions (e.g., Hurricane Sandy disruptions), and drought- or flood-impaired fuel transport.

Approximately 2.3 billion gallons are produced daily from onshore oil and gas wells in the United States. For oil wells, this represents an average ratio of 7.6:1 of produced water to oil produced. By 2025, as a result of aging wells with decreasing oil production, the ratio is expected to average 12:1 for onshore crude oil. ", "U.S. energy-related wastewaters are primarily from conventional oil and natural gas and coal bed methane (CBM). Research indicates that shale gas may produce less wastewater per unit of recovered gas than conventional natural gas (although water inputs during unconventional well development often exceed those for conventional natural gas, as described above). Disposal of shale wastewaters has received more attention recently than wastewaters from conventional production because of the rate of increase in shale development and its associated wastewaters in locations that are not accustomed to oil and natural gas development. Management of energy-related wastewaters is evolving rapidly, with different techniques dominating in different locations and raising concerns related to water quality and seismicity. Where deep wells for the permanent disposal of produced water are limited, producers increasingly are recycling and reusing produced water in fracturing operations. This reduces the amount of freshwater needed and relieves stress on disposal sites. At the same time, reuse of produced waters may increase the transport and handling of saline waters, potentially increasing a risk pathway for spills. The potential for human-induced seismic events associated with oil and gas wastewater injection is receiving scientific and political scrutiny in the context of the recent frequency of earthquakes, particularly in the central and eastern United States. Over 300 earthquakes of magnitude (M) 3 or greater occurred between 2010 and 2012 in the central and eastern United States, compared to an average of 21 earthquakes per year of M>3 between 1967 and 2000. The increase in seismicity seems to be correlated with the increase in the number of disposal wells, many of which are injecting wastewaters brought to the surface at shale oil and gas wells and in the use of hydraulic fracturing. Of the 30,000 injection wells in the United States used for wastewater disposal, however, only a few are correlated with seismicity of M > 3. The largest seismic events associated with injection seem to involve faulting that is deeper than the wastewater injection, suggesting that transmission of pressure into the basement rocks elevates the potential for inducing earthquakes.", "Recent state actions and anticipated federal actions are affecting or are anticipated to affect the management of produced water. ", "In Texas, produced water generally is disposed through deep-well injection (often on-site) or evaporation ponds; interest in reuse is increasing as the result of limited water availability in some regions (e.g., West Texas) and recent drought conditions. In May 2013, the Texas legislature clarified liability and ownership of produced waters transferred among oil and gas operators for purposes of recycling for a beneficial reuse. Pennsylvania regulations constraining surface water disposal wastewaters from shale gas production and the limited in-state deep well-injection options have resulted in a rapid increase in the rate of produced water recycling for shale gas fracking. Operators in Pennsylvania are required to prepare a wastewater source reduction strategy to maximize recycling and reuse. In August 2013, EPA proposed to discontinue efforts to establish discharge standards for wastewaters from CBM under the agency's Effluent Guidelines Program. EPA has been unable to identify a wastewater treatment technology that would be economically achievable. The agency will continue with a rulemaking for wastewaters associated with shale gas extraction, which is expected to be proposed in 2015."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Electric Grid and Generation", "paragraphs": ["Water availability issues, such as regional drought, low flow, or intense competition for water, can curtail hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation.

During a few days, the peak demand purchases in the real-time wholesale electricity market were at or near the market cap (i.e., $3,000 per megawatt-hour). In the end, only one Texas plant had water-curtailed generation; others were nearing curtailment when weather conditions improved. During the drought of 2012, the mid-continent electric grid avoided major drought-related disruption. Some individual power plants curtailed operations due to water access problems or water temperature issues; others pursued regulatory waivers to continue operations at higher water temperatures or made cooling system investments.

Most once-through cooling is found at power plants located in the eastern United States and is associated with older facilities, or is at coastal facilities using saline waters. Newer facilities and those in more arid regions generally use evaporative cooling. DOE data indicate that 25% of proposed power plants are planning on using reclaimed wastewater for cooling, at least 22% are proposing fresh groundwater, and 17% are planning on dry cooling or generation technologies that do not require cooling.", "Once-through cooling, while largely non-consumptive, requires water to be continuously available for power plant operations. This reduces the ability for this water to be put toward other water uses and can make cooling operations vulnerable to low flows. Evaporative cooling withdraws much smaller volumes of water for use in a cooling tower or reservoir, where waste heat is dissipated by evaporating the cooling water. Evaporative cooling consumes more water at the facility than does once-through cooling. Cooling technologies that consume less water and use degraded water supplies may reduce freshwater use. These options include dry cooling, hybrid dry-wet cooling, cooling with fluids other than freshwater (e.g., brackish groundwater, produced waters), and emerging technologies. While hybrid and dry cooling options may reduce water consumption, they can reduce operational efficiency (potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions) and often are more costly. Thermoelectric withdrawals were 20% less in 2010 than in 2005 for reasons including use of more water-efficient cooling technology by new power plants.

Other energy tradeoffs include transport and storage. Some fuels are easier to store and use existing transport networks and multiple transport modes, while others may require new or expanded infrastructure investments (e.g., pipelines). Significantly, low-carbon energy is not necessarily low in water or environmental impact (e.g., new hydropower reservoirs, freshwater-cooled utility-scale solar), and specific carbon mitigation policies and actions may increase or decrease water consumption.
