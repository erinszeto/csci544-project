NNSA operates three programs: Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, which secures nuclear materials worldwide, conducts R&D into nonproliferation and verification, and operates the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program; Naval Reactors, which \"is responsible for all U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion work\"; and Weapons Activities.", "The latter is the subject of this report. It operates the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which maintains the U.S. nuclear gravity bombs and missile warheads and has science and infrastructure programs that support that mission. (The Department of Defense [DOD] operates the bombers and missiles that would deliver nuclear weapons; it is funded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill.) The Armed Services Committees authorize funds for DOD and NNSA programs. The FY2016 request proposed moving counterterrorism programs from Weapons Activities to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. On a basis comparable to the FY2016 budget structure, the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 83/P.L. 113-235) provided $8,007.7 million for Weapons Activities. The FY2016 request was $8,846.9 million, a 10.5% increase over FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing $8,713.0 million for FY2016. The House passed H.R. 2028, Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, by a vote of 240-177 on May 1. The bill as passed by the House made no changes to the Weapons Activities section of the committee bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the bill on May 21. It recommended providing $8,882.4 million. Congress provided 8,846.9 million for Weapons Activities in the omnibus appropriations bill for FY2016 (H.R. 2029).", "Weapons Activities has four main programs, each with a request of over $1 billion for FY2016, as follows. FY2015-enacted amounts included below are comparable to the FY2016 budget structure.", "Directed Stockpile Work works directly on nuclear weapons. It includes life extension programs, maintenance, and others. The FY2015-enacted amount was $2,797.2 million; the FY2016 request was $3,187.3 million, a 13.9% increase. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, provided $3,354.3 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3,039.5 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $3,387.8 million.

The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,766.3 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $1,818.5 million. Infrastructure and Safety (I&S), a budget category that NNSA proposed in its FY2016 request, includes operations of facilities, recapitalization, maintenance, safety operations, and other programs. The FY2015-enacted comparable amount was $1,386.7 million; the FY2016 request was $1,466.1 million, a 5.7% increase. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating I&S into Infrastructure and Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,466.1 million for I&S. The omnibus appropriations bill accepted the House budget structure and consolidated I&S into Infrastructure and Operations, as described next. Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) funds material recycle and recovery, recapitalization of facilities, and construction of facilities. Prior to FY2016, it also funded operations of the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2015-enacted amount was $2,033.4 million; the FY2016 request was $1,054.5 million, with the decrease due to transferring funds to I&S. The FY2015 comparable request for RTBF was $688.0 million, so on a comparable basis FY2016 RTBF increased by 53.3%. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating funding for RTBF, Infrastructure and Safety, and Site Stewardship into a new category, Infrastructure and Operations (I&O), for which it recommended $2,228.2 million. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, accepted this budget structure. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended keeping I&S and Site Stewardship as separately funded categories, and providing $1,021.1 million for I&O and $36.6 million for Site Stewardship.

After numerous exchanges between DOE and the appropriating and authorizing committees, such issues still remain.", "According to a White House document of May 2010, the President provided Congress with a classified report (the \"1251 report\") required by the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1251, \"on the comprehensive plan to: (1) maintain delivery platforms [that is, bombers, missiles, and submarines that deliver nuclear weapons]; (2) sustain a safe, secure, and reliable U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile; and (3) modernize the nuclear weapons complex.\" According to that document, \"the Administration intends to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex.\" The Administration submitted a revised Section 1251 report in November 2010, projecting weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs for FY2011-FY2020 at between $85.4 billion and $86.2 billion. The request for FY2015 was below the 1251 report figure; in contrast, the request for FY2016 is about at the 1251 report's figure for that year, and projections for FY2017-FY2020 are above the figures in the 1251 report, as Table 2 shows."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganization of the Nuclear Security Enterprise", "paragraphs": ["Along with reconfiguring the nuclear weapons complex, there have been concerns for decades about the proper organization of the federal agency responsible for managing it. While the Army managed the nuclear weapons program during World War II, Congress, in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as an independent civilian agency to manage that program. In the Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, Congress dissolved the AEC and created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which among other functions managed the nuclear weapons program. That program was moved again by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which dissolved ERDA and created DOE. In 2000, as noted above, Congress created NNSA as a separately organized agency within DOE.", "In part, these reorganizations stem from long-standing concerns about the management of the nuclear weapons complex. Many reports have been written over the past several decades to address this issue. Most recently, in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 112-239 , Congress established the Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise and directed the panel to make recommendations on \"the most appropriate governance structure, mission, and management of the nuclear security enterprise.\" In its report to Congress, the panel stated:", "the panel finds that the existing governance structures and many of the practices of the enterprise are inefficient and ineffective, thereby putting the entire enterprise at risk over the long term. These problems have not occurred overnight; they are the result of decades of neglect. This is in spite of the efforts of many capable and dedicated people who must nonetheless function within the confines of a dysfunctional system.\u2026", "One unmistakable conclusion is that NNSA governance reform, at least as it has been implemented, has failed to provide the effective, mission-focused enterprise that Congress intended.", "The panel's recommendations included strengthening presidential guidance and oversight of the nuclear enterprise; establishing new congressional mechanisms for leadership and oversight of the enterprise; replacing NNSA with a new Office of Nuclear Security within DOE, renamed to the Department of Energy and Nuclear Security, with the Secretary responsible for the mission; and building a culture of performance, accountability, and credibility.", "Owing to concerns about cost growth and transparency, P.L. 113-235 contained several sections relating to cost and oversight.

Section 308 required the Secretary of Energy to provide an analysis of alternatives for each major warhead refurbishment program reaching the development engineering stage. Similarly, in its FY2016 report on energy and water development appropriations, S.Rept. 114-54 , the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed its concern \"with the continued poor cost estimating by the Department, particularly within the NNSA,\" and directed the Secretary of Energy to \"provide a report \u2026 that outlines the Department's plan for improving cost estimating for major projects and programs.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Directed Stockpile Work (DSW)", "paragraphs": ["This program involves work directly on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition; maintaining them through repairs, refurbishment, life extension, and modifications; conducting R&D in support of specific warheads; and dismantlement.
