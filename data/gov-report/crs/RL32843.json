Yet Senate procedure generally lacks means for a simple majority to limit consideration and proceed to a vote. As a result, Senate minorities can attempt to block proposals by preventing a vote from occurring, a practice known as filibustering. Filibuster opponents have long sought to institute rules permitting a voting majority to limit consideration, most recently, in relation to judicial nominations. The Senate has seldom been able to adopt such limits, however, because any such proposal is itself subject to filibuster. In addition, the Senate has held that its existing procedures remain continuously in effect, which prevents it from considering a change proposal under limits more stringent than those already in effect. In this way, the existing procedures that lack consideration limits tend to entrench themselves against their own change.", "Advocates of majority consideration limits have often sought ways to assure the ability of the Senate to reach a vote on procedural changes. Inasmuch as such a course of action would break through the obstacles posed by existing procedures, it has been called a \"nuclear option.\" A \"nuclear option\" would presumably either make novel use of existing procedures or engage in ones previously not recognized in Senate practice. The plan most often discussed has been to raise a point of order asserting that the Senate must be able to reach a vote on nominations (or procedural changes) in order to exercise effectively its constitutional \"advice and consent\" power (or rulemaking power). By sustaining such a point of order, the chair would establish precedent for limiting consideration of those matters. Opponents of the ruling could appeal, and could attempt to filibuster to prevent a vote on the appeal, but the Senate could confirm the ruling by adopting a nondebatable motion to table the appeal.", "Under established procedure, however, only the Senate itself has authority to settle points of order in ways that alter precedent or interpret the Constitution. The chair is to follow precedent in ruling, and is to submit points of order raised under the Constitution, or where no precedent exists. If a point of order is submitted, however, or a ruling against a point of order is appealed, the point of order can be sustained only by vote, and the vote might be blocked by filibuster. Tabling the question in this situation would have the effect of affirming previous practice. Only certain additional limits on consideration of a point of order raised while another is pending might afford means of overcoming this difficulty.", "Under most conditions, the Senate might be unable to reach a vote on a procedural question that would institute consideration limits, except by setting aside the principle that the chair adheres to precedent, or that the rules remain always in effect. Once these principles were set aside, however, it might become possible for any voting majority of the Senate to institute further procedural changes in other subsequent situations. In the past, both the Senate and the House have ultimately always declined to institute change by accepting standards that would permit this result.

In response, some leading Senators have called for the Senate to change its procedures to prevent filibusters, or make them harder to sustain, at least on this class of business. Filibusters are possible largely because for most matters, including nominations, existing Senate procedures establish neither limits on the time available for consideration nor means by which a voting majority may impose such limits. In this sense, existing Senate rules largely lack provision for effective majoritarian consideration limits. Accordingly, advocates of change in this area have focused on procedural changes that would afford more effective means for a majority to limit consideration.", "Existing Senate rules and procedures, however, also place potentially substantial obstacles in the way of adopting changes in these rules and procedures. In particular, the lack of effective majoritarian consideration limits also applies to the procedures under which the Senate normally considers proposals for procedural change.

Critics of this form of action, however, have used this term also to connote that unilateral resort to such a course by a majority might undermine \"traditional\" practices of comity within the Senate, especially the expectations of predictability through consensual arrangements that have hitherto been held to characterize the body. Because of this connotation, some advocates of this form of action have come to prefer the term \"constitutional option.\" This designation appears to connote that most of the courses of action currently under consideration would rely on an appeal to constitutional requirements as grounds for instituting consideration limits.", "This report reserves the term \"constitutional option\" for those courses of action that depend specifically on constitutional points of order, as explained in the section on \" The \"Constitutional Option\" .\" The term \"nuclear option\" is here used only to indicate that such a course of action would constitute an alternative to \"conventional\" proceedings because of its capacity to cut comprehensively through the normal difficulties of achieving procedural change. In this usage, any form of \"nuclear option\" would afford the Senate means to circumvent the obstacles to change posed by the usual forms of proceeding.", "This usage leaves open whether a course of action could achieve its result without compelling the Senate to set aside requirements of its existing procedures in the process. A course that did require action at variance with established principles underlying the system of Senate procedure might be considered \"nuclear\" in a more fundamental sense. The reason, as explained in the section on \" Overcoming Entrenchment ,\" is that it would presumably constitute precedent for subsequent departures of the same kind.

It indicates what provisions of existing procedures might pose difficulties for implementing various courses of action, as well as possible procedural responses by which proponents of such action might address these difficulties.", "The discussion also identifies the features that specifically distinguish some of these courses of action as \"constitutional options.\" In addition, however, it identifies points at which the courses of action might require proceedings at variance with existing requirements. On the basis of this examination, it is possible in conclusion to identify some implications that resort to a \"nuclear option\" might have for the subsequent condition of Senate procedure.", "Showing how a course of procedural action represents a \"nuclear option\" involves identifying the ways in which it may bypass or overcome the obstacles posed by the usual procedures. To enable this examination, the discussion begins by describing the nature of these obstacles and indicating how they are grounded in the existing structure of Senate procedure. These observations make it possible to explain more specifically not only what a \"nuclear option\" must accomplish, but also why resort to proceedings of this kind may appear attractive or necessary in the first place."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The \"Entrenchment\" of Senate Procedure", "paragraphs": ["The question of enhancing the ability of the Senate to limit consideration of matters has dominated the procedural history of the body for well over a century. Part of the reason for this persistence is that Senate procedures have always lacked effective limits on consideration. This lack of consideration limits may often enable opponents of a proposal to block its approval, even if it is supported by a majority, by extending its consideration indefinitely, thereby preventing the Senate from ever being able to reach a vote on it. It is delaying actions of this kind that are colloquially, but universally, known as filibustering.", "This lack of effective consideration limits also applies to the procedures normally used for consideration of proposals for procedural change. In particular, it extends to the consideration of any proposal to institute additional consideration limits. Proposals to constrain filibustering can be filibustered. In this way, the existing lack of consideration limits operates as a continuing obstacle to the establishment of new consideration limits.", "The persistence in the Senate of the question of limiting consideration, however, also arises from a second cause. Certain elements of the Senate's procedural system have the effect of requiring that its established procedures remain continuously in effect. As a result, a proposal to institute more effective means of limiting consideration would have to be considered in accordance with the already existing procedures. The principle that existing Senate procedures remain always in effect then combines with the lack of consideration limits under existing procedures to make it hard for the Senate to adopt more effective consideration limits. It is in this sense that Senate rules have been described as \"entrenched\" against their own change.", "This section considers more specifically these two features of Senate procedure, which together bring about its entrenchment. It examines first the procedural provisions that result in the general lack of consideration limits, then the principles that result in the continuous force of the existing system of procedure. On the basis of this discussion it will be possible to consider what characteristics a \"nuclear option\" would have to possess in order to succeed in overcoming the entrenchment of Senate procedure so as to permit the adoption of additional limits on consideration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Overall Consideration Limits", "paragraphs": ["Senate procedure is governed not only by the Standing Rules of the chamber, but also by standing and special orders, pertinent provisions of the Constitution and of statute, the body of precedent formed by past rulings on procedural questions, and informally accepted practices. For most matters, none of these procedural standards either places any restrictions on how long consideration may last, or explicitly establishes any means for a simple majority of Senators voting to impose such restrictions. In general, only by a super-majority may the Senate apply the limits on consideration specified in Senate Rule XXII, an action known as invoking cloture. Otherwise, the Senate may in general place agreed restrictions on consideration of a question only by unanimous consent.", "Some accounts suggest that the most likely purpose of resort to a \"nuclear option\" under current conditions would be to permit the Senate to limit consideration of a nomination by a simple majority vote, rather than a super-majority. In fact, however, Senate procedures already require only a simple majority for the approval of almost any substantive proposal, including a nomination. (The requisite number has often lately been referred to as \"51 votes\" although, in fact, it is smaller when not all Senators vote.) The effect of Senate procedures, in general, is to require a super-majority not for the approval of items of business, but only for the imposition of limits on their consideration, so as to ensure that votes on their approval can occur.", "Under these arrangements, even if a proposal is supported by a majority, opponents may be able, by filibuster, to prevent the Senate from reaching a vote on it, unless supporters are numerous enough to invoke cloture. It is from desire to avoid possible filibusters that Senate practice has historically fostered the settlement of issues through collegial processes of seeking consensual agreement.", "Inasmuch as filibusters are defined by the intent of the participants to block action, their conduct is not limited to the use of any specified form of procedure. Although filibusters are commonly thought of as carried out through extended debate, they may also be conducted by a wide variety of other procedural means. Correspondingly, although cloture is widely understood as a motion for bringing debate to a close, it also restricts certain other actions that could be used for purposes of delay.", "Senate procedure also permits debate on many procedural motions. In particular, a motion that the Senate proceed to consider a bill or resolution is debatable under most circumstances (by contrast, however, present practice permits the Senate to proceed to consider a nomination on a non-debatable motion). For this reason, if opponents of a matter persist in a filibuster, reaching a final vote may require supporters to secure super-majority support for cloture or other limits on consideration multiple times, on each of several essential questions that may arise in the course of consideration. For a few specific questions, nevertheless, Senate rules or other procedures do establish limits on consideration, and, as discussed in the next section, some of these might play a role in the implementation of a \"nuclear option,\"", "All these conditions of consideration apply to the conduct of Senate business generally; they are not specific to the consideration of proposals for procedural change. Only because the Senate's general rules of procedure also apply specifically to the consideration of proposed changes in procedure do they contribute to the entrenchment of the existing procedures. Specifically, the lack of effective majoritarian consideration limits in existing procedure tends to entrench itself by constituting the chief obstacle to its own change.", "In certain respects, moreover, the system of Senate procedure places greater obstacles in the way of bringing the Senate to a vote on a proposal to amend the Standing Rules than for other matters. As with most other matters, the Senate can adopt amendments to its Standing Rules by a simple majority of those voting. On most matters, however, the vote required to invoke cloture is three-fifths of the full Senate membership (60 votes, if no vacancies exist), while for amendments to the Standing rules it is two-thirds of Senators voting (67, if there are no vacancies and all Senators vote). This more demanding requirement contributes specifically to the entrenchment of the Standing Rules against change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of the Continuing Body Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["The lack of consideration limits in Senate procedures would not suffice to entrench those procedures unless the Senate also required that existing procedures are to govern consideration of proposals for their own change. The chief embodiment of this requirement is the Senate's practice of treating its rules as remaining continuously in effect, even from one Congress to the next, and even in the absence of any action to reaffirm them. This practice arises largely as a consequence of the way the Senate understands its status under what has been called the \"continuing body doctrine.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Continuity of the Senate", "paragraphs": ["To say that Senate is a continuing body is, in itself, to state not a doctrine, but merely a fact. Under the Constitution, a majority of the Senate constitutes a quorum, and only one-third of senatorial terms expire at the end of each Congress. Even at the beginning of a new Congress, as a result, and even before newly elected Senators are sworn in for new terms of office, a quorum of the Senate remains in being, and the body remains capable of functioning and acting. By this criterion, a Senate, with membership sufficient to do business, has been in continuous existence ever since the body first achieved a quorum on April 6, 1789. That the Senate is a \"continuing body\" in this sense was explicitly enunciated at least as early as 1841."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Practical Implications of Continuity", "paragraphs": ["At various times in its history, however, the Senate has understood the implications of the fact of its continuity in different ways, and it is the understanding of these implications that may be considered the \"continuing body doctrine.\" Under current practice of long standing, the Senate regards itself not only as a continuing body, but as a continuously organized one. The elected officers of the Senate appear always to have been regarded as continuing in office from one Congress to the next unless replaced by affirmative action of the body. In current practice, the Senate appoints its committees at the beginning of each Congress, but assignments are regarded as carrying over in the new Congress until changed (or renewed) by action of the Senate. When the Senate first established standing committees, however, its initial practice was to regard assignments as expiring at the end not only of each biennial Congress, but of each annual session.", "It appears, by contrast, that the Senate has always regarded its Standing Rules as continuing in effect from Congress to Congress without affirmative action on its own part. The Senate implicitly decided this question by not acting to re-adopt, revise, or replace its original rules of 1789 at the convening of the first session of the Second Congress in October 1791. Since then, the Senate has amended its rules on numerous occasions and has adopted several comprehensive recodifications, not always at the beginning of a Congress. It has generally done so with at least the tacit understanding that it was acting pursuant to the procedures established in the already existing rules.", "This understanding reflects a presumption that the continuity of the Senate entails the continuity of its rules. In 1959, the Senate explicitly incorporated this principle into its Standing Rules by providing that \"The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules.\" This action, which accompanied certain changes making cloture easier to obtain, had the effect of giving the force of rule to an interpretation of the continuing body doctrine that supports the entrenchment of Senate rules.", "The Senate also treats other components of its system of procedure as maintaining continuity. Standing orders, like the Standing Rules, are accepted as remaining perpetually in force unless their terms specify otherwise. No doubt exists that provisions of the Constitution having procedural force remain continuously effective, and the Senate implicitly accords the same treatment to provisions of statute that operate procedurally. Finally, it is implicit in the precedential character of procedural rulings by the chair and the full Senate that, once made, they continue to guide proceedings subject only to subsequent decisions and actions of the body. All these understandings also contribute to the tendency of the system of Senate procedures toward its own entrenchment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contrast with the House of Representatives", "paragraphs": ["The status of the Senate as a continuing body, and the implications it draws from that status, may be highlighted by contrast with corresponding practices of the House of Representatives. In just the sense that the Senate is a continuing body, the House is not, for the terms of all House Members expire with the biennial expiration of the constitutional term of a Congress. Consistent with this circumstance, the House adheres to the principle that one House cannot bind a subsequent House, and consequently the organizational arrangements of the House in one Congress do not automatically carry over to the next. When a new House of Representatives convenes after an election, it understands itself as an inchoate, unorganized body that must proceed to its own organization as its first order of business. Its initial proceedings include the election of its Speaker and other officers, the adoption of rules, and the approval of committee assignments for all Members.", "The rules the House adopts typically consist of an amended version of the code in effect in the previous Congress. That code includes effective means for limiting consideration of measures, especially in admitting the motion for the previous question as a device for concluding consideration and proceeding to an immediate vote. While considering the adoption of rules, however, the House regards itself as proceeding not under its previously existing rules, but under \"general parliamentary law.\" The House recognizes the motion for the previous question as a part of general parliamentary law, thereby affording itself a means of concluding consideration and proceeding to a vote on the resolution to adopt the rules.", "As with the Senate, however, the House implicitly accepts the principle that present procedural rulings should conform to previous precedent. The House treats this principle itself as a part of the general parliamentary law; it could even be said that the House justifies its adherence to general parliamentary law before the adoption of rules by appealing to the precedent of its having done so in the past. On similar grounds, the House has long continued the practice of having the Clerk of the previous House call the new House to order and preside until the election of a Speaker. By these means the House enables itself to maintain a continuity of practice without entrenching its rules against their own change. In particular, these practices enable the House to maintain effective means of limiting consideration while still observing the principle that it is not bound by the rules adopted by the House in a previous Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Entrenchment in Practice Only", "paragraphs": ["One implication of the preceding discussion is that the principles and provisions that bring about the entrenchment of Senate procedures do not suffice to render that entrenchment absolute. No imperative mandate purports to declare Senate procedures immune from change or positively to prevent the Senate from altering them. Instead, Senate procedures are entrenched in practice only, as a consequence of a combination of certain provisions they contain and principles on which they rest. Even pursuant to procedures as they now stand, the Senate could in practice alter any of those procedures (except, of course, for constitutional requirements) unless opponents were able to prevent the Senate from reaching a vote. If, furthermore, the Senate did alter its procedures so as to provide for limits on the consideration of proposals for procedural change, it would thereby enable a voting majority, in general, thereafter to adopt whatever additional change proposals it favored. Under those conditions Senate procedures would cease to be entrenched in the sense just described.", "The conditions that entrench existing procedures come into play only when opponents of a proposed change that commends majority support are able to prevent a vote. As a result, Senate procedures are entrenched only to the extent that, because of the lack of majoritarian consideration limits, a voting majority may still be unable to achieve procedural changes. A number of legal and constitutional arguments might be raised against the propriety even of this entrenchment in practice. Yet any such argument might afford the Senate no concrete assistance in overcoming the practical condition of entrenchment, unless it could be brought to bear in an effective way in the context of actual Senate proceedings\u2014meaning, presumably, that it would be invoked as an element of a \"nuclear option.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Requisites of a \"Nuclear Option\"", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overcoming Entrenchment", "paragraphs": ["In light of the preceding discussion, resort to a \"nuclear option\" may be understood as an attempt to overcome the existing entrenchment of Senate procedures and enable a voting majority to institute desired procedural changes (specifically, provisions for limits on consideration). To achieve this purpose, it appears, a \"nuclear option\" would have to afford some means of ensuring that the Senate could reach a vote on a procedural change proposal, which would evidently mean providing some way to overcome at least one of the two conditions that combine to bring about entrenchment. A course of action could provide a \"nuclear option\" either by (1) overcoming the scarcity of majoritarian consideration limits afforded by existing procedures or (2) departing from the principle that the existing system of procedure as a whole remains always in effect.", "From this perspective, it appears that a \"nuclear option\" might achieve its effects by engaging in either (1) an innovative or unorthodox use of some existing procedures or (2) proceedings not governed by the existing system of Senate procedure. Roughly speaking, proceedings of the first kind would involve means of overcoming the existing scarcity of consideration limits; those of the second kind would disregard the principle that established procedures remain continuously applicable. Successful action in either form would result in the institution of changes from the system of Senate procedure as previously established, and either approach would represent a \"nuclear option\" in the sense that it would overcome the obstacles to procedural change presented by the Senate's existing procedural system.", "Setting aside existing procedures in the course of considering procedural changes, however, might be considered \"nuclear\" in an additional sense as well. A course of action of this kind would not only result in the alteration of established procedure, but engaging in it would, in itself, already constitute an alteration from established procedure. Under these conditions, change would be realized not only as an outcome of a process of considering proposals for change, but in the very occurrence of the process. This form of \"nuclear option\" would, by definition, constitute an extraordinary proceeding, in the strict sense of taking place outside the ordinary conditions of proceeding. Its occurrence, in itself, would already constitute peremptory, ad hoc action to remove the Senate from regulation by its previously established procedures. As a result, the subsequent effects of this form of action on the system of Senate procedure would come through not only the changes it would institute, but also those that would occur simply through carrying it out.", "The remainder of this section examines some specific forms of action that have recently been discussed as possible elements of a \"nuclear option.\" It assesses whether a successful \"nuclear option\" could be constructed through novel or alternative uses of some established elements of procedure, or would require extraordinary proceedings. These considerations will permit subsequent examination of some specific courses that a \"nuclear option\" might take. On this basis, potential implications of carrying out proceedings that would be \"nuclear\" in the \"strong\" sense of involving peremptory departure from existing procedures will be discussed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consideration Limits Under Existing Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The previous discussion of entrenchment suggests that the chief requisites of a feasible \"nuclear option\" would be (1) that a proposal for procedural change be subject to adoption with the support of a simple majority of Senators voting; and (2) that its consideration be subject to limitation also by a simple voting majority, so as to ensure that a vote can be reached. The first requirement is easily met by the regular procedures of the Senate; it is the second that presents difficulties. To meet the second requirement, it appears that applicable procedures would have to either (1) permit a voting majority to impose limits on the time available for consideration of a matter; or (2) provide generally for such limits, including by making the matter non-debatable.", "In addition, if an existing procedure does not impose an overall time limit on consideration of a proposal, but only permits a majority to limit consideration, it can assure a vote on the underlying proposal only if it assures that the Senate can reach a vote on the question of limiting consideration. Such a procedure, accordingly, would also have to include some effective means of limiting consideration of the question of limiting consideration. As with the underlying matter itself, the procedure could limit consideration of this new question either by imposing a general limit or by permitting a vote to impose one. If it does so only by permitting a vote to impose a limit, however, the same requirement would again apply to the procedure for considering the question of imposing the limit.", "It follows that any effective procedure for limiting consideration must include some provision establishing a general consideration limit for some question involved in the process. If it provides for no such limit, the Senate could be prevented from getting to the point at which it could begin the series of votes that would ultimately result in imposing consideration limits on the underlying substantive matter.

For example, if opponents of a proposal offer a series of amendments in an attempt to protract consideration, a voting majority can dispose of each amendment by moving, and immediately agreeing, to table it.", "The motion to table, however, terminates consideration of a proposal only by defeating it.

Typically, a parliamentary question, or question of order, comes before the Senate in the form of a point of order. A point of order is a claim, raised from the floor by a Senator, that some pending procedural action is inconsistent with pertinent rules or other procedural standards. Under most circumstances, the presiding officer may settle a point of order by ruling on whether the claim it raises is procedurally correct. A question of order may also be presented, without any point of order being raised, if an ambiguous or unsettled situation arises in the course of proceedings. Most questions arising in this way also may be settled by a ruling of the chair. In either case, the ruling of the chair becomes final unless any Senator appeals it to the full Senate. An appeal is settled by a simple majority of Senators voting, and this vote either confirms or reverses the initial ruling of the chair.", "The initial action of the chair on a point of order is, in effect, subject to limits on consideration, because Senate practice permits debate on a pending point of order only at the discretion of the chair.

As a result, opponents of the decision that the Senate seems likely to make on an appeal may be able to filibuster to prevent the Senate from reaching a vote on the appeal.

The chair does not often exercise this option, but appears to have done so especially when presented with a \"question of first impression,\" that is, a situation in which no previous precedent has established any interpretation of the point at issue. The apparent rationale of this practice is that, inasmuch as the authority of a rule rests ultimately on the constitutional power of the Senate to adopt it, the initial decision on its interpretation is appropriately left to the same body.", "In addition, however, Senate practice also holds that the chair ought to submit to the Senate any question of order raised on constitutional grounds. The possibility of a constitutional point of order exists because the Senate understands the constitutional provisions that operate to regulate aspects of its procedure as integral components of its procedural system.

Proponents then moved to table the submitted point of order, which would have affirmed that the rulemaking power authorized a majority to limit consideration of rules change proposals. The Senate, however, defeated the tabling motion, then sustained the point of order, thereby declining to affirm the constitutional claim in this form.", "In 1969 and 1971, accordingly, change advocates instead moved for cloture on the motion to proceed, but also raised the contention that, pursuant to the rulemaking power, a simple voting majority should be held sufficient to invoke cloture on a rules change proposal at the beginning of a Congress. In both years, cloture was supported by a simple majority, but not by the two-thirds required by Rule XXII on rules changes. In 1969, Vice President Humphrey then announced that consideration would proceed under cloture. Opponents, however, appealed this decision, and the Senate reversed it, thereby again declining to affirm that the rulemaking power authorized a majority to limit consideration of a rules change. In 1971, the chair ruled that, under the 1969 precedent, the support of a simple majority did not suffice to invoke cloture. Change advocates appealed this decision, but the Senate tabled the appeal, thereby sustaining the chair and reaffirming the precedent against limiting debate under authority of the rulemaking power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Presumptively Non-Debatable Motion to Proceed", "paragraphs": ["After these occurrences, change advocates abandoned the approach of moving first for an immediate vote, then for a procedural ruling that would permit that vote. Instead, in 1975, they combined these efforts into a single motion that the Senate both proceed to consider a resolution to amend the cloture rule and vote immediately on this motion to proceed.", "The second part of this motion proposed treating the entire motion as non-debatable and subject to adoption by a simple majority. Combining both propositions in this way overtly manifests the \"nuclear\" character of the proposed action, in that the second part of the motion proposed to prescribe terms for the consideration of the motion as a whole. If the motion were to be considered pursuant to the previously existing rules, it presumably could not make such a prescription. The prescription could become effective only through adoption of the motion, yet the proceedings that this prescription would regulate would have to have taken place already, during consideration of the motion. Instead, a motion of this kind can be effective only if its own offering is accepted as bringing about a summary, peremptory change in the rules under which its consideration will occur. Its offering, in itself, accordingly, amounts to an attempt to bring about a tacit settlement of the procedural claim it raises.", "Although little subsequent commentary appears to have addressed this self-referential character of the 1975 motion, it became an important determinant of the outcome. Because the second part of the motion in effect embodied the procedural claim supporters sought to establish, opponents had to counter that claim by raising a point of order that the motion as a whole was out of order, on grounds that existing rules did not permit a simple majority to close consideration. When Vice President Rockefeller submitted this point of order to the Senate as a constitutional question, proponents moved to table it. The tabling motion enabled proponents to place before the Senate in non-debatable form the basic claim that a voting majority should be able to limit consideration of a rules change proposal.", "The Senate initially adopted the motion to table the point of order, thereby endorsing the position that a majority could limit debate in relation to a rules change proposal. By this action the Senate, in effect, accepted for the first time the procedural claim of proponents under the rulemaking power. This action might be expected to have led to an immediate vote on the motion that had been held in order. Opponents, however, then demanded a division of the question on the combined motion, so that its first part, the motion to proceed, would be considered separate from its second part, embodying the procedural prescription that the motion be decided by a simple majority without debate. This division destroyed the self-referential character of the procedural prescription. As a result, the Vice President held the motion to proceed, the first part of the original package motion, to be debatable. Opponents then undertook extended debate on this motion to proceed.", "To overcome this difficulty, supporters of change ultimately agreed to accept a proposal under which the Senate would vote on a compromise proposal to strengthen the cloture rule, but also on reconsidering the tabling of the original point of order. The Senate adopted the motion to reconsider, and, on reconsideration, rejected the motion to table, thereby bringing the original point of order back before the Senate. The Senate then voted to sustain the point of order, thereby reversing its endorsement of the claim that a simple majority had authority to limit consideration of rules change proposals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Corresponding Considerations in the House", "paragraphs": ["At an earlier period in its development, the House of Representatives confronted potential conflicts between securing the exercise of its constitutional rulemaking power and maintaining stability in its proceedings that were similar to those addressed by current discussions in the Senate. By the early years of the 20 th century, the development of House procedures had centralized control of the floor agenda in the Speaker, in part through his ex officio chairmanship of the Committee on Rules. So nearly absolute was this control that not only the minority party, but dissident factions in the majority party as well, became severely disaffected. The leadership, however, was able to use the Speaker's control of the floor to prevent consideration of proposed changes that would mitigate that control.", "Dissidents attempted to obtain consideration for rules changes in part by arguing that constitutional rulemaking power of the House made measures to change the rules \"constitutionally privileged\" for consideration. This argument bears strong resemblance to that advocated by supporters of procedural change in the Senate in the mid-20 th century, even though the issue in the Senate was the procedural control exercised by a minority rather than by an agent of the majority. In 1910, Representative George Norris seized a parliamentary opportunity to offer, as \"privileged under the Constitution,\" a proposal to reconstruct the Committee on Rules. Speaker Joseph Cannon ruled, consistently with established House practice, that no such privilege attached to measures to change the rules, and that the measure would have to be referred to his Committee on Rules. The House reversed the ruling on appeal and proceeded to consider and adopt the resolution.", "The reconstructed Committee on Rules subsequently proposed, and the House adopted, several important and enduring innovations in House rules, including the discharge rule. As initially written, however, the discharge rule proved not only ineffective, but also susceptible to dilatory use. In the following session of the same Congress (1911), therefore, Representative Charles Fuller offered, as constitutionally privileged, a resolution to amend this rule. In accordance with the 1910 precedent, Speaker Cannon ruled this resolution privileged, but his ruling was appealed and the House reversed it.", "The House thereby not only vindicated the Speaker's earlier initial ruling of 1910, but restored the previous principle that the constitutional power to make rules did not entail any right to consider every possible proposal to do so. Cannon ' s Precedents accordingly recounts these events under the heading: \"A proposition to amend the rules is not privileged.... In exercising its constitutional privilege to change the rules the House has confined itself within certain limitations.\" In re-establishing this principle, the House seems to have judged that according constitutional privilege to rule change proposals could permit the chamber to be tied up continually with such measures, irrespective of merit and perhaps for dilatory purposes. It could also have resulted in continual and possibly capricious changes in procedure instituted by temporary majorities for their immediate benefit. Some Members who voted both to overturn the precedent in 1910 and to restore it in 1911 explained their action on the grounds that the first vote was a \"revolutionary act\" that was necessitated by circumstance, but that the principle involved was not sustainable as a settled doctrine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Stability and Procedural Control", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prospective Effects on Senate Practice", "paragraphs": ["The events of 1910 may be seen as representing the House's historic attempt to come to grips with one of the most fundamental problems of a free government under law: that of how to provide effectively by law for change in law, and specifically of how to proceed when the law that prevents change is the law whose change is sought. It is the reflexive, or \"catch-22,\" character of entrenchment that often makes it appear soluble only by going \"outside the system\" to cut through the dilemma.", "Current proposals for action by \"nuclear option\" have a form that resembles that of the action taken by the House in 1910, because the dilemma they address has a reflexive form similar to that of the House in 1910. As do contemporary advocates of consideration limits in the Senate, supporters of change in the House argued that the autonomy of a deliberative body requires it to be able to entertain proposals to change rules when it deems necessary. As do Senate advocates today, House reformers presented their claim as a shift from an inappropriate to a more correct principle of action. But the House in 1911 concluded that unrestricted floor access for rules changes was subject to such abuses as to be unworkable as a settled principle.", "The events of 1975 in the Senate could be viewed as representing a corresponding development of thought in that body. In order to promote the attempt of that year to change the cloture rule, the Senate initially affirmed the propriety of permitting a simple majority to close consideration of a rules change at the beginning of a Congress, by tabling a point of order against a motion that would have had that effect. These proceedings enabled the Senate to adopt amendments to the cloture rule that tended to facilitate limiting consideration. At that point, however, the Senate accepted a reconsideration of the original point of order, and decided to sustain it, thereby rejecting the principle that a voting majority could close consideration of rules changes and consequently reaffirming the entrenchment of Senate rules.", "Ultimately, as a result, although the Senate had on some occasions seemed prepared to accept some version of the claim based on the rulemaking power, it always drew back in the end from ultimately confirming this claim, instead affirming principles that supported entrenchment. It is possible to see this course of events as manifesting the willingness of Senators to accept resort to the constitutional rulemaking power as a \"revolutionary\" principle, but their unwillingness to maintain it as a permanent possibility in the practice of the Senate.", "In present circumstances, before the Senate makes a departure from accepted principles in favor of ones that might be unsustainable in the long run, in order to achieve certain specific goals, the body might wish to satisfy itself that the magnitude of the problem to be addressed genuinely warranted, and its intractability genuinely required, such action. If consideration of this question concludes that the Senate could not successfully regulate itself in the long run on the basis of the proposed principle, then invoking that principle to meet immediate needs would presumably have to be justified instead on the grounds of something like \"revolutionary expediency.\" Like the House in 1910, the Senate might have to justify its action on the grounds that the situation precluded any other means of amelioration. It is, of course, a concept that lies squarely at the heart of the American tradition that in such circumstances, \"revolutionary\" action may appropriately be justified by appeals to explicitly stated arguments of exactly the kind just sketched\u2014a concept both articulated in and exemplified by the Declaration of Independence itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Change Under Established Constraints", "paragraphs": ["The preceding reflections suggest that, if a \"nuclear option\" involved abandonment of the practice of adherence to precedent in parliamentary rulings, it could have the effect of replacing the current almost impenetrable resistance of Senate procedure to change (if the change is controversial) with a nearly uncontrollable volatility. Establishment of a more sustainable balance between procedural stability and the Senate's control of its own rules might require action by other than extraordinary means.", "Presumably, the Senate would wish to have effective means of changing its rules at need and to adapt them to the needs of the times, but it might not wish to foster continual change on an ad hoc basis in response to shifting immediate demands. If a rule regulating the consideration of proposals for change could be crafted in a way that afforded an appropriate balance between these values, the Senate might be able to adopt it through its regular processes for amending its rules. A procedure adopted in this way could respond to considerations about what specific ways of proceeding would effectively permit action while still securing the possibility of meaningful exchange of views as the basis for finding broadly acceptable solutions.", "If a procedure were established by these means, the Senate might also be able to frame it in a way that would take account, in an explicit and appropriate way, of the status of the Senate as a continuing body. It might provide, for example, that a change supported by a majority too small to invoke cloture could be adopted, but could not take effect until six years after its adoption. Such an arrangement would permit change in the long run while inhibiting changes by a temporary majority for immediate purposes."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "For Further Reading", "paragraphs": ["Sarah Binder and Steven Smith. \"This Battle Isn't New: The Filibustering of Judicial Nominations.\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch , March 8, 2005, p. 6.", "Robert C.
