The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has pursued research and development (R&D) of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated CCS system since 1997. Congress has appropriated nearly $7 billion in total since FY2008 for CCS research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) at DOE's Office of Fossil Energy: nearly $3.5 billion in total annual appropriations (including FY2015) and $3.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act; P.L. 111-5). The large influx of Recovery Act funding for industrial-scale CCS projects was intended to accelerate development and deployment of CCS in the United States. Since enactment of the Recovery Act, DOE has shifted its RD&D emphasis to the demonstration phase of carbon capture technology. To date, however, there are no commercial ventures in the United States that capture, transport, and inject industrial-scale quantities of CO2 solely for the purpose of carbon sequestration.", "The success of DOE CCS demonstration projects likely will influence the outlook for widespread deployment of CCS technologies as a strategy for preventing large quantities of CO2 from reaching the atmosphere while U.S. power plants continue to burn fossil fuels, mainly coal. One project, the Kemper County Facility, has received $270 million from DOE under its Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) Round 2 program and is slated to begin commercial operation in 2016. The 582 megawatt-capacity facility anticipates capturing 65% of its CO2 emissions, making it equivalent to a new natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant. Cost and schedule overruns at the Kemper Plant, however, have raised questions over the relative value of environmental benefits from CCS technology compared with construction costs of the facility and its effect on ratepayers.", "In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed emission standards for new and existing fossil-fueled electric generating units under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. New natural gas-fired stationary power plants should be able to meet the proposed standard for new plants without additional cost and without the need for add-on control technology. However, the only apparent technical way for new coal-fired plants to meet the standard would be to install CCS technology. The proposed rule has sparked increased scrutiny of the future of CCS as a viable technology for reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.", "Given the pending EPA rule, congressional interest in the future of coal as a domestic energy source appears directly linked to the future of CCS. Debate has been mixed as to whether the rule would spur development and deployment of CCS for new coal-fired power plants or have the opposite effect. Congressional oversight of the CCS RD&D program could help inform decisions about the level of support for the program and help Congress gauge whether it is on track to meet its goals. In the 114th Congress, a bill has been introduced (S. 601) that would promote CCS for coal-fired utilities by a combination of loan guarantees, tax credits, and supporting the DOE R&D effort in its coal program, among other things. A similar bill was introduced in the 113th Congress but was not enacted.", "One issue is whether congressional oversight is needed of the CCS R&D program, particularly of the results from the demonstration projects as they progress.

An integrated CCS system would include three main steps: (1) capturing CO 2 at its source and separating it from other gases; (2) purifying, compressing, and transporting the captured CO 2 to the sequestration site; and (3) injecting the CO 2 into subsurface geological reservoirs. Following its injection into a subsurface reservoir, the CO 2 would need to be monitored for leakage and to verify that it remains in the target geological reservoir. Once injection operations cease, a responsible party would need to take title to the injected CO 2 and ensure that it stays underground in perpetuity.", "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has pursued research and development of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated CCS system since 1997.

How many retirements will take place and what role EPA regulations will play in causing them are matters of dispute.", "Part of the argument over the proposed rule for new plants has focused on whether CCS is the best system of emissions reduction (BSER) for coal plants and whether it has been \"adequately demonstrated\" as required under the Clean Air Act. In its re-proposed rule, EPA cites the \"existence and apparent ongoing viability\" of several ongoing CCS demonstration projects as examples that justify a separate determination of BSER for coal-fired plants and integrated gasification combined-cycle plants.

The shift appears to be largely due to the cheaper and increasingly abundant fuel\u2014natural gas\u2014compared to coal for electricity production. The EPA re-proposed rule noted that \"power companies often choose the lowest cost form of generation when determining what type of new generation to build. Based on [Energy Information Administration] modeling and utility [Integrated Resource Plans], there appears to be a general acceptance that the lowest cost form of new power generation is [natural gas combined-cycle].\" Cheap gas, due to the rapid increase in the domestic natural gas supply as an alternative to coal, in combination with regulations that curtail CO 2 emissions may lead electric power producers to invest in natural gas-fired plants, which emit approximately half the amount of CO 2 per unit of electricity produced compared to coal-fired plants. Regulations and abundant cheap gas may raise questions about the rationale for funding CCS demonstration projects (e.g., see \" Lessons from FutureGen: A Similar Path for Other Demonstration Projects? \").", "Alternatively, and despite increasingly abundant domestic natural gas supplies, EPA regulations could provide the necessary incentives for the industry to accelerate CCS development and deployment for coal-fired power plants. As part of its re-proposed ruling for new power plants, EPA cited technology as one of four factors that it considers in making a BSER determination. Specifically, EPA stated that it \"considers whether the system promotes the implementation and further development of technology,\" in this case referring to CCS technology. It appears that EPA asserted that its rule would likely promote CCS development and deployment rather than hinder it. Those arguing against the re-proposed rule do so on the basis that CCS technology has not been adequately demonstrated, and that it violates provisions in P.L. 109-58 , the Energy Policy Act of 2005, that prohibit EPA from setting a performance standard based on the use of technology from certain DOE-funded projects, such as the three projects cited in the EPA re-proposal, among other reasons.

Bush proposed a 10-year, $1 billion project known as FutureGen to build a coal-fired power plant that would integrate carbon sequestration and hydrogen production at a 275 megawatt-capacity plant, enough to power about 150,000 average U.S. homes. As originally conceived, the plant would have been a coal-gasification facility and would have produced and sequestered between 1 million and 2 million tons of CO 2 annually. On January 30, 2008, DOE announced that it was \"restructuring\" the FutureGen program away from a single, state-of-the-art \"living laboratory\" of integrated R&D technologies\u2014a single plant\u2014to pursue instead a new strategy of multiple commercial demonstration projects. In the restructured program, DOE announced that it would support up to two or three demonstration projects of at least 300 megawatts that would sequester at least 1 million tons of CO 2 per year.", "In the Bush Administration's FY2009 budget, DOE requested $156 million for the restructured FutureGen program and specified that the federal cost share would cover only the CCS portions of the demonstration projects, not the entire power system. However, after the Recovery Act was enacted on February 17, 2009, Secretary of Energy Chu announced an agreement with the FutureGen Alliance\u2014an industry consortium\u2014to advance construction of the FutureGen plant built in Mattoon, Illinois, the site selected by the FutureGen Alliance in 2007. Further, DOE anticipated that $1 billion of funding from the Recovery Act would be used to support the project.

FutureGen 2.0 differed from the original concept for the plant because it aimed to retrofit Ameren's existing power plant in Meridosia, Illinois, with oxy-combustion technology at a 202 megawatt oil-fired unit, rather than build a new, state-of-the-art plant in Mattoon. ", "On February 3, 2015, DOE announced it was canceling funding for the FutureGen project. The most pressing reason for the program's suspension is the September 30, 2015, deadline for spending the Recovery Act funding and the likelihood that the FutureGen Alliance would not be able to commit the funds by that date, which, in turn, led to uncertainty about the alliance's ability to secure private-sector funding to make up the rest of the project costs after Recovery Act funding was exhausted. The FutureGen Alliance had spent approximately $200 million of the nearly $1 billion in Recovery Act funding appropriated and allocated to FutureGen.

DOE committed approximately $3.3 billion of Recovery Act funding to large demonstration projects (approximately $800 million less now, with the demise of FutureGen). One rationale for committing such a substantial level of funding was to scale up and quicken the pace of CCS RD&D.", "Some argue that FutureGen was unique from its original conception. None of the other large-scale demonstration projects in the United States share the same original ambitious vision to create a new, one-of-a-kind, near-zero emission CCS plant from the ground up. Even though the individual components of FutureGen as it was originally conceived were not themselves new innovations, combining the capture, transportation, and storage components into a 250-megawatt functioning power plant could be considered unprecedented and therefore likely to experience delays at each step in development.

The task of tackling all the stages of technology development in one project\u2014the original FutureGen\u2014might have been too daunting and, in addition to other factors, contributed to the project's erratic progress since 2003.

The large-volume tests can be considered injection experiments conducted at a commercial scale (i.e., approximately 1 million tons of CO 2 injected per year) that should provide crucial information on the suitability of different geologic reservoirs; monitoring, verification, and accounting of injected CO 2 ; risk assessment protocols for long-term injection and storage; and other critical challenges.", "In 2003 DOE created seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships (RCSPs), essentially consortia of public and private sector organizations grouped by geographic region across the United States and parts of Canada.

These nontechnical issues are not trivial, and could pose serious challenges to widespread deployment of CCS even if the technical challenges of injecting CO 2 safely and in perpetuity are resolved. For example, a complete regulatory framework for managing the underground injection of CO 2 has not been developed in the United States. However, EPA promulgated a rule under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) that creates a new class of injection wells under the existing Underground Injection Control Program. The new class of wells (Class VI) establishes national requirements specifically for injecting CO 2 and protecting underground sources of drinking water. EPA's stated purpose in proposing the rule was to ensure that CCS can occur in a safe and effective manner in order to enable commercial-scale CCS to move forward.", "The development of the regulation for Class VI wells highlighted that EPA's authority under the SDWA is limited to protecting underground sources of drinking water but does not address other major issues. Some of these include the long-term liability for injected CO 2 , regulation of potential emissions to the atmosphere, legal issues if the CO 2 plume migrates underground across state boundaries, private property rights of owners of the surface lands above the injected CO 2 plume, and ownership of the subsurface reservoirs (also referred to as pore space). Because of these issues and others, there are some indications that broad community acceptance of CCS may be a challenge. The large-scale injection tests may help identify the key factors that lead to community concerns over CCS, and help guide DOE, EPA, other agencies, and the private sector towards strategies leading to the widespread deployment of CCS.

Boundary Dam also sends most of its captured CO 2 to a nearby oilfield for enhanced oil recovery.", "The DOE CCS RD&D program has embarked on commercial-scale demonstration projects for CO 2 capture, injection, and storage.

The use of hydraulic fracturing techniques to extract unconventional natural gas deposits recently has drawn national attention to the possible negative consequences of deep well injection of large volumes of fluids. Hydraulic fracturing involves the high-pressure injection of fluids into the target formation to fracture the rock and release natural gas or oil. The injected fluids, together with naturally occurring fluids in the shale, are referred to as produced water. Produced waters are pumped out of the well and disposed of. Often the produced waters are disposed of by re-injecting them at a different site in a different well. These practices have raised concerns about possible leakage as fluids are pumped into and out of the ground, and about deep-well injection causing earthquakes. Public concerns over hydraulic fracturing and deep-well injection of produced waters may spill over into concerns about deep-well injection of CO 2 . How successfully DOE is able to address these types of concerns as the large-scale demonstration projects move forward into their injection phases could affect the future of CCS deployment."], "subsections": []}]}}
