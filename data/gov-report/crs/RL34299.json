Since 2000, aid levels have increased, especially in the Andean region, as the focus has shifted from Cold War issues to counternarcotics and security assistance. Current aid levels to Latin America and the Caribbean comprise about 5.8% of the worldwide FY2007 aid budget, including both bilateral and multilateral assistance. Amounts requested for the regular FY2008 budget would increase this ratio to 6.1%, and to 7.2% if Congress approves supplemental funds for a new counternarcotics initiative in Mexico and Central America. Three countries\u2014Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador\u2014have signed compacts for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funds worth a combined $851 million. Aid levels to the region could increase further as more countries become eligible for MCA.

Brazil and the Southern Cone of South America are to receive an estimated $18.5 million.", "Aid programs are designed to achieve a variety of goals, from poverty reduction to economic growth. Child Survival and Health (CSH) funds focus on combating infectious diseases and promoting child and maternal health. Development Assistance (DA) promotes sustainable economic growth in key areas such as trade, agriculture, education, the environment, and democracy. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) assists countries of strategic importance to the United States, and funds programs relating to justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, and respect for human rights.

The region is considered important to U.S. interests as countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are important trading partners, sources of immigration to the United States, and production centers and transit points for illegal narcotics. Environmental concerns are also prominent, particularly in the Amazon basin.", "U.S. support for development is identified by President Bush as one of the three pillars, with defense and diplomacy, of the National Security Strategy, developed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Globally, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) identifies five challenges to which U.S. assistance programs are designed to respond: promoting transformational development; strengthening fragile states; providing humanitarian relief; supporting U.S. geostrategic interests; and mitigating global and transnational ills. USAID identifies the main security threats to the United States as the confluence of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and global criminal networks. The focus has shifted to strengthening the institutions of weak states, rather than on just economic growth, because weak states are seen as permissive environments for terrorist and criminal activities.", "A foreign aid reform initiative, begun in 2006, categorizes countries in one of five categories: transforming; developing; sustaining partners; rebuilding; and restrictive.

U.S. assistance spiked in the 1960s during President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, reflecting an interest in preventing the spread of Soviet and Cuban influence in the region, and recognizing poverty as one possible root cause of popular discord. In the 1980s, the U.S. focus shifted to the Central American isthmus where leftist insurgencies were challenging friendly governments, and where a leftist movement in Nicaragua had taken control of government through armed combat. Substantial amounts of U.S. assistance were provided to support Central American governments and the U.S.-backed Contras seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.", "In the aftermath of the 1989 U.S. military intervention in Panama, and the 1990 electoral defeat of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, U.S. assistance to these two countries increased substantially. Countries in Central America have resolved a number of their political problems since the 1980s, although it is still one of the least developed areas in the hemisphere. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. concerns about spreading communist influence lessened, and so too did levels of U.S. assistance for a time.

During the 1990s, the regional annual average aid level was approximately $1.9 billion; since 2000, it has averaged $2.4 billion, largely a reflection of increases in counternarcotics resources directed at the Andean region. The FY2008 request of $1.6 billion in the regular budget represents a decrease in the average since 2000, but is consistent with levels since FY2006. When including an additional $550 million in counternarcotics funds for Mexico and Central America requested as part of the supplemental budget, the FY2008 request is $2.1 billion, an increase from the previous year.", "Some countries are benefitting from two new presidential initiatives. Haiti and Guyana\u2014identified as focus countries by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u2014have received increased assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.

The average during the 1990s was $459.8 million.

OAS Development Assistance Programs focus on Summit of the Americas mandates pertaining to economic prosperity, social well being, and environmental health. The OAS De-mining Program (AICMA) works to ensure that the Western Hemisphere is cleared of all land mine devices. The OAS also monitors the disarmament and demobilization of Colombian armed groups through its Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia.", "Other Types of Foreign Assistance", "Highly-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative", "The HIPC initiative was first launched in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank to provide relief to extremely poor countries facing unsustainable amounts of foreign debt. The HIPC initiative encompasses 41 countries, mostly in Africa, but only those that have adopted sound fiscal policies and a poverty reduction plan may qualify. Latin American beneficiaries of the HIPC initiative include Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Total costs of the HIPC initiative are estimated at $51 billion (nominal terms), roughly evenly divided between bilateral creditors like the United States and multilateral lenders such as the IMF and World Bank. Because only about 3% of the HIPC debt was owed to the United States, the U.S. financial commitment has been relatively small in relation to the cost to all creditors.", "Democracy Fund", "For FY2006, Congress created a new account and appropriated $95 million for it. The program is to increase the effectiveness and oversight of programs that promote democracy, governance, human rights, an independent media, and the rule of law. The $95 million provided is in addition to other bilateral assistance that promotes democracy. Congress also directed that $3 million be provided for forensic assistance to Central and South America, and $2 million be provided to the National Endowment for Democracy for programs in Venezuela."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
