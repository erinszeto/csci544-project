Many senior leaders are determined to design a strategy that defines a new role for U.S. nuclear weapons and makes those weapons responsive and relevant in today's global threat environment. The current U.S. nuclear enterprise consists of a triad of options: Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs), and long-range bombers. All three legs of the nuclear triad are aging, since they were largely built to counter the threat of the Soviet Union. Policymakers in Congress and the Executive Branch are now deciding whether to modernize or replace parts of each leg.", "The Obama Administration's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) outlines its approach to reducing nuclear dangers and pursuing the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, while simultaneously advancing broader U.S. security interests. In his April 2009 speech in Prague, President Obama highlighted the current nuclear dangers in the global environment and declared the United States will \"seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\" The Nuclear Posture Review provides the roadmap for implementing President Obama's agenda for reducing nuclear risks to the United States, U.S. allies and partners, and the international community.", "This raises several issues for Congress particularly regarding the Triad's ICBM component. First, Congress may consider whether the current plans for the nuclear enterprise are sufficient to address the problems within the ICBM force or whether there may be other ways to sustain the current force. Second, Congress may consider whether the United States should continue to deploy ICBMs in the future nuclear force structure, particularly in light of expected financial constraints. It may consider whether nuclear weapons modernization programs will compete with each other, or with conventional weapons programs, for scarce resources. Finally, Congress may address questions about whether the United States can afford to forgo ICBM sustainment and modernization programs in an era of changing national security challenges."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States is currently facing two key challenges related to the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force. The first is sustainment of the current force and the implementation of needed improvements in operations and support. The second is the planned modernization of the ICBM force, including building new weapons, expected in the late 2020s. Both would likely necessitate increased funding, but the Budget Control Act (BCA) limits funding for the Department of Defense (DOD) through 2021. Moreover, the United States also plans to modernize other components of its nuclear forces during the 2020s, which would also likely necessitate further significant increases in spending in the 2020s. Congress has a key role in any decisions related to these issues.", "The discussion about whether to modernize or replace the ICBM force is a significant part of the national debate about the future of U.S. nuclear weapons. Supporters argue that ICBMs have been the cornerstone of the U.S. nuclear force posture since the 1960s, when the U.S. fielded the first Minuteman III missile. While deterrence in the 21 st century is more difficult for the U.S. than it was in the past, having the right mix of nuclear capabilities to deal with new challenges is still seen as crucial. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) identifies a variety of emerging situations in which ICBMs might play a role in deterring adversaries, stabilizing regions and reassuring allies and partners. Both Russia and China are modernizing their nuclear weapons. Moreover, the U.S. relationship with China is evolving, North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, and Iran has pursued a nuclear program that may eventually provide a weapon capability. The United States also continues to extend deterrence to allies and partner nations with a \"credible U.S. 'nuclear umbrella.'\" Thus, according to many observers, the United States would need to sustain and modernize its ICBM force to manage challenges in the new global security and threat environment.", "While long-range nuclear bombers and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMS) are relatively concentrated in location (and therefore may be vulnerable to attack), the size, protection, and dispersion of ICBM forces makes them virtually impossible to destroy short of an all-out nuclear attack. Additionally, since an ICBM force can only be crippled by a large and unmistakable nuclear attack, land-based ICBMs can provide clarity about when a country is under attack and who the attacker is.", "Others, however, argue that ICBMs are a relic of the Cold War and play little or no role in helping the United States meet \"21 st century security challenges.\" Further, they argue that, in an era of constrained resources and declining defense budgets, U.S. security would be better served by investing in new advanced conventional weapons than by sustaining and modernizing the ICBM force.", "Experts agree that the international security environment has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War. As President Obama noted in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, the threat of global nuclear war has become remote, but the risk of nuclear attack has increased. Some nations may be shifting their security strategy to rely more on nuclear weapons in an effort to counter the U.S. conventional forces.", "The Nuclear Posture Review further noted that, \"as long as nuclear weapons exist,\" the United States will sustain secure and effective nuclear forces. In this view, these nuclear forces will continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring allies and partners around the world. In \"A Nuclear Deterrent for the 21 st Century,\" Clark Murdock writes, \"much like the United States in the 1950s when it faced massive Warsaw Pact conventional forces, other states are increasing their reliance on nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons offset conventional military superiority. When the U.S. military declares that it is seeking 'full spectrum dominance\", it simply reinforces the dependence of our would-be competitors on nuclear weapons.\"", "There are several issues for Congress. First, Congress may consider whether the current plans for the nuclear enterprise (consisting of leadership, people and things that work on the nuclear mission) are sufficient to address the problems within the ICBM force or whether there may be other ways to sustain the current force. Second, Congress may consider whether the United States should continue to deploy ICBMs in the future nuclear force structure, particularly in light of expected financial constraints. It may consider whether nuclear weapons modernization programs will compete with each other, or with conventional weapons programs, for scarce resources.

According to the Nuclear Posture Review, \"strategic nuclear submarines and the SLBMs they carry represent the most survivable leg of the U.S. nuclear Triad.\" Some argue single-warhead ICBMs contribute to stability, and like SLBMs are not vulnerable to air defenses. Unlike SLBMs and ICBMs, bombers can be visibly forward deployed, as a signal in crisis to strengthen deterrence of potential adversaries and assurance to allies and partners. Others contend that, because each leg of the triad contributes unique attributes that enhance deterrence and reduce risk, together they comprise a robust deterrent that complicates a potential adversary's offensive and defensive planning. In this view, they provide a \"synergistic force\" that provides protection against the failure of any single one of its legs.

The Navy plans to replace each retiring boat, starting in 2031, with a new class of ballistic missile submarine, referred to as the SSBNX, or the Ohio-class replacement. The Navy originally planned to begin using the replacement boats in 2029, but in 2012 the Pentagon announced a two-year delay to the SSBNX program. This would push back completion of the first SSBNX to 2031.

The Pentagon's FY2014 budget includes $359 million for research and development of the bomber. The Air Force plans to spend $32.1 billion over the next ten years on research and development of the new bomber.

These aircraft became operational in 1997 and have a planned service life of six decades. In order to continue delivering long-range direct attack munitions in an anti-access environment, the B-2 will need upgrades in communication, offensive, and defensive systems.

The Air Force plans to retain 400 ICBMs as the United States reduces its forces under the 2010 New START Treaty. Many observers have noticed that, because these ICBMs are geographically dispersed in hardened, underground silos, the ICBMs would be difficult for any adversary to destroy in an attack on the United States.

These programs have addressed aging and technology issues in the missiles' propulsion, guidance, and reentry vehicle systems. Currently, the Air Force is pursuing the ICBM fuse modernization program, which is to replace the current MK21 warhead fuse so that the missiles can operate through 2030. The Air Force plans to procure 693 modernized fuses for the Minuteman fleet, at a cost of $830 million. It has requested $13.7 million for this program in FY2016, and expects to spend around $65 million through 2020.

In other words, the Air Force would deploy a new missile in its existing Minuteman infrastructure. Reports also indicate that, although this missile would be deployed in fixed silos, the design would allow the missiles to be deployed on mobile launchers sometime in the future.

Many officers on missile duty feel that the rewards of such work are not commensurate with the effort required, despite the knowledge that the work is vital to national security. Therefore, missile crews seek ways to minimize their exposure to primary combat crew duty. One way to do so is to score high marks on proficiency examinations, which can lead to designation as a crew instructor and a reduction in duty on missile alert. This attitude is completely opposite to Air Force flight crews who are generally motivated to spend as much time as possible performing crew duty in the air.", "Another issue is the long-term viability of the ICBM officer career. While the Air Force needs a large number of junior officers on combat crews, it does not need as many in other ICBM-related assignments such as instructors or working daily operations.

They argue that it is \"unlikely that these problems can be solved by more money, more stars, more organizational changes, reducing burdens on airmen, or recommitting to the importance of deterrence without addressing the underlying problem.\" The underlying problem, according to these skeptics, is that nuclear weapons no longer play a prominent role in U.S. national security policy.", "Others also argue that these reforms will not be sufficient in addressing the underlying problems because no amount of cleaning, paint, or increase in pay can offset the sense, in the ICBM force, that there is no meaning to the mission. The morale problems facing the troops who are part of the nuclear enterprise are unlikely to be fully resolved by any changes that DOD can make. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated in discussing the review that in order to change the situation, \"we must change the cultural perception of a nuclear enterprise\u2026We must restore the prestige that attracted the brightest minds of the Cold War era, so our most talented young men and women see the nuclear pathway as promising in value.\" Some argue that Hagel's assessment only draws further attention to the real issue\u2014the United States is no longer in \"the Cold War era.\" They state the U.S. is in a strategic transition from the Cold War to an era characterized by threats such as al Qaeda, ISIS, and Ebola.

In addition to pursuing sustainment and modernization programs for the ICBM force, the Air Force is beginning work on a new long-range bomber and a new cruise missile, and the Navy is beginning the construction of a new ballistic missile submarine while pursuing a life extension program for its submarine launched D-5 missile. Congress may consider whether the U.S. should continue to deploy ICBMs in the future nuclear force structure, particularly in light of expected financial constraints. It may consider whether nuclear weapons modernization programs will compete with each other, or with conventional weapons programs, for scarce resources.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) is currently investing in life extension programs for U.S. nuclear warheads. During the Cold War, DOE sustained the U.S. warhead stockpile by designing, testing, and deploying new warheads to replace aging warheads. Because the United States has observed a testing moratorium since 1992, it maintains its current inventory through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, a scientific experimentation and simulation undertaking that assesses the status of the nuclear weapon arsenal without underground nuclear tests. Instead of designing and deploying new warheads, DOE manages and maintains the stockpile by pursuing Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for existing warheads and investing in the supporting and aging infrastructure. Many analysts agree that investments in both the infrastructure and workforce will help sustain the long-term safety, security, and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but these investments could add to the cost of the nuclear enterprise at the same time that DOD is modernizing its nuclear delivery systems.", "As calculated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the costs of these programs could reach more than $30 billion per year in the 2020s, and amount to a total of more than $1 trillion over 30 years. Yet, as Frank Kendall, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee, this plan could generate \"affordability problems\" in the 2020s. This can raise questions of whether the United States can, or should, pursue all of these programs. As a result, some have suggested that the United States forgo the ICBM modernization programs and eventually eliminate the ICBM leg of the triad.", "Over the 2015-2024 time period, the Administration's plans for nuclear forces would cost $348 billion per CBO estimates (see Table 1 ).

Most experts agree that U.S. nuclear strategy has changed since the Cold War days of potential massive retaliation and mutual assured destruction, but many argue that nuclear weapons still matter for the United States because they are the most credible means of deterring the use of nuclear weapons by other states. While few anticipate a U.S.-USSR-style potential nuclear exchange, some experts suggest that a \"second nuclear age\" has begun in which numerous nations may possess nuclear weapons and the ability to use them in regional conflicts. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review recognized this change when it asserted that nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation now pose greater threats to U.S. security than established nuclear-armed states. U.S. strategic nuclear forces are not well designed to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism, but future U.S. nuclear strategy will need to account for the threats that may exist as a result of nuclear proliferation.", "Some argue that ICBMs are antiquated systems unchanged since the Cold War. They contend that the ICBM force is a relic of the Cold War and is not relevant in an environment where the United States no longer faces the threat of a massive attack from the Soviet Union. These analysts argue that because the Pentagon cannot plan \"for every contingency, it must plan for the most conceivable future. In this case, that might mean a step back from nuclear weapons toward greater focus on those weapons we might actually use.\" Others argue that U.S. ICBMs could only be used against Russia because if they were to be sent anywhere else in the world, they would still have to overfly Russia, risking the creation of ambiguous attack indicators that could trigger a nuclear response.", "On the other hand, some experts argue that ICBMs continue to provide a deterrent to nuclear attack on the homeland. They note that the sheer numbers of Minuteman III silos (400+) that are spread across the American West are invulnerable to all but massive nuclear missile attacks. This curbs those who may wish to attack the United States: conventionally or with nuclear weapons. They note that, without ICBMs, U.S. land-based strategic nuclear targets shrink \"from 503 to six, which could all be destroyed with conventional strikes. Only ICBMs require a nuclear strike.\" Moreover, any attack against the ICBM force represents a direct attack against the United States. Therefore, ICBMs deny prospective enemies \"any hope of half-way measures against us: if they mean nuclear war, then they must decide upon nuclear war.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should ICBMs Be Sustained in an Era of Strategic Uncertainty?", "paragraphs": ["As analysts within and outside DOD continue to debate the value of the nuclear deterrent to the defense of the United States, Congress may wish to reevaluate whether to continue to support the nation's ICBM force.

According to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, both North Korea and Iran have violated nonproliferation obligations, defied directives of the United Nations Security Council, pursued missile delivery capabilities, and resisted international efforts to resolve through diplomatic means the crises they have created.

The United States could seek to address these challenges through dialogue and transparency. Though the dialogue with each country would be different, the message could be similar: fostering good will and partnerships. For example, a strategic dialogue with Russia could allow the United States to explain that \"our missile defenses and any future U.S. conventionally armed long-range ballistic missile systems are designed to address newly emerging regional threats, and are not intended to affect the strategic balance with Russia.\" In turn, the United States could ask Russia to explain their modernization programs as well as their strategic doctrine.", "A strategic dialogue with China could, likewise, allow both nations to communicate with one another about their views on each other's nuclear strategies, policies, and programs. China's leaders have been vocal about their concerns over the U.S. ballistic missile defenses. As stated in the 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report, \"maintaining strategic stability in the U.S.-China relationship is as important to this Administration as maintaining strategic stability with other major powers.\" It is seen as important for the U.S. to highlight willingness to work together with the PRC, while simultaneously underlining U.S. support to its allies and partners in the East Asia region.", "Others, however, doubt that dialogue, even when combined with transparency, would resolve emerging concerns with either Russia or China. In the past year, Russia has taken a number of steps, such as its invasion of Ukraine, its aggressive military exercises, and its violation of the 1987 INF Treaty, that challenge the security interests of the United States and its allies. China has also become more assertive in its region with its actions in the East China and South China Seas in ways that have raised concerns about challenges to U.S. interests and allies. At the same time, both nations are modernizing their nuclear forces and, in some cases, expanding their nuclear arsenals.", "As a result, many analysts continue to view nuclear weapons, and the nuclear balance, as a significant marker in the U.S. relationship with both Russia and China. They note that a U.S. commitment to modernizing its triad, in general, and its ICBM force, in particular, is necessary to assure stability and U.S. security. Some experts argue that, from a global perspective, the United States must \"maintain nuclear parity with the Russians and sustain nuclear superiority over the Chinese.\" They contend that dealing with a Russian government believing it possessed nuclear superiority would be more difficult than it is at present and that dealing with a China that had achieved nuclear parity would tear big holes in the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Therefore, some argue that, in order to remain a credible player on the world stage, the U.S. must ensure that its nuclear forces and capabilities remain a priority.
