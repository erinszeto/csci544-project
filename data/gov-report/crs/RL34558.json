The President's request for those funds and Congress' disposition of the request are discussed in this report on pp. 2 through 9, below. The balance of the report discusses those parts of the President's regular FY2009 budget request covered by the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill.", "President George W. Bush submitted his regular FY2009 appropriations request to Congress on February 4, 2008, including $115.3 billion for programs covered in the regular Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill: $24.4 billion for Title I (military construction and family housing); $90.8 billion for Title II (veterans affairs); and $183 million for Title III (related agencies). Compared with funding appropriated for FY2008 (emergency supplemental appropriations are pending), this represented increases for Title I of $3.8 billion (18.3%), for Title II of $3.2 billion (3.6%), and for Title III of $16.7 million (10.1%). The overall increase in appropriations between that requested for FY2009 and enacted for FY2008 is $7.0 billion (6.4%).", "The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported their versions of the FY2009 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill on June 24 (H.R. 6559) and July 22 (S. 3301), 2008, respectively. The bill's legislative path is laid out in detail in the Regular Fiscal Year 2009 Appropriations section of this report. The House committee recommended appropriating $118.7 billion in new budget authority, $3.4 billion above the President's request. This included $24.8 billion for Title I, $400 million above the request and $4.2 billion above the FY2008 enactment. The Senate committee recommended $119.8 billion, including $24.7 billion for Title I. The Continuing Appropriations Act appropriated $119.6 billion, including $25.0 billion for Title I. In the area of veterans' non-medical benefits, mandatory spending is increasing as claims for disability compensation, pension, and readjustment benefits increase due to a combination of several factors including the aging of the veterans population and the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result of the increase in the number of claims, the average processing time for a disability claim in FY2007 was 183 days. To reduce the pending claims workload and improve processing time, funds were provided in the FY2008 appropriation for hiring and training additional claims processing staff. In FY2008 mandatory spending was $44.5 billion, increasing to $46.0 billion in FY2009.", "In terms of medical care afforded to veterans, similar to the past six years, the Administration has included several cost sharing proposals including increase in pharmacy copayments and enrollment fees for lower priority veterans. An additional proposal would bill veterans directly for treatment of nonservice-connected conditions. The House Appropriations Committee draft bill provides $40.8 billion for Veterans Health Administration for FY2009, a 9.6% increase over the FY2008 enacted amount of $37.2 billion, and 4.1% above the President's request of $39.2 billion.

The E.O. applies only to appropriations enacted after January 29, 2008, and will therefore not affect any existing or prior-year appropriation.", "The E.O. does not appear to bar the implementation of congressionally directed funding in cases where spending is \"required by law or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.\" Examples of such a situation have existed where particular construction projects have been directed in the text of previously enacted authorization acts. The President's order also allows agency heads to \"consider the views of a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress with respect to commitments, obligations, or expenditures to carry out any earmark\" when \"such views are in writing....\"", "In addition, the definition of an \"earmark\" written into the E.O. may reduce somewhat the clarity of exactly what spending is to be avoided. That definition states that earmarks are \"purported congressional direction ( whether in statutory text , report language, or other communication) [that] circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient\" (emphasis added). While much of the E.O. stresses the necessity of adhering to the letter of the law, this definition could be interpreted as preventing an agency from observing some statutory text.", "More generally, the E.O. may raise a number of other questions regarding future expenditure of appropriated funds. Two examples are suggested below.", "1. There are instances where a construction project is not stated within the statutory text of the law in question, but rather is referenced in the text of another. An example might be a statutory requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs to construct a number of cemeteries for the use of veterans at specified locations for which appropriations are not provided until a number of years later. Would the E.O. bar the initiation of construction until such a statutory link is found and proven to unambiguously cover each project? 2. The E.O. grants agency heads the authority to accept congressionally directed funding when a project has \"merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking,\" or when considering \"the views of a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress ... when such views are in writing....\" Do these provisions constitute a broad discretion on the part of agency heads to accept congressional guidance on spending?", "In drafting its version of the FY2009 appropriations bill, the House committee clarified the status of congressionally directed spending within the context of the Executive Order by referencing the list of construction projects within the statute.
