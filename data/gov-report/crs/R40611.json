{"id": "R40611", "title": "Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit", "released_date": "2018-08-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173) established a voluntary, outpatient prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2006. Medicare Part D provides coverage through private prescription drug plans (PDPs) that offer only drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage (MA) prescription drug plans (MA-PDs) that offer coverage as part of broader, managed care plans. Private drug plans participating in Part D bear some financial risk, although federal subsidies cover most program costs in an effort to encourage participation and keep benefits affordable.", "At a minimum, Medicare drug plans must offer a \"standard coverage\" package of benefits or alternative coverage that is actuarially equivalent to a standard plan. Plans also may offer enhanced benefits. Although all plans must meet certain minimum requirements, there can be significant differences among offerings in terms of benefit design, specific drugs included in formularies (i.e., lists of covered drugs), cost sharing for particular drugs, or the level of monthly premiums. In general, beneficiaries can enroll in a plan, or change plan enrollment, when they first become eligible for Medicare or during open enrollment periods each October 15 through December 7. For plan year 2018, there are between 19 and 26 PDPs in the nation's 34 PDP regions, in addition to Medicare Advantage plans. Because sponsors are allowed to change plan offerings from year to year, beneficiaries annually face the need for careful review of their choices to select the plans that best meet their needs.", "A key element of the Part D program is enhanced coverage for low-income individuals. Persons with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and assets below set limits are eligible for extra assistance with Medicare Part D premiums and cost sharing. Individuals enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (so-called dual eligibles) and certain other low-income beneficiaries are automatically enrolled in no-premium plans, which are Part D plans that have premiums at or below specified levels.", "In 2017, about 42.5 million out of a total of 58.6 million Medicare beneficiaries received prescription drug benefits through a PDP or an MA-PD, with almost one-third receiving a low-income subsidy. Another 1.6 million received drug assistance through a Part D-subsidized retiree health plan. Of the remaining 25% of Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in Part D, about half had coverage through health care plans that was at least as generous as Part D; the other half had no coverage or coverage less generous than Part D. Overall, about 88% of Medicare beneficiaries had drug coverage through either PDP or MA-PD plans, retiree coverage, or private insurance of comparable scope. Total Part D expenditures were approximately $100.0 billion in calendar year 2017.", "Medicare Part D has cost less than originally forecasted, due in part to lower-than-predicted enrollment and increased use of less expensive generic drugs. However, the Medicare Trustees project that spending on Part D benefits will accelerate over the next 10 years due to the expectation of further increases in the number of enrollees, costs associated with the gradual elimination of the out-of-pocket cost coverage gap, changes in the distribution of enrollees among coverage categories, a slowing of the trend toward greater generic drug utilization, and an increase in the use and the prices of specialty drugs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["On January 1, 2018, the Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit (Medicare Part D) began its 13 th year of operation. Congress created Part D in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173 ), effective January 1, 2006. The law also made Part D the primary source of drug coverage for individuals covered under both Medicare and Medicaid (so-called dual eligibles). Since that time, Part D has been modified by a series of statutes, including by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ; P.L. 111-152 ). ", "Part D coverage is provided through private insurance plans (PDPs) that offer only drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (MA-PDs) that offer drug coverage as part of a broader, Medicare Part C managed care benefit. Alternatively, beneficiaries may be enrolled in retiree prescription drug plans offered by their former employers. The MMA provides subsidies for retiree drug plans as an incentive to employers to continue such plans. (See \" Retiree Drug Subsidy .\") A growing number of employers and unions are also offering retirees (and their eligible spouses and dependents) Part D benefits through employer-group waiver plans (EGWPs). See \" Employer Group Waiver Plans .\")", "As of July 2018, 44.2 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D plans. Of that total, about 25.5 million were in PDPs, 18.0 million were in MA-PDs, and about 690,000 were in other types of plans. ", "A major focus of the Part D program is providing subsidized coverage to qualified, low-income beneficiaries. Individuals with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level and limited assets are eligible for a low-income subsidy (LIS). The LIS reduces beneficiaries' out-of-pocket spending by paying for all, or some, of the Part D monthly premium and annual deductible, and limiting co-payments or coinsurance. The LIS is progressive, meaning the lowest-income beneficiaries receive the greatest assistance. An estimated 12.9 million beneficiaries will receive the LIS in 2018.", "The ACA made major changes to Part D in an effort to improve coverage and to make the premium structure more progressive, including requiring higher-income beneficiaries to pay more for coverage. Starting in 2011, the ACA required Part D enrollees with incomes above a certain threshold to pay a monthly surcharge in addition to their regular plan premiums. (See \" Premium Surcharge for Higher-Income Enrollees .\") In addition, the ACA phases out the \"doughnut hole\" by requiring drug manufacturers to provide discount for brand-name drugs purchased by beneficiaries in the Part D coverage gap, or \"doughnut hole\" and gradually phases in Medicare subsidies to cover 75% of the cost of generic drugs and 25% of the cost of brand name drugs in the coverage gap. (See \" The Coverage Gap .\") The ACA provisions were further modified by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA; P.L. 114-10 ) and the Balanced Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ), which, among other things, accelerated the closing of the coverage gap.", "Medicare Part D relies on participating private insurance plans to provide coverage and bear part of the financial risk of the program. All Part D plans must meet certain minimum requirements, though there are significant variations among plans in terms of benefit design including differences in premiums, drug formularies (i.e., lists of covered drugs), and cost sharing for particular drugs. In 2018, a total of 782 PDPs are offered nationwide, an increase of 36 (or 5%) from 2017 but a 12% reduction from 2016.

The end date is, at a minimum, through the end of the calendar year within which the individual becomes eligible. Beneficiaries who are deemed LIS-eligible for any month during the period of July through December of one year are deemed eligible through the end of the following calendar year. CMS changes an individual's deemed status in mid-year only when such a change qualifies the beneficiary for a reduced co-payment obligation.", "Eligibility for the LIS is not always continuous from year to year. For example, LIS beneficiaries who lose eligibility for Medicaid or SSI during the year are not automatically qualified to receive the LIS the next year. Each September, CMS is to notify such individuals that their LIS-deemed status will end on December 31 of that year. Such individuals may reapply for the LIS, as they may qualify for the LIS through the application process. (See \" LIS Enrollment .\") ", "At the end of each plan year, CMS reassigns LIS beneficiaries who are enrolled in Part D plans if their plan is terminated or raises its monthly premium to a level above the LIS benchmark premium for the plan region. The ACA altered the method for determining which Part D plans are eligible to enroll low-income beneficiaries so that more plans can qualify and, thus, reduce the number of low-income beneficiaries who are reassigned from year to year.

An individual who applies, and is deemed eligible for the LIS, is allowed to begin receiving benefits on the first day of the month in which the application was submitted. In most cases, this means that LIS status is applied retroactively. For example, if an LIS beneficiary was enrolled in a Part D plan prior to a determination of LIS eligibility, the Part D sponsor must ensure that the beneficiary is reimbursed for any premiums or cost sharing that should have been covered by the subsidy. If a person was not already eligible for Medicare, the LIS subsidy takes effect on the first day of the month when his or her Medicare eligibility begins.", "Initial LIS eligibility determinations are for no longer than 12 months.

According to the SSA, less than 5% of Medicare enrollees have been subject to the IRMMA.", "The higher-income surcharge is calculated as the difference between the Medicare Part D base beneficiary premium (which represents 25.5% of the average national bid amount) and 35%, 50%, 65%, or 80% of the national average cost for providing Part D benefits, excluding federal reinsurance or subsidies. The surcharge is based on beneficiary income, with higher-income beneficiaries facing a larger surcharge. Because individual plan premiums vary, the law specifies that CMS calculate the Part D surcharge using the base premium, rather than each beneficiary's individual premium amount. (See Table 4 .) ", "The ACA originally froze the income thresholds for the IRMMA through 2019. Section 402 of the MACRA maintained the freeze on the income thresholds for all income categories through 2017 and on the lower two high-income premiums tiers through 2019. Beginning in 2018, MACRA reduces the threshold levels for the two highest income tiers so that more beneficiaries will fall into the higher-percentage categories. Additionally, starting in 2020, the income thresholds for all income categories will be adjusted annually for inflation based on the 2019 income thresholds. This will, in effect, maintain the proportion of beneficiaries who pay the high-income premium. ", "Section 53114 of BBA 2018 adds an additional high-income category beginning in 2019 for individuals with annual income of $500,000 or more or couples filing jointly with income of $750,000 or more. Enrollees with income equal to or exceeding these thresholds will pay premiums that cover 85% of the average per capita cost of the Part D benefits instead of 80%. The threshold for couples filing jointly in this new income tier will be calculated as 150% of the individual income level rather than 200% as in the other income tiers. This new top income threshold will be frozen through 2027 and will be adjusted annually for inflation starting in 2028 based on the CPI-U.", "The surcharge is calculated using a statutory formula that multiplies the base Part D premium by a set ratio. For 2018, the ratios are (35% \u2212 25.5%)/25.5%; (50% \u2212 25.5%)/25.5%; (65% \u2212 25.5%)/25.5%, or (80% \u2212 25.5%)/25.5%. For example, for 2018 (with a base premium of $35.02) the surcharge for an individual with a 2016 adjusted gross income between $133,500 and $160,000 would be calculated as ", "IRMMA = $35.02 x ((65% \u2212 25.5%)/25.5%) ", "IRMMA = $35.02 x 1.549 ", "IRMMA = $54.24, rounded down to the nearest dime = $54.20.", "Beneficiaries pay the surcharge directly to the federal government, rather than to Part D plans.

Plans have flexibility in structuring the tiers. Different plans may place the same drug on different tiers, and drugs in parallel tiers may not have the same cost-sharing requirements. To illustrate, a five-tiered formulary may be structured so that Tier 1 includes preferred generics, Tier 2 includes nonpreferred generics, Tier 3 contains preferred brand-name drugs, Tier 4 includes higher-cost, nonpreferred brand names, and Tier 5 (the \"specialty tier\") has very expensive or rare drugs.
