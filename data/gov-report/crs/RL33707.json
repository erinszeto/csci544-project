Title XVI's implementation by DOI's Bureau of Reclamation has been contentious; many Members of Congress, particularly from water-scarce western states, support both the program and specific projects, but are frustrated by growing backlogs of projects seeking authorization or awaiting appropriations.", "The Bush Administration has generally opposed authorizing additional projects, citing the backlogs and noting that the projects proposed for authorization generally do not meet Reclamation's requirements for a feasibility study. At the same time, the Administration's requests for appropriations for Title XVI have been relatively consistent for several years, with the FY2007 request at $10.1 million, albeit nearly half of what Congress has appropriated in recent years. The resulting inertia in implementation has raised congressional interest in possible changes to the program. Options discussed range from clarifying the program's criteria (e.g., focus on areas of most need), to changing the way projects are evaluated (e.g., replacing the requirement for a Reclamation feasibility study with an evaluation of technical and financial viability), to expanding and prioritizing Title XVI appropriations.", "Views on how to proceed vary based on perspectives of the proper role of the federal government in water supply, the appropriate priority for the program in the current fiscal environment, the history and mission of the program, and the urgency and need for investment and promotion of water reuse technologies. Title XVI's genesis includes helping Southern California reduce its reliance on Colorado River water. As authorizations for projects in other areas and with other purposes were added, the justification for federal involvement in these projects, which expand municipal water supply, and the long-term goals and planning for the program came under increasing scrutiny, particularly by the Administration. At the same time, the program was increasingly pursued by project sponsors as a route for federal assistance, which was then leveraged for additional support and financing. Several project sponsors have directly pursued congressional authorization outside the Title XVI feasibility study process. It is not clear if this is due to the Administration's resistance to pursue Title XVI projects, or due to a combination of other factors.", "In the face of decreasing support from the Administration and mounting dissatisfaction of project sponsors, the 109th Congress has engaged in oversight of the program and authorized only a limited set of additional Title XVI projects. The issue for Congress is whether and how to change the program. The challenge for Congress is that stakeholders' perspectives on how to improve the program are fundamentally different. Project sponsors generally prefer a more streamlined project development process and expanded program appropriations, while the Administration supports a smaller, more focused program with long-term objectives tied to federal interests. This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Growing populations and changing values have increased demands on water supplies and river systems, resulting in water use and management conflicts throughout the country. These demands are particularly evident in the West, where population is rapidly increasing and where climate variability and water scarcity make managing water supplies especially challenging. In many western states, agricultural and urban needs conflict, and these demands also compete with water demand for threatened and endangered species, recreation, and scenic enjoyment.", "Debate over western water resources revolves around the issue of how best to plan for and manage the use of this renewable, yet limited resource. Some observers advocate enhancing water supplies, through such steps as building new storage or diversion projects, expanding old ones, and funding water reclamation and reuse facilities. Others emphasize conservation and policies that provide opportunities for more efficient use of existing supplies, such as using market mechanisms or providing better price signals, which theoretically would result in more efficient water use. In practice, all of these tools are used by western water managers to varying degrees, and all have been addressed by Congress, again to varying degrees.", "To address growing challenges in western water management, Congress in 1992 directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish a federal water reclamation, recycling, and reuse program (Title XVI of P.L. 102-575 , the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Studies and Facilities Act; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7390h). The act directed the Secretary to \"investigate and identify\" opportunities for water reclamation and reuse in the West, for design and construction of \"demonstration and permanent facilities to reclaim and reuse wastewater, and to conduct research, including desalting, for the reclamation of wastewater and naturally impaired ground and surface waters\" (43 U.S.C. \u00a7390h(a)).", "The Title XVI program appears to be at a crossroad. As reuse and desalination have become more viable options for addressing a variety of water management issues, legislative proposals for authorizing Title XVI projects have increased. At the same time, Administration support for the program has changed from full support prior to enactment in 1992, to the Administration's current position of generally not supporting projects proposed for authorization by project sponsors (primarily municipal water agencies) that have not gone through Reclamation's feasibility process. For example, the Administration, when asked, has testified against every Title XVI bill in the 108 th Congress and most of the pending bills in the 109 th Congress, citing mostly budgetary and project feasibility concerns. Further, the Administration continues to request funding only for projects that have received funding in prior years. Also during this time, congressional authorization of new projects has been significantly less than demand. Since 1996, six projects have been authorized. Of approximately 13 project authorization bills introduced during the 108 th Congress, two were enacted; as of August 2006, the 109 th Congress has enacted one bill and has 16 individual project authorizations in pending legislation.", "This situation has created frustration and confusion over the existing program, its future, and to some degree, the future role of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in the rapidly growing West. Frustration is especially apparent among project sponsors whose authorized projects remain without Title XVI funding or with limited funding, and sponsors of pending project proposals, resulting in increased pressure on Congress and the Administration to address program issues. In sum, the resulting backlog of sparsely funded and unfunded projects, and pent-up demand for federal assistance, have raised the question of the future of the Title XVI program.", "Following is a Title XVI overview covering its genesis, implementation, and current status.

The original statute directed the Secretary to undertake appraisal investigations to identify opportunities for water reclamation and reuse, and provided authority to participate with other federal agencies, as well as state, regional, and local authorities in developing feasibility studies.", "The genesis for Reclamation's wastewater reclamation and reuse program was a six-year western drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In particular, the drought strongly affected California and the Southwest. It led to an intense debate in Congress over federal water supply policies, including how to address conflicts between the need and desire for continued operation of the federal Central Valley Project and the application of state and federal environmental laws that could potentially limit water deliveries in order to protect certain aquatic species or comply with water quality standards. The result of several years' effort in addressing this conflict was the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-575 ). While much attention has been given to Title XXXIV of that act (the Central Valley Project Improvement Act), Title XVI authorized construction of five specific reclamation water reuse and recycling projects in Arizona and California and established the reuse program. Title XVI of the act also authorized a comprehensive reuse study for Southern California, including Colorado River hydrologic regions. The latter language provides specific statutory authority for activities that were underway in 1991 in response to then-Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan's announcement of a \"Comprehensive Water Reuse Initiative\" for Southern California which spoke to the federal interest in management of the Colorado River.", "In addition to increasing the water supplies available to the area [southern California], this program would also decrease the area's dependency on water imports from the Colorado River, California, and Los Angeles Aqueducts, help restore and protect the quality of existing ground-water reserves, and help meet environmental water needs. Lujan said ... \"Reclaimed water\u2014one of the most dependable, abundant and underutilized water supplies available\u2014could provide as much as 2 million acre-feet of water each year for the area.\"", "The Southern California study and other reuse studies initiated under the Title XVI authority, however, became caught in an apparent policy shift to decrease Administration support for the Title XVI program, a shift that grew out of the preparation of the FY2004 Reclamation budget. That FY2004 budget included an evaluation of the Title XVI's effectiveness by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB PART review process, discussed below). The policy shift resulted in an uncertain future for the studies underway, thus frustrating project sponsors.

Second, the PART review raises questions regarding the appropriate federal role in water supply development for municipal and industrial (M&I) uses. For example, is Congress redefining the federal government's role in M&I water supply and treatment as it authorizes new site-specific projects? To what degree should the federal government provide incentives for water supply development via new technologies, and what geographic, regional, or social factors should be considered? Third, is coordination or realignment of certain federal water activities needed to ensure efficient use of scarce federal resources?", "In general, Title XVI policy issues fall into two categories: (1) broad policy issues and (2) issues specific to the program's implementation and structure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Broad Policy Issues", "paragraphs": ["A broad policy issue central to discussions of the future of Title XVI is the debate over the appropriate federal role in water supply development, particularly for M&I purposes.

At issue for Congress is the basic question of whether supporting Title XVI's municipal water development projects is an appropriate federal role.", "Historically, federal water resource agencies' involvement in water supply was limited to developing irrigation projects and multiple use projects. Unlike other areas of water resources management in which the federal role is more prominent (e.g., irrigation water supply, flood damage reduction, and navigation; or supporting wastewater and drinking water treatment investments through revolving loan programs), the federal role in water supply development for M&I uses largely has been secondary to the primary role of state and local governments. Water supply development for M&I purposes generally has been incidental to the primary project purposes of large, multi-purpose irrigation, flood reduction, hydro power, and navigation projects, pursuant to congressional policy established in the Water Supply Act of 1958.", "While as a general matter, local, regional, or state agencies have been responsible for water supply development, and wary of federal involvement in allocating water, Congress occasionally has deviated from this policy. For example, over the last two decades, Congress has increasingly, and incrementally, authorized the DOI to participate in construction of approximately 13 water supply projects for small and rural communities, as well as water reclamation and reuse projects under Title XVI. Although Congress has increasingly passed bills for site specific projects and established the Title XVI program, it has not re-articulated long-standing congressional policy regarding the federal role in M&I water supply development since the 1958 Water Supply Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Issues", "paragraphs": ["On the implementation front, what is at issue for Congress is whether the Title XVI program's current implementation inhibits the achievement of congressional interest in water reuse projects.

Other federal water assistance programs, such as state revolving loan funds for wastewater and drinking water administered by EPA, and rural water and wastewater disposal programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), have criteria, regulations, and competitive processes for projects and funding. Congress appropriates money annually for these programs; however, project funding is not appropriated by line item, as is the case for Reclamation projects.

However, the act does not include clear evaluation or decision-making criteria, such as listing criteria that feasible projects must meet for a project to be recommended for construction authorization. Nor does the current authority include project ranking or eligibility criteria.", "To implement the program, Reclamation developed guidelines for the development of Title XVI projects. These guidelines provide more explicit evaluation and feasibility criteria than is provided in the statute; however, again, they are phrased as things that must be \"considered\" and as such do not function as eligibility or decision-making criteria. While OMB in the past has noted Reclamation's Title XVI guidelines provide \"solid criteria ... to evaluate potential projects prior to funding, and also to monitor and evaluate projects under construction,\" the guidelines provide little guidance on project ranking.

Authorized projects are then funded (or not) via the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. However, in practice, many project authorizations and pending legislative proposals are for projects that have not gone through the project evaluation process outlined in Title XVI. The reasons for this are varied. First, it appears that Reclamation itself has initiated few Title XVI appraisal or feasibility studies in recent years. Second, some sponsors have engaged Reclamation in a feasibility study, but have found agency support lacking in recent years. Third, some contend feasibility studies are better suited to traditional, large, multi-purpose projects that Reclamation used to construct and that the process is ill-suited for smaller, primarily locally financed water reclamation and reuse projects. In other words, some view the feasibility process as too cumbersome and costly for the amount of federal assistance being sought.", "It is not clear whether it is the feasibility (evaluation) process itself, funding levels, a change in Administration policy toward implementing the Title XVI program, or other reasons that have contributed to a lag in feasibility study recommendations.

One option currently being pursued focuses on evaluation issues. Two recently introduced bills, H.R. 5768 and S. 3639 , would replace the existing appraisal and feasibility evaluation process with a more limited technical and financial viability and review process. The bills also address implementation issues such as the purpose of the program (to authorize both permanent and demonstration projects in western states and Hawaii), and clarify that desalination and recycling are permitted Title XVI activities. The Administration testified that the proposed legislation would improve the program and make it easier for Reclamation to administer; however, the Administration supported adjustments to the legislation to \"ensure that project assessment and authorization is prioritized to focus on areas of greatest need,\" and to ensure projects are worthy of federal investment. The Administration stated it could not support S. 3639 in its current form.", "Another option would be to focus on program and project eligibility and ranking criteria. This direction is supported in the Administration's testimony on S. 3639 . The Administration specifically called for developing ranking criteria that would help Reclamation, Congress and the Administration prioritize projects. According to Reclamation, \"such ranking criteria would address whether the project actually alleviates significant water conflict or shortage and whether it would add water supply in one of the likely crisis areas that we have focused on in efforts like the Water 2025 program.\" Under this option, other stakeholder priorities might also be addressed. These priorities range from assisting communities with drought resilience to focusing on projects with innovative and new technologies. While S. 3639 includes several factors that must be considered during review of project proposals, including how the project might serve an identified federal interest, these factors are not presented as decision-making or ranking criteria.", "Another approach would be to evaluate programs using a funding focus. Funding issues could be addressed via economic or financial prioritization during the evaluation process, through new program eligibility and ranking criteria, or both. For example, in order to justify federal investment in local projects, many federal capital investment programs include requirements for some type of economic analysis of project alternatives. Federal water resource projects are generally evaluated using \"Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water Resource Projects\" (P&Gs). The focus of the P&Gs is on National Economic Development (NED) benefits, although analysis of regional economic development (RED) is also included. Although using the P&Gs is typically a necessary component of Reclamation's feasibility study process, Reclamation guidelines explicitly state that the P&Gs are not used for Title XVI projects because of the project's local (not national) scope. Instead, the guidelines require an assessment of a project's \"economic feasibility\" relative to other alternatives the local sponsor could pursue.", "Many other federal agencies also require economic analyses of projects via alternatives analysis. For example, the Federal Transit Administration's \"New Starts\" program requires evaluation of cost-effectiveness (via an alternatives analysis) as part of its overall financial and project justification evaluation process (\u00a73011(a) of SAFETEA-LU; 49 U.S.C. \u00a75309(d)). Also, although project-level decisions under the EPA's Clean Water Act state revolving fund program are made by the states, the Clean Water Act directs the EPA Administrator to publish guidelines for evaluation methods, including cost-effectiveness (\u00a7212(2)(C) of P.L. 92-500, 33 U.S.C. \u00a71292(2)(C)), such as the \"identification and selection of cost effective alternatives to comply with the objective and goals\" of the act (\u00a7217).

Other legislative options include dismantling or phasing out the Title XVI program, strengthening the program, or other less drastic adjustments, such as providing Reclamation with clearer direction on the purpose for it to carry out these activities. Options that could be pursued administratively include strengthening agency guidelines, and developing formal rules or regulations with specific program and project eligibility, funding, and ranking criteria.

Of the 12 projects, CRS completed interviews with seven project managers and found that three projects have started construction. One of these is complete, and another is expected to be completed in 2006. The third involves two sub-projects, one of which is 10% complete. Three other projects have not yet started construction, but appear to be moving forward. These projects are in various stages of planning, pre-feasibility, and permitting/environmental analysis. The seventh project, for the City of Tracy (San Joaquin Area Water Reclamation and Reuse Project, CA), is no longer being pursued. Most project sponsors appear to be seeking alternative funding; some have been more successful than others. Most project managers expressed desire for engagement with Reclamation and, not surprisingly, felt that their projects would be farther along with federal funding. Some had begun working with Reclamation in the early stages of the project (e.g., during the pre-feasibility/planning stage), but have not received assistance in recent years.
