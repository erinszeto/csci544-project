Using that delegated authority, agencies issue regulations to implement those statutes and set the details of public policy. ", "To structure the ways in which agencies issue regulations pursuant to their delegated authority, Congress has created a statutory scheme of procedural controls. The most significant of these controls is the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946, which generally requires agencies to issue a proposed rule and take public comment prior to issuing a final rule. Congress designed these basic steps\u00e2\u0080\u0094which create the backbone of the federal rulemaking process\u00e2\u0080\u0094to allow for public input into federal agencies' policymaking decisions. As one scholar noted, \"One of the APA's objectives was to open rulemaking to public participation, especially by those whose interests might be adversely affected by an agency's actions. Congress viewed hearing from such parties as a normal part of the legislative process, and therefore applicable to rulemaking.\" ", "The APA's notice and comment requirements are possibly the best known and most significant mechanism allowing for public input into the rulemaking process.

Though it was centuries old by the time of the American Revolution, the Magna Carta was a heavy influence on the colonists who declared their independence from Britain in the 1770s. The Declaration of Independence, which relied on many of the stated rights and liberties granted under the Magna Carta, referenced the failure of the British government to respond to petitions by stating the following immediately after its list of grievances: \"In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.\" Thus, the implication was that the colonists had an inherent right to petition the king, as well as a right to a response. ", "Likely as a direct consequence of this perceived slight by the British government, the founders explicitly stated in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that the people had a right to petition the government. Specifically, the First Amendment states that \"Congress shall make no law \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 abridging \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the right of the people \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" Although the First Amendment establishes a right to petition the government, it goes no further in detailing whether or how the government shall respond. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Administrative Procedure Act", "paragraphs": ["The lineage of this constitutional provision can be traced forward into the 20 th century and directly to the APA itself. The APA's petition mechanism, which allows interested persons to petition the government to take a rulemaking action, could easily be considered a more modern application of the constitutional right to petition. One scholar described the APA as \"the bill of rights for the new regulatory state\" that \"defined the relationship between government and governed.\" The petition mechanism appears to fit within that characterization. Indeed, the APA's legislative history confirms the link: \"Every agency possessing rule-making authority will be required to set up procedures for the receipt, consideration, and disposition of these petitions. The right of petition is written into the Constitution itself. This subsection confirms that right where Congress has delegated legislative powers to administrative agencies.\"", "Congress enacted the APA in 1946 following a large expansion of the federal government's size and authorities during the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration's New Deal. The APA is considered by most observers to be a compromise between two groups in Congress: conservatives who were wary of the rapid growth of the administrative state and liberals who wanted to protect the ability of agencies to exercise their delegated administrative power. This balance was reflected in the foreword to the compiled legislative history of the APA, in which Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat McCarran stated that although the APA \"is brief, it is a comprehensive charger of private liberty and a solemn undertaking of official fairness. It is intended as a guide to him who seeks fair play and equal rights under law, as well as to those invested with executive authority. It upholds law and yet lightens the burden of those in whom the law may impinge.\" ", "The petition mechanism, like other elements of the APA, can be contextualized by considering this balancing act between these two main perspectives on the administrative process reforms of the 1930s and 1940s. Many conservatives in Congress who believed that the rapid expansion of the government in the New Deal had the potential to threaten individual rights saw a petition mechanism as a way to provide individuals a means through which they could address grievances directly to government agencies. Some liberals in Congress who were generally more trusting of regulatory agencies and wanted to protect recently enacted New Deal programs were willing to agree to a petition mechanism, but they were cautious about how much would be required of agencies to respond. The petition provision that was ultimately included in the final version of the APA can be seen as a compromise between these two sides and is discussed in detail below.

EPA took comments on the petition and published notice in 2003 that it was denying the petition. After a judicial challenge to the denial of the petition, in 2007, the Supreme Court held that EPA's reasons for denial of the petition were invalid and that EPA did have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.
