The scope of the NCP encompasses discharges of oil into or upon U.S. waters and adjoining shorelines and releases of hazardous substances into the environment. The NCP was developed in 1968 and has been revised on multiple occasions to implement the federal statutory response authorities that Congress has expanded over time. Three federal environmental statutes authorized the development of the NCP: the Clean Water Act, as amended; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended; and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.", "Several executive orders have delegated the presidential response authorities of these statutes to federal departments and agencies that implement the NCP. The lead federal agency serves as the On-Scene Coordinator to direct the federal response. Generally, EPA leads the federal response within the inland zone, and the U.S. Coast Guard serves as the lead agency within the coastal zone. However, a response to an incident occurring on a federal facility is coordinated by the federal department or agency that administers the facility. The NCP established the National Response System (NRS) as a multi-tiered framework to coordinate 15 federal departments and agencies on the National Response Team in providing specialized resources and expertise and involving state and local officials and other nonfederal entities.", "Although the framework of the NRS is the same for responding to discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, the NCP establishes separate operational elements for responding to each type of incident, and these elements differ in some respects. The source of federal funding to carry out a response also differs. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund finances the federal response to a discharge of oil, and the Superfund Trust Fund finances the federal response to a release of a hazardous substance. Monies spent from these trust funds may be recouped from the responsible parties under the liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act and CERCLA, respectively.", "For multifaceted incidents (major disasters or emergencies), the NCP also could be invoked under the National Response Framework (NRF) to address an aspect of an incident involving a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance. The NRF is a broader administrative mechanism for coordinating the array of federal emergency response plans. However, the NRF itself is not an operational plan that dictates a step-by-step process. The NRF instead merely may apply the NCP as the operational plan to respond to an oil or hazardous substance incident.", "This report discusses the authorities, relevant executive orders, and federal emergency response framework of the NCP, and identifies the funding mechanisms to carry out a federal response."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Thousands of oil and chemical spills of varying size and magnitude occur in the United States each year.

The scope of the NCP specifically encompasses discharges of oil into or upon U.S. waters and adjoining shorelines and releases of hazardous substances into the environment more broadly. Several hundred toxic chemicals and radionuclides are designated as hazardous substances under the NCP, and other pollutants and contaminants also fall within the scope of its response authorities. The NCP is codified in federal regulation and is authorized in multiple federal statutes. Unlike most other federal emergency response plans that are administrative mechanisms, the regulations of the NCP have the force of law and are binding and enforceable.", "After observing the effects of the 1967 Torrey Canyon oil tanker spill off the coast of England, the Johnson Administration developed the initial version of the NCP in 1968. The first NCP was an administrative initiative to coordinate the federal response to potential oil spills in U.S. waters. Congress later enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (often referred to as the Clean Water Act) to provide explicit statutory authority for the federal response to discharges of oil or hazardous substances into or upon U.S. waters within the contiguous zone and the adjoining shorelines. The 1972 amendments also explicitly directed the preparation of the NCP to carry out these authorities.", "The NCP has been revised multiple times since 1968 to implement additional federal statutory authorities that Congress has enacted in the wake of other major incidents. The discovery of severely contaminated sites in the 1970s, such as Love Canal in New York, led to the enactment of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). This statute addresses releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants into the environment, and it directed a federal response plan for these incidents to be included in the NCP. Although Congress initially considered including oil spills within the response authorities of CERCLA, petroleum was excluded from the scope of the statute with the intention of addressing oil spills in separate legislation. ", "The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska led to the enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). This statute clarified and expanded the oil spill response authorities of the Clean Water Act extending to U.S. waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and directed revisions to the NCP to carry out these authorities.", "Over time, the NCP has been applied on a routine basis to respond to many varied incidents across the United States involving discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances. The framework and procedures of the NCP often generate interest among Members of Congress and affected stakeholders in the execution of federal resources to respond to an incident and the participation of state, local, and private entities. Whereas individual incidents may differ in terms of the magnitude, scope, complexity, and associated hazards, effective coordination of the respondents and the adequacy of resources available to carry out a response can be common issues. Larger and more complex spills may garner more prominent attention, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Some raised questions about the authorities and roles of the entities involved in the response to that incident, including federal agencies, state and local governments, and private parties. ", "This report provides background information on the NCP to address potential questions that may arise in congressional oversight of the federal response to particular incidents. The report discusses the federal statutes that authorize the NCP and related executive orders; mechanisms for reporting incidents to the federal government; the framework under which federal, state, and local roles are to be coordinated; funding mechanisms for federal response actions, including liability for response costs and related damages; and circumstances under which the NCP may be integrated within the National Response Framework (NRF) to address multifaceted incidents, such as major disasters or emergencies.

For a discussion of funding authorized under these statutes to carry out response actions and the scope of liability for response costs and related damages, see the section on \" Funding and Liability \" later in this report.", "The 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act added Section 311 to the statute to provide explicit statutory authority for the President to respond to a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance into or upon the navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines, and the waters of the contiguous zone. The original NCP had focused on the federal response to oil spills. Section 311 directed the President to further develop the NCP to govern discharges of both oil and hazardous substances within the above aspects of the natural environment. The statute also required several basic elements to be included in the NCP, including mechanisms to coordinate the federal, state, and local roles in responding to an incident, and specific response procedures.", "The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 established the Superfund program and expanded the authorities of the President to respond to releases of hazardous substances into the environment more broadly than Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. Section 101(8) of CERCLA explicitly defines the term \"environment\" to include \"the navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone, and the ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive management authority of the United States under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act,\" and any other surface water, groundwater, surface soil, sub-surface soil, or ambient air within or under the jurisdiction of the United States. CERCLA also expanded federal response authority to address releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare. Section 105 of CERCLA directed the President to revise the NCP to include a plan for responding to these types of incidents. This plan is codified in Subpart E of the regulations of the NCP.", "The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) amended various response, liability, and enforcement provisions of CERCLA. Among these provisions, SARA amended Section 105 of the statute directing the President to further revise the NCP and expand the criteria used to evaluate contaminated sites for placement on the National Priorities List (NPL). The primary purpose of the NPL is to identify\u2014in conjunction with the states\u2014the most threatening sites that warrant federal involvement in long-term remediation. Sites that may require short-term response actions to address emergency situations do not require listing on the NPL to be eligible for federal involvement under the NCP.", "The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 expanded and clarified the President's authorities under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act specifically to respond to discharges of oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines, the waters of the EEZ, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the United States. As amended by OPA, Section 311(d) of the Clean Water Act directed the President to further revise the NCP to develop specific procedures for implementing these oil spill response authorities.

Prior to proposing any revisions to the NCP for public comment, EPA must consult with the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal departments and agencies that serve as standing members of the National Response Team (discussed below). As generally is the case with any federal regulation, revisions to the NCP also are subject to the federal rulemaking process, including the opportunity for public comment. Both executive orders further specify that any proposed or finalized revisions to the NCP would be subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "Executive Order 12580 established differing lead agency roles in responding to releases of hazardous substances at federal facilities and vessels. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) administer most of the federal facilities from which a release of a hazardous substance has occurred. Executive Order 12580 explicitly delegates the President's response authorities under CERCLA to DOD and DOE at facilities and vessels within their respective jurisdiction, custody, or control. DOD also is responsible for responding to incidents involving the removal of military weapons and munitions that are or were under its jurisdiction, custody, or control. Other federal departments and agencies may lead the federal response under CERCLA at facilities and vessels under their jurisdiction, custody, or control only in nonemergency situations. Within their respective zones, EPA or the U.S. Coast Guard would retain the lead role under CERCLA in emergency situations at these federal facilities and vessels.

Conversely, EPA remains the Chair for a federal response within the inland zone, and the U.S. Coast Guard the Vice-Chair. ", "Due to the nature of their ongoing missions, the NRT departments and agencies employ skilled personnel and maintain specialized equipment that can enhance the effectiveness of the federal response. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains expertise that may be drawn upon to assess threats to public health resulting from an incident. Within HHS, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) specifically is responsible for assessing public health threats from the release of a hazardous substance, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assesses public health threats from discharges of oil. The CDC played a prominent role in assessing threats to public health from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in connection with the Deepwater Horizon incident.", "Federal departments and agencies that administer federal facilities and vessels are standing members of the NRT to carry out the response to hazardous incidents that may occur in connection with their own activities. Under the NCP, these departments and agencies also may be called upon to use these capabilities in support of the response to nonfederal incidents that present similar challenges. For example, the U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage maintains specialized equipment and capabilities to respond to pollution incidents involving U.S. Naval vessels. These capabilities may be drawn upon to respond to a civilian incident in ocean environments. During the Deepwater Horizon incident, for example, the Navy dispatched oil collection equipment to aid in the federal response under the NCP.", "In addition, the Department of Justice also serves as a standing member of the NRT to represent the United States in any litigation that may involve the federal response to a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance under the NCP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Involvement in Regional Response Teams", "paragraphs": ["The NCP provides state, territorial, local, and tribal governments the opportunity to participate in the federal response to an incident through the Regional Response Teams that fall under the NRT ( Figure 1 ).

Each federal department or agency that is a standing member of the NRT designates an official to serve on each Regional Response Team (RRT) to represent the federal government. The governor of each state or territory within a region may designate an official to represent the state or territorial government. The state and territorial officials serving on a RRT may invite local governments to participate. Indian tribes within a region may designate an official to represent the tribal government.", "Because state, territorial, or local officials are likely to be located in closer proximity to incidents that occur within their respective geographic regions, the NCP specifies that they are expected to be the first government representatives on the RRT to arrive at the scene of a discharge or release to take initial response actions. Consequently, state, territorial, or local officials usually are the first responders who may initiate immediate safety measures to protect the public. For example, the NCP indicates that state, territorial, or local officials may be responsible for conducting evacuations of affected populations according to applicable state, territorial, or local procedures.

However, these monies are subject to certain caps on annual withdrawals from the trust fund and total expenditures per incident. Monies from the Superfund Trust Fund are subject to discretionary appropriations before they are made available for response actions.

Section 107 of CERCLA establishes the liability of parties responsible for a release of a hazardous substance, including response costs, natural resource damages, and the costs of federal public health studies performed by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Unlike OPA, CERCLA does not establish a separate category of liability for economic damages, with the exception of certain economic losses that may be compensable through natural resource damages based on the loss of the use of resources.

Situations in which the application of the NCP through the NRF may occur include", "a major disaster or emergency declared under the Stafford Act, when state and local authorities are overwhelmed and federal assistance is requested; an incident to which a federal agency is responding under its own authority and requests support from other federal agencies to respond to aspects of the incident that involve the discharge of oil or release of hazardous materials; or an incident for which the Department of Homeland Secretary determines that it should lead the response because of special circumstances.", "In practice, the federal response to a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance is most often executed under the regulations of the NCP alone, rather than through the coordinating structures of the NRF under ESF #10. The Secretary of Homeland Security's application of the NCP through the NRF appears to be less common and more limited to multifaceted incidents of greater magnitude, scope, and complexity that may necessitate the coordination of multiple federal response plans. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has stated that the NCP still was applied to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as a stand-alone regulatory authority without involvement of other federal response plans under the NRF. Regardless of whether the NCP is applied as a stand-alone regulatory authority or through the NRF, the procedures for responding to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance are the same because the NCP remains the operative plan in either instance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Chronology of the NCP", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception in 1968, the NCP has been revised on multiple occasions to develop procedures for implementing the federal statutory authorities that Congress has expanded over time to respond to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. Major events in the development of the NCP are outlined below.", "September 1968 : Several departments in the Johnson Administration published the National Multi-Agency Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan. This version established a Joint Operations Center, a national reaction team, and regional reaction teams. This first version of the NCP was prepared under an administrative initiative, and some have characterized its legal authority as being \"not as straightforward\" as subsequent versions codified in federal regulation. April 1970 : The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-224) directed the President to publish a National Contingency Plan for the removal of oil. The act included specific details such as task forces at major ports, a national coordination center, and a schedule identifying potential dispersant uses. This act also altered the primary response authority provision, stating that \"the President is authorized to act to remove or arrange for the removal of such oil at any time, unless he determines such removal will be done properly by the owner or operator of the vessel, onshore facility, or offshore facility from which the discharge occurs.\" June 1970 : Pursuant to P.L. 91-224, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published in the Federal Register a National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan. This plan established the National Response Center, National Response Team, Regional Response Team, and the On-Scene Commander roles (later termed On-Scene Coordinator). The plan addressed discharges of oil and \"hazardous polluting substances.\" August 1971 : CEQ made several modifications to the NCP. CEQ changed the name of the plan to the one that still exists today\u2014the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. The revised plan established roles for the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In particular, the plan designated EPA as the chair of the National Response Team. October 1972 : The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500)\u2014often referred to as the Clean Water Act\u2014amended the 1970 statutory authority of the NCP by explicitly requiring it to address hazardous substances as well as oil. August 1973 : Executive Order 11735 delegated presidential authorities pursuant to the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act to various federal agencies, including EPA, the Secretary of the Department in which the U.S. Coast Guard is operating, and the Council on Environmental Quality. August 1973 : CEQ published a revised NCP, pursuant to the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act and lessons learned from the National Response Team. The NCP was codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 1510. February 1975 : CEQ issued a revised version of the NCP, based on comments regarding the 1973 NCP. December 1977 : The Clean Water Act Amendments of 1977 ( P.L. 95-217 ) required revisions to the NCP to address \"imminent threats\" of oil and hazardous substance discharges. March 1980 : CEQ revised the NCP based on the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act and experiences with several, high-profile spills at that time. The 1980 changes involved, among other things, state participation, local contingency plans, and a national pollution equipment inventory. December 1980 : The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA; P.L. 96-510 ) required the President to develop, and incorporate into the NCP, procedures for prioritizing and responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants into the environment. August 1981 : Executive Order 12316, among other provisions, delegated to EPA the authority to amend the NCP. July 1982 : EPA issued a revised NCP pursuant to CERCLA. The existing NCP structure was largely unchanged. EPA added a new subpart in the regulations with authorities and requirements that specifically addressed hazardous substance response activities. November 1985 : EPA revised the NCP regulations to, among other changes, address \"applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements\" (ARARs) during response activities. October 1986 : The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA; P.L. 99-499 ) amended various response, liability, and enforcement provisions of CERCLA and directed the President to revise the NCP to carry out these authorities. Title III of the act (EPCRA) created SERCs and LEPCs. January 1987 : Executive Order 12580 delegated various functions assigned to the President in CERCLA, as amended by SARA. March 199 0 : EPA revised the NCP based on Executive Order 12580 and the amendments to CERCLA in SARA, including changes to hazardous substance reporting and response provisions, federal department and agency roles for federal facilities and vessels, and state and public participation. October 1990 : Catalyzed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaskan waters, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA; P.L. 101-380 ). Among other provisions, OPA provided authority to the President to perform cleanup immediately using federal resources, monitor the response efforts of the spiller, or direct the spiller's cleanup activities. The act also required the President to amend the NCP to establish procedures and standards for responding to worst-case oil spill scenarios. October 1991 : Executive Order 12777 delegated various functions assigned to the President in OPA. September 1994 : EPA revised the NCP based on OPA and its amendments to the Clean Water Act. The modifications to the NCP reflected the revised authorities of the President (delegated to the U.S. Coast Guard or EPA) to direct and/or undertake responses to oil spills. Additions to the NCP also included provisions regarding the National Strike Force Coordination Center, Area Committees, Area Contingency Plans (ACPs), vessel and facility oil spill response planning requirements, and other response elements."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
