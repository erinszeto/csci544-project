The former-INS had not been maintaining the addresses of foreign students, and reviews of the reporting system questioned the accuracy of the data. The National Commission on Terrorism, a bi-partisan commission established by Congress, cited the vulnerability of the foreign student visa in its June 2000 report, which recommended, among other things, that the former-INS automated system to monitor foreign students be enhanced and expanded.

In July 2001, the former-INS announced that the second phase of its foreign student monitoring system, referred to as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), would begin at 12 Boston area institutions.

Although educational institutions stopped their calls to repeal \u00a7641 of IIRIRA after the terrorist attacks and now support a tracking system, many educational institutions across the country expressed frustration about these new reporting requirements. They argued that the SEVIS is burdensome and that DHS is not providing training to staff who must use SEVIS. All continuing foreign students were required to be entered into SEVIS as of August 2003.", "Following the full implementation of SEVIS in 2003, when its administration was taken over by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) at ICE, there has not been much legislative activity on foreign student monitoring. Some believe that SEVIS has been left relatively unaltered during this time because of high-profile incidents that have positively contributed to the SEVIS image with the general public. Notably, the data from SEVIS resulted in the detection of several instances of unaccounted alien students, including some as recent as the summer of 2006. In this high profile incident, 11 Egyptian student visa holders were admitted at U.S. ports of entry, but never reported to classes or to the appropriate SEVIS officials at Montana State University. University officials reported the absence to DHS, which was able to locate and apprehend all of the 11 students. Incidents such as this one are generally accepted as indicators that SEVIS is working as intended.", "Although SEVIS has been one of the less criticized DHS monitoring systems in recent years, ICE believes it is inadequate in its current form for security purposes. Thus, the agency has proposed raising its fees to fund a second-generation system known as SEVIS II to address security vulnerabilities (discussed in the \"Current Issues\" section). Yet, concerns continue with respect to whether increased security is detracting from the United States' ability to attract the number and quality of foreign students that higher education proponents advocate. The fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) have become particularly dependent upon foreign students, and these fields hold a top priority with most research institutions. Furthermore, the U.S. economy has a high demand for the skill-sets produced in these fields of study, and the STEM students can provide a major link between the academic community and the labor market. Consequently, with security measures now implemented, many groups in higher education and the private sector are seeking to develop pathways to immigration for foreign students.

Investigation of student activities and the determination of visa violations are made by ICE agents. ICE generally encourages nonimmigrants who wish to pursue education in the United States to apply for change of status to an F, J, or M nonimmigrant visa. Moreover, if the nonimmigrant wishes to pursue employment resulting from educational attainment, he or she must apply for work authorization, as well as for change of status to a qualifying nonimmigrant visa.", "The reporting requirements of SEVIS transfer to neither non-educational visa holders nor programs without enrolled F, J, or M visa holders. A foreign national enrolled on a non-educational visa is not required to submit documentation in the SEVIS system.

However, it did not create restrictions on other nonimmigrant visas to prevent school attendance by nonimmigrants without one of the three educational visas. Therefore, SEVIS serves as a monitoring system for foreign nationals admitted on educational visas, but it does not monitor foreign students as a whole. As an example, a trucking school may not be SEVP-certified but may still enroll a nonimmigrant on an \"E\" treaty trader or investor visa. Although the school would still have other reporting requirements, they would not be immigration-related; rather, they would represent the aggregate data on legal operations, as well as the distribution of federal and state-provided student funding.

Furthermore, undergraduate foreign students pay full tuition and are therefore an important source of revenues for many universities. This is highly relevant in discussions of STEM students, because foreign students constitute a significant portion of the overall STEM student population.

Only STEM students who accept employment with employers enrolled in E-Verify would be eligible for the 17-month OPT extension. The student must request a recommendation for an extension from his or her designated school official (DSO).

The first change allows all F-1 students to apply for OPT during the 60-day departure preparation period following the completion of their course requirements. Previously, applications had to be submitted prior to completing required course work. The second technical change clarifies when a period of unemployment during authorized OPT violates the F-1 status requirements. The interim final rule specifies that for students on a 12-month OPT, the aggregate maximum allowed period of unemployment is 90 days. For students with a 17-month OPT extension, this maximum period is increased by 30 days (for a maximum aggregate of 120 days over the course of the entire 29-month OPT period). These unemployment periods are permitted with the intention of allowing for job searches and providing breaks when switching employers.", "In addition to the OPT extension, the USCIS rule change also addresses the commonly referred to \"cap-gap\" for H-1B nonimmigrant employment authorization. The cap-gap occurs when the period of admission for an F-1 student with an approved H-1B petition expires before the start date of the H-1B employment, thus creating a gap between the end of the F-1 status and beginning of the H-1B status. Under previous regulations, USCIS could authorize extensions for students caught in a cap-gap, but only when the H-1B cap was likely to be reached by the end of the fiscal year. USCIS was also previously required to announce the extension of status in the Federal Register . The interim final rule of April 8, 2008, removes these limitations, thereby allowing automatic extensions of status and employment authorizations for F-1 students with pending H-1B petitions. The extension of status applies to all F-1 students with pending H-1B petitions during a fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEVIS Fee Increase", "paragraphs": ["On September 26, 2008, ICE published a final rule in the Federal Register that raised program fees and established SEVIS recertification procedures for participating schools by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Previous SEVIS fees were $100 for most applicants. The new rule raised fees for each F or M student to $200, while most J exchange visitors are now charged $180. Exchange visitors such as camp counselors, au pairs, and summer work/travel program participants now pay a fee of $35. Also, ICE raised the fee for submitting a school certification petition for a school seeking to admit F or M students. The new certification fee is set at $1,700. Moreover, each school campus is required to receive a mandatory site review with an accompanying fee of $655. ", "The published rationale for the fee increase is based largely upon financing increased enforcement activities and the development of SEVIS II. SEVIS II would be a person centric, automated system with an person-centric configuration that would incorporate electronic forms. The shift in SEVIS is necessary, ICE claims, because the current configuration is based on tracking documents (including distinct and unassociated documents for the same individual within the system), which leaves the system exposed to security threats. The FY2008 enacted budget for ICE included $56 million for the SEVP. The FY2009 presidential budget request included an SEVP request of $120 million, an increase of $64 million, or roughly 113%. Most of the funding increase would be directed toward equipment, services, and personnel related to the increased enforcement and SEVIS transformation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "J-1 Student Interns", "paragraphs": ["On June 20, 2008, the Department of State published a final rule for the creation of a new subcategory under the College and University Student category for J visa exchange visitors.

Private sector organizations can offer internships to individuals with less training and experience than had been required of ''trainee'' category participants. To be eligible as an intern in a private sector program, foreign nationals must be currently enrolled in and pursuing studies at an academic institution or a recent graduate (i.e., within 12 months) from such institution.
