FEC", "paragraphs": ["Shortly after enactment of the BCRA amendments to FECA in 2002, the FEC promulgated regulations that exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation altogether by excluding such communications from the definition of \"public communication.\" In response, the two primary sponsors of BCRA in the House of Representatives, Representatives Shays and Meehan, filed suit in U.S. district court against the FEC. In seeking to invalidate the regulations, the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that by not regulating Internet activities, the FEC was opening a new avenue for circumvention of federal campaign finance law, contrary to Congress's intent in enacting BCRA. In 2004, in Shays v. FEC, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the BCRA sponsors and generally overturned the FEC's initial regulations governing political communications on the Internet.", "The Shays court held that excluding all Internet communications from the FEC rule defining \"public communication,\" at 11 CFR \u00a7 100.26, was inconsistent with Congress's use of the phrase, \"or any other form of general public political advertising,\" in the BCRA definition of \"public communication.\" Further, the court found that the FEC had failed to provide legislative history that would persuade the court to ignore the plain meaning of the statute. While not all Internet communications fall within the phrase, \"any other form of general public political advertising,\" the court observed that \"some clearly do.\" However, the court left it to the FEC to determine precisely what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" in the context of the Internet. Furthermore, while the court specifically upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication,\" it found that the FEC's 2002 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) failed to provide adequate notice to the public, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), that the FEC might establish such a definition. As the court noted, it could not \"fathom how an interested party 'could have anticipated the final rulemaking from the draft rule.'\"", "The Shays court also found that the FEC rule exempting Internet communications from the definition of \"public communications\" meant that no matter how closely such communications were coordinated with political parties or candidate campaigns, they could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" and hence, subject to FECA regulation. As the court observed, it had long been a tenet of campaign finance law that, in order to prevent circumvention of regulation, FECA treated expenditures made \"in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with or at the suggestion of a candidate\" as a contribution to such candidate. According to the court, the exclusion of Internet communications from coordinated communications contrasted with prior FEC rules and was contrary to Congress's intent in enacting the statute. The court remanded the case to the FEC for further action consistent with its decision."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEC Rulemaking", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In response to the district court's decision in Shays v. FEC , in April 2005, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comment on its proposal to amend the definition of \"public communication\" to conform to the ruling. In its NPRM, the FEC requested comments on proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication.\" In addition, the FEC sought comment on the related definition of \"generic campaign activity,\" on proposed changes to disclaimer regulations, and on proposed exceptions to the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" for certain Internet activities and communications that would qualify as individual volunteer activity or that would qualify for the \"press exemption.\" According to the FEC, the proposed rules were intended to ensure that political committees properly finance and disclose their Internet communications, without impeding individual citizens from using the Internet to speak freely regarding candidates and elections (e.g., blogging).", "The comment period closed and a public hearing was held in June 2005, and in anticipation of congressional action, the FEC delayed consideration of the Internet regulations. However, in the absence of congressional legislation, in March 2006, the FEC voted unanimously to approve the new regulations. In so doing, the commissioners cited the 2004 Shays v.

The Commission was also mindful that there is no record that Internet activities present any significant danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption, nor has the Commission seen evidence that its 2002 definition of \"public communication\" has led to circumvention of the law or fostered corruption or the appearance thereof. Therefore the Commission proposed to treat paid Internet advertising on another person's website as a \"public communication,\" but otherwise sought to exclude all Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication.\"", "The regulations apply only when money is exchanged for Internet-related campaign advertisements. Accordingly, the funds expended for such advertisements are subject to the limitations, source restrictions, and reporting requirements of FECA.", "Key aspects of the FEC regulations include the following:", "Regulation of paid Internet ads as \" public communications \" \u2014The definition of \"public communication\" includes paid Internet ads placed on another individual or entity's website as a form of \"general public political advertising,\" with no dollar threshold required; the advertiser, not the website operator, is considered to be making the public communication. Accordingly, the fees for such ads are subject to FECA contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimer requirements \u2014Disclaimers (statements of attribution) are required on all political committee websites available to the public. As \"public communications,\" paid Internet ads must contain disclaimers if they expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate or solicit contributions. Disclaimers are not required on e-mails from individuals or groups unless they are political committees, in which case disclaimers are required if more than 500 substantially similar, unsolicited e-mails are sent within a 30-day period. Disclosure of fees paid by candidates to bloggers \u2014Payments to bloggers from candidates are required to be disclosed only on candidate disclosure statements; no such disclaimers are required on blog sites. Coordinated communications \u2014Internet advertisements made for the purpose of influencing a federal election, placed on the website of another person or entity for a fee \u2014and coordinated with a candidate or party committee\u2014are considered \"coordinated communications\" and as such, constitute in-kind contributions to the candidate or committee.
