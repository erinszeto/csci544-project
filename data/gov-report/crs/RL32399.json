Although Congress' exclusive role over naturalization and immigration is found in Article 1 of theU.S. Constitution, the formal inspection of aliens entering the United States came later in our history. In 1882, Congress enacted a law providing for an examination of all aliens who arrive in the UnitedStates and in 1891 established the Bureau of Immigration, which later became the Immigration andNaturalization Service (INS). Laws regarding plant quarantine and inspection date back to 1912.", "For many years, the INS and Customs Service inspectors were \"cross designated\" so that theycould perform initial examinations in each other's functional responsibilities. In practice thisdivision of labor reportedly resulted in INS inspectors being the lead at land ports of entry andCustoms Service inspectors being the lead at air and sea ports of entry. The U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA) had always handled the inspection of plants and animals independently.", "Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is charged with overseeing most of theborder inspections functions.

From a legal perspective, theparameters of the border for inspection purposes are generally given a flexible reading by courts andoften vary from the geographical confines mentioned above. \"Border searches\" (3) may occur when entry is madeby land from the neighboring countries of Mexico or Canada, at the place where a ship docks in theUnited States after having been to a foreign port, and at any airport in the country where internationalflights first land. Courts have given the \"border\" a more flexible reading because of the significantdifficulties in detecting the increasingly mobile smuggler.

Border searches may beconducted within the interior of the United States. The border search exception extends to thosesearches conducted at the \"functional equivalent\" of the border. The \"functional equivalent\" of aborder is generally the first practical detention point after a border crossing or the final port ofentry. (4) It is justifiedbecause in essence, it is no different than a search conducted at the border and occurs only becauseof the impossibility of requiring the subject searched to stop at the physical border. A search occursat the border's functional equivalent when: (1) a reasonable certainty exists that the person or thingcrossed the border; (2) a reasonable certainty exists that there was no change in the object of thesearch since it crossed the border; and (3) the search was conducted as soon as practicable after theborder crossing. (5) Placessuch as international airports within the country and ports within the country's territorial waters orstations at the intersection of two or more roads extending from the border exemplify such functionalequivalents.

Customs inspections also involve U.S. export law,in part, by interdicting the export of unreported currency from narcotics trafficking and other illicitactivities; preventing international terrorist groups and rogue nations from obtaining sensitive andcontrolled commodities; and interdicting stolen vehicles and other stolen property. The challengefaced by CBP is to achieve a sufficient level of security while not jeopardizing the efficient flow ofcommercial trade at the border. Given this framework it is important to understand that customsinspections serve two different, yet intertwined purposes: border security; and commercial entry.", "Commercial Import Process. Generally, importedgoods may not legally enter the commerce of the United States until CBP has authorized deliveryof the goods. The commercial import process can be described as a series of steps: entry, inspection,appraisement, and classification and liquidation. For the purposes of this report only the entry andinspection steps will be discussed.", "Importers or their agents are required to file entry documentation with CBP for eachimportation, regardless of whether duty must be paid on the merchandise. To expedite clearance oftheir goods, importers often file entry documents electronically and pay surety bonds before themerchandise arrives at the port of entry. Most importers choose to hire customs brokers to transacttheir customs-related business. Entry documents include proper bills of lading, entry forms,invoices, and evidence of the right to make entry. Importers or their agents must file entrydocumentation within five working days of the arrival of a shipment at the port of entry. Importersmust then file an entry summary and deposit estimated duties within 10 working days of the time thegoods are entered and released by CBP.", "Upon arrival at a port of entry, the goods are considered 'imported' and are examined by CBPinspectors for admissibility before being released from CBP custody. CBP inspectors are requiredto examine a sufficient number of shipments and entries of merchandise to determine whether:", "the merchandise is properly marked to denote country of origin or other specialdesignations required by law;", "the merchandise or shipment contains prohibitedarticles;", "the merchandise or goods in the shipment are properly described on theinvoice;", "an excess or shortage of invoiced merchandise or goods exists;and", "duty is owed on the imported merchandise or goods.", "Following examination, CBP typically releases the goods to the importer, usually under bond tocover potentially unpaid duties, taxes and other charges. The amount of duty owed is determinedby tariff classification and valuation of the goods. In a process known as liquidation, CBP inspectorsmake a final calculation of the importer's liability (duties and charges owed).", "CBP inspectors rely on targeting mechanisms and random inspections to conduct theirinspection operations. CBP uses preclearance, (55) primary inspections, and secondary inspections in order to helpidentify those passengers and cargo considered high-risk from a customs perspective.", "Cargo Targeting and Inspection. Customs-relatedbusiness is increasingly conducted electronically. Entry documents are often filed electronicallythrough the Automated Broker Interface (ABI). ABI is a part of the Automated Commercial System(ACS) used by Customs to track, control, and process all commercial goods imported into the UnitedStates (56) ABI is avoluntary program available to brokers, importers, carriers, port authorities, and independent servicecenters, that allows qualified participants to file import data electronically with CBP. According toCBP, over 96% of all entries are filed through ABI. (57) The carrier or the shipper (airline, vessel operating company,trucking company, etc.) must also file manifest information with the director of the port where thecargo is entering the United States. The importer or broker uses ABI to file the entry documents, andthe carrier or shipper uses the Automated Manifest System (AMS) to file manifest information. There are several variations or components of AMS: Sea or Vessel AMS, Air AMS, and Rail AMS. There is a varying level of automation with each system. The most automated mode is the VesselAMS, the least automated being the truck system, which does not have a separate AMS module inACS. (58) Once themanifest and the entry documents are filed, they are matched up by ACS. (59) ", "A risk assessment system is employed to focus customs inspections on high risk shipments. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) automatically flags the shipments deemed to be the highestrisks. ATS standardizes bill of lading and entry summary data received from ACS and createsintegrated records called \"shipments.\" These shipments are then evaluated and scored by ATS usingweighted rules derived from the targeting methods of experienced personnel. The higher the score,the more attention the shipment requires, and the greater the chance it will be targeted for secondaryinspection. ATS sorts through records stored in a database containing detailed information on everyshipment that has entered the United States in the past 10 years. According to CBP, all nationalsecurity related targeting using ATS is done at CBP's National Targeting Center (NTC). When ahigh risk shipment is flagged by the NTC, this information (flag) is sent out to the field terminals sothat when an inspector at the border pulls up information on the shipment the flag is displayed andthe inspector will target the shipment for further inspection or review.", "Customs inspections are dependent on accurate manifest information arriving in a timelymanner in order to execute the risk assessment and targeting procedures before shipments reach theborder. To give inspectors adequate information and time to perform a risk assessment on cargoshipments, legacy Customs published a rule (known as the 24-hour rule) (60) requiring the submissionof certain manifest information to Customs 24-hours in advance of the vessel cargo being laden atthe foreign port. The Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ), as amended by the Maritime TransportationSecurity Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-295 ), required CBP to develop rules requiring the electronicsubmission of cargo manifest data. These new rules were published in their final version December5, 2003. (61) The newadvanced electronic manifest rules will require the electronic submission of cargo manifest dataaccording to the following time frames:", "Vessel -- 24 hours prior to lading in the foreign port;", "Air -- 'wheels up' or four hours prior to departure for the United States(depending upon where the flight originated);", "Rail -- two hours prior to arrival in the United States;", "Truck -- one hour prior to arrival for shipments entered through PAPS or ABI,and 30 minutes prior to arrival for shipments entered through FAST.", "While the enforcement of these regulations is currently rolling out in phases, the intent is that everyadvance manifest will be run through the ATS at the NTC before each shipment reaches a U.S. portof entry.", "Modal Differences. While the commercial importprocess is relatively uniform in terms of documentary requirements, differences in the level ofautomation in the AMS system lead to differences across the modes of transportation dependingupon whether the shipment is arriving by truck, railcar or by vessel. As mentioned above, the air,sea, and rail AMS modules are well automated, and thus targeting and commercial processing hasbeen conducted electronically through the process outlined above.", "Truck cargo entry is the least automated of all the modes and many truck drivers must presentCBP inspectors at the border with paper entry documents as they arrive at the inspection booths. TheCBP inspector reviews these documents, questions the driver, and decides whether or not to directthe truck to secondary inspection. The CBP inspector will collect any owed duties and release thecargo into the United States if he is satisfied with the documentation.", "ABI is functional at the land border for truck entry, and thus importers or customs brokerscan electronically pre-file entry documentation for truck shipments. Because there is no truck AMSmodule, however, most truck carriers do not file manifest information electronically. Automatedline release programs do exist at the northern and southern borders. For example, the Border ReleaseAdvanced Selectivity System (BRASS) allows drivers to present a pre-assigned bar code, along withthe invoice and manifest. The CBP inspector scans the bar code, verifies that the informationmatches the invoice data, enters the quantity and releases the cargo. The release data is thensubmitted to ACS which establishes an entry and the entry summary requirements, and notifies theABI participant of the release.", "As part of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT, which is discussedlater in this report) and Canada's Partners in Protection programs, the United States and Canadalaunched a bilateral initiative known as Free and Secure Trade (FAST) to establish complimentaryimport/export processes. Under FAST, both countries are working to harmonize their inspection andcommercial operations at the border. Expanding upon earlier initiatives that allow for the electronicsubmission of entry documents and, thus, result in expedited cargo releases, the FAST programallows major importers and their carriers to use dedicated inspection lanes. The electronic cargorelease system currently employed as part of FAST is the National Customs Automated Prototype(NCAP). As a module of the ACS, the Pre Arrival Processing System (PAPS) has been developedto replace NCAP and was brought online in FY2003. PAPS interacts with the Border CargoSelectivity program and the ATS to randomly select cargoes for examination to check forcompliance.", "The security of cargo containers loaded onto U.S.-bound vessels has been of significantconcern. (62) To beginaddressing this concern, the Container Security Initiative (CSI) was initiated by the former U.S.Customs Service in January of 2002 to \"prevent global containerized cargo from being exploited byterrorists.\" CSI is one of a series of initiatives aimed at securing the supply chain. The rationalebehind CSI is that finding a nuclear weapon or a radiological \"dirty bomb\" at a U.S. port could betoo late. CSI is based around four core elements: developing criteria to identify high-risk containers; pre-screening high-risk containers at the earliest possible point in the supply chain; using technologyto pre-screen high risk containers quickly; and developing and using smart and secure containers. Under the CSI program, CBP officers are sent to participating ports where they collaborate with hostcountry customs officers to identify and pre-screen high-risk containers using non-intrusiveinspection technology before the containers are laden on U.S. bound ships. CBP has initiallytargeted CSI on the top 20 high-volume ports that account for nearly 70% of all containers shippedto U.S. seaports. As of September 2003, governments representing 19 of these 20 ports had signedagreements to implement CSI; and CSI had actually been implemented in 16. (63) ", "Physical Inspection of Cargo. Cargo shipments maybe targeted or randomly selected for a secondary inspection for both security and trade compliancepurposes. This secondary inspection could involve: a more detailed document check; passing thecontainer through a radiation portal monitor; taking an x-ray or gamma ray image of the contents ofthe container; and/or the physical unloading and examination of the cargo itself. (64) ", "CBP has deployed a number of non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies at ports of entryto assist customs inspectors with the inspection of cargos. Large scale NII technologies include anumber of x-ray and gamma ray systems. The Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems (VACIS),which uses gamma rays to produce an image of the contents of a container for review by the CBPinspector, can be deployed in a mobile or stationary capacity depending upon the needs of the port. CBP has also deployed a rail VACIS system to screen railcars. Other large scale NII systems includetruck x-ray systems, which like the VACIS can be deployed in either a stationary or mobileconfiguration; the Mobile Sea Container Examinations Systems; and the Pallet Gamma Ray System. CBP is also continuing to deploy nuclear and radiological detection equipment including personalradiation detectors, radiation portal monitors, and radiation isotope identifiers to ports of entry. According to recent CBP figures, in FY2003, NII technology was used at ports of entry to conductmore than 4.8 million examinations, which resulted in 2,190 seizures totaling more than 1.1 millionpounds of narcotics. (65) ", "Various canine teams are also deployed at ports of entry to assist in the inspection of cargoand passengers. CBP uses canine teams trained to detect several types of contraband includingnarcotics, explosives, chemicals, and currency.", "Passenger Targeting and Inspection. Customspassenger inspection is concerned with collecting duties on imported items brought into the countryalong with preventing the entry of contraband. A typical Customs primary inspection consists of aninterview in which individuals may be asked about their citizenship, their trip, and about any goodsthey may be bringing into the country that they did not have when they departed. Individualsentering the United States via land border crossing are required to make a verbal declaration. Individuals arriving in the United States by air or sea are required to fill out a Customs declarationform. These forms are usually provided by the airline or the cruise ship. The Customs declarationform requires individuals to provide certain personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, place andcountry of residence, passport information) and information about the nature of the trip (countriesvisited, airline or cruise ship information, nature of the trip: business or pleasure). The Customsdeclaration form also requires information concerning goods an individual is bringing into thecountry. Duty may be assessed on the value of goods exceeding personal exemption limits. Theprimary inspection for individuals arriving by air or sea will include a review of the Customsdeclaration as a part of the interview process. Based upon the results of the primary inspection, someindividuals may be referred to secondary inspection.", "Customs inspections are based upon a number of factors (e.g., behavioral analysis,observational techniques, inconsistencies, intelligence information, canine units, x-ray machines, andincidence of a seizure or arrest) to determine which individuals should be targeted for more intensivescrutiny. (66) Thesecondary inspection could involve a more thorough interview and review of identification and traveldocuments, baggage inspections, and under prescribed circumstances personal searches.", "Customs inspection currently relies on the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS)to screen passenger and crewmember lists prior to their arrival in or departure from the U.S, if theyare arriving by air or sea. At the land border, where Customs inspections do not have advancepassenger information, CBP has deployed license plate readers to assist them in targeting vehiclesand their passengers for additional inspection. (67) For example, when a passenger vehicle approaches a land borderport of entry, license plate readers automatically locate, read and communicate vehicle license platedata to the Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS) and the National CrimeInformation Center (NCIC) for possible record matches. (68) The primary inspectors at the port of entry receive instantaneousresponses from TECS. As of September 2003, CBP had installed 201 inbound and 50 outboundlicense plate readers on the southern border; and 104 inbound license plate readers on the northernborder. (69) ", "Smuggling. The primary mission of CBP is toprevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country. However, other components ofCBP's mission include interdicting other prohibited items such as illegal drugs, ammunition,firearms, and counterfeit goods; and monitoring trade compliance. Theoretically, every person orconveyance crossing the border presents an opportunity for smuggling. The statistics in AppendixC illustrate the aggregate size of the so-called \"smuggling window of opportunity.\" Appendix D provides data on Customs narcotics seizures from FY1997-FY2002. In addition, during FY2002Customs officers made 12,570 arrests, and seized 6.4 million rounds of ammunition, nearly 40thousand firearms, 7.5 million tablets of the drug \"ecstasy,\" over $1.3 million worth of merchandise,and more than $60 million in counterfeit goods.", "Differences Between the Northern and SouthernBorder. Operational differences between Customs inspections on the northern andsouthern borders arise due to several factors. One is simply the nature of the cross-border traffic thatpredominates at ports of entry along each border. The ports of entry on the southern border mustdeal with a significantly greater amount of pedestrian and personal vehicle traffic than the northernborder; while the northern border contends with considerably more commercial traffic than does thesouthern border. Appendices E and F in this report illustrate these differences. For example, thetotal number of personally operated vehicles entering the United States crossing the southern andnorthern borders for Calendar Year (CY) 2002 was nearly 122.3 million. Of this total 89.8 million,or 73% entered across the southern border, while 32.5 million or 27% entered across the northernborder. Of the 11.3 million freight truck crossings in CY2002, 6.9 million or 61% entered acrossthe northern border, while 4.4 million, or 39% entered across the southern border. Of the 2.4 millionrail freight crossings, 1.8 million or 75% entered across the northern border.", "Operational differences at the northern and southern borders are also caused by differentlevels of progress that have been made on the bilateral agreements between the United States andCanada and the United States and Mexico. October 2, 2003, a progress report was issued on theUnited States-Canada Smart Border Declaration (signed December 12, 2001). FAST is a jointprogram for low-risk companies that allows for the expedited movement of shipments across thenorthern border in both directions. The United States-Canada Smart Border Declaration alsoincludes other efforts to harmonize commercial processing, conduct clearance operations away fromthe border, develop joint facilities, share customs data, improve container targeting at seaports,address infrastructure improvements, and develop intelligent transportation systems, among others.", "On March 22, 2002 President Bush and President Fox of Mexico met and endorsed theUnited States-Mexico Border Partnership accord that was signed by Santiago Creel, Secretary ofGovernance, and Colin Powell, Secretary of State. The accord was accompanied by a 22-pointaction plan that included several customs-related items similar to those contained in the UnitedStates-Canada Smart Border Declaration. On April 23, 2003, the Department of Homeland Securityissued a joint statement on progress achieved on the United States-Mexico Border Partnership. (70) Three working groupshave been created to develop and implement initiatives identified in the 22-point plan: the BorderWorking Group, the Enforcement Working Group, and the Technology and Customs ProceduresWorking Group.

Inspections cover passengers arriving by vehicle, airplane, and ship, cargo andinternational mail, and commercial aircraft, vessels, trucks, and railcars. Inspection methods includehuman sensory examination, X-ray, and detector dog inspection, along with examination ofdocuments accompanying incoming cargo to assure compliance with health and trade agreements.

DHS personnel inspect international arrivals of passengers and their baggage, importedcargo and international package mail, and international conveyances. While combining agriculturalinspections with other border security activities can increase the number of inspectors who canmonitor the border for prohibited agricultural products, it requires diligence to maintain adequateagricultural inspections in light of more general customs and immigration concerns.", "Inspection Procedures. As with other inspectionfunctions by former Customs and INS personnel, animal and plant health inspectors use a \"smartborder\" or risk assessment approach to identify which people or containers to inspect. Intelligencebased on documents and advance notice frequently can add security away from the United States andmake the actual border more fluid for legitimate trade and immigration.", "Passenger Inspection. The passenger inspectionprogram utilizes a uniform inspection process at land, sea, and air ports of entry. Passenger baggageis inspected on a random basis, and also from information that passengers provide on declarationforms. Inspectors also speak with travelers at primary inspection stations to ascertain where theyhave come from and what agricultural and food products they may be carrying. Based on the pointof departure, inspectors judge whether passengers are more likely to be carrying, for example,prohibited fruit, spices, cheese, or meat. All agricultural products are subject to inspection and areconfiscated if they are found to be infested or are prohibited entry due to known pest and diseaserisks.", "To focus attention on the highest risk passengers, agricultural inspections are coordinatedwith other inspection functions, either physically or through intelligence sharing. Before DHS wascreated, APHIS cooperated with other inspectors through the Border Passenger Processing Initiative. The majority of passengers cleared through the system without delay. APHIS, Customs, INS, andthe State Department examined passenger lists and checked them against past violators and otherdata to determine the most effective targets for inspection. Inspector dog teams (commonly knownas the \"beagle brigade\") roam the baggage arrival areas and can effectively determine the presenceof agricultural products without opening individual bags. APHIS also uses x-ray technology toquickly screen certain targeted baggage.", "Pre-clearance of passengers is sometimes more feasible than inspection at ports of entry. Passenger pre-clearance responsibilities were not transferred to DHS. Passengers departing Hawaiiand Puerto Rico for the mainland pass through an APHIS pre-departure inspection. Even though partof the United States with respect to immigration and customs, these offshore locations could presentagricultural threats to the mainland. APHIS also operates passenger pre-clearance programs inBermuda, the Bahamas, Aruba, and at four cities in Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, andCalgary). U.S. inspectors pre-clear passengers passing through Canada on their way to the UnitedStates, since Canadian passengers typically would not face the same level of agricultural inspectionat U.S. ports of entry. A pre-clearance program for military passengers expedites the arrival ofsoldiers returning from countries that have pests that could harm domestic agriculture.", "Cargo Inspection. Cargo shipments are targetedfor efficient inspections based on manifest descriptions of the containers. This assessment occursat ports of entry and, more commonly, at departure ports. Notification while in transit, especiallyfor ships, allows inspectors to target certain shipments upon arrival at port. ", "Inspectors board ships, planes, rail cars, and trucks in order to thoroughly inspect shipments. In some cases, products are off-loaded at secure warehouses for a more thorough \"strip-out\"inspection. In addition to inspecting agricultural products, inspectors also examine shipments of autoparts or other products arriving in crates or pallets containing solid wood packing material that couldcontain harmful wood-boring pests. USDA personnel also typically oversee, and sometimes carryout, any necessary fumigation of agricultural cargo at ports of entry.", "In addition to visual, x-ray, and detector dog inspection, APHIS is adapting new technologiesfor finding biological agents in cargo shipments.

Pre-cleared commodities are less likely to require intensive inspections at the port of entry,although they may be subject to random inspection and/or checks to ensure compliance with anyother mitigating steps that were required to take place between the time of the pre-clearanceinspection and arrival at the port of entry. Other commodities, however, require treatment beforethey can be cleared for entry. The most common types of pre-clearance treatments include hot waterimmersion, cold treatment, and fumigation.", "In addition to traditional cargo, food and garbage from international flights and cruises cancarry pests and diseases that could harm U.S. agriculture.

Established by legislation passed two months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,TSA is now located in BTS alongside CBP. TSA officials state that their first priority is to protectair travelers, and to do so they have set into place a system of reinforcing rings of security to mitigatethe risk of future terrorist or criminal acts. These security measures cover air traffic from curbsideto cockpit, supported overall by intelligence and threat analysis.

X-rayor visual examination of baggage contents may occur. For cargo and international mail, aninspection occurs when the shipment is opened or x-rayed.

Also, preclearance of certain cargo shipments removes another subset of importsfrom the same need for inspection at ports of entry.

H.R. 10 as passed, S.2845 as passed, S. 2774/H.R. 5040 and H.R. 5024 wouldrequire the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to develop and implement a plan to expeditethe processing of registered travelers through a single program (current registered traveler programsinclude NEXUS and the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection (SENTRI)). Thebills would further require the Secretary to review and evaluate existing programs that expeditetravel and increase research and development efforts to accelerate the development andimplementation of a single program. The bills would also require the registered travelers programto be integrated into the entry and exit data system and would authorize DHS to improve the securityof passports and other travel documents, including through the strengthening of securityrequirements for documents that may be used to attain passports or other travel documents.", "In addition, H.R. 10 as passed would expand pre-inspection programs in foreigncountries and assistance to air carriers at selected foreign airports in the detection of fraudulentdocuments; would limit the President's ability to waive general statutory requirements for U.S.citizens traveling abroad or attempting to enter the United States to bear a valid U.S. passport, so thatsuch a waiver can only be exercised with respect to U.S. citizens traveling to or from foreigncontiguous territories who are bearing identification documents designated by DHS as (1) reliableproof of U.S. citizenship, and (2) of a type that may not be issued to an unlawfully present alienwithin the United States; and would amend the present waiver authority concerning documentrequirements for arriving nationals from foreign contiguous countries or adjacent islands, so thatsuch waivers may only be granted (in non-emergency situations) through a joint determination bythe Secretary of DHS and Secretary of State on the basis of reciprocity, and then only if the arrivingforeign national is in possession of identification documents deemed secure by the Secretary of DHS.", "The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (P.L.108-458). The compromise version of S. 2845 that ultimately wasenacted into law, included some -- but not all -- of the border inspections provisions in both theHouse and Senate versions of S. 2845 .", "Foremost, P.L. 108-458 requires accelerated deployment of the biometric entry and exitsystem to process or contain certain data on aliens and their physical characteristics. The Act alsoexpands the pre-inspection program that places U.S. immigration inspectors at foreign airports,increasing the number of foreign airports where travelers would be pre-inspected before departureto the United States. Moreover, it requires individuals entering into the United States (including U.S.citizens and visitors from Canada and other Western Hemisphere countries) to bear a passport orother documents sufficient to denote citizenship and identity.", "The Act requires improvements in technology and training to assist consular and immigrationofficers in detecting and combating terrorist travel. It (1) establishes the Human Smuggling andTrafficking Center, which includes an interagency program devoted to countering terrorist travel;(2) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Director of the NationalCounter Terrorism Center, to establish a program to oversee DHS's responsibilities with respect toterrorist travel; and (3) establishes a Visa and Passport Security Program within the Bureau ofDiplomatic Security at the Department of State."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Adequacy of Infrastructure.

(112) Meanwhile, theTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( P.L. 105-178 ) established the Coordinated BorderInfrastructure (CBI) program to \"improve the safe movement of people and goods\" across theborders with Canada and Mexico. Although CBI allows for funding of non-transportation projects,financing projects aimed at customs and immigration enforcement functions at the borders hasproven controversial because many supporters of CBI assert it should be used for transportationprojects. (113) ", "The current infrastructure at most U.S. ports of entry, many warn, is not sufficient toaccommodate the demands of the automated entry and exit data system, US-VISIT. Thoseconcerned about infrastructure point out that in order to record the departure of every alien leavingthe United States through a land port, there need to be sufficient lanes, staff, and resources. According to some observers, additional lanes may be necessary at many land ports of entry toaccommodate the large number of individuals seeking entry into the United States. Some alsoexpress concern that the current infrastructure at air ports of entry may not be sufficient toaccommodate US-VISIT when it is fully operational. Although federal immigration inspectors havea presence at selected airports, the space that is occupied by them is not federally owned. Airportshave limited space and may not have additional resources to fund new construction. Some contendthat this could lead to significant delays as travelers try to make their way through ports of entry.Others maintain that as the technologies used at the border become more sophisticated and efficient,concerns about long lines and delays will abate. Infrastructure limitations, they assert, will beresolved by the time US-VISIT is fully implemented. (114) ", "Inter-Agency and Inter-Department Coordination. Cooperation between CBP and other agencies is critical to the success of CBP's mission. Thisnecessity is highlighted by the recent spate of new regulations that have been promulgated by severalagencies charged with border security related activities. One example concerns advance notificationrequirements. While CBP is completing its rulemaking regarding electronic advanced manifestsubmissions, the FDA has promulgated advance notification regulations pertaining to certain foodimports. (115) TheFDA advance notice rules have different time frames from those being considered by CBP. TheFDA rules require electronically filed and complete notice before the shipment arrives at the firstU.S. port:", "no more than five days, and no less than eight hours for food arriving bywater;", "four hours for food arriving by air or by rail; and", "two hours for food arriving by truck.", "At this time, it is unclear as to how the two sets (FDA and CBP) of advanced notice requirementswill be integrated. The FDA rules indicate that importers or their agents must submit their advancenotice using CBP's ABI or ACS systems. Those food importers without ABI or ACS access will useFDA's Prior Notice (PN) System Interface. According to the FDA rule, the Commissioners of FDAand CBP will publish a plan detailing the integration and partial harmonization of these rules. ", "Another example of the importance of inter-agency cooperation is evidenced in the variousfederal entities that have the responsibilities for aliens who seek asylum in the United States. Dutiesare spread across DHS's Coast Guard (interdiction), Customs and Border Protection (apprehensionsand inspections), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (detention), Citizenship and ImmigrationServices (determination of credible fear) and DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review(asylum and removal hearings). While the lead agencies for setting asylum standards and policy areUSCIS and EOIR, CBP inspectors are quite often the first point of contact with arriving asylumseekers.", "Training of Personnel. As is evident from thediscussions of the agricultural, customs, and immigration inspections, the CBP inspector must learna set of complex laws and procedures as well as develop a keen eye for violators and violations ofthe law.", "Some argue that it is too much to expect that those working in primary inspections areknowledgeable of the various types of travel documents, (116) as well as when a foreign national is required to have a traveldocument. (117) Someexpress concern that the ability to recognize these documents and differentiate fraudulent documentsfrom legitimate ones is learned only from experience and training. The customs inspector is attunedto targeting travelers and goods from a cargo perspective, a skill some argue, that is quite distinctfrom an immigration inspection. That the inspector must also be facile in accessing numerous datasystems and databases has raised further questions about the adequacy of training. (118) ", "Specific concerns are being raised that primary inspectors in CBP from customs andimmigrations backgrounds may not have sufficient agricultural training. Some argue that currentCBP training in agriculture for new inspectors may be inadequate. Former APHIS inspectors hadrequired science and biology backgrounds, combined with extensive pest and disease training. Manystakeholders in the agricultural community are asking whether CBP administrators and front lineinspectors will pay enough attention to agricultural inspections.", "Others assert that these concerns about training needs are exaggerated and observe that CBPhas a new 14-week training course for inspectors. They point out that the immigration and customsinspectors have been cross-designated for years and are already familiar with the laws, procedures,and databases. They also observe that agricultural inspections will remain specialized for the timebeing and will occur during secondary inspections.", "Database Technology. Critics of the currenttechnological infrastructure contend that it poses a security risk. The Enhanced Border Security andVisa Entry Reform Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-173 ) mandated the integration of immigration databases. In addition to integrating data systems that contain federal law enforcement and intelligenceinformation relevant to making decisions on visa admissibility and the removal of aliens, P.L.107-173 also mandated that immigration databases be integrated with other relevant data systems. The integration of law enforcement and intelligence data systems and databases with immigrationdata systems and databases continues to be a concern and is considered critical for the CBP inspectorto adequately screen individuals seeking entry to the United States.", "Many assert that the need for all agencies involved in admitting aliens to share intelligenceand coordinate activities is essential for U.S. immigration policy to be effective in guardinghomeland security. Some maintain that the reforms Congress made in the mid-1990s requiring allvisa applicants to be checked in the \"look out\" databases were inadequate because the databasesacross the relevant agencies were not interoperable and the various agencies were territorial withtheir data. They maintain that, in the long run, the most efficient and effective guard against theentry of aliens who would do us harm is an interagency and inter-departmental database that isaccessible in \"real time\" to consular officers, CBP inspectors, and key law enforcement andintelligence officials.", "Others point to the cost, time, and complexity of developing interoperable databases. Theycite the difficulty thus far in determining what biometric identifiers are most appropriate forscreening aliens. (119) They point out competing technologies of the existing databases in which various key agencies havealready heavily invested. Some maintain that success of the interoperable database technologydepends on 100% inclusion of aliens applying for visas and seeking admission, but that the sheerscope of such a system poses \"real time\" implementation issues. They also warn that if intelligencedata become too accessible across agencies, national security may actually be breached becausesensitive information may be more likely to fall into the wrong hands. Privacy concerns arise as wellas the data sharing and interoperability broadens.", "Meanwhile, CBP has been engaged in a long-term effort to acquire a new comprehensivedatabase system that dates back to the U.S. Customs Service. The Automated CommercialEnvironment (ACE) will replace ACS which has been characterized as outmoded andinefficient. (120) Difficulties with ACS are evident in the different levels of automation available for different modesof transportation. The most recent evidence of the difficulties raised by uneven automation can beseen in the different rollout deadlines for the new mandatory advance electronic manifest ruleproposed by CBP. The lack of consistent automation, particularly for commercial trucks, means thatseveral different programs will have to be utilized (FAST, PAPS, BRASS etc.) until ACE becomesfunctional. The ACE strategy is developing commercial automation protocols and procedures so thatexpeditious tracking and more effective screening and monitoring can develop over time.", "CBP is also working with other government agencies on developing the Integrated TradeData System (ITDS). ITDS will be an interconnected database of all government agencies involvedin the trade process, allowing users to submit data to one agency database available to other agencies. Questions remain however, because ACE and ITDS were envisioned prior to the merging of primaryborder agencies in DHS. Issues such as how ACE and ITDS will be incorporated into the largerDHS strategy, and how they will interact with other existing databases, remain a concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Fourth Amendment. Through the laws of thelegacy agencies, inspectors have unique statutory authorizations to inspect and search individualsand merchandise at the border, as discussed above. Beyond these specific authorities, however,inspections at the border must still adhere to the protections afforded by the Constitution. The scopeof these protections may be more limited at borders and ports of entry than in the interior of theUnited States. The scope of protections also might vary with the particular laws being enforced.", "A related constitutional matter that arises in this realm is \"racial profiling.\" Racial profilingis the practice of targeting individuals for law enforcement purposes based on their race or ethnicityin the belief that specific minority groups are more likely to engage in certain unlawful behaviors. Several courts have considered constitutional ramifications of the practice, as an \"unreasonablesearch and seizure,\" and more recently, as a denial of equal protection of the laws. (121) In the past, some haveaccused Customs inspectors of racial profiling. (122) Others maintain that it is difficult to discern where legitimatetargeting based on risk management principles crosses the line into racial profiling. In theimmigration context, the constitutionality of making distinctions on grounds of race or nationalityis unsettled. (123) Withrespect to immigration inspections conducted near, but otherwise beyond the actual physical border,however, the case law seems to suggest that race alone cannot justify a stop by a roving patrol, (124) but can be moredeterminative when questioned at fixed immigration checkpoints. (125) ", "Fifth Amendment. For purposes of proceduraldue process under the Fifth Amendment, immigration law has long made a distinction between thosealiens who have come to our shores seeking admission and those who are within the United Statesafter an entry, irrespective of its legality. In the latter instance, the Supreme Court has recognizedadditional rights and privileges not extended to those in the former category, who are merely \"on thethreshold of initial entry.\" (126) Indeed, Supreme Court jurisprudence still questions whetherthe Constitution applies at all to aliens seeking entry at the border or a port of entry, particularly indetermining an alien's right to be here. With respect to due process in the immigration context,therefore, aliens seeking admission to the United States must generally accept whatever statutoryrights and privileges they are granted by Congress. (127) In cases where the arriving alien is suspected of being aterrorist, the alien may be summarily excluded by the regional director with no further administrativeright to appeal. This policy is especially controversial if a suspected terrorist is returned to a countryin which the person is \"more likely than not to be tortured.\" (128) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overarching Questions", "paragraphs": ["As Congress views border inspections through the lens of homeland security, a series ofquestions emerge.
