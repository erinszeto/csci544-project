The EITC, enacted more than 40 years ago, has evolved from a relatively modest tax benefit to a significant antipoverty program. This report reviews economic research on the EITC. Understanding the economic impact of the credit, as well as its limitations and potential drawbacks, may inform future legislative discussions of the EITC and other refundable tax credits.", "When initially enacted in the 1970s, there were two major purposes of the EITC. First, the credit was meant to encourage the nonworking poor with children to enter the workforce. Second, the credit was intended to help reduce the tax burdens of working poor families with children. Some policymakers at the time worried that taxes\u2014especially payroll taxes\u2014would reduce poor families' take-home pay to such an extent that they would need to rely on cash welfare. In the 1990s, the purpose of the credit was expanded to include poverty reduction, with a focus on encouraging welfare recipients\u2014generally unmarried mothers\u2014to work. At the time, the EITC was seen as a way to ensure that a full-time worker with children would not be in poverty.", "As the credit has expanded and changed over time, researchers have evaluated various aspects of the credit, including the following:", "Decisions About Working: The EITC has encouraged single mothers to enter the workforce, but generally has had little to no impact on the number of hours they work. For example, one study found that 34% of the increase in employment among single mothers between 1993 and 1999 was due to legislative expansions of the EITC. Poverty: The EITC has had a significant impact on reducing poverty among recipients with children, but little impact among childless individuals. For example, CRS analysis indicates that the EITC reduces the proportion of unmarried childless workers in poverty from 19.9% to 19.6% (a 1.5% reduction). In comparison, the EITC reduces the proportion of unmarried households with three children in poverty from 40.5% to 32.3% (a 20.2% reduction). Health and Education Outcomes: Although the EITC was not designed as a health or education benefit, current research suggests that it may improve the health and educational achievement of low-income populations. Fairness: The EITC has increased inequity in the tax code between those with and without children. The unequal benefit the credit provides to families with children in comparison to those without is largely due to the different objectives of the credit for these two populations. For workers with children who work full time at a minimum wage job, the EITC was intended to ensure that the family would not be in poverty. In contrast, the smaller childless EITC was designed to help childless workers offset a gas tax increase, and not intended to lift them out of poverty. Complex Rules: The EITC's complex rules and formulas may make it difficult for taxpayers to comply with and difficult for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to administer. Studies indicate that EITC errors (whether intentional or unintentional) result in a relatively high proportion of EITC payments being issued incorrectly. The IRS estimates that between $14.9 billion and $17.6 billion in EITC payments (i.e., between 21.9% and 25.8% of payments) were issued improperly in FY2017. The majority of the dollar amount of these errors is due to taxpayers incorrectly claiming children for the credit. In addition, the IRS may have difficulty ensuring that tax filers are in compliance with all the parameters of the EITC."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit available to eligible workers earning relatively low wages.

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, in the face of increasing concern over growing welfare rolls, some policymakers became interested in alternative forms of aid. Economist Milton Friedman proposed a negative income tax (NIT) that would have provided a guaranteed minimum level of income administered through the tax code. President Nixon, influenced by the NIT, proposed in 1969 a \"family assistance plan\" (FAP) that would have benefited both the working and nonworking poor with children, effectively replacing the existing cash welfare program known at the time as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). While the Nixon plan never became law, it was twice approved by the House.", "Senator Russell Long, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed interest in an alternative government assistance program which would encourage the poor to work by providing them with a \"work bonus\" or supplement to their wages. Senator Long's \"primary objection to the NIT was that it provided its largest benefits to those without earnings\" and would hence discourage people from working. In contrast, Senator Long stated that his proposed \"work-bonus plan\" was \"a dignified way\" to help poor Americans \"whereby the more he [or she] works the more he [or she] gets.\" ", "In addition, the work-bonus plan was seen as a way to help reduce increasing payroll tax burdens. The worker's share of payroll taxes had risen from 1.5% in 1950, to 3.0% in 1960, and 4.8% in 1970. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a growing belief among policymakers that payroll taxes, as a regressive tax, especially burdened the working poor. Several antipoverty task forces also \"showed that future refinancing of the Social Security system might encumber the poor even more.\" Advocates of the work-bonus plan believed that payroll taxes reduced the poor's income to such an extent that the only way they could make ends meet was to receive welfare. According to Long, his \"work bonus plan\" would \"prevent the social security tax from taking away from the poor and low-income earners the money they need for support of their families.\" ", "In 1975, the work bonus plan was enacted on a temporary basis as part of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 and renamed the Earned Income Tax Credit. In addition to encouraging the poor to work and reducing their dependence on cash welfare, the credit was also viewed as a means to encourage economic growth in the face of the 1974 recession and rising food and energy prices. Since the EITC was viewed in part as an alternative to cash welfare, it was generally targeted to the same recipients\u2014single mothers with children. (Childless poor adults would not receive the credit until the 1990s, discussed subsequently.) The credit was extended several more times on a temporary basis before being expanded and made permanent by the Revenue Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-600 ). Making the credit permanent reflected Congress's belief \"that the earned income credit is an effective way to provide work incentives and relief from income and Social Security taxes to low-income families who might otherwise need large welfare payments.\"", "In the late 1980s and 1990s, policymakers remained interested in the EITC as an antipoverty program. A Wall Street Journal article from 1989 described the EITC as \"emerging as the antipoverty tool of choice among poverty experts and politicians as ideologically far apart as Vice President Dan Quayle and Representative Tom Downey, a liberal New York Democrat.\" President Bill Clinton, a champion of the EITC as a poverty-reduction tool, declared that expanding the credit would \"reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.\" As one scholar noted, \"President Clinton's declaration completed the evolution of the EITC from Senator Long's modest 'work bonus' to a major antipoverty initiative.\"", "Before the 1990s, the EITC's structure limited its ability to reduce poverty among families of different sizes. As illustrated in Table 1 , the EITC as originally designed did not vary by family size. Thus, as family size increased, the credit became less effective at helping a family meet its needs. The EITC was restructured to vary based on family size beginning modestly with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508 ) and greatly expanded by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66 ). Specifically, the EITC was now calculated such that at any given level of earnings, the credit was one size for a taxpayer with a single child and larger for taxpayers with two or more children. For example, when OBRA93's legislative changes had fully phased in, taxpayers with one child could receive a maximum credit of $2,152, while families with two or more children could receive a maximum credit of $3,556 in 1996. The 1993 bill also extended the credit to childless workers for the first time (see Table 1 ). Unlike the expansion of the credit for workers with children, the main rationale for this \"childless EITC\" was not poverty reduction. Instead the credit was intended to partly offset a gasoline tax increase included in OBRA93. The credit for childless workers was smaller than the credit for workers with children. It was calculated as 7.65% of the first $4,000 of earnings, for a $323 maximum credit in 1996. Notably, aside from inflation adjustments, the formula for the childless EITC has remained unchanged since OBRA93. ", "At the beginning of 2000, there was congressional interest among both political parties in reducing marriage penalties (although the means by which they intended to achieve this goal varied). For low-income taxpayers with little or no tax liability, a marriage penalty is said to occur when a married couple receives a smaller refund than the combined refund of each partner filing as unmarried. (Marriage bonuses also arise in the U.S. federal income tax code. ) In 2001, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) identified the structure of the EITC as one of the primary causes of the marriage penalty among low-income taxpayers. ", "In 2001, Congress chose to reduce the marriage penalty in the EITC. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16 ) gradually increased the income level at which the credit phased out for married couples by $3,000 (adjusted for inflation). In 2009, ARRA temporarily increased EITC marriage penalty relief to $5,000, also adjusted for inflation. This change was originally in effect for 2009 and 2010. The increased marriage penalty relief was extended for 2011 and 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ) and further extended from 2013 until the end of 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ; ATRA). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113 ) made the $5,000 of EITC marriage penalty relief permanent.

First, the credit value increases to its maximum value from the first dollar of earnings until earnings reach the \"earned income amount.\" Over this \"phase-in range\" the credit value is equal to the credit rate multiplied by earnings and is represented as the upward sloping line of the schedule. When earnings are between the \"earned income amount\" and the \"phase-out threshold\"\u2014referred to as the \"plateau\"\u2014the credit amount remains constant at its maximum level. For each dollar over the \"phase-out threshold,\" the credit is reduced by the phase-out rate until the credit equals zero, which is represented by the downward sloping line of the schedule.

A provision may be seen differently through these lenses. For example, a tax provision may simplify the tax code (improve administration), but result in an undesirable behavior (reduce efficiency).

A smaller body of research has examined the impact the EITC has on married secondary earners with children, generally assumed to be women. Research tends to examine either the impact that the credit had on a population's decision to start working (\"work force participation\") or on their decision to work a different number of hours.

Another study found that 34% of the increase in employment among single mothers between 1993 and 1999 was due to legislative expansions of the EITC. Other research found that \"60% of the 8.7 percentage point increase in annual employment of single mothers between 1984 and 1996 is attributable to the EITC with its expansion.\" In addition to encouraging many single mothers to enter the workforce, the EITC also played a role in reducing welfare caseloads. Research evaluating the interaction between welfare policy and the EITC in the 1990s found that the EITC had a substantial effect in reducing new entries into the cash welfare program. In other words, many single mothers chose to work, and receive the EITC, rather than apply for welfare. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Participation of Married Workers", "paragraphs": ["In comparison to unmarried workers, research is less conclusive as to the impact of the EITC on married secondary earners' decisions to start working.

One study, which assumed that married secondary earners were women, found that \"the 1993 EITC expansion led to a one percentage point reduction in the participation rate of married mothers.\" Another study found that legislative changes that expanded the EITC resulted in some married women choosing not to work. Couples may decide, for example, that one spouse's EITC is sufficiently large to allow the other spouse to stay out of the workforce and instead raise children. These couples could determine that having two earners would not only reduce their EITC, but may also increase the cost of other expenses, like child care, ultimately lowering their disposable income. However, more recent research has found that among married women, the EITC has had a negligible effect on labor force participation. ", "If the EITC is discouraging some secondary earners from working it would effectively be \"subsidizing the lower earning partner in a married couple to stay home.\" Whether that is desirable from a policy perspective depends on policymakers' goals with respect to married couples with children. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hours Worked of Unmarried Workers", "paragraphs": ["Among unmarried workers, research on the impact of the EITC on hours worked is generally inconsistent with theoretical predictions. Fundamental to the theoretical impact of the EITC on hours worked are the concepts of \"income\" and \"substitution\" effects. These effects can help economists predict how a worker will behave in response to a policy like the EITC.", "For example, in the phase-in region of the credit, the EITC increases the compensation per hour worked (or the \"marginal return to work\"). For an unmarried worker with one child, $1 of wages pre-EITC will yield $1.34 of wages post-EITC. This additional income makes the worker feel richer for the same amount of work. If the worker has an income target (\"I need to make $200 this week\"), an increase in wages from the EITC means they can work less to achieve the same level of income. Economists refer to this as the \"income effect\" of the EITC. At the same time, an increase in the marginal return to work means that \"not working\" or \"leisure\" implicitly costs more in terms of foregone wages. Returning to the example of the unmarried worker with one child, not working now costs the individual $1.34 in foregone income instead of $1. Hence, the individual will consume less leisure, and work more. Economists refer to this as the \"substitution effect\" of the EITC. Hence, if a worker is in the phase-in range of the credit, the impact of the EITC is theoretically ambiguous. The income effect implies they work less, while the substitution effect implies they work more.", "However, most EITC recipients' income places them in the plateau or phase-out region of the credit, where the economic framework of income and substitution effects suggests workers will be encouraged to reduce the hours they work. ", "Plateau: If taxpayers' income places them in the plateau region, they would receive the same amount of the EITC regardless of the number of hours worked. In this region, the EITC neither increases nor decreases hourly wages, and hence has no substitution effect. But since workers still receives the credit, then according to the income effect, they will work fewer hours. Hence, overall, economic theory suggests workers will cut back on hours worked. Phase-out: If recipients' income places them in the phase-out region of the credit, the value of the credit falls for each additional hour worked, and according to the substitution effect, \"leisure\" became less costly, and so workers work less. In addition, in the phase-out region, the credit is still available, and so according to the income effect, workers would also be encouraged to work fewer hours. Hence, overall, economic theory suggests that both the income and substitution effects will encourage workers to cut back the hours they work.", "Yet, despite the theoretical predictions, most of the empirical evidence indicates the EITC has \"had little effect on the number of hours they work.\" As one study stated, ", "...theory implies that the EITC will decrease hours worked among those already working because most recipients are on the plateau or phase-out portion of the credit schedule. However, recent hours worked patterns for EITC eligible individuals do not appear to fit this second prediction. Hours and weeks worked by likely recipient groups have not fallen. ", "There are several explanations as to why the EITC may have had little impact on the number of hours unmarried parents work. Chief among them is that the complexity and timing of the EITC limits its work incentive effect. Taxpayers may not understand the complex relationship between the credit's value and the worker's earnings, complexity that is likely compounded by receiving the credit the year after employment decisions are made. In addition, some experts suggest that instead of responding to the marginal impact that work has on their EITC amount (and overall tax liability), tax filers instead make their decision about how much they will work based on their average tax rate (their total taxes or refund divided by their total income). The impact of additional earnings on average tax rates is generally lower than its impact on marginal tax rates, which may also account for the limited impact of the EITC on hours worked. Finally, workers in low-wage jobs may not have the flexibility to alter the number of hours they work, even if they would like to. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Research", "paragraphs": ["More recent research has provided a more complex picture of taxpayer behavior with respect to the EITC, behavior that might not be apparent in the previous analyses of aggregate data. Specifically, it is possible that in certain circumstances a worker may adjust their income level (including by adjusting hours worked) to maximize their credit. To understand this finding, it is important to remember that there are two inflection or \"kink\" points in the EITC schedule: at the earned income amount and at the phase-out threshold, as illustrated in Figure 1 . The earned income amount is the lowest earnings level at which the credit reaches its maximum amount. The phase-out threshold is the highest earnings level at which the credit remains at its maximum amount. Recent research has examined whether taxpayers \"bunch\" around these inflection points. In other words, do taxpayers tend to earn the exact amount of money needed to get the largest credit? ", "One study found \"clear evidence of bunching around the first kink point of the EITC\u2014the point at which the credit reaches its maximum level.\" In addition, bunching tended to increase over time, suggesting taxpayers were learning about the structure of the EITC. This effect, however, was concentrated among the self-employed, who can adjust their earnings more easily than wage earners (by reducing hours worked or their reported earnings). No bunching effect was found among EITC recipients with only wage income and the authors did not report evidence of bunching around the second kink point of the EITC. However, these results did indicate that some self-employed individuals were aware of the EITC formula, and how it varied by earnings. Using high rates of \"self-employed bunching\" as a proxy for \"high knowledge\" about the structure of the EITC, a subsequent study focusing on wage earners found that EITC claimants who live in \"high knowledge\" neighborhoods tended to have wage earnings concentrated in the EITC plateau. Crucially, the authors noted that ", "the welfare consequences of the EITC depend on whether the higher concentration of earnings around the refund-maximizing plateau of the EITC schedule comes from increased earnings for those who would have been in the phase-in region or reduced earnings for those who would have been in the phase-out region.", "Assuming no changes in wage rates, this would imply workers would adjust the number of hours they work to maximize the credit. The authors found that the majority of the clustering effect in the plateau region was from workers whose income originally placed them in the phase-in region working more hours, rather than from those in the phase-out region working fewer hours. These studies suggest that low-income workers may respond to the EITC by increasing hours worked. ", "However, this newer research still does not explain why the EITC apparently does not lead to an overall reduction in hours worked among workers whose income places them in the phase-out range, even though economic theory suggests otherwise. As Hoynes states with respect to workers whose income places them in the phase-out region of the credit \"we expect hours to decrease ... the literature has failed to find a consistent negative impact of the EITC on hours worked. This, I think, is a bit of a puzzle.\" One possible theory is that workers in the phase-in range are part-time workers and can increase their hours in response to the EITC, whereas workers in the phase-out range are likely full-time workers who might not have the option to cut back their hours.

The EITC for childless workers has effectively remained unchanged from its 1993 formula\u2014except for annual inflation adjustments. In addition, the EITC for childless workers is likely too small to encourage workers to work at a low-wage job, especially on a full-time basis.

The official poverty measure, however, is unable to capture the antipoverty impact of the EITC. The official poverty measure is calculated by comparing an individual's or family's resources, measured as pre-tax cash income (hence excluding the EITC), to a poverty threshold, roughly equal to three times the cost of spending on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economy Food Plan. If an individual's or family's resources are less than their applicable threshold, the individual or family is counted as poor.", "New experimental poverty measures that include government benefits like the EITC provide evidence of such programs' antipoverty effects. The U.S. Census Bureau found that when government tax and transfer programs were included in a broader measure of poverty, refundable tax credits were estimated to reduce poverty by three percentage points. This compares to a 1.6 percentage-point reduction for food assistance (known as SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and a 0.2 percentage-point reduction for welfare (known as TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families). Although this analysis includes both the EITC and refundable portion of the child tax credit, the EITC is the largest refundable tax credit targeted to the poor, and previous research indicates that most of the antipoverty impact of refundable tax credits can be attributed to the EITC.", "The antipoverty effects of the EITC are not uniform across different types of households and tax filers. Figure 2 illustrates how pre-tax income of workers at the federal poverty level (FPL) changes after subtracting taxes owed (including payroll taxes) and adding back the EITC. Under the current federal income tax, married and unmarried childless workers with pre-tax income at the FPL tend to see their income remain below the poverty line after taxation, even when including the EITC. In contrast, married and unmarried workers with children whose pre-tax income is at the FPL will have post-tax income above the FPL because the EITC is greater than their payroll tax liability. Many poor tax filers, especially those with children, do not generally owe federal income tax. ", "CRS estimates of poverty rates based on the most recently available Census data indicate that the EITC reduces poverty, with the greatest reduction being among unmarried households with children, as illustrated in Figure 3 . For example, in 2016, without the EITC, 12.2% of unmarried households with three children were in deep poverty (below 50% of the FPL), and 28.3% had income between deep poverty and poverty (50% to 100% of the FPL). With the EITC, those proportions fell 10.1% and 22.2%, respectively. The relatively smaller impact of the credit on reducing poverty rates among families with children who are in deep poverty (as compared to having incomes 50% to 100% of the FPL) may be because the credit in dollar terms is too small to push these families over the poverty threshold. In addition, families in deep poverty may be less likely to work and hence receive work-based credits like the EITC. CRS estimates that 30.4% of unmarried households with three children in deep poverty were not working\u2014as compared with 24.2% of households with the same family structure, but income between 50% and 100% of the FPL. This reflects a broader limitation of work-based credits\u2014those who do not or cannot work do not receive them. ", "In addition, as illustrated in Figure 3 , the EITC results in a relatively small reduction in poverty rates among childless workers in comparison to workers with children. For example, among unmarried childless individuals, CRS estimates 19.9% (11.3% + 8.6%) are poor without including the EITC. When the EITC is included in their income, 19.6% are considered poor, a 1.5% reduction. Among unmarried households with three children, CRS estimates 40.5% are poor without the EITC, falling to an estimated 32.3% when the EITC is included, a 20.5% reduction.

Decades of research has linked poverty to poorer health outcomes among infants and children, suggesting that measures to alleviate poverty\u2014like the EITC\u2014could improve certain health outcomes. Recent research indicates that in addition to its broad antipoverty impact, the EITC may also improve the health of children born to low-income mothers. One widely used indicator of infant health is the infant's weight at birth and whether the baby is considered low birth weight (LBW), which is defined as weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth. LBW babies have been found to have a number of health complications at above-average levels. Several recent studies suggest that the EITC is associated with increases in birth weight and a reduction in the incidence of LBW. One study found that a $1,000 increase in the EITC was associated with a reduction in the incidence of LBW by approximately 3%, and an increase in mean birth weight. Another study found that the EITC was associated with improvements in maternal health; EITC-eligible mothers were less likely to have risky levels of certain biomarkers (i.e., high blood pressure or other indicators associated with cardiovascular disease and inflammation).", "Some possible causal mechanisms have been offered to explain the association of the EITC with higher birthweight, and research on the matter is ongoing. Some studies have found an association between EITC receipt and reduction in maternal smoking. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been consistently associated with LBW. The EITC may also result in improved access to prenatal care, or reduce maternal stress. Researchers acknowledge that they are unable to decouple the income effects of the EITC from the labor effects. In other words, it remains unclear to what extent health effects flow from the boost in income the credit provides as opposed to the effects of having a previously unemployed mother enter the workforce. ", "The impact of the EITC on adult health outcomes is less conclusive. A 2013 systematic review by the Cochrane Group found no evidence of an effect on the health status of working-age adults. Since 2013, some researchers have found an association with EITC eligibility and improvements in health outcomes of the working-age population, although these studies may not adequately control for other influencing factors.", "In addition to exploring the effects of the EITC on health outcomes, many researchers have studied the effects of the credit on education outcomes of low-income populations. Researchers looking at the test scores of children in elementary school in a large urban school district found that children in families that received larger EITCs (and the refundable portion of the child tax credit) tended to score higher on English and math tests. (Similar results were found by researchers looking at the impact of legislative expansions to the EITC in the 1990s. They found that the children in families that received the largest increase in the credit tended to score higher on math and reading tests. ) The authors acknowledge that \"their results do not shed light on the mechanism through which an increase in tax credits aids student achievement. Are families directly spending more on school-related resources for children? Are families moving into neighborhoods with better schools and peers?\" In addition, as with the research on the health implications of the EITC, researchers are unable to decouple the income effects of the credit from its labor supply effects. While it remains unclear how credits may improve student achievement, these studies indicate that the EITC (and the child tax credit) may contribute to the improvement of academic achievement among low-income children. ", "Research has also found that the EITC also improves the college attendance rates of low-income high school students. One recent study found that among low-income high school seniors, an increase in their family's EITC by $1,000 increases their chances of enrolling in college by 1.3 percentage points. (Depending on what proportion of a family's EITC is spent on college costs, the authors note that their estimated impact of the EITC on college enrollment may be comparable to traditional student aid.) In contrast, the authors note that their research suggests there is no effect on enrollment decisions from tax refunds received in the spring of the high school student's junior year. Hence the timing of when the credit is received\u2014around the time college enrollment decision are being made\u2014may be a large factor in why the credit influences enrollment decisions. In their comprehensive survey of the EITC literature, Nichols and Rothstein note that \"[t]aking all of the estimates together, these is robust evidence of quite large effects of the EITC on children's academic achievement and attainment, with potentially important consequences for later-life outcomes.\" The authors continue, \"[T]he effects are large enough to demand an explanation for the relatively small estimates of effects of family income on student outcomes that come from non-EITC settings.\"", "These studies are illustrative of relatively recent EITC research that examines a broader impact of retributive policies on social outcomes, like health and education. While the EITC was not designed as a health or education benefit, current research suggests that it may improve the health and educational achievement of low-income populations.

First, the credit was meant to encourage the nonworking poor (only those with children) to enter the workforce and be more self-sufficient. Second, the credit was intended to help reduce the tax burdens of working poor families with children. While these families were generally not subject to income taxes, they were subject to payroll taxes on their earnings. Some policymakers at the time worried that payroll taxes would reduce poor families' take home pay to such an extent that they would need to rely on cash welfare. In the 1990s, the purposes of the credit were expanded to include poverty reduction, with a focus on encouraging welfare recipients\u2014generally unmarried mothers\u2014to work. ", "If policymakers want to modify the EITC, it may be helpful to understand both the benefits and limitations or problems with the credit. Research on the EITC suggests that the EITC has generally achieved many policymakers' original goals: It has encouraged single mothers to enter the workforce and it has reduced poverty among families with children. Evidence also suggests that the credit may improve health and education outcomes of low-income populations. However, studies also indicate limitations, unintended consequences, or problems with the EITC. Some research suggests the EITC could discourage some married women from working. It has also been shown to exacerbate inequities in the tax code between taxpayers with and without children. In addition, approximately a quarter of all EITC payments are issued improperly. Improper payments are likely related to the complex eligibility rules of the credit, which can be difficult for taxpayers to comply with and difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to verify. For workers without children, the EITC has generally been shown to be ineffective at reducing poverty. No research has indicated the EITC has any effect on encouraging childless individuals to enter the workforce. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. The Economic Theory of the Impact of the EITC on Labor Supply", "paragraphs": ["The EITC, insofar as it changes the marginal returns to work (compensation for each hour of work), will theoretically affect both unmarried and married workers' decisions to work and the amount that they work (i.e., the number of hours). The following is a detailed overview of the theoretical impact of the EITC on labor supply decisions (the decision to work and the number of hours worked).", "Workforce Participation", "According to economic theory, the EITC will unambiguously increase the workforce participation of single workers because these workers can only receive the credit if they work. And those who do not work are no better or worse off as a result of the EITC. As Eissa and Hoynes state \"[t]he well-being of a taxpayer who does not work has not changed and any taxpayer who preferred working before [the EITC] will still prefer working, and some taxpayers may find that the additional after-tax income from the EITC makes it worth entering the workforce.\"", "Among married couples however, the theoretical impact the credit has on each spouse's labor force participation may differ and can be understood using the theoretical framework of \"income\" and \"substitution\" effects. In summary, when a tax policy, like the EITC, increases the marginal returns to work, this additional income makes the worker feel richer for the same amount of work. If the worker has an income target (\"I need to make $200 this week\"), an increase in wages from the EITC means they can work less to achieve the same level of income. Economists refer to this as the \"income effect\" of the EITC. At the same time, an increase in the marginal return to work means that \"not working\" or \"leisure\" implicitly costs more in terms of foregone wages. Hence, the individual will consume less leisure, and work more. This is referred to as the \"substitution effect\" of the EITC by economists.", "Economists generally assume that in a married couple, one spouse is the primary earner, and earns more of the household income than the secondary earner. In addition, economists generally assume that the primary earner makes their labor force participation decision first, and then the secondary earner decides whether to work (this is referred to as sequential family labor supply decisions). In such a model, the primary earner's labor force decision is the same as the one faced by an unmarried worker. They (and their family) will only receive the credit if they work, and hence the labor force participation of primary earners should unambiguously increase. ", "Given that the value of the EITC for a family is based on the combined earnings of both spouses, the secondary earner's labor force participation decision will depend on the distribution of income between the spouses. If the income of the primary earner is sufficiently low that it places the family in the phase-in region of the credit, then the secondary earner's decision to work will theoretically be ambiguous. On the one hand, by working, the secondary earner would increase the marginal returns to work of the married couple. According to the substitution effect, the secondary earner would be encouraged to work. On the other hand, the family might decide that the additional income from the EITC is sufficient for the family to meet their needs, and according to the income effect, the secondary earner may choose to remain out of the labor force. Given that these two effects move in opposing directions, it is unclear as to whether the labor force participation of secondary earners will increase in this situation, although most empirical research suggests that over this income range, the substitution effect is dominant (and hence the secondary earner will decide to start working).", "However, the income of most earners implies that if they were to marry, the combined family income would place the family in the plateau or phase-out range of the credit. Over this income range, the income and substitution effects suggest that the secondary earner would be better off staying out of the labor force, which could lead to a reduction of the labor force participation of these individuals. If the secondary earner were to start working, the family's EITC would either remain constant (if the family remained in the plateau region of the credit), or fall in value (if the family was in the phase-out region of the credit). In either region, the family would still receive a credit, and the income effect would suggest that the secondary earner would be discouraged from entering the workforce. If the family's income placed them in the plateau region, the family would receive the same amount of the EITC regardless of the number of hours worked. In other words, the credit would not increase their hourly wage, and hence would have no substitution effect. If the family's income placed them in the phase-out region of the credit, the value of the credit would fall for each additional hour worked. Hence, the cost of leisure would decline, and according to the substitution effect, a secondary earner would be discouraged from working. Thus, in either case, the combined income and substitution effects would discourage some secondary earners from working.", "Hours Worked", "Economic theory suggests that the decision workers face in terms of how many hours to work will\u2014like the decision a secondary earner faces in terms of working or not working\u2014depend on the income and substitution effects of the credit. For unmarried workers, the impact of the credit will depend on their individual income, while for married workers the impact will depend on their combined family income. For clarity, the following discussion will refer to a single worker, but the same analysis holds for combined family income of a married couple.", "As previously discussed, as the EITC phases in, it increases the marginal return to work for the worker. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 , in the phase-in range, one dollar of wages pre-EITC leads to $1.34 of wages post-EITC. An increase in the marginal return to work, will lead to the worker feeling richer and working less\u2014the income effect\u2014while also simultaneously raising the cost of not working and encouraging workers to work more\u2014the substitution effect. Given these two opposing forces, the theoretical impact of the EITC on hours worked in this earnings range is ambiguous. ", "For workers whose income places them in the plateau region of the credit, the framework of income and substitution effects implies a worker will work less. In this plateau region, the worker receives the same amount of the EITC no matter how many hours they work. In other words, the credit does not increase their hourly wage, and hence has no substitution effect. But the credit does have an income effect, encouraging that worker to work less. In effect, if workers receive the same credit amount over a range of earnings, economic theory suggests some workers will choose to work the least number of hours to receive the credit (other workers in the plateau region may work more hours to receive more in wages).", "As the credit phases out, it decreases a worker's marginal return to work (i.e., in the example in Figure 1 , every additional dollar of pre-EITC earnings leads to a reduction of the EITC by almost 16 cents). Hence, the cost of leisure declines, and according to the substitution effect, a worker will work fewer hours. Even though the amount of the EITC is falling, it is still greater than zero in this range, meaning it still boosts income. Hence, according to the income effect, a worker will consume more leisure and work less. Therefore, economic theory suggests that workers whose incomes places them in the phase-out region of the credit will work less."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
