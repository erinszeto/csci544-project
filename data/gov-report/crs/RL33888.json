{"id": "RL33888", "title": "Section 527 Political Organizations: Background and Issues for Federal Election and Tax Laws", "released_date": "2008-02-08T00:00:00", "summary": ["Several prominent groups organized under \u00a7 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) were prominent players in the 2004 presidential election, raising and spending approximately $435 million and being widely seen as having an impact on the outcome of the race. Yet, some so-called \"527\" organizations remain outside the purview of federal election law. Section 527, added to the IRC in 1975, provides tax-exempt status to federal, state, and local political organizations. At first, it was generally thought that, with respect to federal election activities, political organizations correlated directly with political committees as defined under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). It became clear by 2000, however, that this was not necessarily true because prevailing judicial interpretation of Supreme Court precedent has permitted FECA regulation of only those communications containing express advocacy (i.e., explicitly urging the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates). By avoiding such terms, groups could arguably promote issue positions in reference to particular federal elected officials without triggering FECA's disclosure, contribution limits, and source restrictions. Still, the groups qualified for the favorable tax treatment of \u00a7 527 organizations because that benefit is not limited to groups that conduct express advocacy.", "In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) addressed express advocacy, but regulated only messages broadcast within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election that referred to a federal office candidate. BCRA left unregulated such areas as broadcasts aired before elections and voter mobilization efforts. Groups wishing to engage in these activities and still avail themselves of the unlimited funding sources no longer available to political parties generally qualify for tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 527. Supporters of BCRA have led the effort to extend federal election law regulation to these types of 527 organizations, seeing the enormous amounts of money raised and spent in recent years as a result of the FEC's failure to enforce existing law. BCRA critics, however, insist that what occurred since 2004 was the predictable result of the ban on soft money activity by national parties, thus redirecting massive amounts of unregulated money to outside groups that are less accountable to the political system; they insist that many of these groups not engaging in express advocacy cannot be constitutionally regulated.", "In the 109th Congress, the House twice passed similar bills to add 527 organizations to FECA's political committee definition, unless involved solely in state and local elections. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee reported a similar measure, but the Senate did not act on it. Similar bills (H.R. 420 and S. 463) have been offered in the 110th Congress. Other bills (H.R. 2316; H.R. 1204) that would affect 527s have also been introduced in the 110th Congress. This report explores the evolution of the 527 issue and attempts to address it in the courts, the Federal Election Commission, and Congress. It will be updated periodically to reflect further developments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the terms \"527 organizations,\" \"527 groups,\" and \"527s\" have been used interchangeably to describe groups that intend to influence federal elections in ways that may be outside the scope of federal election law. The terms stem from the fact that these organizations are provided tax-exempt status under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). These groups have become the subject of controversy due to the different definitions used in federal election law and tax law as to what constitutes political or election-related activity and the lack of uniform opinion as to what election law itself regulates or may permissibly regulate.", "Strictly speaking, IRC \u00a7 527 provides tax-exempt status to many more organizations than just those that are colloquially referred to as 527s. The section applies not only to organizations that are active in federal elections, but also to organizations involved in state and local elections and certain non-electoral activities. While IRC \u00a7 527 applies to a broad range of organizations, only the groups colloquially referred to as 527s (i.e., those groups that intend to influence federal elections in ways that may be outside the scope of federal election law) are the focus of current controversy.

At that time, it was generally thought that, with respect to groups participating in federal elections, political organizations correlated directly with political committees as labeled by and operating under federal election law. Indeed, political committees\u2014whether political parties, political action committees (PACs), or candidate committees\u2014have tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 527. In 2000, however, it came to light that some groups engaged in federal-election-related issue advocacy were claiming exempt status under IRC \u00a7 527 while not being regulated under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).

Such funds are often referred to as hard money . FECA defines both \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as monies or anything of value \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" In order to preserve the law's regulation of contributions and expenditures against invalidation for constitutional vagueness, the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo construed the terms \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" to encompass only funds donated for or spent for express advocacy (that is, voter communications using explicit phrases and words such as \"vote for,\" \"vote against,\" \"elect,\" and \"defeat\"). Likewise, the Court construed the term \"political committee\" to include only \"organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.\" In so doing, the Buckley Court established the \"major purpose test,\" which determines whether or not an organization, if it raises more than $1,000 in \"contributions\" or makes more than $1,000 in \"expenditures,\" is subject to regulation under FECA as a \"political committee.\"", "Neither FECA nor the Supreme Court, however, has yet defined precisely how to ascertain the major purpose of an organization. Indeed, how the major purpose test works, and to what groups it applies, are at the heart of a debate concerning the circumstances under which non-party organizations, including 527s, can constitutionally be considered FECA regulated \"political committees.\" For example, some observers proffer that it is relevant to examine an organization's activities beyond express advocacy to ascertain its major purpose, while others maintain that Supreme Court precedent still limits FECA regulation through the designation of \"political committee\" status to only those organizations engaging in express advocacy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "P.L. 93-625 and Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1975, the Internal Revenue Code was silent as to the tax treatment of organizations whose primary purpose is influencing elections. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not generally require these organizations to file tax returns or pay taxes. It appears this was because the IRS treated contributions to political organizations as gifts, which meant that the organizations did not have taxable income. By the early 1970s, it became apparent that these organizations had sources of income other than contributions, such as investment income and gain from the sale of donated property. In 1973, the IRS announced it would begin requiring political committees and parties with investment and other types of income to file tax returns and pay taxes. Parties and committees were taxed as corporations, trusts, or partnerships, depending on the surrounding circumstances.", "In 1975, Congress responded to the IRS action by adding Section 527 to the Internal Revenue Code ( P.L. 93-625 ; 88 Stat. 2108). Section 527 as enacted by P.L. 93-625 is similar to the current version, with the exception of the reporting requirements that currently exist (these are discussed below in the section on P.L. 106-230 and P.L. 107-276 and in the Appendix ).", "Section 527 applies to \"political organizations\" which are those organizations, including a party, committee, association, or fund, that are organized and operated primarily to directly or indirectly accept contributions and/or make expenditures for an \"exempt function.\" An exempt function is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of an individual to a federal, state, or local public office, to an office in a political organization, or as a presidential or vice-presidential elector.", "Section 527 political organizations are subject to tax only on \"political organization taxable income.\" This is the organization's gross income, excluding \"exempt function income,\" less $100 and any allowable deductions. Exempt function income is any amount received, to the extent that it is segregated to use for an exempt function, as", "contributions of money or other property, membership dues, fees, or assessments, proceeds, which are not received in the ordinary course of business, from political fundraising and entertainment events or from the sale of campaign materials, and proceeds from conducting a bingo game.", "The tax rate is generally the highest corporate income tax rate. Under IRC \u00a7 527(h), however, income of the principal campaign committee of a congressional candidate is taxed using the graduated corporate tax rate schedule. This special rule does not apply for campaign committees of candidates for state or local office.", "Under P.L. 93-625 , political organizations only had contact with the IRS if they were required to file a tax return because they had taxable income. Thus, the law was properly thought of as addressing the tax treatment of these organizations, rather than regulating them. The lack of reporting requirements may have been because, at the time of the law's enactment, political organizations were generally thought of as candidate funds and political parties and committees (i.e., the same types of entities that, when involved in federal elections, are regulated by FECA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergence of Issue Advocacy Campaigns", "paragraphs": ["During the 1996 election cycle, a new phenomenon was seen in campaigns for President and Congress that marked a turning point both in the way in which campaigns for federal office are conducted and in efforts to regulate the flow of money in federal elections. Political parties and interest groups had in 1995 and 1996 made broadcast communications that discussed candidates' merits in conjunction with particular issue positions, which, while technically not meeting federal election law criteria for election-related activity, were widely viewed as intending to influence federal races. As public policy messages without express advocacy language, such activities were labeled issue advocacy . By not explicitly urging the defeat or election of clearly identified candidates, entities could present information to the public which encouraged more positive or negative views of public officials who also were candidates. Not only could these communications be paid for with funds from any source and in any amount (i.e., soft money), but they were not uniformly disclosed either.", "While issue advocacy caught much of the political world by surprise in 1996, it quickly caught on as the new growth area of money in politics. While the lack of disclosure made it impossible to know for sure the extent of such activity, the Annenberg Public Policy Center estimated that between $135 and $150 million was spent on broadcast issue advocacy in 1996, rising to between $250 and $341 million in 1998, and some $509 million in 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effect on Campaign Finance Reform Debate", "paragraphs": ["The highly visible and increasing levels of \"issue spending\" in the 1996-2000 elections reinforced perceptions of a major loophole by which politically interested groups were circumventing federal election law. But even before the evidence of a growing trend was established, proponents of campaign finance reform recognized the potential for such growth and responded quickly by redirecting their efforts toward addressing issue advocacy.", "During the 1980s and early 1990s, pressure had been building in Congress to address concerns about the role of money in politics, primarily involving the high costs of seeking office and the concomitant need for private sources of campaign funds. Those interested in campaign finance \"reform\"\u2014generally characterized by favoring greater regulation\u2014had focused their efforts during much of this time on two issues: the rising costs of elections to federal office and the growing funding role played therein by political action committees. The most prominent legislative proposals came to feature provisions to curb, if not eliminate, PAC money as a funding source in federal elections, and to impose voluntary spending limits in congressional elections, in exchange for candidates' receiving either public funding or some form of cost-reducing public benefit (such as postal or broadcast rate reductions).", "These provisions were key elements in comprehensive reform bills passed by the House and Senate in the 101 st , 102 nd , and 103 rd Congresses. While other aspects of campaign finance law were included in these measures, such as ones dealing with party soft money, the major point of contention was the insistence of the reform advocates on spending limits and public funding or benefits. The dynamics of the debate over PACs shifted over time, and even that provision eventually became relatively less a point of contention.", "On September 7, 1995, during the 104 th Congress, Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold introduced their first campaign finance reform bill, establishing themselves as the leading reform advocates in the Senate. That bill, S. 1219 , was the successor to the reform bills that had passed in the previous three Congresses, and it reflected the same pre-1996 consensus among advocates of campaign finance reform that prioritized curbing the high cost of congressional elections and replacing the need for private funds, especially PACs, with other funding sources. ( S. 1219 also expanded on the earlier bills' treatment of party soft money, with inclusion of stricter curbs on the raising and spending of soft money by national and state and local political parties.)", "Following the watershed election of 1996, in which unregulated campaign activity appeared to overshadow the regulated activity, the leading reform advocates in Congress responded with significant changes in their proposed legislation at the start of the 105 th Congress. In S. 25 , introduced by Senators McCain and Feingold, and its companion measure H.R. 493 , offered by Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan, provisions were added to their 104 th Congress bills to redefine \"express advocacy\" to allow federal regulation of more election-related activity. By the fall of 1997, following the most intensive congressional activity on campaign finance reform since the 1970s, a revised S. 25 was offered. As modified by floor amendment, S. 25 featured provisions addressing the issues of party soft money and issue advocacy. The provisions on congressional spending limits and public benefits, and on PACs, the key elements of reformers' objectives for at least the previous 10 years, were eliminated from the bill entirely. Thus, in one year's time, the very nature of the campaign finance debate had shifted from an attempt to improve the existing regulatory system to saving it from becoming meaningless in the face of newly emerging campaign practices. This debate, started in the wake of the 1996 elections, would continue until the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Emergence of the 527 Issue", "paragraphs": ["Not only was 1996 the year in which issue advocacy emerged, but it was also the year in which the IRS began issuing several private rulings on the types of activities that qualify as influencing an election for purposes of IRC \u00a7 527. Under these rulings, it became apparent that some of the issue advocacy activities described above could qualify as election-influencing activities under IRC \u00a7 527. Thus, these rulings helped create an awareness that groups participating in these issue advocacy activities, while arguably not required to report to the FEC, could still qualify for the benefit of tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 527.", "After the 1996 election, media and congressional attention turned to groups with 527 status that were engaging in activities aimed at influencing federal elections without conforming to FECA rules. Sporadic news accounts of their activities tended to categorize them simply as tax-exempt groups, without the more specific label as a 527.

George W. Bush's environmental record.", "While that article identified the sponsor of the ad (Texas businessman Sam Wyly), it did not label the group as a 527 organization. Its activities did, however, call attention to that section of the code in dramatic enough fashion that, within weeks, news accounts were focusing specifically on 527 groups. A New York Times account, at the end of March 2000, identified groups with 527 status across the political spectrum and analyzed the advantages of various vehicles under the tax code for waging issue advocacy campaigns. A Wall Street Journal article in May 2000 outlined how the newly discovered 527 vehicle was by then being used to create soft money leadership PACs for elected officials. In a few months, the 527 issue had burst on the scene.", "When the 527 issue emerged in 2000, Congress was enmeshed in consideration of BCRA, and opinion was still evolving about whether and how Congress could regulate activity that was not express advocacy. With the emergence of 527s, Congress was confronted with the practice of election-related issue advocacy by groups receiving the benefit of tax-exempt status under the IRC. Rather than short-circuit the debate on regulating non-express advocacy activity and begin yet another on the also-complicated issue of differing definitions of political organization under the IRC and political committee under the FECA, Congress adopted a different approach by having regulation triggered not by the nature of the activity but by the nature of the entity engaging in it. By simply requiring disclosure to the IRS by groups with tax-exempt 527 status in P.L. 106-230 (discussed in next section), Congress thus kept the debate going about standards for regulation under the election law and addressed what was seen as the most urgent need at that point.", "Sponsors of what was ultimately to become BCRA recognized the need for this action as a provisional measure. In prepared testimony for the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, Senator Feingold stated,", "I hope that the Ways and Means Committee and the full House will promptly pass a bill that, if nothing else, will end the veil of secrecy behind which 527s now hide. There is, of course, much more that can and should be done on the campaign finance issue generally and to strengthen disclosure in particular.... I want to make it very clear that none of us who support reform are under any illusion that a positive resolution of the 527 problems is all that needs to be done to cure the ills of the campaign finance system. It is a crucial first step, but only a first step. Our fight in the Senate for more far reaching reform, including a ban on soft money, will continue. At the same time, we cannot let our desire for more sweeping reform, or for broader disclosure, prevent us from dealing with the 527 problem in this Congress, and hopefully in the next few weeks.

P.L. 107-276 amended the requirement by adding an exemption for political committees of state and local candidates and state and local committees of political parties.", "In addition to the initial notification requirement, P.L. 106-230 also included a provision that requires the periodic disclosure of contributions and expenditures to the IRS. Under this provision, any organization that accepts a contribution or makes an expenditure for a Section 527 exempt function during the year is required to file a disclosure report with the IRS on either a quarterly or monthly basis. A periodic report must include (1) the name, address, occupation, and employer of any contributor who made a contribution during the reporting period and gave at least $200 during the year, along with the amount and date of the contribution; and (2) the amount, date, and purpose of each expenditure made to a person if the total annual expenditures to that person was at least $500, along with the person's name, address, occupation, and employer. The disclosure requirements do not apply to any political organization that is required to report to the FEC as a political committee, is a state or local committee of a political party or a political committee of a non-federal candidate, or expects to have gross receipts of less than $25,000. They also do not apply to independent expenditures, which are expenditures that expressly advocate for a candidate but are made without the candidate's involvement or cooperation. Additionally, P.L. 107-276 added an exemption for state and local political committees if they are required to report similar information to a state.", "P.L. 106-230 and P.L. 107-276 also changed the rules for when political organizations must file tax and information returns. Under prior law, a political organization only filed a tax return if it had political organization taxable income and never had to file an information return. P.L. 106-230 required any organization with at least $25,000 in gross receipts to file a tax return, regardless of whether it had political organization taxable income, and required that any organization that filed a tax return also file an information return.

Title II of BCRA addressed the express advocacy issue, but in a limited fashion, in large measure to enhance its chances of withstanding judicial scrutiny. Without amending FECA's definition of \"political committee,\" \"expenditure,\" or \"contribution,\" Title II created a new term in federal election law, \"electioneering communications\"\u2014political advertisements that refer to clearly identified federal candidates, broadcast within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. Generally, the law prohibits such communications from being funded with union or corporate treasury funds, and disbursements of over $10,000 and donors of $1,000 or more are required to be disclosed to the FEC. BCRA did not address interest group involvement in such other election-related activities as broadcasts prior to the specified period before an election, public communications through non-broadcast methods, voter identification, and get-out-the-vote and registration drives.", "Shortly after BCRA was enacted, plaintiffs filed suit arguing that key portions of the new law violated the First Amendment and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Due to its regulation in the area of express advocacy, some commentators predicted that Title II, in particular, was potentially vulnerable to being struck down. In December 2003, however, the Supreme Court, in McConnell v. FEC, largely upheld the entire law, including Title II. In upholding Title II, the Court determined that its decision in Buckley v. Valeo construed FECA's disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as its expenditure limitations, to apply only to funds used for communications that contain express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. The McConnell Court held that neither the First Amendment nor Buckley, however, prohibits BCRA's regulation of \"electioneering communications,\" even though electioneering communications, by definition, do not necessarily contain express advocacy. The Court determined that when the Buckley Court distinguished between express and issue advocacy it did so as a matter of statutory interpretation, not constitutional command. Moreover, the Court announced that, by narrowly reading the FECA provisions in Buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth, it \"did not suggest that a statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line.\" \"[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad,\" the Court observed.

After passing H.R. 4975 , the House substituted it for the text of S. 2349 , the Senate-passed version of the bill, to enable a conference with the Senate. The Senate-passed bill did not contain the 527 provisions, and the Senate resisted considering 527s in the context of ethics reform. This conflict between the House and Senate kept the issue from being resolved in the 109 th Congress.", "Another bill offered in the second session reflected a limited regulatory approach. H.R. 4696 , sponsored by Representative Mike Rogers, would prohibit 527 organizations that are not also political committees under the FECA from making electioneering communications, the most visible, but hardly the only, form of election-related issue advocacy. Four additional bills were offered in the 109 th Congress, seeking a more limited approach to the 527 issue than reflected in the bills discussed above. To the extent that what has concerned many observers about 527 groups' activity is their lack of accountability relative to organizations regulated under federal election law, these proposals sought to bolster the disclosure requirements in the Internal Revenue Code and thus offer voters a greater opportunity to know about these groups and who finances them. These bills included H.R. 471 , sponsored by Representative John Larson; H.R. 914 , sponsored by Representative Phil English; and H.R. 1942 and H.R. 2204 , sponsored by Representative Clay Shaw."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "110th Congress", "paragraphs": ["BCRA sponsors in the House introduced their legislation to regulate 527s early in the 110 th Congress. H.R. 420 , sponsored by Representatives Marty Meehan and Christopher Shays, and S. 463 , sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold, the 527 Reform Act of 2007, are identical to the two measures passed by the House in the 109 th Congress, as they pertained strictly to 527s (amendments on party coordinated expenditures and leadership PACs were omitted). A summary of these bills, compared with current law, follows in Table 10 .", "Two other 527 bills have also been introduced in the 110 th Congress. First, a lobbying and ethics reform bill ( H.R. 2316 , Conyers) passed by the House in May 2007 would have required lobbyists to disclose certain contributions to non-political committee 527s. However, the lobbying reform measure that ultimately became law ( P.L. 110-81 ) did not address 527s. Second, H.R. 1204 (English) would change periodic disclosure requirements for those 527 organizations that report to the IRS rather than the FEC. The bill would also amend the penalties for failing to file such reports in a timely manner. Finally, the bill would require that the periodic disclosure reports filed with the IRS also be filed with the FEC."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["If the 110 th Congress chooses to address 527s, a key question will be whether additional regulation should occur via legislation, new FEC or other regulation, or enforcement of existing regulations. Regardless of how policy change occurs, perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear whether the courts would uphold additional attempts to regulate 527 activity. Indeed, whether regulation of 527 activity needs to be limited to only those organizations engaging in express advocacy is a topic of much controversy and debate. Nevertheless, there is likely to be continued criticism that activity by 527s in the manner seen in recent elections threatens to undermine the effectiveness of regulation under federal election law.", "Another issue that has received attention is whether, in the event that Congress does require further regulation of 527 organizations, money might flow to other types of tax-exempt organizations, such as IRC \u00a7 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations and \u00a7 501(c)(6) trade associations. These types of organizations may engage in political campaign activity so long as it is consistent with the organization's exempt purpose. There are, however, two limitations in the IRC that would make these organizations less efficient than Section 527 political organizations for carrying on election-related activities. First, the IRC implicitly restricts the amount of political campaign activity that these organizations may conduct\u2014specifically, participating in political campaign activity cannot be the organization's primary activity. Second, under IRC \u00a7 527(f), IRC \u00a7 501(c) organizations are subject to tax if they make an expenditure for an IRC \u00a7 527 exempt function. As discussed above, an exempt function is influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of an individual to a federal, state, or local public office, to an office in a political organization, or as a presidential or vice-presidential elector. Under IRC \u00a7 527(f), the organization is taxed at the highest corporate rate on the lesser of the organization's net investment income or its total amount of exempt function expenditures. Finally, it should be noted that tax-exempt organizations must also abide by any applicable election laws. For example, since campaign finance laws ban unions and corporations from making any contribution or expenditure in connection with federal elections, IRC \u00a7 501(c)(5) labor unions and any incorporated tax-exempt organizations are generally prohibited from doing so, as well."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
