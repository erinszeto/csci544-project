During the past few years, there have been numerous examples of hackers breaking into corporate, government, academic, and personal computers and compromising computer systems or stealing personal data such as Social Security, bank account, credit card, and driver's license numbers, as well as medical and student records. These breaches occur not only because of illegal or fraudulent attacks by computer hackers, but often because of careless business practices, such as lost or stolen laptop computers, or the inadvertent posting of personal data on public websites. A recent infamous example occurred in May 2006, when 26.5 million veterans and their spouses were in danger of identity theft because a Veterans Affairs data analyst took home a laptop computer containing personal data (including names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth), which was later stolen in a burglary.", "Depending on the definition, the most common type of identity theft is credit card fraud, and there is evidence that the extent of credit card fraud has increased due to opportunities provided by the Internet. Although some aspects of identity theft have been known for many years, it is viewed now primarily as a product of the information age. A particular crime of identity theft may include one or all of these stages:", "Stage 1: Acquisition of the identity through theft, computer hacking, fraud, trickery, force, re-directing or intercepting mail, or even by legal means (e.g., purchase information on the Internet).", "Stage 2: Use of the identity for financial gain (the most common motivation) or to avoid arrest or otherwise hide one's identity from law enforcement or other authorities (such as bill collectors). Crimes in this stage may include account takeover, opening of new accounts, extensive use of debit or credit cards, sale of the identity information on the street or black market, acquisition (\"breeding\") of additional identity related documents such as driver's licenses, passports, visas, health cards, etc.), filing tax returns for large refunds, insurance fraud, stealing rental cars, and many more.", "Stage 3: Discovery of the theft. While many misuses of credit cards are discovered quickly, the \"classic\" identity theft involves a long period of time to discovery, typically from six months to as long as several years. Evidence suggests that the time it takes to discovery is related to the amount of loss incurred by the victim.", "Identity theft is rarely one crime, but is composed of the commission of a wide variety of other crimes, such as check and card fraud, financial crimes of various sorts, various telemarketing and Internet scams, auto theft, counterfeiting and forgery, etc.", "The difficulty in studying identity theft is investigating what portion of the long list of identity theft related crimes is related to the \"classic\" type of identity theft that results in repeat victimization. For example, a common type of credit card fraud is to steal an individual's credit card. The offender makes a quick purchase of an expensive item then discards the card. Has the victim's identity truly been stolen? The event clearly fits within the definition above, but it is not the wholesale theft of the victim's identity. However, should the offender be working with an accomplice, the card could be turned over several times and even sold on the street. Finally, should the victim's driver's license and other identifying documents such as a health card with a Social Security number on it also be stolen, the basic elements for stealing an individual's identity are present.", "A January 2007 white paper by the computer security research company McAfee Avert Labs reports a dramatic increase in global identity theft trends. One key finding was that \"[p]ersonal data for tens of millions of people disappears each year. It's either been stolen or misplaced. Despite this disturbing trend, the number of complaints is surprisingly low, which leads us to believe the losses are not fully acknowledged.\"", "A California law that requires notice of security breaches to the affected individuals is the major reason for the increased awareness of these breaches.

'The threat of identity theft from data losses is being greatly exaggerated,' Fred H. Cate, the director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University in Bloomington, told this newspaper not long ago. 'And that's because a lot of people have fallen into the trap of equating data loss with identity theft.' Whether or not that is true is open to debate, but what all this data loss does represent, however, is the potential for identity theft\u2014one that will never go away. Sure, it's a game of odds. There is only so much a crook can do with a few hundred thousand names and Social Security numbers. But once they are out there, they are out there for good. Names don't change. Neither do Social Security numbers or dates of birth. And as long as it remains easy enough to fashion that trifecta into a car loan, a home, a credit card, work papers, that would seem to be a bit of a long-term problem.", "The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as the government entity charged with developing \"procedures to ... log and acknowledge the receipt of complaints by individuals,\" as well as educate and assist potential victims. The FTC compiles annual reports and charts of aggregated statistics on these events, but does not identify which corporations, organizations, or other entities have been victims of security breaches. In February 2007, FTC issued its annual report on fraud complaints consumers have filed with the agency. For the seventh year in a row, identity theft topped the list, accounting for 36% of the 674,354 complaints received between January 1 and December 31, 2006.

Based on the information reported in the first quarter of FY2007, US-CERT identified the following cybersecurity trends: phishing made up the bulk of security threats reported to US-CERT, accounting for almost 75% of all incidents handled. The number of reports grew by more than 500%, with just over 16,000 reports in FY2006 Q1, compared with over 103,000 in FY2007 Q1.

(A Chronicle of Higher Education article examines why this is so, noting that while colleges have become better at detecting electronic break-ins, security practices, particularly password protections, are lax. In addition, academic culture embraces the open exchange of information and provides a target-rich environment for data breaches\u2014an abundance of computer equipment filled with sensitive data and a pool of financially naive students. ) In September 2006, Louisiana State University (LSU), under a year-long agreement with Equifax Inc., provided students, faculty and staff members with free daily monitoring of their credit reports and $2,500 in identity-theft insurance. LSU claims this is the first agreement of its kind between a credit agency and a higher-education institution. The university will pay Equifax, Inc. $150,000. Other prevalent targets for identity theft are financial institutions (banks, credit card companies, securities companies, etc.), and government agencies (international, federal, state, and local). The AARP analyzed 244 publicly disclosed security breaches from January 1, 2005 through May 26, 2006, identified by the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). An examination of the most frequent cause of reported security breaches reveals that a third of all breaches were caused by hackers who broke into computer systems to gain access to sensitive personal information. The analysis finds that educational institutions are more likely than any other type of entity to report having had a security breach. In fact, educational institutions were more than twice as likely to report suffering a breach as any other type of entity. Physical theft of computers, computer equipment, or paper files is the next most common cause of security breaches, followed by improper display (allowing sensitive personal information to be viewed by those who should not have access (for example, printing of Social Security numbers on address labels, inadvertently making sensitive personal information accessible on Internet sites viewable by the general public, or not properly disposing of files containing sensitive personal information)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For Additional Reading", "paragraphs": ["CRS Report RS22374, Data Security: Federal and State Laws , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL33273, Data Security: Federal Legislative Approaches , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL34028, Identity Theft Laws: State Penalties and Remedies and Pending Federal Bills , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL33005, Information Brokers: Federal and State Laws , by Angie A.
