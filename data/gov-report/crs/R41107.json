Negotiated by the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union and its 27 member states, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and Switzerland, the ACTA is intended to build on the IPR protection and enforcement obligations set forth in the 1995 World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). It also is intended to address emerging IPR issues believed to be not addressed adequately in the TRIPS Agreement, such as IPR infringement in the digital environment. The ACTA, which was negotiated outside of the WTO, focuses primarily on trademark and copyright enforcement. It establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, which contains provisions on civil enforcement, border measures, criminal enforcement in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale, and enforcement in the digital environment for infringement of copyrights or related rights. It also provides for enhanced enforcement best practices and increased international cooperation.", "The ratification (\"formal approval\") of the ACTA is in a state of uncertainty, despite the fact that most negotiating parties (Australia, Canada, the EU and 22 of its member states, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States) have signed the proposed agreement. Following months of controversy over the ACTA in the EU, on July 4, 2012, the European Parliament voted against the ACTA, meaning that neither the EU nor its individual member states can join the agreement in its current form.

Policymakers face a challenge of finding an appropriate balance between protecting private rights and promoting broader economic and social welfare. The ACTA negotiation has spurred various policy debates. While governments involved in the negotiation and IPR-based industries have voiced strong support for the ACTA, other groups have expressed concern about the ACTA's potential impact on trade in legitimate goods, consumer privacy, the free flow of information, and public health.

Accordingly, the ACTA would not be subject to congressional approval, unless it were to require statutory changes to U.S. law. The USTR maintains that the ACTA is consistent with existing U.S. law and does not require the enactment of implementing legislation. It is not clear if the United States has a timetable for submitting a formal instrument of approval for the ACTA. The European Commission negotiated the ACTA on behalf of EU member states. In contrast to the United States, in order for ACTA to enter into force in the EU, the European Parliament and all 27 member states must sign and ratify the ACTA. On July 4, 2012, the European Parliament voted against the ACTA, meaning that neither the EU nor its individual member states can join the agreement in its current form. EU member states have been undertaking national ratification processes.

There is the possibility that the European Commission may try to revive the ACTA following the court ruling. Certain ACTA participants, such as the United States, EU, and Switzerland, claim that implementation of the ACTA will not require changes to their domestic legal systems. However, other countries may have to pass new laws in order to implement the enforcement standards of the ACTA, including granting ex-officio authority to customs officials to initiate criminal investigations in cases of trademark infringement and copyright piracy and providing legal remedies for circumventing technological protection measures (TPM). Some of the digital enforcement standards of the ACTA are contained in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty and Performance and Phonograms Treaty (\"WIPO Internet treaties\"). For example, on June 29, 2012, Canada finalized passage of a copyright bill, C-11, that incorporates the WIPO Internet treaties into Canadian domestic law, among other things. Canada signed the WIPO Internet Treaties in 1997, but had not entered the treaties into force. Previous copyright reform bills failed to advance before prior dissolutions of Parliament.

Adequate protection and enforcement of IPR are considered to play a key role in promoting innovation, which is viewed as an important source of the competitiveness of many industries in the United States and the other knowledge-based economies involved in the ACTA negotiations. Advocates of a strong international IPR regime claim that counterfeiting and piracy inflict billions of dollars of revenue and trade losses annually on legitimate IPR-based industries.", "While the United States and other participants to the ACTA claim that the magnitude of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods and the associated economic losses are substantial, it is difficult to quantify these assertions. The very nature of IPR infringement\u2014secretive and illicit\u2014makes it difficult to track production and trade in counterfeit and pirated goods. Compared to infringement of \"tangible\" goods, infringement of digital media may be even more difficult to track, as such goods increasingly are disseminated by the Internet, further complicating data collection efforts. In some cases, companies may be reluctant to release information about IPR infringement problems that they face with their branded products, out of concern that such public information may affect the marketing of their products. ", "On the opposing side, some question the commercial rationale for the ACTA. Some observers point out that many of the estimates for losses associated with IPR infringement are generated by industry groups, which may have self-interested motivations. Some analysts question the proposition that sales of pirated goods translate directly into revenue losses for legitimate firms. For example, some consumers who purchase an IPR-infringing product may not be able or willing to purchase the legitimate version of the product at the market price offered absent IPR infringement. In addition, some advocates of civil liberties assert that government discussions about ACTA may not be fully evaluating the economic and commercial benefits of exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights, such as \"fair use\" exceptions in U.S. copyright law. ", "Moreover, some public interest groups argue that IPR protection and enforcement have tilted disproportionately in favor of private rights at the expense of broader economic and social welfare.

In contrast, some public health advocates maintain that there has been a conflation of counterfeiting of goods with the health threats posed by those goods. It is conceivable that a medicine can be legitimate, not be infringing on an IPR, and still pose health and safety threats if it is substandard. Conversely, it also is conceivable that a medicine can be counterfeit\u2014for instance, violating a trademark\u2014and not pose health and safety threats.

As a result, when the agreement was proposed initially, many observers believed that it would focus primarily on combating trade of fake medicines, toys, auto parts, computer parts, and the like. However, as ACTA negotiations progressed, the scope of IPR in the agreement broadened from beyond traditional notions of \"counterfeiting,\" to also include piracy.

For example, the European Union reportedly advocated for the inclusion of patents in the civil enforcement section. The EU argued that exclusion of patents from civil remedies would limit the extent to which certain industries, such as the automotive, machinery, pharmaceutical, and agro-chemical industries, may be able to take advantage of the ACTA. The United States opposed the inclusion of patents in the civil enforcement section; some have speculated that the opposition was due to a concern that the inclusion would contradict U.S. patent law. The final ACTA text includes a footnote to the civil enforcement section which states, \"A Party may exclude patents and protection of undisclosed information from the scope of this Section.\" Given this exemption, it remains to be seen which countries exclude patents from the scope of their civil enforcement. The United States has said that its implementation of the ACTA would exclude patents.", "As another example, the EU and the United States also took differing positions regarding the inclusion of trademarks in the digital enforcement section of the ACTA. The EU supported the inclusion of trademarks, along with copyrights, in the scope of the digital enforcement section, expressing concern about the volume of Internet sales of goods infringing on European trademarks. In contrast, the United States opposed the inclusion of trademarks in this section; some have speculated that the opposition was due to a concern that the inclusion would contradict U.S. law. For instance, some U.S. stakeholders argued that inclusion of trademarks in this section would go beyond the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which focuses only on copyright piracy. The digital enforcement section of the final ACTA text largely excludes trademark counterfeiting, focusing primarily instead on infringement of copyright or related rights over digital networks. However, it does include a provision stating that a Party may provide its competent authorities with the authority to order an online service provider to disclose information to a right holder sufficient to identify a subscriber whose account was allegedly used for trademark or copyright infringement and where such information is being sought to protect or enforce those IPR.

Among some groups, there is a perception that the ACTA negotiation lacked sufficient public transparency and meaningful public input. Some critics assert that the negotiating governments engaged in close consultation with right holders, including representatives of the entertainment, software, apparel, and pharmaceutical industries, but did not engage in extensive consultations with consumer and public interest groups. Some observers have commented that the level of secrecy in the ACTA negotiations was unprecedented, compared to other international trade negotiations. They point out that draft texts for other international trade treaties, such as the WTO TRIPS Agreement, were released during their respective negotiation. Some Members of Congress and a range of stakeholders have called on USTR to enhance the transparency of the ACTA negotiations. For instance, in a letter addressed to USTR, Senators Bernard Sanders and Sherrod Brown called on USTR to allow the public to review and comment on substantive proposals for the proposed ACTA. ", "During the early negotiating rounds, USTR refrained from publicly circulating draft text of the ACTA, citing security reasons. U.S. Trade Representative Kirk has defended the ACTA negotiation process, maintaining: ", "As is customary during negotiations among representatives of sovereign states, the negotiators agreed that they would not disclose proposals or negotiating texts to the public at large, particularly at earlier stages of the negotiation. This is done to allow participants to exchange views in confidence, facilitating the negotiation and compromise that are necessary to reach agreement on complex issues.", "USTR reportedly shared a draft of the digital enforcement chapter with cleared advisors in the USTR formal trade advisory system and selected industry and public interest groups, who were required to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to view the negotiating text. Moreover, the ACTA negotiation process became more transparent as the negotiation advanced. USTR publicly released a summary of key elements under discussion in November 2009, following the 6 th round of negotiations; a draft text in April 2010, following the 8 th round of negotiations; a consolidated text in October 2010, following the 11 th and final round of negotiations; a finalized text on November 15, 2010, subject to legal verification; and a final text in May 2011. As additional examples of increasing transparency, USTR pointed to a number of steps it took in 2009, including establishing a dedicated ACTA web page on the USTR website; releasing a public summary of issues under negotiation; and releasing public agendas on the ACTA web page prior to each negotiating round. ", "USTR also contends that it consulted sufficiently with Congress and outside stakeholders. It has stated that the ACTA is the \"product of close collaboration between the Administration and Congress as well as intensive consultations with U.S. industry and nongovernmental organizations.\" In terms of congressional consultation, USTR has pointed to ACTA-related meetings and conference calls it has held with congressional staff and Members to provide updates on ACTA developments and to solicit views to ensure that the ACTA reflects congressional perspectives. In terms of consulting with other stakeholders, USTR has noted it solicited advice from a broad range of experts, including representatives of right holders, Internet intermediaries, and non-government organizations. Additionally, it issued a Federal Registrar notice in February 2008 requesting public comments on the ACTA and subsequently invited stakeholders to a public meeting that it would hold, in conjunction with the Department of Commerce, to discuss the ACTA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Range of Participants", "paragraphs": ["The range of participants included in the ACTA negotiation was subject to controversy. One element of debate was the absence of developing country participation. Some groups are critical that the ACTA was negotiated as a plurilateral agreement primarily among largely advanced industrialized countries. Some developing country advocates express concern that the ACTA negotiation did not sufficiently take into account the interests, views, and needs of developing countries. For instance, during WTO TRIPS Council meetings, China and India have stated that the ACTA, among other things, could weaken the balance of rights, obligations, and flexibilities that have been negotiated in WTO agreements; create barriers to trade; constrain flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, such as for public health and trade in generic medicines; limit government's freedom to allocate resources for IPR by compelling them to focus on enforcement; and lead to the incorporation of ACTA standards in future regional and other agreements. Other developing countries not party to the ACTA negotiation also have espoused similar views.", "The selection of certain countries as participants in the ACTA has been another element of debate. Some observers have questioned why countries designated in the USTR's Special 301 report for having inadequate IPR protection and environment are involved in the ACTA. The 2012 Special 301 Report included Canada on the Priority Watch List, and Mexico and certain European Union members (Finland and Romania) on the Watch List. According to the USTR, participation in the ACTA may help countries identified in the Special 301 report to attain their goals of enhancing IPR enforcement. At the same, some observers also have questioned the effectiveness of an agreement that does not include countries like China and Russia (both designated in the Special 301 Report), which are considered to be major sources of counterfeiting and piracy.", "ACTA negotiation parties have discussed expanding the ACTA to include other interested countries in the future. The final text of the agreement includes accession terms, stating that after the May 1, 2011-May 1, 2013, signatory period for parties to the ACTA negotiation, any member of the WTO may apply to accede to the agreement. The ACTA Committee, which oversees the agreement and accession of new members, is to decide upon the terms of accession for each applicant. USTR has expressed hope that other countries will join the ACTA over time, \"reflecting the growing international consensus on the need for strong IPR enforcement.\" However, some critics speculate that developing countries would be invited to join the ACTA at a point when the agreement has largely been \"locked-in\" and when significant changes could not be introduced. Some groups voice concern that developing countries will feel pressured to adhere to the ACTA in order to obtain trade benefits from ACTA participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact on Legitimate Trade and Consumer Activity", "paragraphs": ["The ACTA negotiation has generated debate about the potential impact of increasing IPR protection and enforcement standards on legitimate trade and consumer activities. This speaks to a long-standing broader debate about the perceived trade-off between the protection of IPR and the facilitation of trade. IPR-based industries have voiced strong support for the ACTA, contending that its enhanced standards will contribute to greater economic growth and employment. Other stakeholders, including some consumer rights, public health, and civil liberty groups, contend that ACTA provisions may interfere with trade in legitimate goods and consumer activity. Negotiating parties maintain that the ACTA respects the WTO Doha Declaration on Public Health, is not intended to interfere with citizens' fundamental rights or undermine civil liberties, and contains safeguards to protect against creating barriers to legitimate trade. Following the 9 th round of negotiation, USTR released a statement saying:", "ACTA will not interfere with a signatory's ability to respect fundamental rights and liberties. ACTA will be consistent with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Participants reiterated that ACTA will not hinder the cross-border transit of legitimate generic medicines, and reaffirmed that patents will not be covered in the Section on Border Measures. ACTA will not oblige border authorities to search travelers' baggage or their personal electronic devices for infringing materials.", "One flashpoint in the debate has been the ACTA's potential impact on consumer privacy and the free flow of information. For example, some critics charge that digital enforcement provisions of the ACTA would require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to terminate customers' Internet accounts after repeated allegations of copyright infringement, a provision akin to a \"three-strikes\" law introduced by the French government. Such provisions reportedly have been controversial in the European Union, where some members of Parliament consider Internet access to be a fundamental human right that should only be terminated by judges. While many IPR-based industries argue that increasing ISP involvement in IPR enforcement is critical to combating online piracy, critics contend that requiring ISPs to filter communication places undue burdens on ISPs. Some civil liberties groups have expressed concern about what they perceive as a low threshold for terminating consumers' Internet access; they assert that proof of online piracy, not allegations, should be the requirement for termination of Internet accounts. ", "In recent months, the debate about ISP obligations related to IPR infringement has been heightened by legislation introduced in the 112 th Congress\u2014the Prevent Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP Act, S. 968 ) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA, H.R. 3261 )\u2014to address online piracy, which include some provisions similar to the ACTA. Following opposition by civil society groups and several Internet-based companies, congressional consideration of these bills has been postponed.", "In addition, some commentators have been concerned with the extent to which U.S. \"fair use\" practices would be maintained under an agreement. There has been speculation about potential ACTA provisions on providing remedies against circumvention of technological protection measures (TPM) used by right owners to prevent the use of their copyrighted works in unwanted ways. Such provisions may have implications for the free flow of information. ", "The final ACTA text does not include provisions similar to a \"three-strikes\" rule, or similar \"notice-and-takedown\" rules. Rather, the final text requires ACTA participants to give their competent authorities the ability to order ISPs to disclose expeditiously to a right holder sufficient information to identify a subscriber whose account was allegedly used for infringement. The ACTA does contain provisions on TPM. However, the ACTA text broadly states that the digital enforcement procedures \"shall be implemented in a manner that avoids the creation of barriers to legitimate activity, including electronic commerce, and consistent with that Party's law, preserves fundamental principals such as freedom of express, fair process, and privacy.\" ", "Another flashpoint has been concerns that the ACTA could undermine trade in legitimate goods. One prominent aspect of this debate are border enforcement provisions in the ACTA under which governments may give customs officials ex-officio authority to seize and detain goods suspected of infringing IPR. Some countries that are participants to the ACTA negotiation currently do not empower their customs officials with such ex-officio authority. Others grant this authority in limited cases. In the United States, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is authorized to make determinations that goods violate copyrights and trademarks and seize such goods. However, the CBP is not authorized to make determinations of patent violations. In the case of patents, CBP enforces exclusion and cease-and-desist orders issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against patent-infringing goods.", "Many business groups assert that granting customs officials ex-officio authority is critical to preventing the flow of counterfeit and pirated goods across borders. This would ensure that customs officials can engage in more proactive efforts to combat trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy, without having to wait for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder. Some critics, such as public interest and civil liberties groups, assert that such measures would impose unnecessary or burdensome delays on the movement of goods across borders, raise the costs of trade, and result in undue impediments of personal travel. ", "The ACTA negotiation included discussion of whether or not to include patents in the border enforcement section, which led to concerns that the ACTA could undermine legitimate trade in generic medicines and public health. As patent inclusion was debated, some public health advocates expressed concern that empowering customs authorities to make determinations about patent violations could lead to the prevention or delay of exports and imports of legitimate generic drugs. For instance, some groups contended that the ACTA may \"interfere with legitimate parallel trade in goods, including the resale of brand-name pharmaceutical products.\" They point to recent seizures in Europe of legitimate generic medicines in-transit based on industry concerns of counterfeiting. ", "In the end, the border enforcement section of the ACTA's final text specifically states in a footnote that patents and the protection of undisclosed information are excluded from the scope of that section. Thus, the border enforcement section applies to other forms of IPR, such as trademarks and copyrights. The applicability of trademarks to the border enforcement section has continued to raise concerns among some public health advocates about access to medicines, such as generic medicines. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Negotiation of ACTA as Stand-Alone Agreement", "paragraphs": ["The ACTA was negotiated as a stand-alone agreement outside of the WTO, WIPO, and other multilateral institutions involved in international IPR protection and enforcement. This approach to the ACTA has generated debate. On the one hand, advocates suggest that negotiating the ACTA outside of existing multilateral frameworks allowed the United States and other like-minded countries to advance global IPR protection more efficiently and with greater flexibility. The advancement of trade negotiations in multilateral venues has stalled in recent years. For example, the WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiation is at a standstill over country differences on agricultural, industrial tariffs, and services. Meanwhile, WIPO members have not been able to reach an agreement on potential new elements for discussion on the WIPO global patent agenda. ACTA negotiating parties also assert that the ACTA is an innovative agreement that would not have fit under current multilateral frameworks. A fact sheet released by the USTR stated: \"We feel that having an agreement independent of a particular organization is an appropriate way to pursue this project among interested countries. We fully support the important work of the G8, WTO, and WIPO, all of which touch on IPR enforcement.\" On the other hand, some critics charge that the decision by ACTA participants to hold these negotiations outside of existing multilateral frameworks was intended to bypass the concerns of developing countries or other stakeholders representing various public interests.", "Some observers question the status of the ACTA in the long term: Would the ACTA continue to exist as a stand-alone agreement, or would the WTO or other international bodies incorporate the ACTA? Negotiating parties have expressed hope that the WTO may incorporate ACTA standards in the future. For example, Japanese trade officials have stated, \"We very much want to make ACTA a model for forming international rules within the WTO framework.\" Some speculate that if the ACTA becomes a part of the WTO, signing on to the ACTA could become a requirement for WTO accession.

They also maintain that the ACTA is intended to fill in the gaps between current legal frameworks and enforcement practices and emerging IPR infringement concerns, particularly in the case of IPR infringement in the digital environment. In addition, they argue that establishing a contingency of a sizeable group of countries that support stronger efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy could send a clear, powerful signal to the rest of the world about the importance of global IPR protection and apply pressure on countries where counterfeiting and piracy continue to be serious problems. A larger group of countries also may dispel the perception that the global advancement of IPR efforts is primarily a unilateral U.S. initiative. Since the advent of the TRIPS Agreement, the United States often has been perceived as a key champion of IPR. ", "Critics view the ACTA as potentially duplicative, arguing that the proposed elements of the ACTA suggest significant overlap with the WIPO Internet treaties and the WTO TRIPS Agreement. Some observers note that some countries have not fulfilled their obligations under these international frameworks completely. From this perspective, they question the effectiveness of pursuing new trade agreements and potentially directing greater financial or staff resources when mechanisms currently exist to address the issues, but are not being utilized effectively. ", "Still others question how much \"teeth\" an executive government-to-government agreement on IPR protection and enforcement can have if it does not increase legal protections. Some counter that, for many countries, IPR laws \"on the books\" are adequate, but shortcomings arise in enforcement of those laws. The ACTA, they argue, can play a critical role in addressing these gaps. Others point out that while the ACTA may not result in a statutory change in U.S. law, it could have a significant impact on the global protection of intellectual property by resulting in the need for other countries to change or enforce their laws.

Rationales cited for the ACTA include the commercial losses sustained by legitimate businesses from IPR infringement, as well as health and safety concerns associated with counterfeit and pirated products. Among these numerous concerns, what forms of infringement should be given priority if resources are limited? What implications does the proposed ACTA have for the allocation of federal funds? Would implementation of the ACTA require the appropriation of federal funds, even though changes in federal laws are not necessarily required?
