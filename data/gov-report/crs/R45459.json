In 1938, the FCIC was created to carry out the program, which focused on major crops like wheat in leading producing regions. During the same era, farm programs were established to support crop prices and boost farm income for producers of so-called program crops, including wheat, corn, and cotton. ", "The availability of federal crop insurance expanded with the passage of the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-365 ), which brought coverage to many more crops and regions of the country. To increase participation, Congress enhanced the crop insurance program in 1994 by raising subsidy levels and in 2000 by expanding geographic availability and again raising subsidy levels. The changes also expanded the role of the private sector in developing new products that would help farmers manage their risks. Today, many banks, when making operating loans, require that farmers purchase crop insurance. ", "The federal crop insurance program provides farmers with risk management tools to cope with yield and price declines. Under the program, farmers can purchase subsidized policies that pay indemnities when their production or revenue falls below a producer-selected coverage level. Insurance policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies. The insurance companies' losses are reinsured by USDA, and their administrative and operating costs are subsidized by the federal government. ", "In purchasing a crop insurance policy, a producer selects a level of coverage (i.e., deductible) and pays a portion of the premium that increases with higher coverage levels (or none of it in the case of catastrophic coverage). The federal government pays the rest of the premium (63%, on average, in 2017). ", "The federal crop insurance program offers two main levels of coverage: Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) and buy-up coverage: ", "1. CAT coverage insures against losses in excess of 50% of normal yield, equal to 55% of the estimated market price of the crop (called 50/55 coverage). The premium is 100% subsidized. Producers pay an administrative fee of $655 per crop per county. Limited-resource producers may have this fee waived. CAT coverage is not available on all types of policies. 2. Buy- up coverage allows producers to obtain coverage beyond the catastrophic level and pay a premium that is subsidized by the federal government. Buy-up provides for additional coverage up to 85% of production per acre and 100% of a specified market price established for each crop and region. The premium subsidy for these policies ranges from 38% to 67%. Producers pay an administrative fee of $30 per crop per county.", "The availability of crop insurance for a particular crop in a particular region is an administrative decision made by RMA. The decision is made on a crop-by-crop and county-by-county basis based on farmer demand for coverage and the level of risk associated with the crop in the region, among other factors. In areas where a policy is not available, farmers may request that RMA expand the program to their county. The process usually starts with a pilot program in order for RMA to gain experience and test the program components before it becomes more widely available. Alternatively, a policy can be reviewed and later discontinued if it fails to perform at an acceptable level (e.g., it experiences low participation or high losses). ", "RMA also regularly responds to requests from commodity organizations or industry representatives for enhancements to existing coverage, such as adding revenue coverage. RMA offers pilot programs with various types of coverage for new crops (particularly specialty crops) or that include new geographical areas. It uses the performance of these programs to inform its decision on whether to extend coverage permanently.

The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reauthorization Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-354 ) helped initiate efforts to expand federal crop insurance coverage for specialty crop producers. It amended the Federal Crop Insurance Act to require (among other things) additional data collection, reporting to facilitate the development of new crop insurance policies, tracking the progress of newly developed policies, and an expected timetable for expanding crop insurance coverage to include \"new and specialty crops.\" Since then RMA has submitted episodic reports to Congress tracking this progress. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) further emphasized increasing the availability of risk management tools for producers of crops with no individual policy coverage.

These laws authorized and extended other USDA programs that help facilitate the formulation of crop insurance policies for specialty crop producers, including market data collection programs. ", "The 2008 and 2014 farm bills further expanded provisions governing how RMA administers and implements Section 508(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, which governs new policy development, including how it is contracted out and funded, how policy ratings are undertaken, and how a policy may start as a pilot and may (or may not) evolve to a full-fledged insurance policy. Additional information on the Section 508(h) process is described in \" Development of New Policies and Section 508(h) .\"", "The 2014 farm bill also directed RMA to develop the WFRP insurance policy as part of an effort to provide additional options for crops that lack crop-specific policy coverage. WFRP policies insure revenue of the entire farm, rather than an individual crop, under a single insurance policy that is not limited to specialty crop production. The types of producers eligible for whole farm policies include direct-to-consumer marketers and producers of multiple agricultural commodities, including specialty crops, industrial crops, livestock, and aquaculture products. Coverage is also expanded for the value of packing, packaging, or any other similar on-farm activity. WFRP can be combined with other policies with buy-up coverage. WFRP does not offer CAT-level coverage and cannot be combined with CAT-level policies. WFRP is discussed further in \" Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) Insurance .\"", "Despite expansion of the federal crop insurance program, coverage for specialty crops remains below that for traditional crops in terms of individual crop policies and covered acres. Often insurers face technical difficulties in developing new policies such as price discovery, non-weather risks, and premium ratings. In some cases, USDA has not pursued policies for particular commodities because producers have expressed concerns that offering insurance could adversely affect the market (i.e., because an insurance policy reduces producer risk, farmers may plant more acreage, which could drive down prices and total crop revenue). This has been a particular concern for vegetable crops and explains in part lower levels of insured vegetable acreage compared with other crops.

", "A small market reduces sales incentive for companies selling insurance while contributing to higher per-unit costs for developing the product, training staff, modifying computer programs, and other activities. Small acreage also results in low market volume or the establishment of production contracts between producers and buyers. Crops grown and marketed in smaller quantities and/or targeting niche markets often command a price premium, resulting in often highly variable market prices, further complicating price discovery. Moreover, most specialty crops are intended primarily for sale in the higher-value fresh market versus the typically lower-value crops sold for further processing. Fresh product is highly perishable and non-storable, unlike the field crops that are more widely covered by federal crop insurance policies.", "In general, lack of reliable pricing data for crops not traded on commodity exchanges has been an ongoing challenge for USDA in the federal crop insurance program. RMA's price discovery for specialty crops largely relies on Agricultural Marketing Service, NASS, and other USDA agency data and academic and industry sources. In the absence of a well-developed cash market, such \"thin market\" conditions make it difficult to observe and forecast market prices. For example, in 2015 FCIC cancelled the Dry Bean Revenue Endorsement because USDA did not have sufficient market data from processors to establish a harvest price from which to calculate whether indemnities would be triggered under the endorsement. ", "Setting price guarantees correctly is critical for encouraging participation, the actuarial soundness of the program, and maintaining the overall market dynamics for the crop. If the insurance is priced (rated) too high, producers who tend to have few losses might decide against purchasing insurance, leaving only high-risk farmers in the pool (known as \"adverse selection\"). If the insurance is priced too low, premiums may not cover expected indemnities, potentially inflating the federal cost of the program by providing a greater premium and higher administrative and operating subsidies than was intended. Artificially low premiums might encourage additional crop production, further contributing to weak market prices, thereby adversely affecting financial returns for producers.", "Another challenge for insuring specialty crops is the diversity and multitude of crop varieties and production practices. Compared with field crops, specialty crops tend to have a wider variety of farming practices that depend on the crop variety, adding complexity to the policy and its development cost. For example, a vegetable crop may need to be grown on raised beds, use plastic, or have specific crop rotations. Various marketing claims made for products (such as that they are organic or other production or sustainability claims) can contribute to product complexity. Understanding how these factors affect potential yields is required for determining what practices can be insured and for developing and establishing underwriting standards. Variation across crops and variety within crop types also complicate the loss adjustment process (i.e., assessing the effect of weather on crop production).", "Finally, in some cases, USDA has reportedly not pursued policies for particular commodities because some producers have expressed concerns that offering insurance could adversely affect the market (i.e., because an insurance policy reduces producer risk, farmers may plant more acreage, which could drive down prices and total crop revenue). This has been a particular concern for producers of vegetable crops and explains in part lower levels of insured vegetable crop acreage compared with other crops.", "Producer interest in the availability of a new policy often starts at the local level and is channeled through RMA's regional offices. In general, for a policy to be viable, a crop must have established cultivars, defined farming practices, developed markets, and identified known perils. Significant producer interest (demand for the policy) is also critical. Perhaps more importantly, insurance policies are dependent on the availability of high quality data. High quality data , from an insurance standpoint, refers to data being timely (so that claims can be paid quickly), relevant (so the product offers reliable protection), audited to international reinsurance standards, and available over a sufficiently long time horizon (time series). Data availability and data quality often pose a challenge for crop insurance purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to Crop Insurance", "paragraphs": ["USDA offers several programs to help farmers recover financially from natural disasters, including droughts and floods. These programs help to provide assistance to producers of noninsured crops or crops with no current individual policy coverage, including some specialty crops. Other supplemental disaster programs further provide assistance to some specialty crop producers from tree losses and the loss of bee colonies. USDA also provides low-interest emergency loans and land rehabilitation assistance to help farmers return land to production following natural disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Among the issues that may arise if Congress continues to consider the role of the federal crop insurance options for specialty crop producers are:", "Availability of crop-specific policies . Crop-specific policies have not been developed for a number of specialty crops, including artichokes, asparagus, blackberries, boysenberries, broccoli, cantaloupes, carrots (fresh and for processing), cashews, cauliflower, chives, celery, dates, eggplants, garlic, guavas, hazelnuts, honeydews, kiwi fruit, lettuce, spinach, squash, tart cherries, watermelons, most leafy greens, most herbs and spices, some tropical plants, and most root crops. Private submitters proposing to develop new policies must present evidence of marketability to FCIC and RMA. Congress might consider whether there are opportunities for USDA to facilitate market research and publish market data to assist with the development of new policies and spur greater competition among private submitters. Development cost benchmarks . Section 11120 of P.L. 115-334 modifies the definition of reasonable research and development costs related to policies that have been approved by the FCIC board for reimbursement. Costs are to be deemed reasonable if based on (1) for employees or contractors, wage rates equal to not more than two times the Bureau of Labor Statistics hourly wage rates, plus benefits; and (2) other actual documented costs incurred by the applicant. That section also limits the FCIC board's review of user fees. Given that Congress reinstated RMA's authority to develop new products in the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ), Congress might inquire whether costs incurred for RMA-developed policies could provide a benchmark for the reasonableness of private sector requests for reimbursement of development costs. Limited participation in WFRP policies . WFRP is available in every county of every state. Its premium subsidies range from 55% to 80%, and coverage levels range from 50% to 85%. In crop year 2017 the average premium subsidy for WFRP was 70%, whereas the average premium subsidy across the entire crop insurance portfolio was 63%. That year WFRP policies accounted for about 3% of all federal crop insurance liabilities. Some speculate that part of the reason that WFRP participation is not higher is that producers are reluctant to provide tax return data. These policies require producers to provide five consecutive years of Schedule F from their federal tax forms. Given the benefits of risk pooling achieved by insuring a whole farm's revenue and the fraud prevention benefits from requiring tax returns to set historical revenue guarantees, Congress might consider whether there are efficiencies to be gained from incentivizing greater participation in WFRP. Determining a \" market price\" for commodities not sold on exchanges . Lack of reliable pricing data for crops that are not traded on commodity exchanges has been an ongoing challenge for USDA in the federal crop insurance program. RMA's price discovery for specialty crops largely relies on Agricultural Marketing Service, NASS, and other USDA agency data and academic and industry sources. In the absence of a well-developed cash market, such \"thin market\" conditions make it difficult to observe and forecast market prices, which affects RMA's ability to set the appropriate level of price guarantees. Setting price guarantees correctly is critical to the actuarial soundness of the program and for maintaining overall market dynamics for the crop. Increased farm-level price data for commodities not sold on exchanges could also assist producers of those commodities in negotiating contracts and in their financial planning. Congress might consider whether there is a role for the federal government in supporting data collection of farm prices of commodities that are not sold on exchanges. Coverage of quality losses . Many crops are vulnerable to lower prices or to becoming unmarketable due to quality losses. Small markets for specialty crops that are not sold on commodity exchanges may be particularly price-sensitive to variations in quality (e.g., herbs and spices, certain fruits and vegetables, honey). Certain federal crop insurance policies cover some quality losses, but the range of such coverage is limited. Congress might consider (1) whether the current coverage for quality losses is available for all crops that are vulnerable to quality losses, (2) whether loss adjustment procedures for quality losses accurately assess the variations in quality and the effects on marketability and prices, and (3) whether the procedures for assessing quality losses properly balance cost efficiency and fraud prevention. Effect of ad h oc payments on demand for crop insurance . One of the stated policy goals of federal crop insurance has been to reduce the agricultural sector's reliance on supplemental or \"ad hoc\" disaster assistance payments. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it is difficult to assess whether this policy goal has been achieved. The 115 th Congress authorized ad hoc disaster assistance, and USDA has separately implemented a \"trade aid\" package, both of which apply to some specialty crops. Given the lower participation levels for certain specialty crop insurance policies as compared to non-specialty crops, Congress might consider whether repeated ad hoc payments in response to adverse events may have an effect on demand for federal crop insurance for crops generally and for specialty crops in particular."], "subsections": []}]}}
