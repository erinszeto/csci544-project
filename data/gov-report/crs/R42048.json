The INA allocates 140,000 visas annually for employment-based LPRs, which amount to roughly 14% of the total 1.0 million LPRs in FY2014. The INA further specifies that each year, countries are held to a numerical limit of 7% of the worldwide level of LPR admissions, known as per-country limits or country caps.", "Some employers assert that they continue to need the \"best and the brightest\" workers, regardless of their country of birth, to remain competitive in a worldwide market and to keep their firms in the United States.

The presumption is that many high-skilled people (proponents cite those from India and China, in particular) would then move closer to the head of the line to become LPRs.", "To explore this policy option, analyses of approved pending employment-based petitions are performed on two different sets of data: approved pending petitions with the Department of State (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC), and approved pending petitions with U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS). Because DOS and USCIS play different roles in the visa application process, their datasets represent different populations. DOS's data from the NVC contains individuals who apply for a visa while residing outside of the United States. They are considered new arrivals once they are issued a visa and enter the United States. USCIS's data contains individuals who are already residing in the United States and are applying to change their immigration status from a temporary status to a permanent LPR visa. This process is referred to as an adjustment of status.", "As of November 2015, there were 100,747 approved employment-based LPR petitions pending at the National Visa Center.

The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system (enacted after World War I) with per-country ceilings. The Immigration Act of 1990 was the last law to significantly revise the statutory provisions on employment-based permanent immigration to the United States.", "Currently, permanent immigrants (or LPRs) enter the United States based on a preference system. Nonimmigrants, who are admitted into the United States temporarily, are not admitted through this preference system. There are five preference categories for employment-based LPRs and each has its own eligibility requirements and numerical limitations, and at times different application processes. Per-country ceilings are an additional numerical limitation placed on permanent immigration in order to prevent any one country from taking too large of a share of the visas. ", "Interest has grown in the per-country ceilings, which limit the number of employment-based LPRs coming from specific countries each year. While no one is arguing for a return to the country-of-origin quota system that was the law from 1921 to 1965, some assert that the current numerical limits on employment-based LPRs are not working in the national interest. To inform this debate, this report analyzes the impact of the per-country ceilings on the employment-based immigration process.", "The Departments of State (DOS) and Homeland Security (DHS) each play key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of migrants.

DOS is responsible for the allocation, enumeration, and assignment of all visas. In addition, the Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for ensuring that employers seeking to hire employment-based LPRs are approved to do so. The prospective immigrant must maneuver this course through these federal departments and agencies to obtain LPR status.

The same analyses of approved pending employment-based petitions are performed on two different sets of data: approved pending petitions with the DOS National Visa Center; and approved pending petitions with USCIS, known by the petition number as the I-485 Inventory.

Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens as well as refugees and asylees who are adjusting to LPR status are exempt from direct numerical limits. As a result, roughly 1 million LPRs are admitted or adjusted annually.", "In addition to preference category numerical limitations, the INA specifies that each year countries are held to a numerical limit of 7% of the worldwide level of U.S. immigrant admissions, known as per-country limits or country caps. The actual number of immigrants that may be approved from a given country, however, is not a simple percentage calculation, as certain types of LPRs (such as immediate relatives) are exempt from the country caps.

The foreign labor certification program in the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for ensuring that foreign workers do not displace or adversely affect wages or working conditions of U.S. workers. Therefore, employers applying for foreign workers under the 2 nd and 3 rd preference categories must first get a foreign labor certification from DOL before filing a visa petition with USCIS.

The annual worldwide level for permanent immigration is 675,000 LPRs. For a dependent foreign state, the per-country ceiling is 2%. The per-country level is not a \"quota\" set aside for individual countries, as each country in the world could not receive 7% of the overall limit. As the State Department describes it, the per-country level \"is not an entitlement but a barrier against monopolization.\" ", "In addition to being a worldwide ceiling of 7% per country, the 7% per-country ceiling applies within the family-based preference system and did apply within the employment-based preference system prior to FY2001. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-313 ) enabled the per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants to be surpassed for individual countries that are oversubscribed as long as visas are available within the worldwide limit for employment-based preferences.

Individuals must then wait for their priority date to become current before they can proceed to the next steps. ", "Once an individual's priority date becomes current, the next steps they take will depend on whether they are already in the United States or are abroad. If the prospective immigrant is already residing in the United States, the individual must apply for an adjustment of status (with Form I-485), which involves the individual, who is currently in the country, switching from a temporary category (e.g., an individual with an F-1 student temporary visa) to a permanent category. USCIS handles the processing of applications for adjustment of status. ", "If the prospective LPR does not have legal residence status in the United States or is living abroad, the National Visa Center will handle the processing of the petition and will then forward the petition to the DOS Bureau of Consular Affairs in the applicant's home country. Regardless of whether the potential LPR is adjusting status with USCIS in the United States or obtaining a visa abroad from Consular Affairs, DOS assigns the visa priority dates and allocates the visa numbers.", "Most foreign nationals who become LPRs were already living in the United States. For example, approximately 86% of employment-based LPRs adjusted to LPR status in FY2014 and only 14% arrived from abroad.

Data from DOS's NVC caseload of approved pending petitions reflects visa petitions that DOS has received and therefore excludes adjustment of status I-485 applications (processed by USCIS).
