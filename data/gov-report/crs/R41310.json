A PLA provides contractors with a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers at predictable costs for wages and benefits. PLAs prohibit strikes and lockouts. Because local unions are generally members of a national union, a union can recruit workers both locally and nationally. A large project is easier to manage if there is a PLA. Instead of dealing with several unions that may have different wages and benefits and whose contracts may have different expiration dates, contractors must deal with a single collective bargaining agreement. Because labor costs are predictable and because a PLA makes it easier to manage a large project, a PLA helps ensure that a project will be completed on time and on budget. A PLA may help train workers by requiring contactors to participate in apprenticeship and training programs. A PLA can improve worker safety by requiring contractors and workers to comply with project safety rules. A PLA can help ensure compliance with labor standards (e.g., wages and overtime) and workplace health and safety laws. ", "Opponents argue that PLAs have several disadvantages:", "PLAs can increase costs. Because a PLA sets standard labor costs, nonunion contractors cannot win bids based on lower costs. Nonunion contractors may choose not to bid on projects that are covered by a PLA, resulting in fewer bids and higher costs. PLAs can impede efficiency. If a PLA requires contractors to hire workers through a union hiring hall, contractors may not be able to use their own workers. Standard work rules can prevent contractors from managing the project in the most efficient manner. If a contractor is able to use his own workers, the workers may have to join a union and pay union dues. If a contractor has to pay into a union pension plan, the employees may not be on the project long enough to vest in the plan. Nonunion contractors may operate more efficient worker training programs. Instead of apprenticeship programs of a fixed duration, nonunion contractors can train workers for specific tasks. Evidence does not indicate that nonunion construction projects are less safe than union projects. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) enforces federal wage, overtime, and other labor standards and either the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or states with their own plans enforce workplace health and safety standards.

The Davis-Bacon Act requires employers to pay workers at least the locally prevailing wage and fringe benefits on construction projects of more than $2,000 to which the federal government is a party. Prevailing wages and fringe benefits are based on U.S. Department of Labor surveys of construction contractors, subcontractors, and building trades unions.

Thus, it may be difficult to measure the economic effects of PLAs if the characteristics of a project determine whether a PLA is used. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research", "paragraphs": ["This section summarizes the findings of research on the economic effects of PLAs. ", "In a 1998 report, GAO summarized three studies on the effect of PLAs on project costs. The first study was conducted by the Associated Builders and Contractors. The study concluded that PLAs raised bids by 26% on two New York state projects. In the second study, the New York Thruway Authority hired a consultant to negotiate a PLA for a project to refurbish the Tappan Zee Bridge. The consultant concluded that the PLA reduced the cost of the project by $6 million (or 4.6%). Instead of 19 local CBAs (each of which would have expired during the project), the PLA standardized the terms and conditions of the project. The third study involved construction at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, CA. An official from the laboratory provided GAO with documents that indicated that the project contractor estimated that the PLA lowered the cost of the project by about 0.4%. Most of the estimated savings were due to lower costs for overtime, shift differentials, and holiday pay, as well as the greater use of apprentices instead of higher-paid journeymen.", "More recent studies have reached different conclusions about the economic impact of PLAs. The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University in Boston has published a series of studies on the effects of PLAs. The studies conclude that PLAs raise the costs of construction. In a study of 62 school construction projects in the Boston area from 1995 to 2003, researchers at the institute concluded that PLAs raised the cost of construction by $16.51 per square foot (in constant 2001 dollars), or 12%. The study controlled for the size of construction (i.e., square feet) and whether the project was new construction or renovation. ", "The Beacon Hill Institute also published a study in 2004 of school construction projects in Connecticut. The study concluded that PLAs raised the cost of construction by $30.00 per square foot (in constant 2002 dollars), or 18%. The estimate controlled for the size of the project, whether the project was new construction or renovation, the number of stories, and whether the project was an elementary school. ", "On the other hand, a study of 70 new school construction projects in Massachusetts from 1996 to 2002 concluded that, after controlling for several characteristics of the projects, the relationship between PLAs and school construction costs was not statistically significant. The study found that projects with PLAs were larger and more expensive than projects that did not use PLAs. The authors concluded that their statistical model may not fully capture the relationship between construction costs and PLAs. If PLAs are more common on larger and more expensive projects, PLAs may not raise the costs of construction. Instead, the size and cost of a project may cause a contractor to use a PLA to take advantage of the benefits it may provide. ", "A study by the National University System Institute for Policy Research examined the effects of PLAs on the costs of school construction in California. The study collected information on 551 school construction projects, including 65 projects that used a PLA. The projects were built between 1996 and 2008 and were valued at $5 million or more. The study concluded that projects built using a PLA cost 13% to 15% more per square foot than projects not built with a PLA. But, 47 of the 67 projects built with a PLA were in the Los Angeles school district, where construction costs were higher. The overlap of high construction costs and the use of a PLA made it difficult to identify the unique contribution of PLAs to the costs of construction. ", "A study conducted for the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) concluded that the effect of PLAs on construction costs is strongly influenced by the degree of unionization in an area. In highly unionized cities, where most large construction projects use union workers, the study concluded that PLAs can have a beneficial effect. In these areas, a PLA can provide consistent wages and work rules. But, in cities with a low degree of unionization, PLAs can increase construction costs by 5% to 9%.", "Another study conducted for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs concluded that a PLA could raise the construction costs of a VA project in Pittsburgh, PA, by 3% to 5%.", "Qualitative research has been conducted on other aspects of PLAs. For instance, a group of researchers interviewed approximately 40 people experienced with PLAs to identify advantages and disadvantages of the agreements. Results from such a small sample may not be representative of all PLAs. Nevertheless, the researchers concluded that \"interviewees seemed most convinced that the greatest benefit of a PLA was in assuring timely completion of a project. Foremost, PLAs nearly guarantee a steady flow of qualified labor.\" One interviewee said, \"Anything above five to eight million dollars we will go to a project labor agreement because we find it a more effective management tool.... Basically it's the labor pool, the supply of labor, [and] the quality of the workmanship.\" Interviewees were also critical of PLAs, however. The main criticism was that PLAs can increase the bargaining power of construction unions. According to the study, in areas where a large share of jobs are covered by PLAs, construction unions may make greater demands during negotiations over new union contracts. If one union is successful, other unions may make similar demands. ", "In short, much of the research on the effect of PLAs on the costs of construction is inconclusive. In part, it can be difficult to find similar projects where some use a PLA and the others do not. Instead of comparing similar projects, economists use statistical models that attempt to control for differences in the characteristics of construction projects.
