The Supreme Court has yet to address this issue, and lower court decisions have varied in how they have approached the ADA and the Internet. Similarly, congressional action has been limited. The ADA was amended in 2008 to respond to a series of Supreme Court decisions that had interpreted the definition of disability narrowly but did not address the issue of Internet coverage. On April 22, 2010, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the ADA in the digital age.

The FCC released its plan on March 16, 2010. One of the recommendations in this plan stated: ", "The federal government should ensure the accessibility of digital content. The DOJ should amend its regulations to clarify the obligations of commercial establishments under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act with respect to commercial websites. The FCC should open a proceeding on the accessibility of video programming distributed over the Internet, the devices used to display such programming and related user interfaces, video programming guides and menus. Congress should consider clarifying the FCC's authority to adopt video description rules.", "The ADA contains various requirements depending on whether the discrimination prohibited is in the employment context (Title I), is related to the activities of state or local governments (Title II), or concerns public accommodations (Title III).

The court reasoned that", "[b]y including \"travel service\" among the list of services considered \"public accommodations,\" Congress clearly contemplated that \"service establishments\" include providers of services which do not require a person to physically enter an actual physical structure. Many travel services conduct business by telephone or correspondence without requiring their customers to enter an office in order to obtain their services. Likewise, one can easily imagine the existence of other service establishments conducting business by mail and phone without providing facilities for their customers to enter in order to utilize their services. It would be irrational to conclude that persons who enter an office to purchase services are protected by the ADA, but persons who purchase the same services over the telephone or by mail are not. Congress could not have intended such an absurd result.", "The First Circuit concluded that \"to exclude this broad category of businesses from the reach of Title III and limit the application of Title III to physical structures which persons must enter to obtain goods and services would run afoul of the purposes of the ADA.\" ", "The Seventh Circuit in Doe v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company agreed with the First Circuit. In Doe , Judge Posner discussed the nondiscrimination requirements of Title III in a case involving a cap on insurance policies for AIDS and AIDS-related complications and found that \"[t]he core meaning of this provision, plainly enough, is that the owner or operator of a store, hotel, restaurant, dentist's office, travel agency, theater, website, or other facility (whether in physical space or in electronic space) ... that is open to the public cannot exclude disabled persons from entering the facility and, once in, from using the facility in the same way that the nondisabled do.\" The court reasoned that \"the owner or operator of, say, a camera store can neither bar the door to the disabled nor let them in but then refuse to sell its cameras to them on the same terms as to other customers.\" However, Judge Posner found no violation of the ADA in this case and concluded that \"Section 302(a) does not require a seller to alter his product to make it equally valuable to the disabled and nondisabled.\"", "The Second Circuit joined the First and Seventh Circuits in finding that the ADA is not limited to physical access. The court in Pallozzi v. Allstate Life Insurance Co. , stated that \"Title III's mandate that the disabled be accorded 'full and equal enjoyment of goods, [and] services ... of any place of public accommodation,' suggests to us that the statute was meant to guarantee them more than mere physical access.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Accommodations Are Limited to Physical Structures", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the cases discussed above, the Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits appear to limit public accommodations to physical places.", "In Stoutenborough v.

The Sixth Circuit rejected this allegation, holding that Title III's prohibitions are restricted to places of public accommodations, not broadcasts. Similarly, in Parker v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. , the Sixth Circuit held that the ADA's nondiscrimination prohibition relating to public accommodations did not prohibit an employer from providing employees a disability plan that provided longer benefits for employees disabled by physical illness than those disabled by mental illness. In arriving at this holding, the Sixth Circuit found that \"a benefit plan offered by an employer is not a good offered by a place of public accommodation.... A public accommodation is a physical place.\"", "In Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp. and Weyer v. Twentieth Century F ox Film Corp ., the Third and Ninth Circuits also found that a public accommodation must be a physical place. As the Third Circuit in Ford stated, ", "[t]he plain meaning of Title III is that a public accommodation is a place.... This is in keeping with the host of examples of public accommodations provided by the ADA, all of which refer to places.... Since Ford received her disability benefits via her employment at Schering, she had no nexus to MetLife's 'insurance office' and thus was not discriminated against in connection with a public accommodation.

Southwest Airlines, Co ., where the district court held that the Southwest Airlines website was not a \"place of public accommodation\" and therefore was not covered by the ADA. In making this finding, the district court examined the ADA's statutory language, noting that all of the listed categories were concrete places, and that to expand the ADA to cover \"virtual\" spaces would be to create new rights. The Eleventh Circuit, however, in dismissing an appeal of the district court's decision, on other grounds, noted in dicta that that it was avoiding \"wading into the thicket of a circuit split on this issue\" of the application of Title III to Internet web sites, which was far from \"beyond any doubt.\"", "In a recent case, National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation , a district court within the Ninth Circuit took a more nuanced approach and denied Target's motion to dismiss allegations that inaccessibility of the retailer's website impeded the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services offered in the retailer's stores. The motion to dismiss was granted with respect to aspects of Target's website that offered information and services unconnected to the retailer's store. The district court noted that the purpose of the ADA was \"broader than mere physical access\" and that \"[t]o the extent defendant argues that plaintiffs' claims are not cognizable because they occur away from a 'place' of public accommodation, defendant's argument must fail.\" The court required, however, that there be a \"nexus\" between the Internet services and the physical place in order to present an actionable ADA claim. ", "The district court's use of the \"nexus\" approach to the ADA's applicability to the Internet would cover many places of business such as Target. However, stores such as Amazon.com that have no physical storefront may not be covered under such an approach. Because of this, the nexus approach has been criticized by the National Council on Disability:", "With the passage of time, as more and more goods, services, informational resources, recreation, communication, social and interactive activities of all kind migrate, wholly or partly, to the Net, maintenance of legal distinctions among otherwise similar Web sites, based on their connection or lack of connection to a physical facility, will become increasingly untenable and incoherent. Were there no nexus doctrine, and were all Web sites to be per se excluded from coverage, the law, however unjust, would at least be clear. But now that we see the direction in which the law, even in the hands of its most cautious interlocutors, is moving, the effort to define what is a sufficient nexus and to determine whether it exists in each particular case will surely continue. Use of the nexus approach, preferable as it may be to civil rights advocates over an approach that categorically excludes the Web from coverage, may, however, result in far more havoc than even the most sweeping and inclusive requirement for across-the-board commercial Web site accessibility ever could.", "The most recent reported judicial decision on the ADA's application to the Internet is Young v. Facebook, Inc. , where a plaintiff suffering from bipolar disorder alleged that the social networking website unlawfully discriminated against her by failing to provide reasonable customer services to assist individuals with mental disabilities. In that case, the federal district court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's controlling authority that \"places of public accommodation\" under the ADA are limited to actual physical spaces. The Young court observed that despite its frequent use of terms such as \"posts\" and \"walls,\" Facebook operates only in cyberspace and is thus not a place of public accommodation. The court also found that while Facebook's physical headquarters obviously occupies a physical space, it is not the place where the online services to which the plaintiff claimed she was denied access are offered to the public. Although the plaintiff argued that Facebook's services have a sufficient nexus to a physical place of public accommodation, as evidenced by its gift cards sold in retail stores, the court concluded that Facebook's Internet services do not have a nexus to these physical places of public accommodation because it does not own, lease, or operate these stores."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The law on whether and how the ADA applies to the Internet is unsettled.

The lower courts that have examined the issue, moreover, have split, creating additional uncertainty. Furthermore, the use of a \"nexus\" approach that a district court within the Ninth Circuit adopted in National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation , which requires a connection between the Internet services and the physical place in order to present an actionable ADA claim, would limit the ADA's application to online retailers.
