On September 8, the President announced that he was rescinding his certification of the proposed U.S.-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement. This action, in effect, withdrew the proposed agreement from further congressional consideration for the foreseeable future", "Under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), the text of such an agreement is to be submitted to the committees of jurisdiction for at least 30 days of consultation, and the agreement itself is then to be submitted to Congress for 60 days, during which the committees are to consider it and report recommendations. The AEA requires the President to state his approval of the agreement before the 60-day period begins, but he did so in his initial letter of submission, perhaps rendering moot the consultive purpose of the 30-day period.", "Such an agreement would go into effect unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted by the end of the 60-day period, which, the President's submittal stipulated, will immediately follow the 30-day period. Both periods are measured in \"days of continuous session,\" which includes all days except recesses of either house of more than three days, with \"continuity\" broken only by the sine die adjournment of a Congress. September 8, when the August recess is to end, is to be the 59th day of the full 90-day period, and the projected sine die adjournment on September 26 may be only the 77th day. A later sine die adjournment, a \"lame duck\" session, recall by the President or by congressional leadership, or the use of pro forma sessions instead of recesses could allow the 90th day to be reached within the 110th Congress. Otherwise, the agreement could not take effect until the end of a new disapproval period starting anew after the 111th Congress convenes in January, 2009.", "The AEA prescribes an expedited procedure for Senate consideration, including committee discharge, a non-debatable motion to proceed to consider, a 10-hour limit on consideration, and a prohibition on amendments. For the House, the Committee on Rules is invited to prescribe similar terms of consideration. A disapproval resolution was introduced in the House on May 14, and another, by committee leaders, as the AEA prescribes, at the start of the 60-day period on June 24. On the same date, Senate committee leaders introduced a resolution of approval. Although enactment of the approval resolution neither block nor hasten the effectiveness of the agreement, it could apparently be considered under the expedited procedure, and might thereby prevent expedited action on a disapproval resolution. Congress could also disapprove the agreement, or approve it with conditions, by enacting an alternative measure under its general rules. The President might likely veto any disapproval or conditional approval, in which case the agreement would go into effect unless Congress overrides the veto before the end of the disapproval period. Inasmuch as the President may take 10 days for his action, the timely enactment of a disapproval resolution may be feasible only if Congress initially passes it with more than 10 days remaining in the disapproval period.

The remainder of section 123. prescribes different regulations for congressional action depending on whether or not the agreement requires this exemption and on other features of its terms. As explained below, the procedural regulations applicable specifically to the proposed agreement with Russia depend principally on three features of the agreement: (1) it requires no exemption for failure to meet any of the nine requirements; (2) it includes provisions relating to \"large reactors;\" and (3) it covers only civil uses of atomic energy.", "Section 123.a. provides that if a proposed agreement requires no exemption, it may go into effect at a prescribed point unless Congress acts before then to disapprove it.", "Section 123.b. specifies that unless an agreement involves military-related uses of nuclear energy, the President is to submit its text to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for a period of \"not less than 30 days of continuous session\" for consultation. This submission is to be accompanied (for agreements like that with Russia) by an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) prepared by the Department of State.", "Section 123.d. directs that if the agreement involves large reactors, the President is to submit it, along with additional supporting documents, to Congress for a period of 60 \"days of continuous session.\" The supporting documents include (1) any classified annexes to the NPAS; and (2) a statement of the President's approval of the agreement and determination that it \"will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.\" The measure is to be referred to the same two committees as specified under section 123.b., which are, during this 60-day period, supposed to hold hearings on the proposal and report recommendations to their respective chambers.

If a committee of referral does not report a joint resolution with respect to the agreement within 45 days, it is automatically discharged from further consideration of the introduced resolution. For the Senate, section 130.i. provides that the joint resolution may be called up on a non-debatable motion, time for consideration is limited to 10 hours, and amendments are prohibited.

The submittal letter also stated that the classified annex would be submitted separately (and it appears, in fact, that the committees of jurisdiction had already received this annex on May 12).", "The inclusion of the unclassified NPAS met the requirements of the AEA to begin the 30-day period, and the inclusion of the President's \"approval and determination,\" together with the separate submission of the classified annex to the NPAS, met the requirements for the 60-day period to start. The President's letter of submittal, accordingly, stated that this submission \"shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123.b. and 123.d. of the Atomic Energy Act.\"", "The letter of submittal, nevertheless, also expressed an understanding that the two periods would not both commence immediately, but instead would occur consecutively. It went on to declare that the 60-day period shall commence \"upon completion of the 30-day period.\" Although it is unclear that the President can determine by declaration when the statutory periods start and end, these stipulations appear to conform to recent the past practice of both the President and Congress on agreements for nuclear cooperation.

Section 130.g.(2) stipulates that", "[F]or purposes of this section insofar as it applies to section 123 ... continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment of Congress sine die; and ... the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days are excluded in the computation of any period of time in which Congress is in continuous session.", "The effect of this provision is that (1) any period of continuous session terminates only with the final adjournment of the last session of a Congress; but (2) in determining the length of a period of continuous session, any day on which either house is in a recess of its session is not counted. This arrangement is apparently intended to prevent a situation in which an agreement would go into effect only because Congress was not in session, or did not remain in session long enough to act on a disapproval resolution.", "The definition established by section 130.g.(2) seems intended to correspond to the constitutional requirement that neither house may adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other. Congress may adjourn for more than three days either (1) by ending its annual session (an adjournment sine die ), or (2) by taking a recess within its annual session, such as the \"non-legislative periods,\" or \"state\" (or \"district\") work periods\" customarily scheduled, for example, around Memorial Day and Independence Day each year. In both cases, the two houses typically grant each other the required consent by adopting a concurrent resolution.", "Under the statutory definition, accordingly (1) continuity of session is broken just when Congress adjourns its last session pursuant to a concurrent resolution for a sine die adjournment; and (2) the count of \"days of continuous session\" pauses on exactly those days on which both houses, or either one of them, is not in session pursuant to a concurrent resolution for a recess of more than three days. On the other hand, a day on which either house, or both, is out of session for three consecutive days or fewer counts as a day of continuous session. If both houses adjourn from Friday to Tuesday, for example, not only the days each house is in session during the preceding and following week, but also the intervening three days of the extended weekend, count as days of continuous session.", "Under the definition of section 130.g.(2), accordingly, until the final sine die adjournment of the 110 th Congress, every calendar day, Saturdays and Sundays included, will count as a day of continuous session except those on which at least one house is out of session pursuant to a concurrent resolution providing for a recess of more than three days. Under the Constitution, however, the term of the 110 th Congress expires on January 3, 2009. At some point before then, as a result, the 110 th Congress must adjourn its last session sine die , or else it will automatically stand adjourned sine die at noon on January 3. As Under Secretary Rood affirmed in testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on June 12, this sine die adjournment will put an end to the existing period of continuous session. If Congress adjourns sine die without acting on the proposed agreement, and before 90 days of continuous session are completed, the agreement will not take effect until a new period of continuous session, beginning ab initio when the 111 th Congress convenes, has reached the requisite length.", "In colloquy with members of the Committee, Under Secretary Rood also expressed his understanding that the 90-day period was measured separately in each house and, for each house, included only the days on which that house was in session. On this understanding, for example, if the House were out of session on Thursday while the Senate met, and the Senate were out of session on Friday while the House met, one day of continuous session would be counted for each chamber. This interpretation appears to overlook that days of continuous session may occur even if one house is, or both houses are, out of session (as long as they are out of session for no more than three consecutive days). In addition, section 131.g. is not couched in terms of separate counts in each house, but explicitly refers to the continuous session of Congress as a whole. The language quoted at the outset of this section implies that a single count covers both houses, and states explicitly that when either house takes a recess (of more than three days), the count of days pauses until both houses are back in session. The estimates in the following sections follow this last interpretation of the quoted provision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Days of Continuous Session in the 110th Congress", "paragraphs": ["After President Bush submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia on May 13, 2008, Congress remained in continuous session, as defined by the AEA, until May 22, which amounted to nine days of continuous session. The House then entered a recess for Memorial Day, so that the count of days of continuous session paused. (A non-legislative period of the Senate occurred during the same week, but that body took no adjournment of more than three days, meeting instead in periodic pro forma sessions, which the recess resolution had authorized it to do.) On June 3, when the House reconvened, the count resumed, making that day the 10 th day of continuous session. As a result, June 23 was the 30 th day of continuous session and the last day of the 30-day period for consultation. In accordance with the declaration in the President's letter of submittal, June 24, being the 31 st day of the overall 90-day period, became the first day of the 60-day period for congressional action.", "For the Independence Day non-legislative period, both houses adjourned for more than three days, but the recess of the House extended from June 27 through July 7, whereas that of the Senate extended from July 1 through July 6. On this occasion again, as a result, it was the schedule of the House, which took the longer recess, that defined the period excluded from the count of days of continuous session. The last day of House session before the recess, June 26, was the 33 rd day of continuous session in the overall 90-day period, and the day of its return, July 8, became the 34 th day.", "No further recess of either house occurred until August 1, which accordingly represented the 58 th day of continuous session. Congress then entered a summer non-legislative period pursuant to H.Con.Res. 398 , which stipulated that both chambers reconvene on September 8. During this non-legislative period again, the Senate arranged to meet in periodic pro forma sessions, so that no adjournment of more than three days occurred in that chamber. The House, on the other hand, did not schedule any pro forma sessions in the intervening period, so that an adjournment of more than three days did occur there. Inasmuch as one house was taking an adjournment of more than three days, the count of days of continuous session paused during this period. Unless both Houses return before then pursuant to either the contingent reassembly provisions of H.Con.Res. 398 or a call by the President, September 8 will be the 59 th day of continuous session.", "Any further projection of days of continuous session is dependent on assumptions about subsequent recesses and an adjournment sine die. The schedules previously announced by the majority party leadership in each chamber project no further recesses during the present session. The House schedule projects adjournment sine die on September 26, 2008; the Senate schedule includes no projection for this event. If the chambers follow these schedules, it appears that September 26, 2008 will be the 77 th day of continuous session. Accordingly, if Congress adjourns sine die on this date, continuity of session will be broken before the 90 th day is reached, and the proposed agreement with Russia will not be able to take effect before the end of the 110 th Congress. A new period of continuous session will begin when the 111 th Congress convenes, and the agreement with Russia will be able to take effect under the AEA only at the conclusion of this new period of continuous session. If, on the other hand, Congress does not adjourn sine die on September 26, and neither house takes any further recess, the 90 th day of continuous session could be reached on October 9, and the agreement with Russia could accordingly take effect on that date.", "The ability of Congress to disapprove the proposed agreement depends not only on whether the two houses can complete their initial action on a resolution of disapproval before the prescribed period of continuous session expires. Section 123. of the AEA prescribes that the agreement can be disapproved only if the joint resolution of disapproval is actually enacted into law within the prescribed period. If the President vetoes a disapproval resolution, as a result, the agreement will go into effect unless both houses can complete action to override the veto within 90 days of continuous session after its submission. Inasmuch as the President has 10 days to act on a measure presented for his approval (Sundays excepted), Congress might, in practice, be unable to prevent an agreement from taking effect unless it completes its initial action on the disapproval resolution by about the 88 th day of continuous session.

First, Congress could adopt concurrent resolutions establishing additional recesses of its session, including a recess spanning the election, after which Congress would reconvene in a \"lame duck\" session. Second, Congress could be reconvened, either during a recess or after a sine die adjournment, either by its leadership or by pursuant to the constitutional authority of the President. Finally, through the use of periodic pro forma sessions in both houses, a scheduled recess period could be converted into a period of continuous session."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"Lame Duck\" Session", "paragraphs": ["In some recent election years, Congress did not adjourn sine die before the elections, but instead recessed its session in early autumn and reconvened after election day for what is called a \"lame duck session\" (more accurately, a \"lame duck\" portion of its regular session). The leadership of both houses is said to intend to avoid this practice in the 110 th Congress by concluding the business of the session, and adjourning sine die , before election day (November 4). If, however, Congress in the end takes a recess spanning the election, the occurrence of the 90 th day of continuous session will depend on the dates of recess and reconvening.", "For example, Congress might recess on September 26 and reconvene on November 12 (the day after Veterans' Day). Under these conditions, if September 26 had been the 77 th day of continuous session, the 90 th day could occur on the 13 th calendar day following the reconvening, which, in the case supposed, could be November 24 (the Monday preceding Thanksgiving).

If as many as 13 additional days of continuous session occurred as a result of this change, the 90 th day of continuous session counting from the May 13 submission could occur before the 110 th Congress adjourns sine die , in which case the agreement with Russia could take effect before the 111 th Congress convenes.", "Corresponding considerations could apply if the 110 th Congress were to adjourn sine die before the 90 th day of continuous session was reached, but were called back before the expiration of its term on January 3, 2009. Inasmuch as the term of the 111 th Congress would not yet have begun, the Congress that would reconvene would still be the 110 th Congress. The continuity of session as defined by section 130.g.(2) of the AEA would not have been broken, and the previous count of days of continuous session would presumably resume from the point at which it had left off. Under these conditions as well, the current period of continuous session might reach 90 days before the end of the 110 th Congress, and the proposed agreement with Russia could take effect.", "The way in which this continuity would be realized, however, would differ depending on whether Congress were called back by its own leadership or by the President. If Congress reconvened pursuant to the call of the leadership, the action would presumably vitiate the sine die character of the previous adjournment, and the 110 th Congress would presumably resume its present (second) session. If, on the other hand, Congress were reconvened by the President after a sine die adjournment, it would meet in a new session, which would be the third session of the 110 th Congress. Continuity of session would be maintained, in that case, because the sine die adjournment of the present session would cease to qualify as the sine die adjournment of the 110 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pro Forma Sessions", "paragraphs": ["Pro forma sessions are those held merely \"for the sake of form,\" or as a formality. Typically, no legislative business is conducted; on some occasions, the chamber provides in advance (usually by unanimous consent) that no business may occur. Pro forma sessions count as days of session for purposes of determining whether an adjournment of more than three days is occurring.", "The resolution authorizing the non-legislative period for George Washington's Birthday in 2008, for example, did not provide for a recess in the constitutional sense. Although the resolution covered essentially the period defined by the announced schedules, it did not provide for a recess of more than three days, but instead directed pro forma sessions of the House at least every fourth day, and authorized the Senate to arrange a similar schedule. Inasmuch as the Senate proceeded to exercise this authority, no \"adjournment of more than three days,\" as contemplated by the Constitution and section 130.g.(2) of the AEA, occurred in either house during this period. Instead, every day of the non-legislative period counted as a day of continuous session.", "At the July 12 hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Under Secretary Rood noted that days with pro forma sessions count as days of continuous session. He did not note that this will be true only if the other house also is not in recess. If both houses hold pro forma sessions at least every fourth day during a non-legislative period, no \"adjournment of more than three days\" occurs in either house. Nor did Under Secretary Rood explicitly note that under these conditions, not only the days of pro forma session themselves, but also the remaining days of the non-legislative period, will count not as days of recess, but as days of continuous session.", "It is possible that no pro forma sessions will be used in these ways to affect the length of continuous session of the current Congress. Days occurring during non-legislative periods will count as days of continuous session only if they are covered by periodic pro forma sessions in both chambers; if only one chamber holds pro forma sessions while the other takes a recess of more than three days, the days of the recess will still not count as days of continuous session. The resolution providing for the August 2008 non-legislative period, for example, authorized only the Senate to schedule pro forma sessions, and provided for a recess of the House in the constitutional sense. Pursuant to section 130.g.(2) of the AEA, inasmuch as one house has been in recess during this period, the days of this recess are excluded from the count of days of continuous session. Under these conditions, as already discussed, the date scheduled for sine die adjournment of the House will presumably arrive before the 90 th day of continuous session has been reached after submission of the agreement.", "If, on the other hand, both houses had determined to hold periodic pro forma sessions during the August non-legislative period, the 90 th day of continuous session could have occurred as early as Tuesday, September 2, 2008 (the day after Labor Day, and a date that would still fall within the non-legislative period).", "For some recent periods of pro forma sessions, including the August period, the Senate has sometimes provided that no legislative business occur in the pro forma sessions. If the 90 th day of continuous session were to fall within a session recess governed by such a provision, Congress could become unable to act on a joint resolution of disapproval in a timely fashion, and in the absence of that disapproval, the agreement with Russia would presumably take effect on the date specified. This difficulty, however, might be overcome by use of the authority of the leadership or the President to reconvene Congress before the expiration of the recess. Being reconvened by either means would presumably supersede the order against conducting legislative business, and accordingly would enable Congress to consider a disapproval resolution rather than allow the agreement to enter into force by default."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Possible Need to Renew Action in the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["If the 110 th Congress adjourns sine die before the 90 th day of continuous session after May 13, 2008, the period during which Congress could act to disapprove the agreement will not yet have elapsed, and the agreement with Russia will be unable to take effect under the AEA at that point. Instead, a new period of continuous session will begin with the convening of the 111 th Congress in January 2009 (assuming the 110 th Congress is not reconvened for the requisite remaining period after its sine die adjournment). Until this new period of continuous session reaches the requisite length, the entering into effect of the agreement will be postponed, and the opportunity for Congress to disapprove it pursuant to the AEA will remain available.", "The AEA does not explicitly provide whether failure of the 110 th Congress to complete the periods required under section 123. would necessitate starting from the beginning, in the 111 th Congress, of the entire approval process or of only such parts of it as the 110 th Congress did not complete. Inasmuch as the AEA makes provision for the process it prescribes to continue after a break in the continuity of session, it could be read as implying that the submission of an agreement triggers a single process of congressional action that may carry over into a subsequent Congress. The definition of \"continuous session\" in section 130.g.(2) seems expressly to contemplate that a new period of continuous session would begin automatically with the convening of the 111 th Congress.", "Rigorously applied, this view could imply that the 111 th Congress would not have to repeat statutory requirements that had already been accomplished in the 110 th Congress. For example, inasmuch as the President has already submitted the text of the agreement to the committees, made the required approval and determination, submitted the agreement itself to Congress, and submitted the NPAS and its classified annexes, he would not have to carry out these requirements anew in the 111 th Congress. It could be argued, as well, that inasmuch as 30 days of continuous session were completed during the 110 th Congress after the submission of the text on May 13, 2008, the 30-day consultation period required by section 123.b. would not have to repeated in the 111 th Congress. On this view, the first day of the 111 th Congress could be construed as the beginning of the 60-day period prescribed by section 123.d. for congressional action on the agreement and, accordingly, as the day on which new joint resolutions of disapproval should automatically be introduced. Further, by this interpretation, if no joint resolution of disapproval were to be enacted by the end of the 60 th day of continuous session of the 111 th Congress, the agreement would automatically go into effect.", "At the June 12 hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, Under Secretary Rood took the position that, if the full period of 90 days of continuous session is not completed within the 110 th Congress, the entire period must begin de novo in the 111 th Congress. Under this interpretation, it might also be held necessary for the President to resubmit the agreement itself to Congress in the new session, in the way provided in the AEA. Absent this resubmittal, it could be argued, no date could be fixed at which the disapproval resolution would be automatically introduced. Although no established guidance or previous proceedings appear to settle this point definitively, there are indications that both houses would be likely to pursue this interpretation of the act.", "Under this interpretation of the AEA, and if the statutory requirements are implemented in the 111 th Congress in the same way as the 110 th , the Presidential resubmission of the agreement with Russia would presumably have to be accompanied by the requisite unclassified NPAS and its classified annexes, as well as the approval and determination of the President. The committees to which the text of the agreement is submitted would presumably be intended to engage in consultations with the executive on the agreement during the 30 days of continuous session following submission.

As a result, legislative days are likely to elapse more slowly than days of continuous session, which, except during recess periods, include all calendar days.

During the non-legislative period, however, the Senate is operating under a unanimous consent order for periodic pro forma sessions, during which no legislative business is to occur. This order against legislative business might be held to preclude the discharge from occurring until the Senate returns for business on September 8.

Pursuant to this expedited procedure, the joint resolution of disapproval is privileged, meaning that the Senate may take it up by approving a non-debatable motion to proceed to consider. ISAAECA also limits debate on the resolution itself to 10 hours (equally divided and controlled by the two floor leaders or their designees), and precludes any amendment (or motion to recommit).
