Historically, the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law has been construed to be limited to certain criminal provisions of the INA that also fall under state and local jurisdictions; by contrast, the enforcement of the civil provisions, which includes apprehension and removal of deportable aliens, has strictly been viewed as a federal responsibility, with states playing an incidental supporting role. In previous Congresses, several proposals had been set forth that would appear to expand the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the civil enforcement aspects of the INA.", "Congress, through various amendments to the INA, has gradually broadened the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law, and some recent statutes have begun to carve out possible state roles in the enforcement of civil matters. Indeed, several jurisdictions have signed agreements (INA \u00a7287(g)) with the federal government to allow their respective state and local law enforcement agencies to perform new, limited duties relating to immigration law enforcement. Still, the enforcement of immigration laws by state and local officials has sparked debate among many who question what the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials should be in enforcing such laws. For example, many have expressed concern over proper training, finite resources at the local level, possible civil rights violations, and the overall impact on communities. Some communities have taken steps to define or limit the involvement of local authorities in the implementation of immigration law.", "This report examines some of the policy and legal issues that may accompany an increased role of state and local law officials in the enforcement of immigration law.

But beyond enforcing the laws or ordinances of their state or locality, state and local officials may also have the authority to enforce some federal laws, especially criminal laws. Immigration law provides for both criminal punishments (e.g., for alien smuggling, which is prosecuted in the courts) and civil violations (e.g., lack of legal status, which may lead to removal through a separate administrative system). States and localities have traditionally only been permitted to directly enforce certain criminal provisions that fall under their jurisdictions, whereas the enforcement of the civil provisions has been viewed as a federal responsibility with states playing an incidental supporting role.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71101 et seq .) currently provides limited avenues for state enforcement of both its civil and criminal provisions. In previous Congresses, several proposals had been introduced, however, that would appear to expand the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the civil regulatory aspects of immigration law (i.e., identifying and detaining deportable aliens for purposes of removal). Adding the enforcement of civil immigration law to the role of state and local law enforcement could, in essence, involve the agencies in a seemingly unfamiliar mission. This potential expansion has prompted many to examine the legal authority by which state and local law enforcement agencies may enforce immigration law, particularly the civil enforcement measures.", "This report examines the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration law.

Nonetheless, after the attacks of September 11, attention refocused on the adequacy of interior immigration enforcement, especially the perceived lack of federal resources. Prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the INS had fewer than 2,000 immigration agents to enforce immigration laws within the United States. With the merger of the interior enforcement function of the former INS with the investigative arm of the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) into DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the number of interior agents have increased.", "In spite of the increase in interior enforcement agents, many continue to believe that the number is still insufficient. Moreover, although the consolidation increased the number of interior enforcement agents, they now have multiple missions, which include enforcing immigration law in the interior of the United States, stemming the flow of illicit drugs, and deterring money laundering, among other things.", "Currently, there are express provisions in federal law that provide state and local law enforcement the authority to assist federal officers with the enforcement of immigration law under certain circumstances.

This practice allows state and local law enforcement officers to play an indirect role that is incidental to their general criminal enforcement authority.", "For example, when state or local officers question the immigration status of someone they have detained for a state or local violation, they may contact an ICE agent at the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC). The federal agent may then place a detainer on the suspect, requesting the state official to keep the suspect in custody until a determination can be made as to the suspect's immigration status. However, the continued detention of such a suspect beyond the needs of local law enforcement designed to aid in the enforcement of federal immigration laws may be unlawful.", "Indirect state participation by means of immigration detainers is not without controversy. Many have alleged such abuses as state detentions premised on immigrant status alone and custodial arrests for traffic violations or similar offenses as pretexts for verifying an individual's status with immigration authorities. Past allegations of abuse at times have led to states and localities entering into consent decrees that strictly limit their role in the enforcement of immigration law. On the other hand, some localities have been concerned that an active role in enforcing immigration law may stretch resources and hinder community cooperation in curbing criminal activity.

To implement its plenary power, Congress has enacted and amended the INA\u2014a comprehensive set of rules for legal immigration, naturalization, deportation, and enforcement. Concomitant to its exclusive power to determine which aliens may enter and which may stay, the federal government also has power to proscribe activities that subvert these rules (e.g., alien smuggling) and to set criminal or civil penalties for those who undertake these activities.", "In examining the INA, it is crucial to distinguish the civil from criminal violations. Mere illegal presence in the U.S. is a civil , not criminal, violation of the INA, and subsequent deportation and associated administrative processes are civil proceedings. For instance, a lawfully admitted non-immigrant alien may become deportable under civil provisions if his visitor's visa expires or if his student status changes. Criminal violations of the INA, on the other hand, include felonies and misdemeanors and are prosecuted in the federal courts. These types of violations include, for example, 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324, which addresses the bringing in and harboring of certain undocumented aliens; \u00a71325(a), which addresses the illegal entry of aliens; and \u00a71326, which penalizes the reentry of aliens previously excluded or deported.", "Congress also has exclusive authority to prescribe procedures for determining who may enter or stay and the right of aliens in these proceedings, subject to the individual rights all aliens in the United States enjoy under the Constitution. However, exclusive authority to prescribe the rules on immigration does not necessarily imply exclusive authority to enforce those rules. While enforcement standards and procedures may differ between the criminal and civil aspects of immigration law, Congress may authorize the states to assist in enforcing both, and state officers may exercise this authority to the degree permitted under federal and state law. There is a notion, however\u2014one being more frequently articulated by the federal courts and the Executive branch\u2014that states have \"inherent\" authority to enforce at least the federal criminal law related to immigration. This inherent authority position is now apparently beginning to be expressed with regard to the enforcement of the civil aspects of immigration law as well. State enforcement, nonetheless, must always be consistent with federal authority.", "Even assuming states have some inherent authority to enforce immigration law, federal law preempts inconsistent state law where concurrent jurisdiction exists. Congress' power to preempt state law arises from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which provides that \"the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" Congressional intent is paramount in preemption analysis; accordingly, a court must determine whether Congress expressly or implicitly intended to preempt state or local action. Generally, a court will determine that Congress intended to preempt a state regulation or enforcement when (1) Congress expresses preemptive intent in \"explicit statutory language,\" (2) when a state entity regulates \"in a field that Congress intended the Federal Government to occupy exclusively,\" or (3) when a state entity's activity \"actually conflicts with federal law.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Involvement in the Enforcement of Immigration Law", "paragraphs": ["Setting the rules on the entry and removal of aliens is unquestionably an exclusive federal power and some would argue that uniformity in enforcing those rules is critical to the exercise of sovereign authority (i.e., it should not be enforced by states). Accordingly, it has been suggested that state involvement in immigration law should be strictly limited to express congressional indication for such participation. On the other hand, Congress can not compel the states to enforce federal immigration law and to do so in a particular way.", "From the states' point of view, the federal government's exclusive power over immigration does not preempt every state activity affecting aliens. And it generally has been assumed that state and local officers may enforce the criminal provisions of the INA if state law permits them to do so but are precluded from directly enforcing the INA's civil provisions. This view may be changing, however.", "State enforcement of the criminal provisions of the INA is seen as being consistent with the state's police power to make arrests for criminal acts and the expectation that states are expected to cooperate in the enforcement of federal criminal laws. Civil immigration law enforcement, on the other hand, has generally been viewed as strictly a federal responsibility: The civil provisions of the INA have been assumed to constitute a pervasive and preemptive regulatory scheme\u2014leaving no room for a direct state or local role. The distinction between civil and criminal violations in the INA has been seen to suggest a bifurcated role for states and localities. For example, state and local law enforcement officers cannot arrest someone solely for illegal presence for the purpose of deporting them because it is a civil violation, but they can arrest someone for the criminal offense of entering the country illegally. To the degree that it is not preempted, the authority of state and local law enforcement officers to investigate and arrest for violations of federal law is determined by reference to state law. This may be done through express authorization in state law. However, this may not be necessary according to some recent decisions from the Tenth Circuit that appear to suggest that state and local law enforcement officers may possess \"inherent authority\" within their respective jurisdictions to investigate and make arrests for criminal immigration matters.", "The following sections briefly examine Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions that have examined immigration enforcement authority, analyze the major cases on the issue, and describe current provisions in law that authorize state and local involvement in the enforcement of immigration law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Legal Counsel Opinions", "paragraphs": ["Several Administrations have spoken on the scope of state and local involvement. For example, a 1978 press release during the Carter Administration stressed the need for cooperation and joint federal/state law enforcement operations, but placed much emphasis on the exclusive federal role to enforce civil immigration law and the special training required to do so. A 1983 statement issued by the Reagan Justice Department emphasized similar cooperative measures, but still made clear that only INS could make arrests for civil immigration violations and that state and local cooperation consisted primarily of notifying INS about, and detaining, suspected illegal aliens taken into police custody for state/local violations. In 1989, the Department of Justice, OLC opined that local police could enforce the criminal violations of the INA, but stated that it was \"unclear\" under current law whether local police could enforce non-criminal federal statutes. More recently, a 1996 OLC opinion concluded that state and local police did possess the authority to arrest aliens for criminal violations of the INA, but lacked recognized legal authority to enforce the civil provisions of immigration law.", "A shift in policy towards increasing the role and authority of local law enforcement officers in the field of immigration enforcement came following the terrorist attacks in September 2001. In December 2001 the INS reportedly began sending the names of thousands of noncitizens to the NCIC databases as part of the Absconder Apprehension Initiative. At a 2002 press conference, Attorney General Ashcroft confirmed the existence of a new OLC opinion that, among other things, expressed the department's view that state and local officials have \"inherent authority\" to enforce federal immigration law, including the civil enforcement provisions. According to the Attorney General:", "When federal, state and local law enforcement officers encounter an alien of national security concern who has been listed on the NCIC for violating immigration law, federal law permits them to arrest that person and transfer him to the custody of the INS. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has concluded that this narrow, limited mission that we are asking state and local police to undertake voluntarily\u2014arresting aliens who have violated criminal provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act or civil provisions that render an alien deportable, and who are listed on the NCIC\u2014is within the inherent authority of states. ( emphasis added)", "Initially, the Department of Justice did not release or publish the 2002 OLC opinion. Accordingly, several immigrant and public interest groups sought disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The department, however, claimed that the memorandum was exempt from disclosure under FOIA based on the deliberative process and attorney-client privileges. A lawsuit seeking the release of the 2002 OLC opinion was subsequently filed by the groups against the Department of Justice. In May of 2005, the Second Circuit granted the interest groups' FOIA request and mandated that the department release the 2002 OLC opinion. The department released the opinion in July of 2005 but was allowed to redact certain sections.", "The 2002 OLC opinion concludes that (1) states have inherent power, subject to federal preemption, to make arrests for violations of federal law; (2) the advice provided in the 1996 OLC opinion that federal law precludes state police from arresting aliens on the basis of civil deportability was mistaken; and (3) 8 U.S.C. \u00a71252c did not preempt state authority to arrest for federal violations. As to the first conclusion, the opinion focuses on the authority of states, as sovereign entities, to retain certain police powers under the Constitution, namely, the inherent authority to make arrests for a violation of federal law. With respect to the second conclusion, the 2002 opinion discredits much of the authority cited in the 1996 and 1989 opinions, takes into account case law not previously considered, and frames the preemption issue differently (from the earlier opinions). The analysis under the third conclusion examines the legislative history of \u00a71252c and a Tenth Circuit case to find a strong presumption against preemption.", "Critics have described the newly released opinion as \"deeply flawed\" and unsupported by legislative history or judicial precedent. It has been stated, for example, that (1) immigration has long been recognized as a distinctly federal concern; (2) federal law authorizes state and local enforcement of the immigration laws only in specific circumstances, not broadly; (3) the opinion does not address the significant distinction between criminal and non-criminal enforcement; and (4) the opinion could have implications far beyond the immigration context. It should also be recognized that although the 2002 OLC opinion describes a position in contrast to previous policy, it cannot compel state action nor does it carry the same weight as an act of Congress. Generally, interpretations contained in opinion letters are not controlling and should be followed only insofar as they have the \"power to persuade.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Law", "paragraphs": ["The issue of whether state and local law enforcement agencies are precluded from enforcing provisions of the INA was analyzed in the Ninth Circuit case of Gonzalez v. City of Peoria . In Gonzalez , the Ninth Circuit examined the City of Peoria's policies that authorized local officers to arrest illegal immigrants for violating the criminal entry provision of the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a71325). The arrestees claimed that the INA represented a full federal occupation of the field, which would in turn preempt state action. The court turned to the legislative history of \u00a71324(c) and determined that when Congress specifically removed language limiting the enforcement of \u00a71324 to federal officers and inserted specific language authorizing local enforcement, that \"it implicitly made the local enforcement authority as to all three criminal statutes (i.e., \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, 1326) identical.\" Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit declared that local police officers may, subject to state law, constitutionally stop or detain individuals when there is reasonable suspicion or, in the case of arrests, probable cause that such persons have violated, or are violating, the criminal provisions of the INA.", "With regards to preemption, the Gonzalez court determined that the criminal immigration provisions were \"few in number,\" \"relatively simple in their terms,\" constituted a \"narrow and distinct element\" of the INA, and did not require a \"complex administrative structure\" consistent with exclusive federal control. The court, therefore, concluded that the criminal provisions did not support the inference that the federal government occupied the field of criminal immigration enforcement.", "With respect to civil immigration enforcement, Gonzalez has been construed to support the argument that states do not possess the authority, \"inherent\" or otherwise, (unless specifically granted by Congress) to enforce the civil enforcement measures of the INA. In conducting a preemption analysis for certain criminal provisions of the INA, the Ninth Circuit in Gonzalez made a distinction between the civil and criminal provisions of the INA, and assumed that the former constituted a pervasive and preemptive regulatory scheme, whereas the latter did not. The court stated:", "We assume that the civil provisions of the Act regulating authorized entry, length of stay, residence status, and deportation, constitute such a pervasive regulatory scheme, as would be consistent with the exclusive federal power over immigration. However, this case [ Gonzalez ] does not concern that broad scheme, but only a narrow and distinct element of it\u2014the regulation of criminal immigration activity by aliens.", "Accordingly, the court concluded that the authority of state officials to enforce the provisions of the INA \"is limited to criminal provisions.\" The preemption analysis in Gonzalez has been criticized by some for parsing the INA when statutory construction and preemption principles generally require consideration of the whole statutory scheme in evaluating a specific provision. While Gonzalez appears to stand for the proposition that states do not possess the authority to enforce civil immigration laws, it has been argued that the preemption analysis in Gonzalez was based merely on an assumption and was outside the holding of the case, and thus does not constitute binding precedent. Whether this conclusion is completely accurate has yet to be tested in the courts in a definitive manner, although some decisions from the Tenth Circuit regarding criminal investigations may be seen by some as strengthening the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement.", "In the Tenth Circuit case of United States v. Salinas-Calderon, a state trooper pulled over the defendant for driving erratically but soon found six individuals in the back of the defendant's truck. Because the defendant, who was eventually charged with the crime of illegally transporting aliens did not speak English, the state trooper questioned the passenger (the defendant's wife) and learned that the driver and the other six individuals were in the country illegally. From this line of questioning, the court determined that the trooper had probable cause to detain and arrest all the individuals.", "In addition to the probable cause conclusion, the Tenth Circuit determined that a \"state trooper has general investigatory authority to inquire into possible immigration violations.\" It has been argued that since there was no reason to believe that the alien passengers had committed any criminal violations (i.e., they were only in the country illegally\u2014a civil violation), the court's statement appears to apply fully to civil as well as criminal violations. The Salinas-Calderon court, however, did not differentiate between civil and criminal INA violations nor did it address the charges or judicial proceedings for the six alien individuals found in the back of the truck. Instead, the focus of the Salinas-Calderon decision was on the probable cause and potential suppression of the statements made by the six alien passengers.", "In United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez , an Oklahoma police officer arrested a Hispanic male suspected of drug dealing because he was an \"illegal alien.\" A specific provision in the INA (8 U.S.C. \u00a71252c) authorizes state officers to pick up and hold for deportation a previously deported alien who had been convicted of a crime in the United States and reentered illegally. Section 1225c requires state officers to obtain confirmation from the INS before making such an arrest. At the time of the arrest in Vasquez-Alvarez , however, the state officer did not have actual knowledge of the defendant's immigration status or past criminal behavior; it was only later discovered that the alien had a history of prior criminal convictions and deportations.", "The defendant argued that the state police could only arrest him in accordance with the restrictions detailed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a71252c and since his arrest did not meet the requirements of that provision, it was unauthorized. The Tenth Circuit, however, ultimately concluded that \u00a71252c \"does not limit or displace the preexisting general authority of state or local police officers to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal law, including immigration law. Instead, \u00a71252c merely creates an additional vehicle for the enforcement of federal immigration law.\"", "The court also recognized that it had previously determined in Salinas-Calderon that state law enforcement officers have the general authority to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal immigration laws. The court concluded that the \"legislative history (of \u00a71252c) does not contain the slightest indication that Congress intended to displace any preexisting enforcement power already in the hands of state and local officers.\" While Vasquez-Alvarez may be interpreted to suggest that state and local police officers do in fact possess the \"inherent authority\" to enforce all aspects of immigration law, it should be noted that the case arose in the context of a criminal investigation and was premised on Oklahoma law, which allows local law enforcement officials to make arrests for violations of federal law, including immigration laws.", "Expanding on Vasquez-Alvarez , the Tenth Circuit, in United States v. Santana-Garcia , again addressed the role of local law enforcement in immigration. In Santana-Garcia , a Utah police officer stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation. The driver of the car did not speak English and did not possess a driver's license. The passenger of the car spoke limited English and explained that they were traveling from Mexico to Colorado, which prompted the officer to ask if they were \"legal.\" The passenger and the driver appeared to understand the question and answered \"no.\" From these facts, the court held that the officer had probable cause to arrest both defendants for suspected violation of federal immigration law.", "In recognizing that state and local police officers had \"implicit authority\" within their respective jurisdictions to investigate and make arrests for violations of immigration law, the court seemingly dismissed the suggestion that state law must explicitly grant local authorities the power to arrest for a federal immigration law violation. To come to this conclusion, the court relied upon a number of inferences from earlier decisions that recognized the \"implicit authority\" or \"general investigatory authority\" of state officers to inquire into possible immigration violations. The court also seemed to rely upon a broad understanding of a Utah state law that empowers officers to make warrantless arrests for any public offense committed in the officers presence to include violations of federal law.", "Although the defendants in Santana-Garcia were apparently in violation of a civil provision of the INA (i.e., illegal presence), the Santana-Garcia court made no distinction between the civil and criminal violations of the INA, and the authorities the court cited generally involved arrests for criminal matters. Moreover, it remains unclear how the court, pursuant to its broad understanding of the Utah state law it relied upon, would have ruled absent the initial reason for the stop\u2014the traffic violation. Accordingly, it can be argued that this case still seems to leave unresolved the extent to which state and local police officers may enforce the civil provisions of the INA as such.", "The aforementioned cases ultimately arose in the context of enforcing criminal matters or violations of state law. This would seem to weaken the argument for an independent role in enforcing civil immigration matters.
