The use of separate accounts solely means that revenues and distributions are directly linked to UC program purpose. The use of a single trust fund (the UTF) for all UC programs permits a balance to carry over surplus spending authority to subsequent years. The balance represents reserve spending authority available to these programs in addition to the spending authority provided by the automatic appropriation of current tax receipts. This reserve spending authority is used during recessions when UC outlays exceed UTF tax revenues, that is, when current spending exceeds current receipts.

This accounting device (designation as a trust fund) is used to accumulate legal spending authority that is available automatically when needed. However, the UTF does not contain financial resources. The required cash the federal government needs to pay benefits or administrative costs must be drawn from current resources through either taxation or borrowing. The revenue and the expenditures of the UC system are counted in the federal budget.", "Federal unemployment taxes are deposited into the unemployment trust fund.

Following federal law, the Treasury invests all state unemployment tax receipts in federal securities that bear interest. This investment increases the federal debt.

This redemption would decrease the federal debt. If the FUA is insolvent and the other federal accounts within the unemployment trust fund do not have sufficient balances to lend the funds that states need (as occurred in FY2010 through FY2015), Title XII of the SSA allows the FUA to borrow funds from the Treasury.
