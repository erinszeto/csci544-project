In addition, it repeals the FCC's ban on integrating the security and navigation functions of cable set-top boxes on December 5, 2015, one year after the law's enactment.

It directs the FCC, when considering whether to modify the local market of a television station to enable it to be carried on an MVPD, to consider whether doing so would promote consumers' access to in-state programming. The act directs the FCC to post information about the market modification process on its website.

In order to retransmit a broadcaster's signals to subscribers, a satellite operator, with certain exceptions, must have the legal rights to retransmit the copyrighted content contained in the broadcast, and must obtain the consent of the broadcaster for retransmission of the broadcast signal. The law specifies distinct copyright license and retransmission requirements for signals transmitted by various categories of broadcast television stations, including local commercial and noncommercial stations, distant network-affiliated and noncommercial stations, non-network stations, nationally distributed superstations, and \"significantly viewed\" stations. ", "The law governing satellite transmission makes a fundamental distinction between local signals and distant signals. ", "Local signals are transmitted over the air by local broadcasters to households within the local market of the subscriber (\"local-into-local service\"). The FCC uses Designated Market Areas (DMAs) constructed by the Nielsen Company to define local television markets for the purposes of retransmission consent. Nielsen has constructed 210 DMAs by assigning each county in the United States to a specific DMA, based on the predominance of viewing of broadcast television stations licensed to operate in a given Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Some households that subscribe to satellite television service in rural or remote areas may not be able to receive over-the-air local broadcast signals and therefore rely on DBS to watch local broadcast channels. DBS operators are allowed, but not required, to provide local-into-local service. If they choose to provide any local signal they must also carry the signals of all other full-power television broadcast stations located within the local area that request carriage. However, if a local broadcast station and a satellite operator fail to reach a retransmission consent agreement, the satellite operator may not include that station's signal in its local-into-local offering.

This section enables satellite operators to obtain rights to copyrighted programming carried by distant broadcast network affiliates, superstations, and other independent stations. Under this regime, the satellite operators submit a statement of account and pay a statutorily determined royalty fee to the U.S. Copyright Office on a semiannual basis, avoiding the transactions costs of negotiating with each individual copyright holder. Furthermore, Section 119 enables satellite operators, similar to cable operators, to transmit superstations to commercial establishments as well as distant independent stations to households (whether or not they are \"unserved\"). Section 119 also grandfathers through December 31, 2019 certain distant signal subscribers who retain eligibility to receive distant signals. Section 339 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7339), which permits carriage of distant television stations by satellite operators. Several portions of this section cross reference Section 119 of the Copyright Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7119). Therefore, although the STELA Reauthorization does not specifically reference Section 339, portions of this section would become ineffective after December 31, 2019, if Congress does not renew Section 119. Section 325(b)(2)(C) of the Communications Act. This section allows a satellite operator to retransmit the signals of distant network stations, without first obtaining the retransmission consent of those distant stations, to those subscribing households that cannot receive the signals of local broadcast television network affiliates. Absent this provision, a satellite operator would have to negotiate compensation terms with those distant network stations whose signals it retransmits to those \"unserved\" subscribers. This provision is similar to the permanent compulsory licensing scheme for cable operators, which dates back to 1976. Section 325(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Communications Act, which prohibits a television broadcast station that provides retransmission consent from engaging in exclusive contracts for carriage or failing to negotiate in good faith. Section 325(b)(3)(C)(iii) also prohibits a satellite or cable operator from failing to negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Consequently, the FCC's rules related to violations of good faith standards, including its prohibition on joint retransmission consent negotiations between two separately owned top-four stations within the same market, would become moot if Congress does not extend this section beyond December 31, 2019.

It is possible that the FCC, when issuing new rules to carry out the STELA Reauthorization Act, will allow only broadcast stations and satellite operators to petition to modify a market for satellite service.", "Section 102 amends section 614(h)(1)(C) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7534(h)(1)(C)), which applies to cable operators, as well as section 338 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7338), which applies to satellite operators, thereby creating near-parity between satellite and cable operators with respect to the FCC's criteria for determining whether a station is eligible to be carried by an MVPD outside of its market.", "Sections 102(a)(2) and 102(b) direct the FCC to consider, the following factors when modifying local television markets for the purpose of satellite and cable carriage of broadcast television stations:", "i. whether the station, or other stations located in the same area:", "I. have historically been carried on the cable system or systems within such community; or", "II. have historically been carried on the satellite carrier or carriers serving such community;", "ii. whether the television station provides coverage or other local services to the community;", "iii. whether modifying the local market of the television station would promote consumers' access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their state of residence;", "iv. whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a satellite carrier in the community provides news coverage of issues of concern to the community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and", "v. evidence of viewing patterns that subscribe and do not subscribe to services offered by MVPDs within the areas served by the MVPDs in the community", "Satellite and cable operators may not delete the signal of a commercial station from carriage while the FCC's market modification proceeding is pending. The FCC must grant or deny the request to modify a market within 120 days after a written request is filed with the agency.", "Moreover, satellite operators are not obligated to carry additional stations under the market modification process if it is not economically or technically feasible for them to do so. A market modification does not have any effect on households' eligibility to receive distant broadcast station signals.

The FCC is to evaluate the potential impact such alternatives could have on localism and on broadcast television locally, regionally, and nationally, and to make recommendations on how to foster increased localism in counties served by out-of-state designated market areas. ", "In a 2010 report on similar subjects, the FCC Media Bureau found that 99.98% of U.S. households had access to in-state programming and that 98.4% of households had access to at least one in-state television station via DBS. ", "The FCC noted that any changes to the FCC's existing rules for determining significantly viewed status would be inconsistent with the statute's requirement that it use the same rules for making significantly viewed determinations for DBS as were in effect for cable operators on April 15, 1976. Accordingly, the FCC concluded, Congress would need to make a statutory change in order for the FCC to modify its existing significantly viewed process. The FCC also noted that any changes in the significantly viewed rules would not be covered by Section 122 of the significantly viewed copyright license, thus rendering such waiver or rule changes unusable by DBS unless they can privatize negotiated copyright permission.", "The report also suggested that modifying the Communications and Copyright Acts to create regulatory parity by including DBS operators among the entities that can apply for market modification could potentially expand the number of local stations available to consumers via their DBS operator.

Instead, only noncommercial stations and commercial stations that elect must-carry would automatically be carried by cable operators on the basic tier. A station that elected to be carried pursuant to retransmission consent would set a price for subscribers to receive it on an a la carte basis. This proposal was not enacted, but the 114 th Congress may revisit the issue if it pursues a comprehensive revision of communications and copyright laws. "], "subsections": []}]}}
