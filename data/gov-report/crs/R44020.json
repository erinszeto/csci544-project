In 1989, it enacted a provision known as the Lautenberg Amendment as part of the FY1990 foreign operations appropriations act. The Lautenberg Amendment provided for the establishment of categories of Soviet nationals who would be subject to special rules about refugee determinations. The legislation was silent about where to process Lautenberg category cases; in-country processing of Soviet cases was an Administrative decision. Not all Lautenberg categories, however, are processed in-country. In 2004, the Lautenberg language was amended to add a new provision known as the \"Specter Amendment,\" which required the designation of categories of Iranian nationals, specifically religious minorities, who would be subject to the Lautenberg rules on refugee determinations.

This same general adjudicatory standard applies to refugee cases processed inside or outside countries of origin. Cases falling within a Lautenberg Amendment category (see \" Designation of In-Country Processing Groups \"), however, are an exception (whether processed inside or outside the refugee applicant's country of origin). Applicants under the Lautenberg standard are required to: establish that they are members of a protected category, assert a fear of persecution on one of the protected grounds, and assert a credible basis for concern about the possibility of such persecution. In asserting a credible basis for concern, applicants may assert, for example, actual past persecution or discriminatory actions taken against them personally, or acts of persecution taken against similarly situated individuals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In considering in-country refugee processing by the U.S. government, it is important to keep in mind how this mechanism fits into the larger scheme of the U.S. refugee admissions program. The INA definition of a refugee makes provision for in-country processing \"in such circumstances as the President after appropriate consultation ... may specify.\" Over the years, Administrations\u2014either on their own or prompted by Congress\u2014have used this authority in limited cases. The 2002 remarks by the State Department about Haiti cited above suggest that some relevant considerations include likely effectiveness and the existence of sufficient alternatives. Relatedly, in-country processing programs are typically aimed at particular groups within a country and may require applicants to have some type of connection to the United States. For example, the new in-country processing program for certain minors from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras requires the minors to have a lawfully present parent in the United States. Given such limitations, as important as in-country programs may be to prospective beneficiaries, out-of-country processing remains the norm. "], "subsections": []}]}}
