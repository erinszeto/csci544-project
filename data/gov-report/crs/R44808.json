The NFIP is described in detail in CRS Report R44593, Introduction to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) . ", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the main program intended to provide federal assistance to homeowners and renters recovering from flood losses. The NFIP was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74001 et seq.). The general purpose of the NFIP is both to offer primary flood insurance to properties with significant flood risk, and to reduce flood risk through the adoption of floodplain management standards. As of May 2018, the NFIP had over 5 million flood insurance policies providing over $1.28 trillion in coverage. Nationally, as of July 2018, about 22,322 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions participated in the NFIP. According to FEMA, the program saves the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the NFIP's building and floodplain management regulations.", "In addition to NFIP claims payments to policyholders, homeowners and renters may also access a number of other federal programs aimed at mitigating the impact on individuals and households. As described below, Congress established certain limits on the availability of federal disaster assistance dependent on whether individuals had flood insurance, as set out by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA, P.L. 93-234 , 87 Stat 985). In addition to requiring property owners with federally backed mortgages to have flood insurance, the FDPA restricts access to federal financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes for use in any area that has been identified as having special flood hazards (i.e., what is known as a Special Flood Hazard Area, or SFHA), and in which the sale of flood insurance has been made available under the NFIP, unless covered by flood insurance (i.e., the community participates in the NFIP). The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , as amended, Stafford Act) also sets restrictions to flood disaster assistance, stating that notwithstanding any other provision of law, no federal disaster relief assistance made available in a flood disaster area may be used to make a payment (including any loan assistance payment) to a person for repair, replacement, or flood disaster assistance that was conditional on the person first having obtained flood insurance under applicable federal law and subsequently having failed to obtain and maintain flood insurance as required under applicable federal law on such property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Assistance Available to Individuals and Families", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Availability of Flood Insurance Through the NFIP", "paragraphs": ["A core design feature of the NFIP is that communities are not required to participate in the program by any law or regulation. Rather, communities in the United States voluntarily participate in the NFIP generally as a means of securing access to the primary flood insurance offered by the NFIP. Essentially, the NFIP is structured so that the availability of primary flood insurance through the NFIP is tied to the adoption and enforcement of floodplain management standards by participating communities. FEMA is only allowed to provide flood insurance to \"those States or areas (or subdivisions thereof)\" where \"adequate land use and control measures\" have been adopted that \"are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use developed\" by the NFIP. Thus, communities that participate in the NFIP, and therefore whose residents may access the NFIP's primary flood insurance, also must adopt, through local or state laws, minimum floodplain management standards that are described in FEMA regulations. Communities are required to adopt these minimum floodplain management standards in order to participate in the NFIP. FEMA has set forth the minimum standards it requires for participation in the NFIP in federal regulations. Though the standards appear in federal regulations, the standards only have the force of law because they are adopted and enforced by a state or local government. ", "A community that has been found failing to enforce the floodplain management standards may be placed on probation and ultimately suspended from the NFIP. However, a community cannot be removed from the NFIP because of increased or excess flood insurance claims and losses. Rather, probation and suspension only occur if the community fails to uphold its obligations related to floodplain management. Communities that have been suspended or those communities that do not participate in the NFIP can face significant consequences. Most importantly, residents of these communities are not able to purchase primary flood insurance through the NFIP, which may result in significant uninsured property risk in that community. In addition, if a community does not participate in, or has been suspended from, the NFIP but has been previously mapped by FEMA for flood hazards, it is difficult for the community and policyholders to access some other forms of federal assistance for areas in the floodplain. ", "For example, by law, no federal assistance may be provided for acquisition or construction purposes in an area that has been identified as having special flood hazards unless the property is covered by flood insurance. Likewise, as federally backed mortgages require flood insurance for properties in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), these property owners would be required to obtain such insurance in the private market. A community is allowed to leave the NFIP at its will, but the potential consequences of that decision are similar to those if the community has been suspended.

Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). The CBRS contains two types of units: System units and Otherwise Protected Areas (OPAs). System units are generally comprised of private lands that were relatively undeveloped at the time of their designation within the CBRS. The boundaries of system units are generally intended to follow geomorphic, development, or cultural features. OPAs are generally comprised of lands held by a qualified organization primarily for wildlife refuge, sanctuary, recreational, or natural resource conservation purposes. The boundaries of OPAs are generally intended to coincide with the boundaries of conservation or recreation areas such as state parks and national wildlife refuges. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Primary Flood Insurance Through the NFIP", "paragraphs": ["FEMA develops, in coordination with participating communities, flood maps called Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) that depict the community's floodplain and flood risk. A key aspect of this flood mapping is the identification of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The SFHA is intended to distinguish the flood risk zones that have a chance of flooding during a \"1 in 100 year flood\" or greater frequency. This means that properties have a risk of 1% or greater of flooding every year if located in a SFHA. In a community that participates or has participated in the NFIP, owners of properties in the mapped SFHA are required to purchase flood insurance as a condition of receiving a federally backed mortgage. By law and regulation, federal agencies, federally regulated lending institutions, and government-sponsored enterprises must require these property owners to purchase flood insurance as a condition of any mortgage that these entities make, guarantee, or purchase. Property owners falling under this mandate may purchase flood insurance through the NFIP or through a private company, so long as the private flood insurance \"provides flood insurance coverage which is at least as broad as the coverage\" of the NFIP, among other conditions. Not all mortgages in the SFHA are affected by this mandatory purchase requirement. For example, a personal mortgage loan between two private parties (such as between family members), or a mortgage issued by a private mortgage company that is not then sold on the secondary market to a bank or entity like Fannie Mae, may not require flood insurance. Even if they are not technically required to mandate flood insurance by federal law, the issuing party may still require it as a means of financially securing the property. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preferred Risk Policies", "paragraphs": ["Flood insurance is optional for properties outside the SFHA regardless of whether they have a federally backed mortgage. However, as there is still a risk of flooding outside the SFHA, residents of NFIP participating communities with property located outside the SFHA may voluntarily purchase a lower-cost Preferred Risk Policy (PRP). Rates for PRPs are lower than for properties in SFHAs in accordance with their lower risk profile; however, unlike properties in the SFHA, an individual may be denied a PRP if there is significant loss history for the property. FEMA encourages the purchase of PRPs both to reduce the financial flood risk of a broader group of individuals, and to expand the number of NFIP policyholders, thus improving the fiscal soundness of the NFIP portfolio. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard Flood Insurance Policies", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has considerable discretion under the law to craft the details of the flood insurance policies it sells through the NFIP. Currently, there are three policies that the NFIP uses to sell primary flood insurance\u2014the Dwelling, the General Property, and the Residential Condominium Building Association policy (RCBAP) forms. Collectively, these Standard Flood Insurance Policies (SFIPs) appear in regulations, and coverage qualifications are generally equivalent. Within the SFIPs sold by the NFIP, there are numerous policy exclusions that are often not understood by policyholders. For example, SFIPs have limited coverage of basements or crawlspaces. Because SFIP coverage limits are often less than the value of a structure or the value of the property's contents, policyholders can obtain excess flood insurance to cover losses beyond the coverage limit. However, such excess coverage is not sold by the NFIP, and can only be purchased through the private insurance market.

The Other Residential Building category also includes hotels, motels, tourist homes, and rooming houses which have more than four units where the normal guest occupancy is six months or more. An individual dwelling unit in a condominium not covered by the RCBAP may be separately insured under the Dwelling form, in the name of the unit owner, up to the limits of insurance coverage for a single-family dwelling (up to $100,000 for contents, up to $250,000 for building elements). A residential condominium association may purchase insurance coverage under the RCBAP on behalf of the association and the unit owners to cover the building and, if desired, coverage of commonly owned contents.

This arrangement between the NFIP and private industry is authorized by statute and guided by regulation. There are two different arrangements that FEMA has established with private industry. The first is the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA), which operates as a private contractor on behalf of FEMA for individuals seeking to purchase flood insurance policies directly from the NFIP. The second arrangement is called the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program, where private insurance companies are paid to directly write and service the policies themselves. With either the DSA or WYO Program, the NFIP retains the actual financial risk of paying claims for the policy (i.e., underwrites the policy), and the policy terms and premiums are the same.", "Following a flood, NFIP policyholders are advised to contact their agent or insurance company to file a claim. This is either one of the WYO companies or the DSA, who will provide an adjuster to assist the policyholder to make a claim. The adjuster will normally take measurements and photographs to assess the damage, provide an estimate of the covered flood damage, and provide a proof of loss form for the policyholder to sign. The estimate, proof of loss form, and other supporting documentation provide the Proof of Loss, which is required before the claim can be paid. The complete Proof of Loss, signed and sworn to by the policyholder, along with documentation to support the amount requested initially and any requests for additional payment, must be sent to the DSA or WYO company within 60 days after the date of loss or within the extension. In severe events, FEMA may authorize an extension of the 60-day period to send the proof of loss to the NFIP adjuster. For example, following both the Louisiana floods in August 2016 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, FEMA authorized multiple extensions which ultimately gave policyholders 330 days to submit their proof of loss after the Louisiana floods and a full two years to submit their proofs of loss after Sandy. So far, policyholders have been given one year from the date of loss to file claims for Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria.

The insurer may offer a total advance payment of up to $20,000 if the policyholder provides photographs depicting flood damage to the covered property and either documentation such as receipts verifying out-of-pocket expenses related to the repair or replacement of covered property, or a contractor's itemized damage estimate. ", "(2) Payment for Significant Damage: If the insurer receives a general contractor's estimate of necessary repairs to the insured property and a flood insurance inspector retained by the insurer has inspected the insured property, an advance payment may be authorized, not to exceed 50% of the general contractor's estimate of necessary repairs. In both cases, the advance payment cannot be used for Additional Living Expenses, and after the claim is settled, the insurer will reduce the final payment by the amount of the advance.

The types of housing assistance include monetary assistance, direct assistance, repairs, and replacement. Monetary Assistance is provided to individuals and families to address the costs to rent temporary housing while repairs are being made to their predisaster primary residence or while they transition to permanent housing. The amount of rental assistance available is calibrated to include housing and utility costs in the affected area. Direct Assistance provides temporary housing units to disaster survivors that are purchased or leased by the federal government. The IHP cost per household limit does not apply to Direct Assistance. The use of Direct Assistance, such as mobile homes and trailers, is rare and is generally considered a last resort to be employed only when other housing options are not available in the immediate disaster area. ", "The great majority of disaster housing help comes in the form of temporary rental assistance and repairs to a home which is not insured in order to make it habitable. This repair assistance does not include new utilities or improvements to the home, but does make the home conform to current, applicable building codes in the affected area. The goal is to repair the home to a safe and sanitary living or functioning condition. FEMA will not pay to return a home to its condition before the disaster. The IHP can also make a contribution through Replacement Assistance toward the replacement of an uninsured or underinsured owner-occupied residence that was damaged in a disaster event. However, the $34,000 limit means that it is unlikely that IHP awards will pay for the full replacement of a residence. IHP recipients whose homes are located in a Special Flood Hazard Area and are in a community participating in the NFIP and who receive assistance for repair, replacement, permanent housing construction, and/or personal property as a result of a flood-related disaster must obtain and maintain flood insurance as a condition of accepting disaster assistance.

This assistance allows households time to recover from the disaster and be in a better position to buy flood insurance after the expiration of the GFIP. The premium for the GFIP is a flat fee of $600 per insured household, which is paid from ONA funds. A special deductible of $200 (applicable separately to any buildings loss and any contents loss) applies to insured flood damage losses sustained by the insured property in the course of any subsequent flooding event during the term of the GFIP.

The STEP program home repairs were not accomplished under the authority of the IHP program, but instead were funded under Section 403 of the Stafford Act, which covers essential assistance; in other words, the grants were provided to eligible Public Assistance Grant Program applicants, who in turn used the funding for essential repairs to private residences. The STEP program was intended to reduce the demand for other FEMA-provided shelter, such as congregate shelters or TSA. STEP consisted of three elements: residential electrical meter repairs, shelter essential measures, and rapid temporary exterior repairs. FEMA delivered the STEP program through direct federal assistance; reimbursement of applicants who perform, or contract for the performance of, authorized emergency protective measures; or a combination of the two.

Consequently, CDBG-DR is not provided for all major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, but only provided at the discretion of Congress. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program", "paragraphs": ["The CDBG-DR program is designed to help communities and neighborhoods that otherwise might not recover after a disaster due to limited resources. Eligible grantees include states, units of local government, Indian tribes, and other areas designated by the President as disaster areas. Generally, CDBG-DR grantees must use at least 70% of the funds for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) persons or areas. Due to the block grant nature of the program, local and state officials exercise a great deal of discretion in determining which combination of eligible activities to employ. This allows communities to use CDBG-DR funds to meet disaster-related needs, including short-term disaster relief, mitigation activities, and long-term recovery activities. Communities and states are also free to amend and revise their annual CDBG plans in response to flood in order to address imminent threats to the health and safety of residents. Communities, at the discretion of Congress, may be reimbursed by CDBG-DR funds for use of their regular CDBG allocation. This results from explicit language included in some appropriations bills. ", "HUD does not provide CDBG-DR funding directly to individuals; however, individuals and families may benefit from a number of the eligible activities for which CDBG-DR funds can be used. Examples of these activities include buyouts of damaged properties in a floodplain and relocating residents to safer areas, relocation payments for people and businesses displaced by a disaster, rehabilitation of homes and buildings damaged by the disaster, and homeownership activities such as down payment assistance, interest rate subsidies, and loan guarantees for disaster victims. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Examples of CDBG-DR Assistance After Major Floods", "paragraphs": ["Some of the biggest flood-related CDBG-DR grants have been made available in the aftermath of hurricanes. For example, following the 2005 hurricane season (particularly Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma), Congress provided $19.7 billion in CDBG-DR funding to five states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas). Louisiana and Mississippi were the two states hardest hit by the 2005 hurricanes and received $13.4 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Both states devoted the majority of the CDBG-DR funding to housing recovery, with particular support for homeowners. Louisiana state officials used $3 billion of CDBG-DR funding for the Road Home program. This program defined a homeowner's potential grant amount as the estimated cost to repair or rebuild the home, minus any insurance payments and FEMA assistance for structural repairs, up to a maximum of $150,000. This potential amount was then reduced by 30% for homeowners who did not carry insurance (homeowners insurance and also flood insurance if the property was in a SFHA and the community participated in the NFIP). The state also reduced the award to remove Duplication of Benefits and unpaid taxes owed to the state. Homeowners could choose to repair their property or to relocate (with only 60% of the potential grant amount available if they chose to relocate out of Louisiana). Mississippi established a similar program called the Mississippi Homeowner Grant Program. The maximum assistance in the Mississippi program considered the applicant's income relative to the area median income, and whether or not the property was located in a SFHA. Assistance in Mississippi was also conditional on homeowners' willingness to attach covenants to the property that created commitments to maintain flood insurance, rebuild and repair in accordance with applicable building codes and local ordinances, and elevate the property in accordance with the most recent FEMA guidelines. ", "After Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in October 2012, $16 billion ($15.8 billion after the sequester) was awarded in CDBG-DR funding to New York City and the states of Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. This funding has been used in a variety of ways which provide funding directly to individuals and families, including housing rehabilitation and replacement, resilient rebuilding (for example, elevation of a property), property acquisition, and coastal resiliency measures. The State of New Jersey used CDBG-DR funding after Hurricane Sandy to make grants of up to $10,000 through its Homeowner Resettlement Program which homeowners could use toward addressing anything that would provide an incentive to remain in their community. One of the eligible expenses for which this money could be used was to pay flood insurance premiums. The Resettlement Program was only available to homeowners in the nine most impacted counties whose property was their primary residence which they owned and occupied at the time of the storm, and whose residence sustained a FEMA-verified loss of $8,000 or greater or more than one foot of flooding on the first floor. Before the funds were released, the homeowner was required to sign a promissory note to reside in the county for three years; otherwise, they would have to repay the funds to the state. Initially 60% of the funds were reserved for LMI families in accordance with HUD income guidelines. The disbursement of the funds was evaluated in the order in which the requests were received. ", "Following the 2017 Hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, and Maria), there were three relevant acts containing CDBG-DR supplemental appropriations. Texas was allocated $57.8 million for damages associated with Hurricane Harvey. The first supplemental allocated an additional $5.024 billion to Texas, $616 million to Florida, $1.507 billion to Puerto Rico, and $243 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the second supplemental, Congress did not provide HUD with any CDBG-DR funding, although it did make some modifications to eligibility, to include tribes, and set expenditure deadlines. In the third supplemental, HUD was allocated $28 billion in CDBG-DR funding. Congress required that these funds be used for two purposes: ", "1. Up to $16 billion to address remaining unmet needs from major disasters in 2017, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria as well as California wildfires and subsequent mudslides. Congress specified that at least $11 million of this be targeted to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with $2 billion to repair and upgrade the electrical grid in these jurisdictions. 2. At least $12 billion to support mitigation activities among CDBG-DR grantees that experienced presidentially declared disasters from 2015 through 2017. After addressing remaining 2017 unmet needs, HUD was able to make an additional $3.9 billion available for mitigation, bringing the amount available for mitigation to nearly $16 billion for recent CDBG-DR grantees.", "CDBG-DR funding from the third supplemental for the 2017 hurricanes, including mitigation funding, allocated $18.4 billion to Puerto Rico, $4.7 billion to Texas, $1.21 billion to the U.S. Virgin Islands, and $707.3 million to Florida.

Individuals who live in a community which has not joined, withdraws from, or which has been suspended from the NFIP, are not allowed to buy or renew NFIP flood insurance and are barred from applying for SBA loans. These households may wish to buy NFIP flood insurance but are not allowed to do so, because of their community's NFIP status (or nonstatus).", " Table 1 provides summary information on available federal assistance from an NFIP insurance policy, FEMA Individuals and Households Program, and SBA disaster loans. This information is provided dependent on the status of the individual's property in the Special Flood Hazard Area, the community's participation in the NFIP, and whether that individual has the required insurance coverage. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unequal Amount of Assistance Available Through Flood Insurance and Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["There is often a perception that flood victims get large amounts of disaster aid and that this may act as a moral hazard which discourages people from purchasing flood insurance and/or adopting risk reduction measures. In fact, the amount of FEMA Individual Assistance after a flood is relatively limited; many of the headline reports of federal aid refer to public assistance or assistance which is not available to all individuals. Flood insurance may be preferable for governments, since policyholders cover a portion of the costs through premium payments. Flood insurance may also be better for individuals, as uninsured households fare less well than those with insurance. Generally, residents must live in a federally declared disaster area to be eligible to receive disaster assistance or disaster loans; in contrast, NFIP policyholders may claim for damages from any flood, regardless of whether the flood was a declared disaster under federal law. Although the maximum coverage available under the NFIP may not be sufficient to cover all flood-related losses, an individual or family will generally be able to get more from NFIP insurance than from disaster assistance. For example, homeowners are able to get up to $350,000 for buildings and contents together and renters are able to get up to $100,000, compared to a maximum of $34,000 per household from FEMA disaster assistance. In addition, most disaster victims do not receive the maximum amount available under FEMA disaster assistance. For example, after the South Carolina floods in October 2015, although less than 5% of households in the counties receiving IHP had NFIP flood insurance, the average IHP payment was about $3,200. In contrast, the average NFIP claim for the South Carolina floods was $34,934. Neither flood insurance payments nor Individual Assistance payments need to be paid back; however, the amount available through IA will be reduced by the amount of NFIP proceeds received for the same damages. In addition, a household without flood insurance will only be able to get IA under a limited set of circumstances. An individual or household may be able to borrow up to $240,000 through a combination of SBA Personal Property and Real Property Loans; however, these loans must be paid back with interest. In order to receive SBA loans, recipients must carry flood insurance for the life of the loan. The amount of this assistance is subject to Duplication of Benefits and sequence protocols. ", "The nexus between flood insurance and disaster assistance reveals conflicting aims: the desire to encourage individuals and households to purchase flood insurance versus the humanitarian objective of providing assistance following a disaster so that people do not suffer unnecessarily. This is fundamentally a moral hazard question. A fully individualistic approach to flood risk would advocate that individuals and households should purchase adequate flood insurance to protect themselves against a major flood disaster. A more egalitarian approach could take the view that individuals do not necessarily have a free choice on whether or not they purchase flood insurance (for example, residents of a community which does not participate in the NFIP) and that some individuals and households may not be able to afford sufficient coverage. In this case, the policy question is whether or not the federal government should step in after a disaster even if the victims do not have flood insurance. Congress may allow these conflicting policies to continue and to retain the current difference between the amounts available from flood insurance and disaster assistance, or may consider proposals that would alter the balance between assistance and insurance. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability of Alternative Funding", "paragraphs": ["A significant amount of money is available to individuals and households through funding sources which are not available in all disasters, particularly through CDBG-DR. For example, homeowners in Louisiana and Mississippi could get grants of up to $150,000 after the 2005 hurricane season, as could homeowners in New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. Rather than being funded through the annual appropriations process, statutory authority for CDBG-DR funding is provided via supplemental appropriations which are awarded by Congress only in extraordinary circumstances that have resulted in significant unmet needs for long-term recovery. Because Congress has so far opted to use special appropriations to deliver CDBG-DR funds rather than establishing a permanent CDBG disaster recovery program, HUD cannot create permanent regulations and guidance of how states should implement CDBG-DR grants. This may lead to delay and/or confusion in implementation, and may also subject program design decisions to local politics. Unless the individual state required homeowners to purchase flood insurance, the recipients of CDBG-DR grants are exempt from the requirement to purchase flood insurance. Given the unequal use of CDBG-DR, there may be an issue of equity in disaster housing assistance, where some disaster events receive an expanded form of federal assistance to meet housing needs in the form of CDBG, which can create different tiers of disaster housing assistance for declared disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considerations for NFIP Reauthorization", "paragraphs": ["NFIP's authorization will expire on November 30, 2018.
