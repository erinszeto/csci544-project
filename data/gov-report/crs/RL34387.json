The broad, longer-term objective included helping Iraqis build \"a new Iraq that is prosperous and free.\" In October 2002, Congress had authorized the President to use force against Iraq, to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,\" and to \"enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\"", "After the initial combat operations, the focus of OIF shifted from regime removal to the more open-ended mission of helping an emerging new Iraqi leadership improve security, establish a system of governance, and foster economic development. Over time, challenges to the emerging Iraqi leadership from homegrown insurgents and some foreign fighters mounted. Sectarian violence grew, catalyzed by the February 2006 bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra. ", "In January 2007, in an attempt to reverse the escalation of violence, President Bush announced a new strategic approach, the \"New Way Forward,\" including a \"surge\" of additional U.S. forces, together with additional civilian experts. The troop surge included five Army brigade combat teams (BCTs), a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), and two Marine battalions. More importantly, most observers agree, Ambassador Crocker and the Commanding General of Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), General David Petraeus, institutionalized counterinsurgency approaches across the force and the U.S. effort as a whole. Those approaches emphasized population security, empowering the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) through close partnership, and building GoI capacity to govern and foster economic development in order to capitalize on security gains.", "Over the course of the surge, observers generally agreed, security conditions on the ground improved markedly. In August 2008, GEN Petraeus agreed that there had been \"significant progress\" but argued that it was \"still not self-sustaining.\" \"We're not celebrating,\" he commented, and there are \"no victory dances in the end zone.\"", "Practitioners and observers have identified a number of factors that may have contributed to the security improvements, including the additional surge forces; new and institutionalized counter-insurgency approaches concerning population security and reconciliation; the application of high-end technological capabilities by Special Operations Forces (SOF) and closer integration between SOF and conventional forces; the accumulated experience of U.S. leaders at all levels after multiple tours in Iraq; the growing numbers and capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces; the ground-up rejection of violence and support for the coalition by many Sunni Arabs; and the ceasefire declared by Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and the abandonment of violence by many of his followers.", "While conventional, force-on-force wars tend to end with the unequivocal defeat of one party, the parameters for \"mission success\" in counter-insurgency efforts like OIF tend to be less definitive and more subject to qualitative interpretation.

It was the product of a contentious negotiations process that began in spring 2008. It elaborated the terms of the bilateral security partnership at the operational level, and provided the legal basis for the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. When approving the two agreements, the Iraqi parliament made the Security Agreement subject to a popular referendum, scheduled to be held by July 2009.

This language was a stricter version of earlier drafts that reportedly had provided for time \"horizons\" or target dates.", "The Security Agreement stipulated that the United States shall not use Iraqi land, sea or air as a \"launching or transit point for attacks against other countries.\" The Strategic Framework Agreement, which echoed this language, also provided that the United States shall not seek a \"permanent military presence\" in Iraq. The negotiations process reportedly considered various formulations regarding external threats to Iraq's sovereignty. The agreed language, in the Security Agreement, required bilateral consultations in case of such a threat, but made no other actions compulsory.", "The Security Agreement required that U.S. forces coordinate all military operations with Iraqi authorities. It tightly constrained the role of U.S. forces in detaining Iraqis and mandated the transfer of current detainees to Iraqi custody. It also granted Iraq some legal jurisdiction over U.S. servicemembers and defense civilians \u2013 specifically, in cases of \"grave, premeditated felonies\" committed off base and \"outside duty status.\" As senior officials on the ground have underscored, the Security Agreement acknowledged that many of its provisions would require further interpretation. To that end, it established a committee structure to provide implementation guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Drawdown and Transition", "paragraphs": ["On February 27, 2009, at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, President Obama announced \"a new strategy to end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility.\" The setting for the speech quietly echoed its theme of transition. U.S. Marines entered Iraq at the start of OIF and helped lead both major combat and counterinsurgency (COIN) efforts. Recently, senior Marine Corps officials have argued that significantly increasing the Marine deployment to Afghanistan will require drawing down in Iraq\u2014\"during calendar year 2010.\"", "The President's policy calls for the withdrawal of all U.S. combat forces by August 31, 2010. That decision marked the culmination of a comprehensive strategic review of Iraq war efforts that President Obama ordered on his first full day in office. Military commanders were reportedly asked to review alternative 16-month, 19-month, and 23-month timeline options for the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces. The announced withdrawal timeline will mark 18 months from the time of the announcement, and approximately 19 months from the Inauguration\u2014slightly longer than the 16-month timeline suggested by then-Senator Obama during the presidential campaign.", "According to the new policy, after August 2010, the U.S. forces' focus in Iraq will shift to a three-pronged mission: training, equipping, and advising the Iraqi security forces (ISF); conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations; and providing force protection for both civilian and military personnel. That so-called \"transitional force\" will initially included between 35,000 and 50,000 troops. All remaining U.S. forces are expected to be withdrawn by the end of 2011, in accordance with the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement.", "At the time of the announcement, there were approximately 140,000 U.S. troops deployed in Iraq, including 14 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) or equivalents, as well as a significantly larger number of support forces. On March 8, 2009, Administration officials announced that 12,000 U.S. troops would redeploy from Iraq without replacement by September 2009. Administration officials have suggested that between 10 and 12 BCTs would remain on the ground at the time of Iraq's national elections tentatively planned for the end of 2009. ", "The key components of the \"transitional force\" are expected to be \"Advise and Assist Brigades\" (AABs). Some officials have suggested an initial target figure of six AABs but have noted that the number could be adjusted. Officials have explained that each AAB will be built on the chassis, or foundation, of a BCT, and it will be augmented with capabilities required for the stability operations-focused mission in Iraq, including training and advisory capabilities and significant enablers. Each unit is expected to prepare and train as an organic whole before deploying. AABs are expected to work closely with U.S. civilian counterparts, including Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs); those relationships, including co-location and the degree and kind of support provided to civilian efforts, is likely to vary geographically across Iraq. ", "The troop withdrawal policy does not imply that no further deployments of U.S. military units to Iraq will take place. Some U.S. units schedule to redeploy from Iraq in the near term will be replaced by fresh U.S. units. In addition, some units may end up serving shorter tours in Iraq than the now-standard 12 months of \"boots on the ground.\"", "The drawdown and transition plans are expected to include a consolidation of three key military headquarters in Iraq: Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), the overall strategic-level command currently led by General Raymond Odierno; Multi-National Corps-Iraq (MNC-I), the operational-level command led since April 4, 2009, by Lieutenant General Charles Jacoby and Ft. Lewis-Washington-based I Corps; and Multi-National Security Transition-Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), led by Lieutenant General Frank Helmick. Some officials have suggested that the headquarters consolidation is likely to take place after the Iraqi national elections, but well before the August 2010 transition. The new entity is expected to be significantly smaller in terms of personnel. The consolidation would reflect not only an elimination of redundancy, but also, as one official described it, discretely \"choosing not to do some things.\"", "The Obama Administration's drawdown and transition policy was widely considered to reflect a compromise between two broad schools of thought\u2014advocates, respectively, of a relatively gradual or a relatively accelerated drawdown. Many observers have suggested that the policy splits the difference by maintaining a relatively robust force on the ground through the political hurdles of 2009, which preparing to draw U.S. forces down relatively rapidly in 2010.", "One school of thought, which included many military commanders, supported a relatively longer timetable. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates acknowledged, \"I think that, if the commanders had complete say in this matter, that they would have preferred that the combat mission not end until the end of 2010.\" One key concern was reportedly a desire to retain a robust force through the Iraqi political hurdles of 2009 to ensure their success and their ability to serve as catalysts of further stabilization. In December 2008, U.S. military commanders reportedly had recommended beginning the drawdown slowly, by withdrawing two BCTs over the first six months of 2009. Before the President's policy announcement, GEN Odierno, MNF-I Commanding General, stated, \"I believe that if we can get through the next year peacefully, with incidents about what they are today or better, I think we're getting close to enduring stability, which enables us to really reduce.\" ", "Proponents of a gradual approach also argued that it is important to take every remaining opportunity to train, advise, and mentor the Iraqi security forces (ISF). MNSTC-I Commanding General LTG Helmick commented in February 2009 that the ISF still had \"a long way to go.\" He argued that if they continue to focus on logistics\u2014their \"Achilles heel\"\u2014and there are no major surprises from the enemy, then the ISF could have \"a sustained ground capability to fight the insurgency\" by the end of 2011.", "Some military commanders were also reportedly concerned that any significant drawdown would be complicated and would require substantial time and attention from U.S. military leadership on the ground. They urged delaying the bulk of the drawdown until 2010, to allow MNF-I to focus primarily on its substantive mission in 2009.", "The other broad school of thought urged the adoption of a relatively accelerated timeline. Some advocates of an accelerated timeline sought simply to end the U.S. military commitment in Iraq as soon as reasonably possible. Other proponents of this school argued that the U.S. troop presence in Iraq\u2014and the antipathy that might be generated among the Iraqi population by the presence of a de facto occupier\u2014could be hindering further progress. Announced troop withdrawal plans, it was argued, could spur progress by encouraging Iraqi leaders to accelerate their own efforts to assume more responsibility and make progress toward reconciliation, and by urging international partners to increase their constructive involvement. They stressed that it would be particularly helpful to reduce the visible presence of U.S. combat forces before the rest of the political \"hurdles\" Iraq faces in 2009, to reduce the risk that the U.S. presence might become the target of politically-motivated rhetoric and opposition.", "Some accelerated timeline advocates underscored the strain that simultaneous war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed on U.S. military forces\u2014a strain likely to grow as the United States increases troop deployments to Afghanistan in 2009. The high demand for forces for the ongoing U.S. troop commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan has meant, for many servicemembers, repeated deployments, extended deployments, and/or short \"dwell times\" at home between tours. Military Departments, responsible in accordance with Title 10, U.S. Code, for \"organizing, manning, training and equipping\" the force, and some key observers, have expressed concerns about the stress these demands have placed, and may continue to place, on the force. Over time, DOD has introduced a series of policies designed to manage that stress\u2014for example, limiting active duty Army deployments to 12 months for those deploying after August 1, 2008. ", "Some observers from each school of thought have expressed concerns about the Obama Administration policy. At the time of the policy announcement, some Democratic Party leaders in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, questioned the need for a residual force as large as 50,000 troops. Some gradualists, in turn, urged the Administration to remain flexible about the timeline in execution, cautioning that \"it cannot be carried out rigidly\" and urging a readiness to \"slow the pace next year if necessary.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Strategic and Operational Dynamics", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration announced its Iraq transition policy, and the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement came into force, against a backdrop of ongoing strategic-level challenges to the Government of Iraq, and multiple operational-level transitions in the counter-insurgency effort."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Strategic Dynamics: Tests and \"Spoilers\"", "paragraphs": ["Most observers agree that the GoI faces several major tests in 2009. These began with the provincial elections held in most parts of the country on January 31, 2009, and are also scheduled to include district-level elections in June; a national referendum on the security agreement in July; and national-level elections at the end of the year. These events carry some risk of unrest, but, many observers contend, should these hurdles be cleared safely and successfully, they might serve to further catalyze the consolidation of the Iraqi state.", "In addition, the GoI still faces several persistent strategic challenges \u2013 potential \"spoilers\" \u2013 that could disrupt not only security conditions on the ground but also progress toward a unified and stable Iraq. ", "One major challenge, increasingly prominent in 2009, is a portfolio of tensions and competing claims in \"the north,\" particularly between Iraqi Kurds and Arabs. The set of related issues includes resolving the political status of the multi-ethnic and oil-rich city of Kirkuk, together with other \"disputed territories\" along the Green Line that divides the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from the rest of Iraq. The problems are complicated by the forced resettlement policies of Saddam's regime, which moved Kurds out of their homes and resettled Arabs in those areas; and by Kurdish efforts in the post-Saddam era to reclaim those areas. Further, the KRG and GoI continue to dispute the proper dispensation of oil revenues generated by the areas rich oil reserves. While Kirkuk city itself has been relatively calm, coalition and Iraqi officials in Kirkuk have noted with concern that outside players with strong vested interests, including ethnically based Iraqi political parties, and Turkey-based supporters of Iraqi Turkmen, sometimes use inflammatory language to stir up tensions in the city. Elsewhere, violence has flared\u2014in 2008, Iraqi security forces skirmished with KRG peshmerga forces in the restive town of Khanaquin, in Diyala province, on the GoI side of the Green Line. The year 2009 is likely to prove pivotal in this ongoing set of debates. UNAMI is expected to present a comprehensive set of recommendations for resolving tensions in the north, as a basis for discussion. Provincial elections, held elsewhere on January 31, 2009, remain to be scheduled for At Ta'amin province, which includes Kirkuk. ", "A second major challenge concerns how effectively Sunni Arabs, are incorporated socially, economically, and politically into the Iraqi polity. Sunni Arabs, who are concentrated in western and central Iraq, were a disproportionately privileged minority under Saddam's rule but lost much of that status after regime change. The provincial elections held on January 31, 2009, marked a positive step, by increasing Sunni Arab political representation at the provincial level. A particular concern is the ongoing integration of members of the Sons of Iraq (SoI) \"community watch\" program. A majority of the SoIs were Sunni Arabs\u2014including some former insurgents\u2014and key Shiite officials in the GoI were long wary of the SoI program. On October 1, 2008, the GoI began assuming responsibility for the SoIs, including paying their salaries, and this transition was expected to be completed by April 2009. ", "The integration of former SoIs into the Iraqi security forces and civilian jobs has proceeded very slowly, and participants have reported serious delays in the payment of salaries. Some practitioners and observers have expressed concerns about the possible security repercussions if the GoI were to shut down the program, cease paying salaries, or fail to secure alternative employment for the SoIs. More seriously still, SoIs have reported a \"campaign of arrests\" against their members by Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), in Baghdad and Diyala provinces. In late March 2009, the detention of a key SoI leader in Baghdad by the ISF led to localized armed clashes, the detention of scores of SoIs, and the GoI decision to disband that SoI group.", "A third major challenge is the potential for violence in \"the south,\" home to a long-standing and growing competition for power and resources between well-established Shiite political factions backed by militias that have sometimes used violence, and also to tribal Shi'a who may be beginning to find a public voice. Against that volatile backdrop in southern Iraq, both U.S. and Iraqi officials remain concerned about Iranian interventions\u2014economic, social, and sometimes \"military\" in the form of the provision of lethal aid and sponsorship of proxies including Asa'ib al-Haq and Ketaib Hezbollah. Tensions in the south have the potential to be exacerbated by elections, and also by potential drives to form multi-provincial \"regions\" that would enjoy special access to authorities and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Operational Dynamics: Transitions", "paragraphs": ["By the start of 2009, several major but uneven transitions were underway at the operational level in Iraq. First, the substantial security improvements achieved over the course of the \"surge\" had further deepened, with some fluctuations during combat operations in 2008 in specific parts of Iraq, and some remaining insurgent activity, particularly in north central Iraq. In March 2009, the outgoing Commanding General of MNC-I, LTG Austin, characterized the overall situation this way: \"We are close to sustainable security but we're not there yet.\" Concerning the restive north, LTG Austin commented that the problems in Iraq's third-largest city Mosul, in Ninewah province, could still \"put us off track and cause violence to really reignite in a greater way.\" East-central Diyala province, along the Iranian border, with its volatile mix of Kurds, and both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs, also remained a potential flashpoint. Second, accordingly, the focus of U.S. military operations shifted toward stability operations in the south and west, with greater remaining emphasis on COIN in north-central Iraq. ", "Third, the operational capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) continued to grow, reflected in\u2014and catalyzed by\u2014ISF operational experiences in 2008 in Basra, Sadr City, Amarah, Mosul, and Diyala. According to U.S. commanders, the March 2008 ISF operations in Basra, targeting Shiite militias, were poorly planned and required a strong rescue effort by coalition forces. The August 2008 operations in Diyala, targeting affiliates of Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), were planned by the Iraqis in advance but still required coalition forces to provide enablers and to help hold areas once they were cleared.", "A fourth transition was a growth in 2008 in formal Government of Iraq (GoI) security responsibility, antedating the Security Agreement, as additional provinces transitioned to \"provincial Iraqi control\" (PIC). In practice, PIC arrangements varied from province to province but as a rule gave the GoI lead security responsibility\u2014and practice exercising that responsibility\u2014and mandated increased coordination of coalition operations and activities with the GoI. Fifth, as the ISF's basic capabilities improved, the coalition's approaches to training and partnering with the ISF evolved substantially though unevenly across Iraq. In terms of substance, many embedded \"transition teams\" shifted their training focus away from basic \"move, shoot, and communicate\" skills, toward more advanced skills including staff functions and the use of enablers. In terms of organization, the use of various forms of unit-to-unit partnering, which allows advising by example as well as by instruction, and complements the work of transition teams, grew substantially. ", "Sixth, by early 2009, MNF-I was a far less \"multi-national\" force than in the past. By the end of 2008, most remaining coalition partner countries had brought their deployments in Iraq to a close. Major redeployments in late 2008 included the 2,000-strong Georgian contingent; the Poles, who had led Multi-National Division-Center South; and the South Koreans, who had led Multi-National Division-Northeast. Faced with the expiration of the UN mandate authorizing the multi-national force in Iraq, several coalition partners\u2014the United Kingdom, Australia, and Romania\u2014each signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the GoI, providing a new legal basis for the presence of their troops, but each of their mandates is set to expire on July 31, 2009. Seventh, the geographical focus of U.S. forces in Iraq shifted somewhat from north to south, as U.S. forces assumed some battlespaces in the south previously held by coalition partner forces. On March 31, 2009, the Multi-National Division-Center absorbed UK-led Multi-National Division-Southeast, to form the new Multi-National Division-South, under U.S. command, with responsibility for nine provinces. ", "Eighth and finally, as civilian-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) grew, they increasingly took the lead in some efforts formerly spearheaded by the U.S. military. In some cases, including Najaf and Karbala provinces, PRTs operated without a significant nearby U.S. forces presence. Nevertheless, the military's extensive presence on the ground at district and local levels, compared with the limited number of U.S. civilian experts, meant that in practice, the military continued to play a strong \"supporting\" role in helping Iraqis develop civil capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diminishing U.S. Leverage", "paragraphs": ["Meanwhile, U.S. practitioners in Iraq, both civilian and military, have suggested that the appetite of GoI officials to be mentored, advised, or guided by U.S. officials\u2014and thus the leverage that the U.S. government is able to exercise \u2013 is diminishing. In 2008, as Iraqi civilian and military capacity and capabilities grew, and as Iraqi confidence in those capabilities increased, GoI officials demonstrated growing assertiveness and less inclination to consult with U.S. officials before taking action. That approach was manifested, for example, in the decision by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki to launch military operations in Basra in March 2008, and the GoI's unilateral decision to assume full responsibility for Sons of Iraq in fall 2008.

Further, most of those operations were already \"combined\" with Iraqi forces. These transitions had been facilitated by the Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC) process, in which, by decision of the GoI in consultation with MNF-I, lead security responsibility for a given province was transferred to Iraqi control, based on assessments of security conditions and local ISF capabilities. Before the Security Agreement went into effect, 13 of 18 provinces had transitioned to PIC, and PIC arrangements generally required that U.S. operations be coordinated with the GoI. Another common practice, before the Security Agreement, was that the GoI granted approval in advance for U.S. forces to carry out certain categories of activities, or to take action against certain targets. The use of warrant-based arrests\u2014now required\u2014was already frequently practiced in 2008.", "As of early 2009, U.S. commanders on the ground, particularly those in PIC provinces, have reported a smooth transition to operations under the Security Agreement.

It added a caveat: \"Iraq may request from the United States forces temporary support for the Iraqi authorities in the mission of surveillance and control of Iraqi air space.\" The caveat is important because the capabilities of the Iraqi Air Force are still in the very early stages of development and training. In addition, that training has focused, first of all, on skills relevant to the ongoing counter-insurgency (COIN) fight, such as moving troops and supplies, and providing some ISR. U.S. officials have noted that Iraqi officials and commanders on the ground remain aware that they still lack key COIN capabilities such as sufficient ISR and CAS; that they acknowledge that they do not yet have the ability to defend Iraqi airspace; and that they remain eager for the support of U.S. air assets. In late 2008, U.S. officials expressed some confidence that it would be possible to reach agreements on shared use of air space.", "The Security Agreement did not address a parallel concern related to operational coordination: Iraqi coordination with U.S. forces concerning ISF operations. U.S. commanders on the ground report that it is increasingly common for ISF commanders to inform U.S. forces only after they have carried out local operations; some commanders add that these are positive developments in terms of growing ISF capabilities and initiative. At the same time, it could be helpful for U.S. forces to know in advance about significant ISF operations, for two reasons: first, the ISF might call on U.S. forces suddenly, during such operations, to provide key enablers; second, such operations could have an impact on U.S. force protection.", "Article 22 of the Security Agreement described provisions for detainee operations. One set of provisions placed tight constraints on the circumstances under which U.S. forces may take Iraqis into physical custody. Another set of provisions, of even more concern to U.S. commanders on the ground, specified how the cases of those detainees held by coalition forces would be further adjudicated. The Security Agreement mandated that U.S. forces provide information about all detainees held, and stated that Iraqi authorities would \"issue arrest warrants for persons who are wanted by them.\" The agreement required U.S. forces to turn over custody of all \"wanted\" detainees, and then to release all remaining detainees \"in a safe and orderly manner.\"", "In anticipation of a more stringent new detention regime, throughout 2008, MNF-I carried out a detainee release program, releasing detainees to their homes and communities whenever possible.

In many cases, for the detainees it held, the coalition lacked releasable evidence with legal sufficiency in Iraqi courts. Scrupulous collection of evidence\u2014such as photographs, diagrams, eye-witness accounts\u2014common in civilian law enforcement, was not always an integral part of coalition combat operations in Iraq. Such legacy detainees could pose real security threats to the Iraqi population, or to the coalition, commanders warned. Some coalition officials and outside observers also expressed concerns that the GoI adjudication of legacy detainee cases, whether or not legally sufficient evidence exists, might evince a sectarian bias\u2014in particular, a tendency to treat Shiite Arabs more leniently than Sunni Arabs.", "In January 2009, Iraqi and U.S. officials reached an agreement that the U.S. military would transfer 1,500 detainees per month to Iraqi authorities.

Through early 2009, the U.S. military continued to provide some support for small-scale reconstruction initiatives, though unevenly across Iraq.

In 2008, some key steps were taken to amplify U.S. government civilian assistance efforts at the provincial level, including authorization to add 66 civilian subject matter experts, in technical fields including agriculture and business development, to work with the PRTs. However, officials at U.S. Embassy Baghdad and at the Department of State noted that it was likely that peak PRT staffing levels in Iraq had already been reached. In 2008, the Embassy\u2014in response to direction from Congress\u2014began working on \"PRT strategic drawdown\" plans.

In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee in January 2009, describing future plans, Secretary Gates noted: \"The plans that General Odierno has developed in conjunction with Ambassador Crocker foresee that as we consolidate our forces, we would also consolidate our PRTs \u2026 so that the two would be stationed together and our forces would be in a position to continue to protect the civilian element.\" Some officials have suggested that those civil-military relationships might vary geographically, including closer integration\u2014including co-location or even full integration into a single staff structure\u2014where security conditions remain unsettled, and looser partnerships in relatively permissive areas.

In May 2008, the personnel of the PRTs for Najaf and Karbala provinces, who had been operating from a remote base in Hillah, in Babil province, relocated to their respective areas of operation. Najaf and Karbala were both PIC provinces at that time, with limited U.S. military presence. In Najaf, for example, in late 2008, the PRT, including a diverse team of civilian experts and a small U.S. military team that provided them with movement, was based at a small Forward Operating Base (FOB), together with a U.S. Army transition team that worked with the local Iraqi Army battalion and a small U.S. military \"mayor's cell\" that managed the installation.

A key operational issue looking ahead is the likely role of contractors supporting U.S. operations in Iraq as U.S. forces draw down.

For example, one of the three pillars of the mission of Advise and Assist Brigades, after August 2010, is to provide force protection to U.S. government civilians. As of early 2009, that function was performed, in many cases, by private security contractors. At the same time, requirements for some specialized contractor skills\u2014for example, training and advisory support to the ISF \u2013 may increase as the U.S. force presence decreases.", "Another factor shaping the role of contractors may be explicit U.S. policy decisions. On January 31, 2009, MNF-I Commanding General, GEN Odierno, issued a directive instructing subordinate commanders to begin reducing their reliance on international contractors, including both U.S. and \"third-country national\" contractors, by five percent per quarter. The Directive noted that commanders should seek to replace them, where possible, with Iraqi contractors, and added, \"As we transition more responsibility and control to the government of Iraq, it's time to make this change.\" ", "A third factor shaping the role of contractors may be decisions stemming from provisions in the U.S-Iraqi Security Agreement that mandate, \"Iraq shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction over United States contractors and United States contractor employees.\" In some instances, concerns about legal jurisdiction have reportedly prompted efforts by U.S. government agencies to transition key contractors to U.S. Government \"term employee\" status. For example, members of Human Terrain Teams\u2014small teams of academic social scientists who support military units by engaging with the local population and \"mapping\" population characteristics and trends\u2014were employed as contractors by BAE Systems.

Support to the ISF: Some U.S. military equipment and supplies may be required by the ISF to further develop their force\u2014or even urgently required by the ISF to help prosecute the current COIN fight. Support for the war in Afghanistan: Some equipment, no longer required in Iraq, may be needed by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. For example, U.S. Army engineering assets, urgently needed in Afghanistan, may be sent directly from one theater to the other. Stockpiles for future contingencies: Some equipment\u2014particularly heavy equipment\u2014may remain stockpiled in the CENTCOM theater, to support possible future contingencies, pending approval by host nations. Availability of Logistical Support: Redeploying equipment requires logistical support in the form of heavy equipment transports (HETs), whether military or commercial, to provide ground transportation; air assets; sea port capacity, including Kuwait and the Iraqi port of Um Qasr; as well as diplomatic permission from all other relevant host nations for basing, access, and/or overflight.

Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) has been the most prominent named organization, but the threat may be better characterized as a loose network of affiliates, including both Iraqis and foreign fighters. Within the networks, assigned roles range from financiers, and planners of coordinated attacks, to unskilled labor recruited to emplace improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Their efforts to recruit primarily young males have capitalized on Iraq's widespread under-employment, which can make the prospect of one-time payments appealing, and general disaffection spurred by a perceived lack of opportunities in the new Iraq. The infrastructure used by AQI and its affiliates has included safe houses and lines of communication reaching, especially, through central and northern Iraq.", "The network has capitalized on Iraq's porous borders. In 2008, U.S. military commanders confirmed that the flow of foreign fighters continued, from Syria into Iraq. In its March 2009 quarterly report to the Congress, the Department of Defense stated, \"Syria remains the primary gateway for Iraq-bound foreign fighters.\"", "Over time, the AQI network demonstrated adaptability, quickly shifting its tactics and its footprint as circumstances change. Pushed out of urban areas, they typically sought refuge and an opportunity to re-group in deep rural settings. As surge operations pushed AQI and its affiliates out of Baghdad in late 2007, they sought new bases of operation to the east and to the north, in the Diyala River Valley in Diyala province, and in the northern Tigris River Valley in Ninewah province. In early 2008, some AQI elements attempted to regroup in Mosul, but coalition and Iraqi operations pushed AQI elements out of the city and deeper into rural areas.", "As of August 2008, U.S. commanders in Iraq assessed that AQI was in disarray but still capable of conducting spectacular attacks. AQI was making increasing use of \"surgical\" attacks, such as sniper attacks, and using intimidation tactics, which may require fewer resources and less coordination that large-scale catastrophic attacks. In western Anbar province, where significant security progress was achieved earlier than in the north, commanders noted\u2014borrowing from Mao\u2014that there's \"no longer a sea for the AQI fish to swim in;\" that is, popular support for AQI had so sharply diminished that they were forced to operate clandestinely.", "As of the end of 2008, DOD assessed that AQI retained \"limited freedom of movement in rural and some urban areas,\" and that it had both the intent and the ability to \"carry out limited high-profile attacks within key urban center.\" Their strongest base of operations remained Ninewah province, where DOD assessed the city of Mosul to be \"a logistical, financial and operational hub for AQI.\" In January 2009, the new Commanding General of Multi-National Division-North, Major General Robert Caslen, noted that there was still \"a viable insurgency\" in Mosul. February 2009 witnessed a series of attacks on U.S. troops in that region by men wearing Iraqi police uniforms.

A central figure since the days of major combat operations has been the young Shi'a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, the head of the Office of the Martyr Sadr political organization and its armed militia, the Jaish al-Mahdi (\"JAM\"). During the year of formal occupation, al-Sadr frequently delivered Friday sermons at mosques, using a hardline nationalist message to condemn the coalition and its Iraqi partners and to call for action against them. In April 2004, his followers staged coordinated, violent uprisings in cities throughout southern Iraq, which were put down by coalition forces.", "While continuing to voice staunch opposition to the U.S. force presence in Iraq, in August 2007, al-Sadr declared a ceasefire to which most of JAM adhered, and he repeated the call in February 2008. By the summer of 2008, al-Sadr was making efforts to shift the focus of his base organization to social, cultural and political activities, including an umbrella movement called al Mumahiddun , designed to provide social services . At the end of July 2008, Sadr issued a statement pledging his support and that of his followers to the Government of Iraq, if the GoI would refrain from signing any security agreement with the United States. He also urged his followers to refrain from any actions that would harm Iraqi civilians, or disrupt the provision of government services.", "Meanwhile, rogue elements of JAM\u2014known euphemistically as \"special groups\" or \"special groups criminals,\" including Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) \u2013 defied al-Sadr's August 2007 ceasefire call and continued to practice violence. The Office of the Martyr Sadr, insisting that JAM itself was an \"army of believers,\" described such elements as criminal infiltrators who find it useful to have the cover of the JAM name. In November 2008, however, Sadr called for members of the renegade AAH to return to the fold; and he created a new armed wing of his own movement, known as the Promised Day Brigade.", "According to U.S. and Iraqi commanders on the ground, the series of Iraqi-led military operations in southern Iraq, which began in Basra in March 2008, had the effect of isolating some Shiite extremists and forcing others to flee across the border into Iran. The Iranian government has reportedly pledged to help stop the further flow of lethal aid into Iraq, but reports suggest there has been no marked diminution. However, in official reports, the Department of Defense stated that as of March 2009, some Shiite extremist groups, including AAH and Ketaib Hezbollah (KH), continued to receive funding and support from Iran. DOD added that while Tehran has reduced the number of militants that it supports, it has \"simultaneously improved the training and weapon systems received by the proxy militants.\"", "According to officials from the Multi-National Divisions that border Iran, the cross-border flow varies geographically over time, tending to seek the path of least resistance. The deployment of the Georgian full brigade to Wasit province, for example, made that province harder to traverse and pushed traffic north and south. As of August 2008, a key locus of cross-border smuggling\u2014not only of lethal aid but also of consumer goods\u2014was the border along Maysan province, where Marsh Arabs historically have traded goods for centuries.", "U.S. and Iraqi commanders have noted that Quds forces continue to train some Iraqi Shiite extremists, including former special groups members. They added that some infiltrations continued, with the apparent goal of carrying out assassinations or planting improvised explosive devices. They suggested that special groups may attempt to reassert themselves in Iraq, with help from Iran. As one Iraqi commander noted, \"Sadly, our neighbors are not friendly.\" Some U.S. and Iraqi commanders commented that a special groups re-emergence might take the form of a streamlined, well-trained terrorist network with a cellular structure, operating under cover, rather than a mass movement with popular support. In March 2009, Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani noted that the ISF had evidence that Shiite militants were regrouping in Baghdad and some locations in southern Iraq.

Some observers assess that, more than the Sunni-based insurgency or any other issue, the struggle for the Shi'a-populated south may shape Iraq's future. Other main protagonists include Prime Minister Maliki's Da'wa party, and the Islamic Supreme Council in Iraq (ISCI, formerly known as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq), which is backed by its Badr militia and which, like JAM, provides people with goods and services in an effort to extend its influence. The power struggle also includes smaller Shi'a political parties backed by militias, such as Fadila al-Islamiyah (Islamic Virtue), which is active in the major southern city and province of Basra.", "Relatively new to the power struggle are the ground-up voices of southern tribal leaders, most of whom stayed in Iraq through the Saddam period, unlike many Iraqi Shi'a political party leaders who spent years in Iran. Recognizing the largely untapped potential political power of southern tribal Shi'a, in 2008 Prime Minister Maliki sought to form consultative tribal isnad (\"support\") councils, first of all in Shi'a-populated areas including the southern provinces, which were supposed to articulate tribal needs to the provincial councils. In at least one case, Babil province, the governor sought to form a competing provincial tribal council. By late 2008, Maliki had expanded the effort to mixed-population provinces including Ninewah, Kirkuk, and Diyala, prompting protests from some senior officials. A number of observers viewed the support councils as a blatant \"get-out-the-vote\" initiative.", "Key political events have the potential to exacerbate the contest for political power and influence in the south. In April 2008, an 18-month moratorium expired on the implementation of a 2006 law on federalism, which included provisions for the creation of \"regions\" based on one or more provinces. \"Regional\" status could prove important because it affects the distribution of economic resources and political power. Major Shi'a groups in the south have called for various approaches to regionalization, based on their popular bases of support \u2013 for example, ISCI has advocated the creation of a nine-province in southern Iraq. Iran, too, has reportedly expressed interest in how southern Iraq might be regionally grouped. In 2008, local political parties and organizations in Basra took the first steps to seek regionalization of Basra province, by organizing a petition drive, but the effort failed to secure the required 140,000 signatures.", "In late 2008, some Iraqi provincial political leaders and security forces commanders in southern Iraq suggested that the several rounds of elections scheduled to be held in 2009\u2014provincial, district, and national\u2014carried the potential for violence, in part because many incumbents recognized that they might not have enough popular support to be elected. Others have stressed the importance of those elections as a safety valve for popular opinion. The results of the provincial elections held on January 31, 2009, reshuffled the balance of political power in southern provinces. Prime Minister Maliki's Da'wa party substantially increased its representation, earning pluralities in Baghdad and southern provinces, while ISCI lost significant ground, and some parties backed by al Sadr secured some support.

Efforts have been underway since that time, in coordination with the Iraqi government and the many countries of citizenship of the MeK members, to determine appropriate further disposition.

Its mixed population of about 290,000 includes Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and Yezidis. From April 2003 until early 2004, the 101 st Airborne Division had responsibility for Ninewah and Iraq's three northern, largely Kurdish-populated provinces. Because the north was relatively quiet, due in part to the effectiveness of the Kurdish pesh merga forces, the 101 st was able to concentrate primarily on Ninewah\u2014a relatively high troops-to-population ratio. In early 2004, when the 101 st redeployed, responsibility for the area passed to a much smaller Stryker brigade. That brigade, in turn, was periodically asked to provide forces for operations elsewhere in Iraq, so the coalition force footprint in Ninewah was substantially reduced.

McMaster, arrived in Tal Afar. COL McMaster was familiar with OIF issues from his previous service as the Director of GEN Abizaid's Commander's Action Group at CENTCOM. At CENTCOM, he had helped the command to think through the nature of the Iraqi insurgency, and to craft appropriate responses including targeted engagements with key leaders. As the author of a well-known account of Vietnam decision-making, COL McMaster could also readily draw key lessons from that earlier complex engagement.", "In early 2005, the 3ACR began their deployment preparations at home in Fort Carson, Colorado\u2014studying COIN approaches, training and exercising those approaches, and learning conversational Arabic. Later, in Iraq, COL McMaster described the Regiment's mission in the classical COIN lexicon of \"population security\": \"...the whole purpose of the operation is to secure the population so that we can lift the enemy's campaign of intimidation and coercion over the population and allow economic and political development to proceed here and to return to normal life.\"", "In practice, that meant taking \"a very deliberate approach to the problem,\" beginning with months of preparatory moves. Those preparatory steps included beefing up security along the Syrian border to the west, and targeting and eliminating enemy safe havens out in the desert. They also included constructing a dirt berm ringing Tal Afar, and establishing check points to control movement in and out of the city.", "Before the launch of full-scale operations in September 2005, the Regiment urged civilians to leave Tal Afar. Then 3ACR cleared the city deliberately\u2014block by block. After the clearing operations, 3ACR had sufficient forces to hold the city, setting up 29 patrol bases around town, every few blocks.", "Basing coalition forces among the population was an unusual approach at the time. Though common in the early days of OIF, by 2005, most coalition forces in Iraq had been pulled back to relatively large Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), secure and separate from the local population. That strategy was driven in part by the theory that the visible presence of coalition forces\u2014and their weapons and their heavy vehicles\u2014could antagonize local communities.", "3ACR's COIN approaches also included working closely with their Iraqi security forces counterparts\u2014the 3 rd Iraqi Army Division.

As early as 2003, some U.S. practitioners in Iraq had suggested that substantial political and economic progress could not be expected, absent basic security conditions that allowed Iraqis to leave their homes, and civilian coalition personnel to engage with local communities. The New Way Forward institutionalized that view.", "The theory of the case was that security improvements would open up space and opportunities for the Iraqi government to make improvements in other areas. As General David Petraeus described it in March 2007, one month into his tour as the MNF-I Commander, if security improves, \"commerce will return and local economies will grow.\" And at the same time, \"the Iraqi government will have the chance it needs to resolve some of the difficult issues it faces.\"", "By early 2008, the basic premise had met with broad if not universal support among practitioners and observers. For example, in October 2007, Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Conway told a think-tank audience, \"Certainly you have to have a level of security before you can have governance.\" Retired Marine Corps General James Jones, who led a congressionally mandated review of Iraqi Security Forces in 2007, described it differently. He suggested that the relationship between two major components of politics and security\u2014national reconciliation and sectarian violence\u2014is more complex: \"It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg question....

The January 2008 mission statement of one division provides a good illustration of the new priorities\u2014population security first, with a view to laying the groundwork for future transition. The division, \"in participation with Iraqi security forces and the provincial government, secures the population, neutralizes insurgents and militia groups, and defeats terrorists and irreconcilable extremists, to establish sustainable security and set conditions for transition to tactical overwatch and Iraqi security self-reliance.\"", "The surge aimed to provide \"population security\" not merely with greater troop strength, but also by changing some of the approaches those troops used. One major emphasis was population control\u2014including the extensive use of concrete barriers, checkpoints, curfews, and biometric technologies for identification including fingerprinting and retinal scans.", "In April 2007, some key Baghdad neighborhoods were entirely sealed off using these approaches, prompting the use of the moniker \"gated communities.\" In an Op-Ed piece, Multi-National Corps-Iraq Commander Lieutenant General Ray Odierno explained that the gated communities were \"being put up to protect the Iraqi population by hindering the ability of terrorists to carry out the car bombings and suicide attacks.\" As counter-insurgency expert Dave Kilcullen described it, \"once an area is cleared and secured, with troops on the ground, controls make it hard to infiltrate or intimidate ... and thus [they] also protect the population.\"", "Some initial press coverage took note of some citizens' dismay at the tighter controls that gated communities brought.

Retired General Jack Keane, a strong surge advocate, noted, \"We're going to secure the population for the first time.

The significantly higher demand for CAS, he noted, was less a reflection of a deliberate strategy to use more air power, than a natural result of a significantly larger number of U.S. troops, working significantly more closely with Iraqi counterparts and in local neighborhoods, and getting better information that made target identification much easier.

A U.S. BCT commander in Diyala reported in January 2009 that he partners with every Iraqi brigade, battalion, squad and platoon in his area of responsibility. He stated, \"We take our tactics, techniques, procedures and our skill sets, and we rub up against them extremely hard. And the end result is that we rub off on them.\"", "Across Iraq, some U.S. units have also partnered with units from other Iraqi security forces\u2014a brigade in Baghdad, for example, described a growing partnership with the Iraqi police. However, unit partnering is both time- and personnel-intensive, and in some cases operational requirements have not permitted U.S. forces to unit-partner with all of the ISF in their battle space.", "Like ISF training in general, unit partnering is a dynamic endeavor\u2014it is designed to boost the capabilities of Iraqi units, and at some stage of improvement a unit's need for a close partnership diminishes. As of early 2009, ISF units had reached quite varied stages of development\u2014many, in the views of U.S. commanders, were very proficient, while others had just been formed, and the Government of Iraq has stated the intention to form still others.", "More so than the use of embedded teams, unit partnership requires a robust U.S. forces presence, and it may become more difficult to practice as U.S. forces in Iraq draw down. It seems that U.S. commanders, in more widely institutionalizing unit partnerships in 2008, decided to make maximum use of time and presence remaining in Iraq\u2014whatever that might be.

The commission benefitted from the participation of many senior leaders with years of experience in policing as well as military matters, and from spending considerable time in Iraq with the ISF. In its September 2007 Report , the commission concluded, somewhat pessimistically, that \"... in the next 12 to 18 months, there will be continued improvement in their [ISF] readiness and capability, but not the ability to operate independently.\"", "Later that year, retired General Barry McCaffrey concluded that the picture had improved somewhat, and that the ISF were making operational contributions.

As one leader with multiple tours in Iraq noted, improved ISF capabilities were the single biggest difference between January 2008 and several years earlier. Operationally, another leader observed, \"the Iraqis are holding their ground, responsible for their own turf.\" Regularly in 2008, at the daily MNC-I Battle Update Assessments, Division Commanders described to the MNC-I Commander operations carried out unilaterally, or with coalition tactical overwatch, by Iraqi forces.", "By fall 2008, U.S. commanders on the ground in Iraq were consistently praising the tactical-level capabilities of their Iraqi counterparts. The Department of Defense argued in June 2008 that in operations in Basra, Mosul and Sadr City, the ISF \"demonstrated their capability to conduct simultaneous extensive operations in three parts of the country.\" One senior U.S. commander noted, \"They can move themselves around the battlefield.\" In March 2009, DOD confirmed the assessment of growing ISF operational capabilities, including their increasing use of after action reviews (AARs) but added: \"The ISF continue to rely on the Coalition for logistics, fire support, close air support, communications, planning assistance, and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\" In February 2009, Lieutenant General Frank Helmick, MNSTC-I Commanding General, stated that the ISF \"are getting better every day, and they have in large measure provided much of the security posture that we have in this country right now. So they are doing okay, but we have a long way to go.\"", "Among Iraqis themselves, there appeared to be a range of views concerning the readiness of the ISF to operate independently. According to MNC-I, Iraqi operational commanders stress that they still want a close partnership with U.S. forces. In August 2008, one Iraqi Army division commander asserted that the United States should maintain combat forces in Iraq for another five years, to work with Iraqi counterparts. In contrast, according to some U.S. officials, the perception of some senior Iraqi civilian officials is that the ISF are ready, or very nearly ready, to maintain security independently. At a press conference in September 2008, seemingly striking a middle path, Minister of Defense Abd al-Qadir noted that the Government of Iraq expects to have a security force completely able to provide security to the Iraqi people on its own, by 2011 or the beginning of 2012.", "In the views of many coalition advisors, the biggest long-term challenges faced by the Iraqi Security Forces as a whole may be institutional, rather than operational. These include improving ministerial capacity and effectiveness; clarifying chains of command; and crafting long-term, integrated force modernization plans for personnel and equipment.", "In early fall 2008, MNF-I and MNSTC-I officials stressed the critical importance of civilian ministerial capacity. The practical challenges of growing and developing the Iraqi force are likely to continue for many years, they noted. But if the right, able civilian leadership is in place, they will be able to make needed decisions and solve problems as they arise. In March 2009, DOD flatly assessed: \"Many of the Iraqi civilians working in positions inside the MoD and MoI are not yet fully trained and qualified for their positions.\"", "Current de facto chains of command within and among the Iraqi Security Forces reflect the exigencies of the GoI's ongoing counter-insurgency (COIN) efforts. To help coordinate the efforts of the various ISF in given geographical areas, the GoI created provincially-based operations commands that report up directly to the office of the Prime Minister. For some observers, the Prime Minister's direct access to the operations commands has raised concerns about potential misuse of the ISF for personal or even sectarian purposes.", "In some cases, the operations command arrangements have created tensions with provincial-level officials, who would ordinarily exercise greater control over some provincial-level security forces. The arrangements have also created some tensions with parent ministries in Baghdad\u2014and in particular with the Interior Ministry, which apparently views the IA-led operations commands as \"MoD-centric.\" The commands also create some practical confusion, since units still rely on their parent organizations for supplies and logistical support. For example, as of August 2008, Baghdad was divided into two area commands: \"Karkh\" and \"Rusafa.\" Under each were two Iraqi Army (IA) divisions and one National Police (NP) division. Each division staff included representatives of the IA, NPs, and the Iraqi Police. Both IA and NP brigades fell under both IA and NP division headquarters. U.S. commanders working closely with these Iraqi units reported that this Iraqi experiment with jointness was working well at the tactical level, but became complicated when units turned to their respective ministries for support. ", "Long-term force modernization planning and execution is another challenge for the ISF, in terms of both cost and strategic requirements. The current force continues to train and prepare for the ongoing counter-insurgency fight against Sunni and Shi'a extremists. Eventually, it is envisaged that the force will shift into a more typical division of labor\u2014and train and equip themselves accordingly\u2014in which MoD forces focus externally, and the Iraqi police, backed up by the National Police, provide domestic security.", "For civilian and military leaders of the ISF, one major challenge is balancing near-term security challenges with long-term requirements. In August 2008, Iraqi ground commanders were all focused completely on the current fight, while senior civilian ministry officials were looking out toward the future division of labor. At a press conference in September 2008, Minister of Defense Abd al-Qadir, speaking about the Iraqi police, stated that \"it is their job to protect the citizen and our job to protect the frontier.\"", "By mid-2008, the Iraqi MoD had demonstrated keen interest in buying equipment for a future, outward-looking force\u2014including tanks and fighter aircraft. DOD assessed in December 2008 that the \"MoD has been overly focused on purchases for its steady-state force (2012 and beyond) rather than fundamental training, equipping, and sustaining shortfalls for its current force.\" Senior U.S. advisors have expressed concerns about still-nascent Iraqi abilities to effectively identify, fund, and contract for future requirements. Some add that the approach of some Iraqi officials appears to be based on traditional \"bazaar culture,\" in which the goal is getting the lowest price, with little consideration for long-term maintenance or interoperability. In September 2008, the MoD signed the first letters of offer and acceptance (LOA) through the foreign military sales (FMS) program, for M1A1 tanks, armored reconnaissance helicopters, and C-130J transport aircraft.", "Some coalition advisors have noted that one of the greatest challenges for the ISF may be overcoming lingering sectarianism. The ISF as a whole is one of the most powerful national-level Iraqi institutions. A resurgence of sectarianism in the ranks could potentially turn key tools of the Iraqi government\u2014the capabilities of its security forces\u2014into potential threats to the unified whole state.", "Some Iraqi government officials, in turn, have expressed concerns about the size and scope of the ISF compared to other Iraqi government institutions. The more resources dedicated to the ISF, the more powerful the ISF will become, and the fewer resources that will be available for other government institutions.

In December 2007, Major General Joseph Fil, the out-going commander of Multi-National Division-Baghdad (MND-B), commented on the status of the Baghdad Operational Command, which has responsibility for Baghdad province and the two Iraqi Army divisions then under its command. MG Fil noted, \"They are making good tactical decisions. They are planning true operations that involve multiple forces, combined operations that are frequently intelligence-driven.\" In January 2008, the Commanding General of Multi-National Division-North (MND-N), noted that the four different Iraqi Army divisions he partnered with were \"growing in size and capacity every day.\" He commented, \"Where we can't be, they can be, and in many cases we're conducting operations with them.\"", "By early 2008, some IA units had also developed the ability to move themselves across Iraq. As part of Operation Phantom Phoenix, the 3 rd Brigade of the 1 st Iraqi Army Division deployed independently, with less than a week's notice, from Al Anbar province in the west to Diyala in the east to support combat operations in the Diyala River Valley. According to MNF-I leaders, while not as attention-grabbing as combat operations, the move demonstrated a different but very important set of capabilities that Iraqi units will need to master, to operate independently in the future.", "In August 2008, U.S. commanders noted that most of the IA units that had participated in operations in Basra, Sadr City, Amarah, Diyala, and Mosul had performed very well at the tactical level.

In March 2009, DOD reported that \"IA brigade and division staffs continue to show steady improvement in planning and executing combined and joint operations, intelligence gathering, information operations, civil-military operations, and limited post-conflict reconstruction operations.\" One BCT commander stated: \"It is now routine for the Iraqi brigade commanders that I partner with to develop their own plans for operations, issue their orders to their battalions, and then expect and demand that those orders are carried out\u2026Increasingly they do it independently, and they come to me on a much more reduced basis for specific help with certain enablers that they may not have yet.\"", "The list of the major developmental challenges faced by the Iraqi Army\u2014building a strong leadership cadre, and developing key enablers such as logistics\u2014has remained relatively consistent over time, although commanders and advisors on the ground point to specific incremental marks of progress in each area.", "Like all the other Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi Army has faced the challenge of quickly developing a capable leadership cadre. As many U.S. military commanders in Iraq point out, a basic problem is that leadership abilities depend in part on experience\u2014their production cannot easily be \"accelerated.\" The IA's leadership challenge may be more acute than that faced by the other security forces, since it is both large and, unlike the Iraqi Police, a nationally based service whose leaders must be able to command diverse mixes of soldiers in all regions of Iraq.", "In December 2006, the Iraq Study Group pointed out simply that the Iraqi Security Forces lacked leadership. In September 2007, the Jones Commission also noted that the Army was \"short of seasoned leadership at all levels,\" and pointed in particular to \"marginal leadership at senior military and civilian positions both in the Ministry of Defense and in the operational commands.\" In congressional testimony in January 2008, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mark Kimmitt indicated that the most important gap was in mid-level leadership \u2014non-commissioned officers and field grade officers, who are required in far greater numbers than senior leaders. To help redress the situation, the Iraqi Army launched several initiatives, including accelerated officer commissioning for university graduates, waivers to time-in-grade or time-in-service promotion requirements, and recruitment of former Army officers and Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs). It is possible that it will prove easier to generate leaders \"on paper,\" than to accelerate generation of leadership qualities.", "In practice, the quality of IA leadership varies somewhat. MND-N noted in August 2008 that the Commanding Generals of the four IA divisions in their area of responsibility were \"very good.\" One of the more impressive IA leaders, according to U.S. officials, is Major General Oothman, the Commanding General of the 8 th IA Division, headquartered in Diwaniyah, in Qadisiyah province. In August 2008, echoing U.S. military counter-insurgency thinking\u2014and helping institutionalize it in the IA\u2014MG Oothman stated, \"Today's fight is a 360-degree battlefield,\" and explained that \"once you clear an area, you have to put in Iraqi Police, the Iraqi Army and coalition forces to hold it.\"", "On the other hand, MND-B officials noted that leadership selection processes varied in quality. In August 2008, the newly selected commanding general of the newly formed 17 th IA division was a well-regarded, competent brigade commander\u2014a good choice. But in some other cases, MND-B officials noted, the choices have been \"terrible\"\u2014reflections not of competence but of political connections that make the selected leaders \"untouchable\" by their military chains of command.", "Another major challenge to the continued progress of the Iraqi Army is developing key enablers, ranging from intelligence to logistics\u2014which are absolutely essential to an Army's ability to operate independently.", "In December 2006, the Iraq Study Group pointed out that the Iraqi Army lacked logistics and support to sustain their own operations. Later, in September 2007, the Jones Commission called logistics the Army's \"Achilles' heel,\" and observed: \"The lack of logistics experience and expertise within the Iraqi armed forces is substantial and hampers their readiness and capability.\" The Commission further concluded that the Army would continue to rely on coalition forces for combat support and combat service support\u2014though the Commission did not estimate for how long that reliance would continue.", "Testifying before Congress in January 2008, then-MNSTC-I Commander LTG Dubik agreed that the Army \"... cannot fix, supply, arm or fuel themselves completely enough at this point.\" As of March 2008, the Army was able to feed itself\u2014a key component of life support. As of June 2008, the Army's maintenance backlog continued, but the backlog had been \"stabilized\" and the IA had better visibility than previously on what needs to be repaired. As of August 2008, the IA was continuing to develop a national-level maintenance and supply system, including the new National Depot at Taji, to serve as the \"centerpiece\" for national supply and maintenance services. The Depot is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009\u2014a target date that has slipped several times.

So there's some work to be done yet.", "Iraqi counterparts agree with this assessment. In August 2008, MG Oothman stated flatly, \"I see no progress in logistics.\" He explained that the Iraqi Army started building its forces by concentrating first on operations, not on logistics or other enablers, such as repairing HMMWVVs, or providing spare parts, or building military hospitals.

A small ePRT, with responsibility for a given district, might work closely with that district council, but due to personnel and resource constraints, the ePRT might have difficulty working equally closely and frequently with all of the subordinate neighborhood councils within that district.", "Military units are likely to have far more frequent interactions with Iraqi officials. Battalion commanders meet regularly with neighborhood councils, Civil Affairs units and other military staff work continually with local officials on essential services and other public works projects, and Captains and their staffs at Joint Security Stations\u2014and their ISF counterparts\u2014meet often with local officials who use the JSSs as community meeting sites.", "In August 2008, for example, PRT and BCT officials described their division of labor: the BCT commander engages the provincial governor, battalion commanders engage the district councils, and company commanders engage sub-district councils and groups of local mukhtars . The PRT, in turn, focuses on the provincial government, helping tie it more closely into the national government. The PRT also mentors young military officers in governance work.", "A central and long-standing focus of coalition governance efforts is helping Iraqis achieve connectivity between the top-down national ministries and their appointed representatives for each province, on one hand, and the ground-up provincial and local governments chosen by local populations, on the other. Military commanders in every region have attested that provincial officials have no authority over\u2014and little relationship with\u2014the ministerially appointed representatives for their province. In August 2008, one division commander explained, \"Where the military can help is in building informal bridges among tribal councils, the Iraqi Security Forces, and local government\u2014and it still needs a forcing function at the national level.\"", "As described by Colonel Tom James, commander of the 4 th BCT of 3 rd Infantry Division, stationed south of Baghdad in early 2008, \"One of the things we really focused on is linkages, making sure that local governments are representative of the people, and they they're linked to higher governments so that we can process, prioritize, and resource the people that need things.\"", "Current governance efforts by coalition forces include fostering connectivity among the levels of government by mentoring Iraqi interlocutors at each level. For example, in one town south of Baghdad, community leaders were apparently frustrated because they felt disconnected from the deliberations of the nearest local council. The Army Captain leading the JSS in the city started bringing local community leaders together regularly, helping them to articulate and prioritize their concerns. Coalition forces then connected that informal body with the Iraqi officials formally chosen to represent that area. That mentoring was then backed up by higher levels of the Captain's chain of command, on their frequent visits.", "In one area of Baghdad, a Brigade Commander and representatives of his subordinate units regularly reviewed the membership of all the local councils, based on the units' frequent interactions with them, checking for vacancies, for the presence of \"outsiders\" from outside a given neighborhood, and for roughly accurate reflections of the demographic balance. Where local councils fell short, the units that regularly engaged them pointed out the concerns to them and urged improvement.", "In the views of many commanders, PRTs and ePRTs are simply not robust enough to conduct the governance mission comprehensively.

In 2008, one economic focus for the military was neighborhood economic revitalization\u2014usually measured in terms of the number of small shops opened. The first shops to reopen in a neighborhood, as security improves, typically included fruit and vegetable stands, and shops selling convenience foods like bottles of soda. To facilitate that process, commanders sometimes sought a local Iraqi partner to serve as the primary contractor for reconstruction in a neighborhood, and to encourage other local entrepreneurs to come onboard. By January 2008, in addition, military commanders, were tasked to keep an eye open for potential \"medium-sized businesses\" to support.", "Commanders have also been able to make available micro-grants, through a Department of Defense program, which allowed them to provide fledgling Iraqi businesses with start-up funds ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars, to purchase equipment or raw materials. For example, in early 2008, a micro-grant enabled one man in Baghdad to buy power saws and raw wood to jumpstart his furniture-making business.", "In August 2008, one BCT commander noted, \"We've had great success reopening small businesses!\" But both civilian and military officials in Iraq note that the number of open shops may be a better gauge of the security climate in a community\u2014how safe the local population feels\u2014than of economic revitalization. Longer-term, sustainable development, civilian and military officials note, requires not just local shops but also production\u2014which in turn requires sustainable and secure systems of supply and distribution, as well as a customer base. Civilian development experts in Iraq caution that this will simply take time.", "In August 2008, U.S. Embassy officials explained that imposing economic policy discipline in the regions\u2014among PRTs as well as military units\u2014is a challenge. This may help explain what some called the \"great poultry debate\" of 2008. In mid-2008, as part of the search for sustainable economic activity, some military and PRT officials proposed supporting the development of domestic poultry and egg farming. Some argued that such a business required relatively low start-up costs, and would provide both employment and income for local families. Officials at the U.S. Embassy, and some civilian and military practitioners in the field, countered that such efforts stood little chance of being profitable\u2014it cost $2 to buy a chicken to eat from Brazil, while a domestic Iraqi chicken would cost much more than that, given the costs of importing feed and cooling the chickens and their eggs. One BCT commander noted, \"poultry farming is a big deal for us,\" while a senior Embassy official countered, \"There's no business plan.\"", "Meanwhile, military commanders have continued to make use of the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP), which provides brigade commanders with discretionary funding for a wide array of projects. As of mid-2008, the majority of CERP funding was being used to support essential services, and other sustained initiatives such as the Sons of Iraq program. Anecdotally, in some instances, CERP may have lost some of its initial flexibility\u2014in the accounts of several BCT commanders, who earlier had been free to spend CERP funds at their own discretion, they had recently been required to seek approval from their Division headquarters to spend CERP money.", "As of August 2008, there was no formal requirement for military units to coordinate CERP spending with Iraqi officials or with PRT or ePRT counterparts, and some OPA and PRT officials have raised concerns about insufficient civil/military coordination. Division, Brigade and Battalion Commanders have noted that most projects nominated for CERP support are initially put forward by local Iraqi officials and residents. Further, although it is not mandated, the military typically cross-walks proposed initiatives with the existing plans of local Iraqi councils. In Kirkuk, BCT and PRT officials noted that they share all project information and coordinate with Iraqis \"at stage one of any project.\" In Baghdad, one PRT and its ePRT partner noted that they coordinate on all projects and select the most expedient source of funding, and that they coordinate all projects with the appropriate Iraqi body\u2014the right Ministry, district council, or neighborhood council.", "In 2008, some Members of Congress expressed frustration with the extensive use of CERP on projects either that might not be necessary, or that the Iraqis might be able to pay for themselves. Some civilian officials in Baghdad shared the concern about the use of CERP. Too-liberal use of CERP funding, some have argued, could counteract the broad policy goal of encouraging Iraqis to solve as many problems as possible by themselves. As an example, one official, pointing to a summer 2008 proposal by one division to spend $62 million on an electrification project, noted, \"We're getting out of that kind of business.\" The big problem, one official observed in August 2008, is that \"we're not giving Iraqis the freedom to fail.\" Some military commanders on the ground shared that concern\u2014one noted in August 2008, \"We've wasted a lot of CERP money in the past.\" In September 10, 2008, testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman noted that DOD was in the process of reviewing and refining the criteria for the use of CERP.", "Meanwhile, in 2008, some transitions in the use of CERP were underway, due in part to the GoI's introduction of Iraqi CERP (I-CERP)\u2014GoI funds that U.S. forces may help Iraqi counterparts spend. Multi-National Force-West officials noted in August 2008 that they were \"giving CERP money back,\" a conscious decision to help make the Iraqi system work. Instead of CERP, the Marines were spending I-CERP.

That gradual growth was punctuated by sharp upward spikes at key Iraqi political junctures, including the January 2005 elections and the October 2005 constitutional referendum, and, less sharply, during Ramadan each year. After July 2007, the overall level of attacks declined sharply, punctuated by a spike during Iraqi and coalition operations in Basra and Sadr City, in March 2008.

MNF-I reports that beginning in July and August 2007, after all the \"surge\" forces had arrived in Iraq, the level of civilian deaths fell sharply and then continued to decline through January 2008, a decline of over 72%.

In late 2007, one of the deadliest forms of IEDs in use was the explosively formed penetrator (EFP), supplied as a rule from Iran. EFP use declined in late 2007 but experienced a brief upsurge in early 2008, before declining again through early 2009. In November 2007, a new and very deadly threat appeared\u2014improvised rocket-assisted mortars (IRAMs).

In August 2008, the most recent IED \"innovation\" was the use of building-borne IEDs, that is, buildings wired to explode, and the use of female suicide bombers increased markedly. Late 2008 saw the rise of \"sticky IEDs\"\u2014small bombs attached magnetically to the under-sides of vehicles, and set off by remote control or timer.

Moreover, commanders noted, those factors were made particularly effective by their interaction effects\u2014for example, coalition personnel with previous service in Iraq, making use of more sophisticated technologies.", "The most fundamental factor may have been what former MNF-I Commanding General, General David Petraeus, has called a shift in the \"intellectual construct\" from an emphasis on transition\u2014a quick hand-over to Iraqis\u2014to a counter-insurgency (COIN) focus on achieving population security. Another key COIN component of that intellectual construct was recognizing the need to separate the irreconcilables from the reconcilables\u2014as GEN Petraeus observed, \"You're not going to kill your way out of an insurgency.\"", "Additional key factors frequently cited by commanders in Iraq include targeted operations by special operations forces; operations and much greater presence by conventional coalition forces; operations, presence, and greatly improved capabilities of Iraqi Security Forces; the rejection of extremists by the \"awakening\" movements; efforts by the Sons of Iraq and other security volunteers, and Muqtada al-Sadr's ceasefire and separation from the violent \"special groups\" wings of his organization.", "In addition, according to commanders, in recent years, far more intelligence assets became available in-country, and at lower levels of command, greatly improving commanders' ability to make decisions and respond in a timely way. New technologies\u2014particularly rapidly fielded counter-IED equipment and approaches\u2014helped coalition forces against the adversaries' deadliest weapons and saved lives.", "Not only did various components of force contribute to the fight, their efforts were far better integrated than they were several years ago, and that integration also helps explain security improvements to date. For example, commanders note that the air component increased the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets available to ground commanders, to support and inform their operations. The greater ground forces presence, and the better information from Iraqis that it generated, in turn, made possible the more frequent and more effective use of air strikes.", "Commanders on the ground have noted that the increasingly sophisticated technologies available to SOF have strengthened their efforts to kill or capture high-value targets. Commanders have stressed, however, that \"you can't get Al Qaeda by just using SOF.\" MNF-I officials have noted that coalition forces tried the SOF-only approach in Ramadi for four years, but it ultimately proved insufficient. They add that SOF is most effective when it draws on conventional forces' intimate knowledge of local communities, based on the close contacts conventional forces have with ISF, SOIs, and local tribes. Then, following SOF actions, conventional forces play the essential role of \"holding\" the area, with a strong, visible presence.", "Finally, as many practitioners on the ground have pointed out, by the time of the surge, force leaders, staff, commanders, and troops in the field typically brought significant previous Iraq experience to the mission. Most leaders and commanders have served at least one previous tour in Iraq, and their familiarity with Iraqi governing structures, basic laws, and customs, is markedly greater than the limited knowledge the first coalition teams brought to Iraq.
