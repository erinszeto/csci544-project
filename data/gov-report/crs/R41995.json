The growing backlog of applications awaiting examiner review could potentially lead to long delays in the time the USPTO requires to grant patents. Extended USPTO delays in reviewing applications may increase industrial uncertainty about whether a patent will cover a particular technology or not. Lengthy approval delays may also decrease the usefulness of the patent system for industries subject to a brisk pace of technological change, as a patent on an invention that is rapidly becoming obsolete has limited value.", "The USPTO has long strived to approve only those patent applications that meet the statutory requirements for obtaining a patent. Because they meet all the requirements imposed by the Patent Act, quality patents may be dependably enforced in court and employed as a technology transfer tool. In contrast, improvidently granted patents may require firms to spend considerable resources either obtaining a license or mounting a legal challenge to the patent.

Under current law, each application is then placed into queue for eventual review by officials known as examiners.", "The USPTO publishes most, but not all, pending patent applications \"promptly after the expiration of a period of 18 months\" from the filing date. Among the applications that are not published prior to grant are those that the applicant represents will not be the subject of patent protection abroad. In particular, if an applicant certifies that the invention disclosed in the U.S. application will not be the subject of a patent application in another country that requires publication of applications 18 months after filing, then the USPTO will not publish the application.", "USPTO officials known as examiners then determine whether the invention disclosed in the application merits the award of a patent. The USPTO examiner will consider a number of legal requirements, including whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention. In particular, the application must enable persons skilled in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation. In addition, the application must disclose the \"best mode,\" or preferred way, that the applicant knows to practice the invention.", "The examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute. To be patentable, an invention must meet four primary requirements. First, the invention must fall within at least one category of patentable subject matter. According to the Patent Act, an invention that is a \"process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\" is eligible for patenting. Second, the invention must be useful, a requirement that is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit. Third, the invention must be novel, or different, from subject matter disclosed by an earlier patent, publication, or other state-of-the-art knowledge. Finally, an invention is not patentable if \"the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" This requirement of \"nonobviousness\" prevents the issuance of patents claiming subject matter that a skilled artisan would have been able to implement in view of the knowledge of the state of the art.", "If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, its owner obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States the patented invention. Those who engage in those acts without the permission of the patentee during the term of the patent can be held liable for infringement. Adjudicated infringers may be enjoined from further infringing acts. The patent statute also provides for an award of damages \"adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer.\"", "The maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed. At the end of that period, others may employ that invention without regard to the expired patent. Although patent term is based upon the filing date, the patentee gains no enforceable legal rights until the USPTO allows the application to issue as a granted patent. A number of Patent Act provisions may modify the basic 20-year term, including examination delays at the USPTO and delays in obtaining marketing approval for the patented invention from other federal agencies.", "Like most rights, those provided by a patent are not self-enforcing. Patent owners who wish to compel others to respect their proprietary interests must commence enforcement proceedings, which most commonly consist of litigation in the federal courts. Although issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, accused infringers may assert that a patent is invalid or unenforceable on a number of grounds.

In addition, a USPTO examiner in 2009 would not review a patent application until, on average, 25.8 months after it was filed. The \"first action pendency\" during 2000 was 13.6 months. Many observers believe that if current conditions continue, the backlog and delay are likely to grow at the USPTO in coming years.", "Long delays for patent approvals may negatively impact high technology industries by increasing uncertainty about the availability and scope of patent rights. For market segments that feature a rapid pace of innovation and short product cycles, such as consumer electronics, lengthy USPTO delays may also significantly devalue the patent right. Put simply, by the time a patent issues, the entire industry might have moved on to more advanced technologies. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke reportedly described the length of time the USPTO requires to issue patents as \"unacceptable,\" explaining that \"[t]his delay causes uncertainty for inventors and entrepreneurs and impedes our economic recovery.\" USPTO Director David Kappos recently opined that \"[e]very quality patent application that sits on the shelf represents jobs not created.\"", "In addition, under current law, USPTO delays may qualify certain patents for an extension of term. For example, if the UPSTO does not respond to an application within 14 months of the day it is filed, the term of a patent that results from that application is extended by one day for each day of delay. Given that the average first action pendency is now almost 26 months, this rule of \"Patent Term Adjustment\" may cause many U.S. patents to have a term that exceeds 20 years.

When inventors, investors, managers, and other stakeholders possess confidence that patents are reliably enforceable, they are said to have increased incentives to innovate, to finance research and development, and to bring new technologies into the marketplace. ", "In contrast, poor patent quality may encourage activity that is not socially productive. Private parties may be required to engage in extensive due diligence efforts in order to determine whether individual issued patents would be enforced by a court or not. Entrepreneurial speculators may find it easy to obtain patents that can then be enforced against manufacturers and service providers. Patent owners and investors may also be negatively impacted. A patentee may make managerial decisions, such as building production facilities or hiring workers, based upon their expectation of exclusive rights in a particular invention. If a patent is declared invalid by a court, the patent owner\u2014along with his financial backers\u2014is stripped of this intellectual property right without compensation.", "The goal of consistently high levels of patent quality may pose a considerable challenge for the USPTO. Increasingly complex technologies appear to have resulted in patent applications that are both lengthy and potentially more difficult for examiners to parse. In addition, technological innovation is today a global phenomenon that is occurring at an increasingly rapid pace. As compared to previous years, USPTO examiners may face more difficulty in locating the most pertinent documents that describe the state of the art.

The significance of this hiring rate should be assessed in view of the fact that in 2009, the total size of the patent examining corps was 6,242. The recent economic downturn has caused the USPTO to limit new hiring, however. As the title of recent congressional testimony of the Government Accountability Office indicates\u2014\"Hiring Efforts Are Not Sufficient to Reduce the Patent Application\" \u2014many observers are of the view that \"[d]ue to both monetary and infrastructure constraints, the USPTO cannot simply hire examiners to stem the tide of applications.\"", "The USPTO also proposed rules with respect to claims and so-called continuing applications that were designed to reduce its examination burdens. These rules would have limited the number of claims that could be filed in a particular patent application, unless the applicant supplied the USPTO with an \"Examination Support Document\" in furtherance of that application. They would have also limited the ability of applicants to re-file their applications\u2014an opportunity more technically termed a \"continuing application\"\u2014absent a petition and showing by the patent applicant of the need for such an application. These rules never came into effect due to a temporary court ruling enjoining their implementation. In the face of considerable opposition to these rules by many members of the patent bar and innovative firms, the USPTO announced on October 8, 2009, that it was rescinding the rules package entirely.", "The USPTO has continued to press forward with a number of additional initiatives.

According to the agency, the Plan \"allows applicants having multiple applications currently pending before the USPTO to have greater control over the priority with which their applications are examined while also stimulating a reduction of the backlog of unexamined patent applications pending before the USPTO.\"", "For its supporters, the advantage to the USPTO of the Patent Application Backlog Reduction Stimulus Plan is straightforward\u2014the voluntary removal of unexamined applications from its backlog. Inventors might also benefit from obtaining more prompt review of a particular patent application. For example, an inventor may believe that one application relates to a technology that is particularly significant to his business plans, while the marketplace outlook of the invention claimed in another application is poor. In that circumstance, he may be well-served by expediting consideration of the former application while abandoning the latter.", "The Patent Application Backlog Reduction Stimulus Plan was originally restricted to applicants that qualified as \"small entities\"\u2014a category that generally consists of individuals, small business concerns, and nonprofit organizations.

In turn, the patent offices of different nations must commit significant effort towards examining applications that are identical or similar to those filed elsewhere. ", "The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) is an initiative intended to rationalize and expedite multinational patent acquisition in light of these legal realities. The PPH consists of a series of bilateral arrangements between the patent offices of a number of nations. In broad outline, the PPH designates one national office as the Office of First Filing (OFF) and the other as the Office of Second Filing (OSF). If the OFF approves of at least one claim, then the applicant may request that the OSF \"fast track\" the examination of corresponding claims in an application filed before that agency.", "Consider, for example, the PPH arrangement between the USPTO and Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO).

Differences in the patent laws of different nations, or simply a differing assessment of the merits of the case by a foreign patent examiner, may potentially lead to rejections overseas even though a U.S. patent was granted. Nonetheless, the allowance rate of some foreign applications that have been previously approved in the United States is reportedly higher than average.", "The USPTO has currently entered into PPH arrangements with over a dozen foreign patent offices, including the European Patent Office and the patent offices of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom.

This program is set to expire on December 31, 2011, although it may be extended further in the future. No fee or support document is required under either of these programs.", "The USPTO also allows inventors to delay review of their applications. In order to defer, the applicant must pay an additional $130 processing fee and, at the outset, choose the number of months of deferral. The maximum period of deferral is 36 months. Applicants have reportedly used this procedure infrequently.", "As noted, the USPTO is contemplating a Three-Track Initiative that would provide additional mechanisms for governing the review of patent applications. Under this system, the USPTO would place all applications into one of three distinct separate queues: an accelerated Track One; traditional examination in Track Two; and a deferral of examination in Track Three. Entering Track One would require a prioritized examination fee of $4,000. The application would then be placed within a docket designed to provide a final disposition of the application within twelve months of the prioritized status grant. A Track One application must have no more than four independent claims and thirty claims total. Prioritized status is forfeited if the applicant ever requests an extension of time to respond to a USPTO communication.", "In contrast, if an inventor requests that a particular application be deferred, it is placed in Track Three. The inventor must request that the application be examined within 30 months from the filing date. Upon receipt of such a request, the USPTO will place the application into queue for review by an examiner.", "The remaining option, Track Two, includes applications that have been neither prioritized nor deferred. Track Two applications would be docketed immediately and will be reviewed by an examiner in the order in which they are received.", "The Three-Track Initiative would also significantly change USPTO procedures with respect to applications that were first filed outside the United States\u2014for example, at the European Patent Office or the Japanese Patent Office. The USPTO currently does not consider the national origin of the application when it is placed into queue for examination. Under the proposal, an application will only be placed into one of the three tracks if it was originally filed in the United States. Applications that were originally filed abroad would not be docketed for examination at all. The USPTO would take no action on a foreign-origin application until it received copies of (1) the prior art search conducted by the foreign office, (2) the initial communication of the foreign office to the USPTO, and (3) the applicant's reply to that communication.", "An example illustrates the working of this procedure. Suppose that a German inventor filed an application at the European Patent Office on December 1, 2011. On December 1, 2012, the inventor then files the same application at the USPTO. Under the Three-Track Initiative, the USPTO would not consider the application until the European Patent Office had conducted a search of the literature, communicated its initial review of the European application to the applicant, and received a reply from the applicant. In contrast, an application that was first filed in the USPTO\u2014by a U.S. or foreign citizen\u2014would be placed on one of the three tracks immediately.", "The USPTO initially planned to implement Track One of the Three-Track Initiative as of May 4, 2011. However, on April 29, 2011, the USPTO announced that it would delay implementation of the program due to reduced spending authority in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011. According to USPTO Director David Kappos, \"[w]ithout the resources to hire a sufficient number of examiners to implement Track One, we must postpone the effective date of the program until we are in a position to implement it successfully while ensuring there will be no adverse impact on non-prioritized examination applications.\"", "According to the USPTO, the Three-Track Initiative \"recognizes that the traditional 'one-size-fits-all' examination timing may not provide applicants much opportunity to choose the examination timing they need.\" The Three-Track Initiative has nonetheless attracted controversy. Some observers believed that the program might favor larger or wealthier firms over start-ups or smaller enterprises. Others were concerned that if industry made significant use of Track One, the ability of the USPTO to review Track Two applications might be diminished.", "The disparate treatment of applications based on the office of first filing has also aroused controversy. According to the USPTO, this \"proposal would increase the efficiency of examination of [foreign] applications by avoiding or reducing duplication of efforts by the office of first filing and the USPTO.\" The USPTO also noted that \"major patent filing jurisdictions like the Japanese and European patent office[s] have already adopted office-drive systems in which they address the applications for which they are the office of first filing.\"", "The United States is a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and also a member state of the World Trade Organization. Article 2 of the Paris Convention and Article 3 of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) requires that nationals of foreign signatory states be treated as well as U.S. citizens. Even if the Three-Track Initiative may be justified under these measures, some observers have expressed concerns that \"placing foreign nationals at a distinct disadvantage in their pursuit of patent rights in the U.S. ... could trigger, among other things, the imposition of new barriers for U.S. inventors to obtain patent rights in foreign jurisdictions.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patent Quality Metrics", "paragraphs": ["The USPTO has for many years maintained an internal quality control group that monitors the quality of the patent examination process by reviewing a sample of approved patents.
