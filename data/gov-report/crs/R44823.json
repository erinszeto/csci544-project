For the individual income tax, the plan would broaden the base, lower the rates (with a top rate of 33%), and alter some of the elements related to family size and structure by eliminating personal exemptions, allowing a larger standard deduction, and adding a dependent credit. For business income, the current income tax would be replaced by a cash-flow tax rebated on exports and imposed on imports, with a top rate of 20% for corporations and 25% for individuals. The cash-flow tax would be border-adjusted (imports taxed and exports excluded), making domestic consumption the tax base, although a recent announcement from congressional leaders has indicated that a border adjustment would be dropped in any future tax plan. The system would also move to a territorial tax in which foreign source income (except for easily abused income) would not be taxed. In addition, the proposal would repeal estate and gift taxes. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes are not repealed in the Better Way tax reform proposal, ACA taxes are repealed in the Healthcare Task Force proposals.", "One objective of tax reform is to increase output and efficiency. However, the plan's estimated output effects appear to be limited in size and possibly negative. The direct effect of lower marginal tax rates on labor supply is limited because the reduction in marginal tax rates is small and largely offset by an increased base that increases effective marginal rates. Capital income effects are also somewhat limited even with the movement to a cash-flow tax (that generally imposes a zero rate) because the current effective tax rate is low, due to current accelerated depreciation and the negative tax rate on debt financed investment. Growth effects are also limited because most empirical evidence does not support large savings and labor supply responses. As currently proposed, the plan loses significant revenue which, according to some estimates, could more than offset the supply responses and eventually lead to a contraction in output.", "The plan would achieve efficiency gains, particularly in the allocation of capital by type and industry and in the even treatment of debt and equity finance. It would eliminate many distortions associated with multinational firms, including eliminating the tax treatment that discourages repatriation of foreign source income to the United States and the incentive for firms to invert (shift headquarters abroad) by merging.", "Although claims have been made that the border adjustment would penalize imports and favor exports, a true border-adjusted tax has no effect on imports and exports due to the dollar's appreciation. There may be transitory effects, and for the blueprint, the export exemption may not be received by all exporters, which could cause the plan to act in part as a tariff. There are, however, a number of methods that might be used to obtain the benefits of the export exemption.", "Studies of the distributional effects indicate that the plan increases the after-tax income of higher-income individuals compared with lower-income individuals. The plan's treatment of families of different compositions remains similar to current law, with families with children favored at low incomes and disfavored at high incomes.", "The plan would simplify the tax system's administration and compliance by reducing the number of itemizers, eliminating the estate tax, simplifying depreciation, and eliminating the need for most international tax planning to shift profits out of the United States. However, some new complications would be introduced, including separating favored capital income of pass-through businesses from labor income of their owner-operators and implementing border-tax adjustments.", "Other concerns about the tax reform are that the border adjustment will be found illegal by the World Trade Organization and violate bilateral tax treaties.

Capital cost recovery provisions allow the cost of capital investment to be deducted over a period of years. Investments in plant and equipment are recovered through depreciation.

As a result of this tax deferral and the foreign-tax credit, relatively little tax is paid on foreign source income.", "The blueprint would impose a 20% corporate income tax and allow investments to be expensed, but disallow the interest deduction. It would eliminate the domestic production activities deduction, but would retain the research credit. This treatment would convert the income tax to a cash-flow tax and impose a zero effective marginal tax rate on investment (and a negative tax rate on research investment). The same rules (except for the tax rate) would be applied to pass-through businesses. A cash-flow tax converts an income tax into a consumption tax. A consumption tax base is composed of two parts: cash flow and labor compensation. By converting the tax on capital income to a cash flow tax, it could be viewed as a part of a value-added tax, with the other part labor compensation. The resulting overall system would be a tax referred to as an X-tax, which imposes a value-added tax. ", "The blueprint would have some slight modifications compared to a full cash-flow tax. It would not allow land acquisitions to be expensed, and it is unclear whether inventories are to be expensed, because it refers to retaining a certain type of inventory accounting (last in-first out), which is different from expensing. The blueprint also does not spell out any details of transition rules, such as allowing depreciation recovery on existing assets, interest income and deductions on existing debt, or for carryforwards for unused credits. Net operating losses (where firms' costs exceed their revenues) will be carried forward indefinitely, with interest. There are other tax code provisions whose treatment is not clarified. ", "Value-added taxes only apply to physical and not financial assets. A cash-flow tax could also include financial transactions and the blueprint appears to do so as it refers to disallowing net interest deductions. How to treat financial firms such as banks under a standard value-added tax is challenging, and a variety of potential approaches exist. The blueprint notes that the plan will address the particular circumstances of financial institutions. ", "The new cash-flow tax would also be imposed on a destination basis, that is, based on where output is consumed rather than the current system that largely imposes the income tax on where output is produced (with a small share of output produced abroad subject to tax). The destination-based tax would be implemented by taxing imports, allowing a deduction for export income, and excluding foreign-source income from tax. Value-added taxes are also imposed on a destination basis.", "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady has recently suggested the possible inclusion of a five-year phase in of the border adjustment and the possible inclusion of special considerations for some industries, such as financial services, shipping, communication, digital services and insurance. The committee has also been considering an allowance of interest deductions for small businesses. Eliminating the border tax adjustment would make the tax a cash-flow tax imposed on production rather than consumption.

Under existing law, a substantial amount of earnings abroad have been deferred and never repatriated. The proposal would tax this accumulated income over an eight-year period at 8.75% for earnings held in cash or cash equivalents and otherwise at 3.5%. If the provision follows past practice, the U.S.-foreign tax credit would be allowed but scaled back proportionally, as was the case in the 2004 repatriation holiday that allowed amounts to be brought back at a lower rate on a voluntary basis.

Efficiency gains have often been conflated with economic growth, but the concepts are different. Efficiency gains arise from an improved allocation of resources whereas economic growth arises from increases in labor and capital. The efficiency objective is to maximize well-being (referred to as utility in economics terms). The two are related to some of the measures but viewed differently. For example, if a marginal tax rate cut increases labor supply the growth effect is the value of additional output, but the efficiency gain is the increased income minus the loss in the value of leisure or unpaid work (such as child care). Increased work always adds to economic growth but does not necessarily add to efficiency or well-being.", "Labor supply is affected by income and substitution effects. When effective rates are cut, a rise in income allows individuals to consume both more goods and leisure, and thus reduces work effort. The substitution effect causes goods to be cheaper and encourages more work. Only the substitution effect and the marginal rate relate to efficiency gain (reducing the distortion between the consumption of goods, financed by working, and the consumption of leisure).", "Similarly, an increase in the rate of return has two conflicting effects on savings: a higher rate of return means that individuals can consume more both in the present and the future; consuming more in the present means a reduction in savings. A higher rate of return also encourages the substitution of future consumption for present consumption, increasing savings. The effect on savings also, however, depends on the timing of tax payments. To the extent, for example, that consumption taxes shift tax payments to the future (when assets may be drawn down in retirement and used to consume), a taxpayer should save more to finance those future tax payments. ", "Whereas growth effects depend on income and substitution effects, and thus on both average and marginal rates, efficiency effects depend on marginal effective tax rates, for both labor and capital. As with labor, the efficiency gain from reducing marginal tax rates on capital income is not the amount of consumption it allows in the future, but the difference in the value of that consumption compared to foregone present consumption.

TPC found that the average marginal income tax rate fell from 24.7% to 22.9%, or a 1.9 percentage point decrease. Its revenue analysis indicates that the tax's structural elements that drive these effects are roughly revenue neutral suggesting there would be no income effect. The percentage increase in net of tax wage (1 minus the tax rate) was 2.4% (based on the 0.771 to 0.753 ratio). Based on the Joint Committee on Taxation's labor substitution elasticity, 0.1 to 0.2, the effects would increase labor input by 0.24% to 0.48%. With labor accounting for about two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), the effect on output would be 0.16% to 0.32% in the short run. The effects would be closer to 0.24% and 0.48% in the long run. ", "These effects are overstated, however, because they do not account for the base broadening effect on marginal effective tax rates. Disallowing state and local tax deductions is an increase in the share of taxes out of an additional dollar. Similarly, any item of expenditure (such as charitable contributions or mortgages interest) that is paid for out of labor income would affect the marginal effective rate for individuals who shift to the standard deduction. The major itemized deductions are mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. ", "To determine the importance of this issue in general, data from the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income indicate that 23.2% of total wages accrued to itemizers who are likely to continue to itemize (income classes above $200,000) but would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes, which accounted for 7.65% of AGI. Using the marginal tax rate for the top quintile, 28.4%, overall marginal tax rates would increase by 0.5 percentage points. The remainder of itemizers account for 36.3% of wage income, have itemized deductions equal to 24.1% of income, and using the tax rate for the fourth quintile of 19.3% have an increase of 1.7 percentage points. The total, 2.2 percentage points, more than offsets the direct marginal rate reductions. ", "It is unclear whether mortgage interest and property tax deductions should be seen as labor income or capital income benefits. If they are considered capital income subsidies, then the offset would be reduced by 47% of the 1.7 percentage point effect, and a negligible amount of the 0.5 percentage points, for a total of 1.4 percentage points. With this view, the base broadening from itemizing deductions would offset three quarters of the rate reduction. ", "Note also that the mortgage interest deduction may not have a marginal impact in the short run because it is largely affected by existing mortgages. It should have an effect in the longer term.", "Although this is a rough calculation, it suggests negligible effects on labor supply from reducing marginal individual income tax rates, in turn suggesting little effect on growth or efficiency. ", "The base broadening changes as well as rates can also have an effect on the allocation of consumption. The direct disallowance of itemized deductions or the reduction in itemizers (largely as a result of disallowing state and local taxes as a deduction) and to a lesser extent the lower top rate would reduce the degree to which the tax system subsidizes these deductions. The deductions, in turn, favor certain types of consumption provided through labor and other incomes: state and local goods and services, owner-occupied housing (through mortgage interest and real estate tax deductions), and charitable contributions. ", "Although a full treatment of these subsidies is beyond the scope of this report, there is some disagreement about the justification for subsidizing these items. Many economists criticize the deductions that favor home ownership as encouraging too much investment in housing, although some arguments (contributing to stable communities and providing an important retirement asset for much of the middle class) could be made in favor of those provisions. Those arguments, however, largely justify benefits for moderate income taxpayers and not wealthy ones. State and local tax deductions require all taxpayers to subsidize spending in particular states, although some spillover effects from this spending may occur (e.g., use of highways by nonresidents and spillovers from education because of mobility). Charitable contributions have been viewed more favorably because charitable giving is undersupplied in a market economy. At the same time, some would argue that tax subsidies favor the charities that benefit higher-income taxpayers (such as the arts and higher education) and that some response estimations to the tax subsidy suggest that a dollar of revenue loss results in less than a dollar of charitable contributions, indicating that the government could deliver more to charity per dollar through direct spending.", "Note that some itemized deductions also repealed by the blueprint\u2014such as extraordinary medical expenses, casualty losses, investment expenses, and employee expenses\u2014are seen to reflect an ability to pay or to be an appropriate measure of income, rather than an incentive.

Investment in intangibles is already subject to cash-flow treatment, and investment in research has a negative effective tax because of the research credit. Tax rates are higher for equipment and public-utility structures and even higher for other structures. The corporate total rates add the shareholder level taxes on capital gains and dividends. These effects are small because of the low rates and limited shares of assets held by taxable shareholders.

The differences between sectors are larger for tangible assets. ", "Effective tax rates for the blueprint are shown in Table 2 . Because the tax is a cash-flow tax, all firm-level taxes are at zero except for investment in research, which benefits from the credit. Total tax rates are close to zero.

Table 3 shows the aggregate tax rates on equity, debt, and combined debt and equity. As shown in the table, debt finance is subject to negative tax rates in the corporate sector because tax at which the interest is deducted is much higher than the rate imposed on the creditor (mainly because of the large share of tax-exempt creditors). The difference between debt and equity is more pronounced in the corporate sector because of the higher corporate tax rate (relative to the rates for noncorporate firms).The CBO estimates assume a larger share of taxable creditors with that share larger for the noncorporate sector and thus results in a small estimated positive rate for the noncorporate sector. Tax-favored debt-financed investment also reduces overall effective tax rates and reverses the relative tax burdens across the sectors with aggregate noncorporate burdens higher than corporate ones (although for the basic assumptions the difference is negligible.) CBO also assumes a lower leveraging ratio for the noncorporate sector, which increases the overall tax rate in that sector compared with the corporate tax rate.

Different estimates reflect, in part, different sources of growth. There are three sources: (1) short-run stimulative effects, which are transitory and depend on the Federal Reserve's response; (2) supply side effects, where labor and capital respond to tax rates and capital can flow from abroad or result from domestic savings (where effects depend on behavioral responses); and (3) crowding out due to deficits, which depend on the magnitude of the deficit and the extent to which it can be financed by borrowing from abroad.", "The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center's (TPC's) analysis used two different models. One model captures all three effects using a demand-side (Keynesian) model that transitions to a neoclassical growth model. In a neoclassical growth model output increases with individuals' increase in labor supply and savings, with the capital stock changing slowly. That model estimates a 1% increase in output in the first full fiscal year (FY2017). This effect would decline to 0.7% in the second year, and 0.2% in the third year. These effects are demand-side effects. The short-run effect disappears after the first four years and the effect turns negative by FY2021 (at a loss of 0.2%). Negative effects occur when crowding out reduces the capital stock more than induced saving increases it and the resultant reduction in output from the smaller capital stock more than offsets any increased labor supply. In the first 10 years, the plan reduces output by 0.5% overall; in the second 10 years, it reduces output by 1%. Note that these are not cumulative growth rates but rather the difference in each year in output with and without the tax change. The second model is a dynamic life cycle model (a model where many generations coexist and make savings and work decisions over a lifetime) that captures both supply-side effects and the crowding-out effects of increased deficits, but not the short-run demand-side effects. It begins with an increase in output of 0.9% in FY2017, declining to 0.1% by 2022, becoming negative (-0.1%) in 2023, and declining to a loss of 0.5% in 2026. In the first 10 years, output is reduced by 0.5% and in the second ten years by 2.6%. ", "The Tax Foundation finds a significant positive effect. Its estimate projects output in the long run to increase by 9.1%, primarily due to changes in capital income taxes. The basic model type is a neoclassical growth model with an immediate transition to the long run. The results reflect only supply side effects and do not include short-run demand effects or crowding out. ", "Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Koehler hereinafter AKK) provide an estimate of wage growth of 8% using the Global Gaidar Model. They characterize this result as optimistic. While they don't report output growth, that growth rate should be similar. The basic model type is a life-cycle model with multiple worldwide regions. Their results appear to arise largely from an increase flow of capital from abroad in a mode where capital is perfectly substitutable across countries. This model also does not consider short-run demand effects or crowding out. ", "The TPC has some sensitivity analysis in their life-cycle model, with an optimistic scenario where output increases quickly to a 1% increase which is fairly stable over time. A pessimistic scenario shows a decline in output by 2019 and, by 2040, a reduction of 9% of GDP. The growth effects appear to be positive in the optimistic case in part because it apparently assumes that deficits can be largely financed with borrowing from abroad, and negative in the pessimistic case in part because all deficits must be financed through the crowding out of investment. ", "To assist in understanding how estimates for growth effects arising from supply side effects can vary widely, a simple growth model showing the steady state effects has been constructed (see Appendix ). This model relies on three elasticities: (1) savings elasticity (denoted as ER), (2) labor supply elasticity (denoted as ES-EI, which reflects a net of the substitution and income elasticities), and (3) factor substitution elasticity (denoted as S, which reflects the ease with which labor and capital can be substituted in the production function). An elasticity is a percentage change in quantity divided by a percentage change in price. For the savings response, it is the percentage change in the savings rate divided by the percentage change in after tax rate of return. The labor substitution elasticity is the percentage change in labor supply divided by the percentage change in after tax wage at the margin or last increment of work. The labor income elasticity, which is negative, is the percentage change in labor supply divided by the percentage change in after tax average wage. The factor substitution elasticity is the percentage change in the ratio of labor to capital divided by the percentage change in the ratio of the wage rate to the pretax return. ", "The model is a closed model that is similar to the one used by the Tax Foundation (open economy issues will be discussed subsequently). It is important to understand how estimates for the effects of a tax change of this nature depend on so many fundamental values and estimates.", "To illustrate the uncertainties with supply side effects, first consider the two sets of estimated tax rate differentials; Table 5 and Table 6 estimate the long-run results using the two tax rate effects discussed in this analysis. Also, consistent with the discussion of marginal taxes on wages, the calculations assumes there is no direct effect on labor from tax reductions, although an expansion of the capital stock drives up wages and labor supply increases in response. ", "These tables illustrate the importance of both the measurement of the tax change and the various elasticities. If the TPC's marginal tax rates on wages were also included in the estimate (not considering the offset of base broadening provisions), there would be an additional increase in output. These same changes applied to the Tax Foundation estimates, with a labor supply elasticity of 0.3, would produce an additional 0.7% increase in output. These effects would be smaller in the short run.", "The Tax Foundation model uses an infinite savings elasticity and, as noted above, a 0.3 labor supply elasticity. Their large output effect is difficult to explain with the model above: using the CRS estimates of tax rate with CBO assumptions about shareholders and debt, a projected 2.8% growth rate would be expected with an infinite elasticity of savings, and a 0.3 labor supply elasticity. Using the TPC's measure of marginal effective tax rate change on labor income, this elasticity would add 0.7%. Larger effects would be expected in a model that did not include economic depreciation in the cost of capital or had a smaller depreciation rate. In the model above, with the same elasticities, a model without depreciation would produce an effect of 4.4%, which added to the labor supply effect would be 5.1%. A likelihood may be that a full or an additional explanation is that the Tax Foundation's tax change is much larger. This larger effect could be partially explained by a different mix of capital stock, focusing more on the capital assets whose rates were reduced by the change and not including those (intangible assets and owner-occupied housing) that were increased by the change.", "The AKK model is likely to closely approach the results for an infinite elasticity because it has an open economy and its lifecycle elements are likely to lead to significant growth. AKK report the tax rates they use are estimated to fall from 34.6% to 16.1%. The effect of the tax rate changes on capital income, which is the main driver of effects, is 3.1 times the CRS tax rate changes with CRS assumptions and 2.4 times the effects of the CRS tax rate changes with the CBO assumptions. The tax rate differential alone would suggest an output effect of around 6% at an infinite savings elasticity and the other most generous assumptions (the higher labor supply and factor substitution elasticities). The effect is 36% higher than the rate reported by the TPC, and using the infinite elasticity that rate would imply a 5% output increase. The TPC and AKK rates exclude owner-occupied housing and that is a significant reason for the larger tax rate effects. ", "This growth effects discussion illustrates that assumptions that go into models, including behavioral responses estimates, crowding out treatment, and a proper measurement of the tax rate changes, are important and reinforce each other in some cases, that is, high elasticities magnify differences in the measurement of tax rate changes on output. ", "What might be a reasonable estimate of the savings and labor supply effects? Both the empirical evidence and the agencies' practices are reviewed in a report of dynamic scoring. Considering models like the one depicted here and the one used by the Tax Foundation, empirical evidence suggests a labor substitution elasticity from close to zero to 0.3, an income elasticity of 0 to -0.1, and a net labor supply elasticity ranging from -0.1 to 0.3. The JCT has used a substitution elasticity of 0.2 and an income elasticity of -.1 for a net labor supply elasticity of 0.1 in their model of this type, whereas CBO used a substitution elasticity of 0.24, an income elasticity of -0.05, and a net labor supply elasticity of 0.19. Empirical evidence on savings elasticities suggests an elasticity around zero, which ranges from negative to positive. In their model of this type, CBO used a 0.2 elasticity. JCT modifies this model by using a life cycle element, but indicates that it produces effects similar to a 0.29 elasticity.", "If the growth effects (without counting crowding out) were calculated with the JCT assumptions, using the tax rates under CRS assumptions and CBO assumptions, the effect would be an increase of 0.7% to 1.0%. If CBO assumptions on elasticities were used, the growth effects would be 0.6% to 0.8%. (These estimates assume a unitary factor substitution elasticity, which is a feature of most models, although some empirical evidence suggests the elasticity is lower.)

The import tax initially makes imports less attractive than domestic production, and the export subsidy, that initially permits firms to charge less for exports, makes exports more attractive to foreigners than their home production. These shifts in demand ultimately change demand for imports and exports, leading to changes in the demand and supply of dollars that causes the dollar to appreciate by 25% with a 20% tax rate. This dollar appreciation offsets the effects of the tax, so that U.S. consumers see no change in prices of imported goods, foreign exporters continue to receive the same price and foreigners buy and sell the same amounts for the same prices in their own currency. ", "Some caveats or objections have been raised about this effect. Perhaps the most important of these is that the export subsidy is not refundable, so that exporters that have loss positions will not be able to use the subsidy. Although loss carryforwards are allowed with interest, these firms may be in a permanent loss position. A recent study that simulated the effect of the border adjustment on firms in loss positions found that, weighted by assets, going to a cash-flow tax without border adjustments caused the fraction of loss firms assets to change very little (remain at around 20%). Adding border adjustments increased the share to, typically, around 40%. Firms with losses will not be able to benefit from the export subsidy and to the extent that the subsidy does not have a value, it will cause the border tax adjustment to act partially as a tariff (and thus discourage imports).", "Potential ways for firms to address this inability to use the subsidy include merging with an importer, adding a business as an import broker, or shifting supplies of intermediate goods from domestic to foreign producers. All of these approaches, however, produce some distortions and market inefficiencies, and a better approach from an efficiency perspective might be to allow refundability or to allow the subsidy to be credited against other taxes, such as employer payroll taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["In Table 5 and Table 6 , these international considerations include the possibility of attracting more capital from abroad and would suggest perhaps increasing the savings elasticity to account for more investment than that generated by domestic savings, although the upper limit that elasticity is nevertheless infinity.

Moreover, because the United States is a large country, the portfolio elasticity will be larger than the supply elasticity, with the latter, approximately 1.8. If that elasticity were used to compute the effects, they would be 1.8% and 2.5% at the top of the range (labor supply elasticity of 0.5 and factor substitution elasticity of 1) and 0.8% and 1.1% at the bottom (labor supply elasticity of 0.1 and factor substitution elasticity of 0.5).", "Another reason the inflow of foreign investment might be less than suggested by the estimates, or even be negative, is the likelihood that debt is more mobile internationally than equity. The new system encourages more equity investment, but discourages debt-financed investment. Some studies have suggested that a cut in the corporate rate would decrease the U.S. capital stock because it would discourage debt inflow from abroad.", "The effects in the AKK study appear to arise largely, at least initially, from international capital flows and they appear to assign an infinite elasticity (perfect substitution) to equity capital (there does not appear to be debt-finance in their model although the tax rates incorporate it). If equity capital is imperfectly substitutable, and debt more substitutable, their results would be too large and possibly in the wrong direction. Their model also appears to treat all capital in the economy as corporate capital, whereas a large share is from pass-through businesses and owner-occupied housing. ", "The destination basis of the tax (which is coupled with moving to a territorial tax that does not tax foreign source income) will eliminate some distortions that currently exist due to tax rules affecting international relationships. For example, the current tax discourages repatriation of income earned abroad by foreign subsidiaries because tax is not due when earned, only when returned to the parent firm as a dividend. This effect would no longer exist with a tax that is only imposed based on the place of consumption. The destination basis would also eliminate the incentive for firms to invert (shift their headquarters to another country), which may require a tax induced merger. In addition, it likely would reduce or largely eliminate artificial profit shifting, which is a paper transaction, but requires real resources and possibly some real effects (e.g., setting up a subsidiary operation in a tax haven). ", "The blueprint will introduce inefficiencies with respect to its border adjustment if the export subsidy is not refundable. For firms in a permanent loss position, tax-motivated changes, such as merging with importers, establishing import brokerage businesses, or substituting foreign for domestic inputs, will introduce distortions motivated by a desire to use loss positions. To the extent these actions are not taken and firms do not receive the subsidy, the proposal will distort trade. ", "Without the border tax adjustment, the territorial tax will still eliminate the tax on repatriations. The territorial tax, lower rate, and disallowance of interest deductions will reduce, and probably largely eliminate, the incentive for inversions. Profit shifting will be reduced because of the disallowance of interest deductions, but the shifting of profits into low tax countries through the pricing of intangibles, which is a more important method of profit shifting, would be increased with a territorial tax and no border adjustment.

For example, the individual who increased savings reduced consumption to do so, and the benefit of the policy should capture what is lost and what is gained. Similarly, the worker who increases work effort is giving up unpaid work or leisure.

By contrast, the income tax falls on wages and investment income. If a cash-flow tax is substituted for the corporate tax, as a separate move, the tax would fall on assets. These issues are outlined in numerous sources. That means there is an inter-generational distributional aspect to the cash-flow tax because it is a one-time tax that falls on the generation alive at the time (although some of the burden may be shared with future generations through inheritance). Returns to investment going forward are not subject to tax, except in the case of economic rents (i.e., returns in excess of the amount needed to attract investment). ", "Which asset holders bear the burden for debt-financed investment depends on whether there is a general price rise (which requires an expansion of the money supply). For example, with a retail sales tax or a value-added tax, such a price rise might be desirable, so that the price of consumption goods rises while wages and asset values do not change. In this case, although these values do not change, their purchasing power falls, which is equivalent to a fall in asset value. If the tax is enacted in a way that does not require a price increase (such as a flat tax or a separate cash-flow tax) or a price rise is not accommodated, debt will retain its value, and the fall in the value of equity-owned assets is larger. For example, if a firm has a third of its assets debt financed, the stock market values would fall by 50% (one-third divided by two-thirds) more than their effective fall when prices change. That is, equity owners bear the full burden of the asset tax.", "Perhaps the best intuition behind the expectation that stock market prices would fall is that a new investment has a higher return than the old investments because it has a subsidy. Therefore, a new investment (such as a new issue of stock) is more attractive than existing investments. To make individuals, who could purchase a new investment with a higher return, willing to purchase existing shares, the price of existing stocks must fall so as to match the return on new issues.", "A fall in asset prices is not confined to the wealthy, although stock held by individuals is concentrated among high-income individuals.

", "If the current income tax were fully an income tax, and the new tax proposal applied its cash-flow effects to all purchases, then the estimated fall in the stock market would be relatively straightforward. However, the current income tax contains significant aspects of a cash-flow tax through accelerated depreciation and expensing of intangibles. Thus it already has discounted prices. In addition, the new cash-flow tax system excludes land purchases from expensing and it is not clear whether inventories would be excluded. ", "The formula for estimating the existing estimates of accelerated depreciation and expensing is shown in the Appendix . Based on the asset data and tax model used in previous CRS reports and data (particularly on land and inventories) in a recent CBO study, the estimated 12% discount, before adjusting for debt, in the current stock market is due to consumption tax elements of the current income tax. About half that effect is due to the expensing of intangible investments, including research and development, advertising, and human capital investment; the remainder is due to accelerated depreciation. The discount estimated for a 20% cash- flow tax that does not apply to land or inventories is estimated at 15.4% (with somewhat less than a quarter of assets in investments that do not qualify). The differences between the two numbers, adjusted to reflect debt and the existing stock market value, ranges from 5.9% to 6.2% (depending on the debt share). Some ambiguity exists regarding the treatment of inventories. If inventories were allowed to be expensed, the estimates would be 8.6% to 9.0%. If a true cash-flow tax were chosen, which would also apply to land, the estimated effects would be 16.9% to 17.3%. ", "These estimates have many caveats. The proposed cash-flow tax is a destination-based tax rather than an origin-based one, and it is unclear how this rule would affect the estimates. Although all estimates are subject to uncertainty, estimating intangible assets, particularly for human capital investment, which accounts for about half of intangibles, is especially uncertain. The estimates of the existing discounts assume uniform debt shares and growth rates across assets. The proposal is unclear on transition rules that allow depreciation on existing assets, which would reduce the discount (although values would eventually fall to the permanent levels as deductions were taken). ", "One important implication of this burden of a cash-flow tax is that proposals to increase the tax rate above 20% to address revenue shortfalls (because there would be little effect on real investment in plant and equipment) would increase the discount. With the exclusion of land and inventories reducing the discount to about three quarters, but debt increasing it by 1.125% for each percentage point.

Those with debt denominated in U.S. dollars, including many third-world countries, find that their debt obligation has increased in terms of their own currency. One study estimated that U.S. holders of foreign assets could lose as much as $4.9 trillion, and foreign holders of U.S. assets could gain as much as $8.1 trillion.
