{"id": "R45666", "title": "Drug Pricing and Intellectual Property Law: A Legal Overview for the 116th Congress", "released_date": "2019-04-04T00:00:00", "summary": ["Intellectual property (IP) rights play an important role in the development and pricing of pharmaceutical products such as prescription drugs and biologics. In order to encourage innovation, IP law grants the rights holder a temporary monopoly on a particular invention or product, potentially enabling him to charge higher-than-competitive prices. IP rights, if sufficiently limited, are typically justified as necessary to allow pharmaceutical manufacturers the ability to recoup substantial costs in research and development, including clinical trials and other tests necessary to obtain regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, because they may operate to deter or delay competition from generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers, IP rights have been criticized as contributing to high prices for pharmaceutical products in the United States.", "Two main types of IP may protect pharmaceutical products: patents and regulatory exclusivities. Patents, which are available to a wide range of technologies besides pharmaceuticals, are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to new and useful inventions. Pharmaceutical patents may claim chemical compounds in the pharmaceutical product, a method of using the product, a method of making the product, or a variety of other patentable inventions relating to a drug or biologic. The holder of a valid patent generally has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and import the invention for a term lasting approximately 20 years. If a court concludes that a competitor's generic or biosimilar version infringes a valid patent, the court may issue an injunction precluding the competitor from making, using, selling, and importing that competing product until the patent expires.", "In some circumstances, FDA grants regulatory exclusivities to a pharmaceutical manufacturer upon the completion of the process required to market pharmaceutical products. Before a new drug or biologic can be sold in the United States, companies must apply for regulatory approval or licensure from FDA, which determines if the pharmaceutical is safe and effective. For certain pharmaceuticals, such as innovative products or those that serve particular needs, FDA provides a term of marketing exclusivity upon the successful completion of the regulatory process. If a product is covered by an unexpired regulatory exclusivity, FDA generally may not accept and/or approve an application seeking FDA approval of a follow-on product (i.e., a generic drug or biosimilar). Regulatory exclusivities vary in length from as little as six months to as much as 12 years depending on the specific type of drug or biologic at issue and other factors.", "Like regulatory exclusivities, patent rights can affect when generic and biosimilar manufacturers can market their follow-on products. Pharmaceutical patent disputes are subject to certain specialized procedures under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). Under Hatch-Waxman, applicants seeking approval of a generic version of an existing FDA-approved drug must make a certification with respect to each patent that the brand-name drug manufacturer lists as covering the product. If the generic manufacturer challenges those patents, FDA generally cannot approve the generic drug application for 30 months while the patent dispute is litigated. For biologics, applicants seeking approval of a biosimilar version of an existing biological product may choose to engage in the BPCIA's \"patent dance,\" a complex scheme of private information exchanges made in preparation for formal patent disputes between brand-name biologic and biosimilar manufacturers. The patent dance does not affect FDA's ability to approve a biosimilar application.", "Some pharmaceutical companies have been criticized for charging high prices and engaging in practices that are perceived by some to exploit the existing legal system governing IP rights on pharmaceutical products. For example, some generic manufacturers have claimed that brand-name drug manufacturers have unreasonably refused to sell them samples of brand-name drugs in order to impede their ability to obtain FDA approval and delay market entry of generic competition. Other commentators have criticized the practice of \"pay-for-delay\" settlements, through which brand-name drug companies settle patent litigation with generic or biosimilar manufacturers by paying them to delay their entry into the market. Still others criticize so-called patent \"evergreening,\" in which pharmaceutical companies are alleged to serially patent minor improvements or ancillary features of their products in order to extend the effective term of patent protection.", "In recent years, a number of congressional proposals have been introduced that seek to address these and other issues in IP law that are perceived by some to contribute to high prices for pharmaceutical products. These proposed reforms range from relatively modest changes, such as increasing patent transparency, to more sweeping reforms such as pricing controls and government compulsory licensing provisions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he prices paid by consumers for prescription drugs have been a recent area of significant congressional interest. Several committees in the House and Senate have held hearings this year on drug pricing issues, and a number of bills have been introduced in the 116 th Congress that seek to address the perceived high costs of prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical products. Because intellectual property (IP) rights, including patent rights and regulatory exclusivities, play an important role in the development and pricing of pharmaceutical products, a key focus of this debate is whether existing IP law promptly balances the need for innovation with the costs that IP may impose on the public. Understanding the interplay between several complex legal regimes is necessary in order to fully make sense of this debate.", "IP law comprises a set of exclusive rights that prevent others from making, copying, or using certain intangible creations of the human mind. Federal law contains several different varieties of IP, depending on the type of intellectual creation at issue. For example, copyright law generally grants authors of original creative works (such as literary works or musical compositions) the exclusive right to reproduce their work, publicly perform and display it, distribute it, and adapt it, for a specified term of years. Other species of federal IP include patent law, which protects novel inventions, and trademark law, which protects symbols used to identify goods and services. Each form of IP covers a different type of creation, has a different procedure for obtaining rights, and grants the IP owner legal rights that vary in scope and duration.", "Although each of these forms of IP is legally distinct, they broadly share a common motivation: providing incentives to create. Patents and copyrights are typically justified by a utilitarian rationale that exclusive rights are necessary to provide incentives to produce new creative works and technological inventions. This rationale maintains that absent legal protections, competitors could freely copy such creations, denying the original creators the ability to recoup their investments in time and effort, and thereby reduce the incentive to create in the first place. IP incentives are said to be particularly necessary for products, such as pharmaceuticals, that are costly to develop but easily copied once marketed. In the words of the Supreme Court, IP rights are premised on an \"economic philosophy\" that the \"encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\" From this perspective, the fundamental aim of IP law is to find the optimal balance between providing incentives for innovation and the costs that IP rights impose on the public. ", "By design, IP rights may lead to increased prices for goods or services that are protected by IP. IP rights are often said to grant a temporary and limited \"monopoly\" to the rights holder. The existence of a patent on a particular manufacturing process, for example, generally means that only the patent holder (and persons licensed by the patent holder) can use that patented process for a set period of time. In some circumstances, this legal exclusivity may allow the patent holder (or her licensees) to charge higher-than-competitive prices for goods made with the patented process, as a monopolist would, because the patent effectively shields the patent holder from competition.", "New pharmaceutical products generally benefit from two main forms of IP protection: patent rights and regulatory exclusivities. These two sets of exclusive rights are distinct, yet often confused. Patents, which are available to a wide variety of technologies beyond pharmaceuticals, are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to inventions that are new, useful, nonobvious, and\u00a0directed at patentable subject matter. The holder of a valid patent generally has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or import a patented invention within the United States for a period beginning when the patent is issued by the PTO and ending 20 years after the date of the patent application. ", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants regulatory exclusivities upon the completion of the FDA regulatory process necessary to market pharmaceutical products (i.e., drugs and biological products). Exclusivities are granted only to certain pharmaceutical products such as innovative products (e.g., a new active ingredient or new indication for an existing drug) or those that serve a specific need (e.g., treating rare diseases). Regulatory exclusivities prevent FDA from accepting or approving an application by a competitor for FDA approval of a follow-on product (i.e., a generic or biosimilar version) of a previously approved pharmaceutical for a set time period, and/or preclude a competitor from relying on safety and efficacy data submitted by the original manufacturer for a period of time. Depending on the type of pharmaceutical product at issue and other factors, regulatory exclusivities may last anywhere from six months to 12 years. In overlapping ways, both patent rights and regulatory exclusivities can operate to deter or delay the market entry of a generic drug or biosimilar.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has found that national spending on pharmaceutical products has been rising in recent years, predicting that these expenditures would continue to rise faster than overall health spending. Many factors other than IP rights contribute to the price consumers pay for prescription drugs and biologics, including demand, manufacturing costs, R&D costs, the terms of private health insurance, and the involvement of a government insurance program such as Medicaid. That said, pharmaceutical products are frequently protected by IP rights, and some studies have shown that IP rights are among the most important factors driving high drug prices. For example, FDA has found that increased competition from generic drug manufacturers is associated with lower prices for pharmaceuticals. Given that IP rights may allow the rights holder to charge higher-than-competitive prices, and can deter or delay the market entry of generic drug or biosimilar competitors, changes to IP rights or otherwise facilitating competition is seen by some to offer a potential means of lowering prices for pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, several current proposed congressional reforms to lower drug prices would reform the existing legal structure of IP rights in the pharmaceutical context.", "This report explains how several of these congressional proposals to reduce drug prices would interact with and/or alter existing IP law for pharmaceutical products. First, the report reviews the basics of patent law, FDA law and regulatory exclusivities, and the interaction between patent rights and FDA approval of pharmaceutical products. With this legal background in hand, the report overviews the details of a number of current legislative proposals to change these laws in order to reduce the drug prices paid by consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legal Background", "paragraphs": ["Several different legal and regulatory regimes create or affect IP rights in pharmaceutical products. As noted above, pharmaceuticals are subject to two principal forms of IP protection\u2014patents and regulatory exclusivities\u2014which are generally distinct, but at times overlap and interact. Complicating matters further is the fact that FDA regulates pharmaceutical products differently depending on whether they derive from natural sources. In particular, before they can be marketed or sold, nonbiological \"drugs\" must be approved by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), whereas \"biologics\" must be licensed by FDA under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Finally, patents on pharmaceutical drugs or biologics are subject to specialized patent dispute resolution procedures that can affect a manufacturer's ability to bring a follow-on product (i.e., a generic drug or biosimilar) to market. Specifically, provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) govern FDA approval and patent disputes for generic drugs, whereas the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) governs FDA licensure and patent disputes for biosimilars.", "In light of these complexities, a fair amount of background is necessary to understand how IP rights are obtained in pharmaceuticals, how these rights may impact drug prices, and the various reforms that have been proposed in Congress to reduce drug prices for consumers. This section provides this background, proceeding in three parts. First, it reviews patent law, including the requirements for obtaining a patent, the rights granted to patent holders, and various limitations on those rights. Second, it overviews FDA requirements for obtaining approval to market a drug or biological product, the abbreviated pathways for generic drug approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act and biosimilar licensure under the BPCIA, and different regulatory exclusivities that FDA grants to certain types of approved pharmaceutical products.

In the view of the Framers, the states could not effectively protect copyrights or patents separately because obtaining IP rights in multiple states with differing standards would be difficult and expensive for authors and inventors, undermining the effectiveness of the legal regime.", "Patent rights do not arise automatically. Rather, to obtain patent protection under the Patent Act, an inventor must file a patent application with the PTO, and a PTO patent examiner must review the application and conclude that the application meets the statutory requirements before the PTO will issue a patent.

During prosecution, a patent examiner at the PTO evaluates the patent application to ensure that it meets all the applicable legal requirements to merit the grant of a patent. In addition to requirements regarding the technical disclosure of the invention, the claimed invention must be (1)\u00a0directed at patentable subject matter, (2) new, (3)\u00a0nonobvious, and (4) useful.

Although the subject matter of patents is wide-ranging, the Supreme Court has long held that \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.\" The Court has reasoned that to permit a monopoly on the \"'basic tools of scientific and technological work' .\u00a0. . might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it.\"", "In a series of recent cases, the Supreme Court has established a two-step test for patentable subject matter, sometimes called the Alice test. The first step addresses whether the patent claims are \"directed to\" ineligible subject matter, that is, a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. If not, the invention is patentable. If it is directed at ineligible subject matter, the invention is not patentable unless the patent claims have an \"inventive concept\" under the second step of the Alice test.

Specifically, an invention cannot be patented if \"the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious . . . to a person having ordinary skill\" in the relevant technology. When determining obviousness, courts may evaluate considerations such as \"commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, [or] failure of others . . . to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented.\" By its nature, obviousness is an \"expansive and flexible\" inquiry that cannot be reduced to narrow, rigid tests.

Any other person who practices the invention (i.e., makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports it) without permission from the patent holder infringes the patent and is liable for monetary damages, and possibly injunctive relief, if sued by the patentee. Patents have the attributes of personal property and may be sold or assigned to by the patentee to a third party. A patentee may also license other parties to practice the invention, that is, grant them permission to make, use, sell, or import the invention, usually in exchange for consideration (such as monetary royalties).", "Patents thus provide a negative right to exclude another person from practicing the claimed invention. However, patents do not grant the patentee any affirmative right to practice the invention. In the pharmaceutical context, this means that even if a manufacturer has a patent on a particular drug (or inventions related to making or using that drug), it nonetheless cannot market that drug without FDA approval.", "With some exceptions, a patent is generally granted \"for a term beginning on the date on which the patent issues and ending 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed.\" The Patent Act includes provisions that may modify the 20-year term, including to account for excessive delays in patent examination at the PTO, or delays associated with obtaining marketing approval from other federal agencies (including FDA). In the pharmaceutical context, patents claiming a drug product or medical device (or a method of using or manufacturing the same) may be extended for up to five years to account for delays in obtaining regulatory approval, if certain statutory conditions are met.", "Patents are not self-enforcing: to obtain relief from infringement, the patentee must sue in court. Patent law is an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction, and the traditional forum for most patent disputes is federal district court. Although patent suits may be filed in any district court across the country with jurisdiction over the defendant and proper venue, all appeals in patent cases are heard by a single specialized court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit). ", "If the patentee succeeds in proving infringement, the patent holder may obtain two major forms of judicial relief: monetary damages and injunctive relief. Damages must be \"adequate to compensate for the infringement,\" and typically take the form of either (1) lost profits , that is, the net revenue \"lost to the patentee because of the infringement,\" or (2) a reasonable royalty , which awards the amount that the patentee would have received in a \"hypothetical negotiation\" if the patentee and the infringer had negotiated a license in good faith prior to the infringement. Courts have discretion to increase the damages \"up to three times the amount found or assessed,\" but such enhanced damages are \"generally reserved for egregious cases of culpable behavior\" by the infringer. Finally, courts have discretion to award attorneys' fees in \"exceptional cases,\" that is, ones that \"stand[] out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position\" or \"the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\"", "In addition to monetary damages, a patent holder may also ask courts to order various forms of injunctive relief. At the outset of a patent litigation, a patent holder may seek a preliminary injunction , a court order that prevents the defendant from committing the allegedly infringing acts while the litigation proceeds. If a patent infringement lawsuit is successful, the patent holder may seek a permanent injunction , an order prohibiting the defendant from infringing the patent in the future.", "Parties accused of patent infringement may defend on several grounds. First, although patents are subject to a presumption of validity, the accused infringer may assert that the patent is invalid . To prove invalidity, the accused infringer must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the patent should never have been granted by the PTO because it failed to meet the requirements for patentability. Thus, for example, the accused infringer may argue that the invention lacks novelty, is obvious, or claims nonpatentable subject matter; that the patent fails to enable the invention; or that the patent claims are indefinite. Second, the accused infringer may claim an \"absence of liability\" on the basis of noninfringement . In other words, even presuming the patent is valid, the patentee may fail to prove that the activities of the accused infringer fall within the scope of the patent claims. Finally, the accused infringer may argue that the patent is unenforceable based on the inequitable or illegal activities of the patent holder, such as obtaining the patent through fraud on the PTO.", "Following the passage of the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) has become an increasingly important forum for patent disputes. The AIA created several new administrative procedures for challenging patent validity, including (1) post-grant revie w (PGR), which allows petitioners to challenge patent validity based on any of the requirements of patentability if the PGR petition is filed within nine months of the patent's issuance; (2) inter partes review (IPR), which allows any person other than the patentee to challenge patent validity on limited grounds (novelty or obviousness based on prior patents or printed publications) at any time after nine months following the patent's issuance; and (3) a transitional program for covered business method patents (CBM), a PGR-like process limited to certain patents claiming \"business methods\" that will be available only through September 2020. Of these procedures, IPR is by far the most widely used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Pharmaceutical Patents", "paragraphs": ["If a person is the first to synthesize a particular chemical believed to be useful for the treatment of human disease, she may file for a patent on that chemical itself, and\u2014presuming that the application meets all requirements for patentability\u2014the PTO will grant the patent. Patents on a pharmaceutical product's active ingredient may be of particular value to the manufacturer because these patents are unusually difficult, if not impossible, to \"invent around\" (i.e., develop a competing product that does not infringe the patent). However, active ingredient patents are hardly the only patents relating to pharmaceuticals and not necessarily the most important to manufacturers as a practical matter. Indeed, in the case of biological products, if the active ingredient is naturally occurring, it may not be legally possible to patent the biologic itself because it constitutes patent-ineligible subject matter. ", "Pharmaceutical patents may cover many different features of a drug or biologic beyond a claim on the active ingredient itself. Such patents may claim, among other things: ", "1. a formulation of the drug (e.g., an administrable form and dosage); 2. a method of using the pharmaceutical (e.g., an indication or use for treating a particular disease); 3. technologies used to administer the pharmaceutical or a method of administration; 4. a method of manufacturing or manufacturing technology used to make the pharmaceutical; 5. other chemicals related to the active ingredient, such as crystalline forms, polymorphs, intermediaries, salts, and metabolites.

To be patentable, the improvement must be new and nonobvious, that is, \"more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions.\" Any person wishing to practice the improved form of the invention will need permission from both the holder of the patent on the original technology and the holder of the improvement patent (who need not be the same entity), if neither patent has yet expired. In the case where the original patent has expired but the improvement patent has not, permission from the improvement patentee is required to practice the improved version, but as a matter of patent law any person is free to make and use the original, unimproved version.", "Because many different aspects of pharmaceutical products (and improvements thereon) are patentable, some pharmaceutical products are protected by dozens of different patents. For example, one recent study of the top 12 drugs by gross U.S. revenue found that pharmaceutical manufacturers had obtained an average of 71 patents on each of these drugs. AbbVie, the maker of the top-selling arthritis biologic Humira, was found to have filed 247 patent applications relating to that product, resulting in 132 issued patents claiming methods of treatment, formulations, methods of manufacturing, and other related inventions.", "The number and timing of nonactive ingredient patents (sometimes called \"secondary\" patents) have contributed to long-standing concerns by some commentators about so-called patent \"evergreening.\" Evergreening, also known as patent \"layering\" or \"life-cycle management,\" is an alleged practice by which \"drug innovators [seek] to prolong their effective periods of patent protection [through] strategies that add new patents to their quivers as old ones expire.\" Critics of evergreening maintain that, by obtaining later patents on improvements or ancillary aspects of a pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical manufacturers effectively extend patent protection beyond the term set by Congress, deterring follow-on competitors and keeping prices high. In the view of evergreening critics, many secondary pharmaceutical patents are of questionable value and validity. ", "A similar, but distinct, concern voiced by some commentators is the notion of a patent \"thicket.\" This term is used in two slightly different ways, both relating to products with a high number of patents. First, a patent thicket may describe the situation where multiple parties have overlapping patent rights on one product, such that a \"potential manufacturer must negotiate licenses with each patent owner in order to bring a product to market without infringing.\" Patent thickets, in this sense, raise concerns about inefficient exploitation of a technology because the multiplicity of owners increases transaction costs and creates coordination challenges. Second, the term may be used in a looser sense to describe an incumbent manufacturer's practice of amassing of a large volume of patents relating to a single product, with the intent to intimidate follow-on competitors from entering the market (or to make it too costly and risky to do so). AbbVie's Humira patent portfolio has been alleged to be an example of this sort of patent thicket. ", "Although some critics deride patent thickets and evergreening, others assert that these are unfairly pejorative terms for legitimate uses of the patent system. On this view, much innovation is incremental in nature, and sound public policy permits patents on improvements: like any other form of technology, society ought to provide incentives to develop more effective formulations of a drug, methods of treatment, and the like. Secondary pharmaceutical patents may represent inventions with true medical benefits to patients, in which case the effect they may have on competition is arguably justified. Finally, even presuming that some improvement patents granted by the PTO are obvious or not truly innovative, defenders of evergreening may point out that existing law already has several mechanisms to challenge the validity of patents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compulsory Licensing", "paragraphs": ["As explained above, the patent holder generally has the exclusive right to practice the invention. Thus, any other person who wishes to make, use, sell, or import the invention will ordinarily need a license (i.e., permission) from the patent holder, or else be exposed to legal liability. In certain cases, however, patents may be subject to a \"compulsory license,\" which allows another person to use the invention without the prior consent from the patent holder. Compulsory licenses are typically a creation of statute and usually require the sanction of a governmental entity and the payment of compensation to the patent holder. Compulsory licenses differ from ordinary licenses in two important respects: (1) the person seeking to use the invention need not seek advance permission from the patent holder; and (2) the compensation paid to the patentee is ordinarily determined by operation of law, not by private contractual negotiations between the licensee and the patent holder. ", "Current federal law contains a number of compulsory license provisions for patents. For example, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, which is sometimes described as an \"eminent domain\" provision for patents, the U.S. government has the authority to use any patented invention \"without license.\" The patentee, however, has the right to sue in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for \"reasonable and entire compensation\" for the government's use of the patented invention. In no event, however, will a court issue an injunction against the United States to prevent its use of the invention. In effect, then, section 1498 allows the United States to issue itself a compulsory license to use any patented invention without obtaining the permission of the patentee, in exchange for the payment of reasonable compensation. The federal government uses its section 1498 authority with some frequency, although it has not been used recently in the pharmaceutical context.", "Compulsory licensing is also available for inventions made with federal funding under the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. In general, the Bayh-Dole Act permits certain government contractors to obtain patents on inventions produced with federal funding. However, the federal government retains the authority to \"march in\" and grant compulsory licenses to third parties for federally funded inventions under certain specified circumstances, such as a failure to practice the patented invention or health or safety needs. A license granted pursuant to Bayh-Dole's march-in provisions must be \"upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances,\" which may require some compensation to be paid by the licensee to the patentee.

The first distortion affected new drug manufacturers: because obtaining FDA marketing approval could take years, the effective patent life (i.e., the period during which the patentee can derive profit from the invention) was shortened by FDA regulatory requirements. In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act granted a patent term extension for certain inventions relating to drug products or medical devices based on delays in obtaining regulatory marketing approval.", "The other distortion concerned the end of the patent term and affected generic manufacturers. In general, once a patent is expired, the patented invention should be available for anyone to use. As a result, in the pharmaceutical context, generic manufacturers can (at least in theory) enter the market once the applicable patents and/or regulatory exclusivities have expired. However, prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act, some judicial decisions had held that uses of a patented drug necessary to obtain FDA approval, such as conducting tests on a patented drug, constituted patent infringement. Thus, as a practical matter, generic manufacturers could not even begin the process of seeking FDA approval until the applicable patents expired. The result was an \"effective extension of the patent term\" based on the \"combined effect of the patent law and the premarket regulatory approval requirement.\" In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act created a \"safe harbor,\" providing that making, using, or selling an invention \"solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs\" is not patent infringement.", "A potential side effect of this safe harbor, however, was to limit the ability of a pharmaceutical patent holder to file a lawsuit for patent infringement prior to the generic manufacturer's marketing of the follow-on product. If actions relating to the FDA approval process are no longer infringing, patent litigation against an ANDA filer might not occur until the generic or biosimilar is actually marketed, following the completion of the FDA approval process. However, earlier resolution of such patent disputes is often considered beneficial, as it provides greater legal certainty to the parties. In particular, generic manufacturers can obtain clarity on patent issues before they market a drug and expose themselves to monetary damages.", "For this reason, the Hatch-Waxman Act made the filing of an ANDA or paper NDA itself an \"artificial\" act of patent infringement. For its part, the BPCIA contains an analogous provision making the filing of a biosimilar or interchangeable BLA an artificial act of patent infringement. Functionally, these artificial acts of infringement enable the original manufacturer, in some circumstances, to sue for patent infringement at the time of the follow-on application, enabling patent disputes to be litigated prior to the marketing of the follow-on product.", "In short, both of the laws that created an abbreviated pathway for the regulatory approval for follow-on products enacted specialized patent dispute resolution procedures intended to facilitate the early resolution of patent issues.

First, the generic applicant must give notice of the ANDA and the paragraph (IV) certification to the patentee and the NDA holder.

If, prior to the expiration of the 30-month stay, the district court concludes that the patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA applicant, FDA may approve the ANDA as of the date of the court's judgment or settlement order to that effect. If the court concludes that the patent is infringed (and that decision is not appealed or affirmed), then the effective date of ANDA approval must be \"not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed.\" FDA approval of a generic drug application can thus be significantly delayed based upon patent rights asserted by the NDA holder.", "By statute, the only patents that must be listed with an NDA are those that either (1) \"claim[] the drug\" that is the subject of the NDA or (2) claim \"a method of using such drug.\" FDA regulations make clear that \"drug substance (active ingredient) patents, drug product (formulation and composition) patents, and method-of-use patents\" must be listed, whereas \"[p]rocess patents, patents claiming metabolites, and patents claiming intermediates\" must not be listed.

Specifically, they argue that the brand manufacturer's refusal to sell samples or its delay in selling samples constitutes an anticompetitive effort to maintain a monopoly in the brand product market in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act . Whether this conduct violates antitrust law, however, is unclear because courts have not defined a clear standard for when a refusal to deal is anticompetitive.

Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) further prohibits \"unfair methods of competition,\" \u2014a category that includes (but is not limited to) conduct that violates the Sherman Act.

", "In evaluating the reasonableness of contractual restraints on trade, courts have found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal only as applied to particular situations.\" Courts generally apply a \"rule of reason\" analysis unless the agreement falls within a per se illegal category.

While the Supreme Court has not developed a \"canonical\" analytical framework to guide this totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry, most courts take a similar approach in resolving rule-of-reason cases. Under the standard approach, a Section 1 plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating that a challenged restraint has anticompetitive effects in a properly defined product and geographic market\u2014that is, that the restraint causes higher prices, reduced output, or diminished quality in the relevant market. If the plaintiff succeeds in making this showing, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the plaintiff's evidence with a procompetitive justification for the challenged practice. If the defendant is unable to produce such a justification, the plaintiff is entitled to prevail. However, if the defendant rebuts the plaintiff's evidence, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show either (1) that the restraint's anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive effects or (2) that the restraint's procompetitive effects could be achieved in a manner that is less restrictive of competition.", "Per Se Illegal . Certain agreements are considered per se illegal \"without regard to a consideration of their reasonableness\" \"because the probability that these practices are anticompetitive is so high.\" Only restraints that \"have manifestly anticompetitive effects\" and lack \"any redeeming virtue\" are held to be per se illegal. The most common categories are agreements for horizontal price fixing, market allocation, or output limitation. The plaintiff need only demonstrate that the agreement in question falls in one of the per se categories; \"liability attaches without need for proof of power, intent or impact.\"", "Quick Look Analysis . A \"quick look\" is an abbreviated rule of reason analysis. In identifying this intermediate standard of review, the Court has explained that because \"[t]here is always something of a sliding scale in appraising reasonableness,\" the \"quality of proof required\" to establish a Section 1 violation \"should vary with the circumstances.\" As a result, the Court has concluded that in certain cases\u2014specifically, those in which \"no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character\" of a challenged agreement\u2014plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case that an agreement is anticompetitive without presenting the sort of market power evidence traditionally required at the first step of rule-of-reason analysis. ", "While there is no universally accepted \"quick look\" framework, several courts of appeals have endorsed an approach to \"quick look\" cases initially adopted by the FTC. Under this approach, if a Section 1 plaintiff can establish that the nature of a challenged restraint makes it likely to harm consumers, the restraint is deemed \"inherently suspect\" and therefore presumptively anticompetitive. A defendant can rebut this presumption by presenting \"plausible reasons\" why the challenged practice \"may not be expected to have adverse consequences in the context of the particular market in question,\" or why the practice is \"likely to have beneficial effects for consumers.\" If the defendant fails to offer such reasons, the plaintiff is entitled to prevail. However, if the defendant does offer such an explanation, the plaintiff must address the justification by either (1) explaining \"why it can confidently conclude, without adducing evidence, that the restraint very likely harmed consumers,\" or (2) providing \"sufficient evidence to show that anticompetitive effects are in fact likely.\" If the plaintiff succeeds in making either showing, \"the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show the restraint in fact does not harm consumers or has 'procompetitive virtues' that outweigh its burden upon consumers.\" However, if the plaintiff fails to rebut the defendant's initial justification, its challenge becomes a full rule-of-reason case.", "In Actavis v. FTC , the Supreme Court held that the rule of reason is the appropriate level of analysis for pay-for-delay agreements. Though it recognized the potential for such agreements to have anticompetitive effects, it acknowledged that \"offsetting or redeeming virtues are sometimes present.\" Such justifications might include \"traditional settlement considerations, such as avoided litigation costs or fair value for services.\" Accordingly, the FTC (or other plaintiff) has to fully prove the anticompetitive effects of a particular agreement before the burden shifts to the defendant.
