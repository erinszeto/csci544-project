The President's FY2016 budget requested increases for these accounts, as it did in the President's FY2015 and FY2014 requests. It departs from earlier Obama and Bush Administration budgets that explicitly stated the doubling goal. Enacted funding for FY2015 for these accounts represents a compound annual growth rate of 3.25% since FY2006, a rate that would result in doubling in 22 years.", "The President's FY2016 request continued support for three multi-agency R&D initiatives\u2014the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The request also continued support for the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative, the Materials Genome Initiative, and the National Robotics Initiative. The President proposed FY2016 discretionary funding for seven new manufacturing institutes as part of his proposed National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), in addition to the nine that have already been planned, competed, or awarded. The President also proposed $1.9 billion in mandatory funding for the establishment of 29 additional institutes between FY2017 and FY2024.

However, widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits are driving difficult decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. ", "The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D. Its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies.

Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process and may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to R&D or in accounts that include funding for non-R&D activities. These budgets are subjected to review, revision, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and become part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress.

Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending (for R&D as for other purposes) in light of the current federal deficit and debt. As Congress acts to complete the FY2016 appropriations process, it faces two overarching issues: the extent to which federal R&D investments can grow in the face of increased pressure on discretionary spending and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding. Budget caps may limit overall R&D funding and may require movement of resources across disciplines, programs, or agencies to address priorities. Moving funding between programs/accounts/agencies can become more complex and difficult because the funding for different programs/accounts/agencies is often provided through different appropriations bills.", "Structurally, this report begins with a discussion of the overall level of the President's FY2016 R&D request, followed by analyses of the R&D funding request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency R&D initiatives.

The doubling goal was expressed in President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative, in budget requests from President Obama before FY2014, and implicitly in the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). The America COMPETES Act and the reauthorization act set appropriations authorization levels consistent with a doubling pace of 7 years and 11 years, respectively.

When President Obama set forth the goal in 2009, total U.S. R&D expenditures were approximately 2.90% of GDP. In 2012, R&D as a percentage of GDP was 2.89%, with the federal government contributing 0.86% (down from 0.91% in 2009) and non-federal sources contributing 2.02% (up from 1.98% in 2009). Achieving the 3% goal would likely require a substantial increase in government and corporate R&D spending. In 2012, achieving the 3% goal would have required approximately $18 billion in additional R&D funding above the actual U.S. R&D funding level of $452.6 billion.", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, such as inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of R&D and the inclusion of R&D activities in accounts with non-R&D activities.

(See Table 8 .) However, RDT&E funds are also appropriated in other parts of the bill. For example, RDT&E funds are appropriated as part of the Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, and the National Defense Sealift Fund. The Defense Health Program (DHP) supports the delivery of health care to DOD personnel and their families. DHP funds (including the RDT&E funds) are requested through the Defensewide Operations and Maintenance appropriations request. The program's RDT&E funds support congressionally directed research in such areas as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions. Congress appropriates funds for this program in Title VI (Other Department of Defense Programs) of the defense appropriations bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program are requested through the Defensewide Procurement appropriations request. Congress appropriates funds for this program also in Title VI. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the procurement, operation and maintenance, and research and development of the nation's naval reserve fleet and supports a U.S. flagged merchant fleet that can serve in time of need. The RDT&E funding for this effort is requested in the Navy's Procurement request and appropriated in Title V, Revolving and Management Funds, of the appropriation bill.", "The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) also contains RDT&E monies.

Typically, the RDT&E funds appropriated for GWOT/OCO activities go to specified Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV. However, they are requested and accounted for separately. The Bush Administration requested these funds in separate GWOT emergency supplemental requests. The Obama Administration, while continuing to identify these funds uniquely as OCO requests, has included these funds as part of the regular budget, not in emergency supplementals. However, the Obama Administration has asked for additional OCO funds in supplemental requests, if the initial OCO funding is not enough to get through the fiscal year. The OCO budget has been declining as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are reduced. As the United States steps up its battle with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), OCO funding will continue. ", "In addition, GWOT/OCO-related requests/appropriations often include money for a number of transfer funds. These have included in the past the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Another transfer fund is the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund (MRAPVF). Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds, and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion. These transfers are eventually reflected in Title IV prior year funding figures. ", "For FY2016, the Obama Administration requested $69.785 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E.

", "The House approved $66.151 billion for DOD's baseline RDT&E program, $3.634 billion below the Administration's request. Most of this decrease can be attributed to reductions made to the Air Force's request. For example, the Long Range Strike program request was reduced by $460 million to reflect a rescheduling of the program. The Next Generation Refueling K-46 Aircraft program request was reduced by $275 million because the House determined that the request of $602 million exceeded needed funding. The House also expressed concern that the Air Force was using funds authorized for the Space Modernization Initiative to start new programs rather than to advance more evolutionary improvements in existing programs. As a result the House reduced the request for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency Military Satellite Communication program by $140 million and the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) program request by $51 million, while transferring the balance of the request for this latter program ($241 million) to the Air Force's Title IX OCO appropriation. This transfer of $241 million to the Air Force OCO RDT&E appropriation accounts for just a portion of the $1.349 billion increase the House approved in Air Force OCO RDT&E.

This funding supports research performed by more than 300,000 non-federal scientists and technical personnel who work at more than 2,500 universities, hospitals, medical schools, and other research institutions. OD sets overall policy and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The ICs focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support. Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with OD. As shown in Table 10 , Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to an intramural Buildings and Facilities account. The other three centers, which perform centralized support services, are funded through assessments on the IC appropriations.", "Funding for NIH comes primarily from the Labor, HHS, and Education (Labor/HHS/ED) appropriations bill, with an additional amount for Superfund-related activities from the Interior/Environment appropriations bill. Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. Each year NIH has also received $150 million in mandatory funding that is provided in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a special program on type 1 diabetes research. In addition, NIH has received funding via a PHS Act transfer. The total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of transfers, is known as the NIH program level.", "For FY2016, the Obama Administration requested an NIH program level total of $31.311 billion, an increase of $1 billion (3.3%) over the FY2015 level of $30.311 billion (see Table 10 ). The FY2016 program level request for NIH included $150 million in mandatory funding for research on type 1 diabetes. The FY2016 program level request also proposed $847 million in funding transferred to NIH by the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside, also called the evaluation tap. NIH and other HHS agencies and programs authorized under the PHS Act are subject to a budget assessment found in Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7238j). It authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify improvements. Although the PHS Act limits the evaluation tap to no more than 1% of eligible appropriations, in recent years the annual Labor/HHS/ED appropriations act has specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2015 and in FY2016) and directed specific amounts of funding from the evaluation tap for transfer to a number of HHS programs. The set-aside has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, has traditionally been the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds and, until recently, a relatively minor recipient. ", "Under the President's FY2016 budget request, most ICs would have received a 2% to 4% increase compared to FY2015 with few exceptions, such as a $70 million (6%) increase for the National Institute on Aging and a $57 million (17%) increase for the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The increase for NLM was targeted for the National Center for Biotechnology Information to support PubMed Central in providing public access to papers emanating from NIH research. The increase was also for ClinicalTrials.gov to accommodate the increased volume of clinical trial reporting due to a proposed expansion of NIH trial reporting policy and implementation of regulations related to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). ", "Except for the mandatory diabetes funding, Congress does not usually specify amounts for particular diseases or research areas. Congress generally appropriates specific amounts to each IC and leaves it to NIH and its scientific advisory panels to allocate funding to different research areas. Some bills may propose authorizations for designated research purposes, but funding generally remains subject to discretionary appropriations and the NIH peer review process.", "The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2016 Labor/HHS/ED appropriations bill ( H.R. 3020 ) would have provided NIH with a total of $31.184 billion, including $1.01 billion provided by the evaluation tap. Adding to this total the amount for Superfund-related activities ($77 million) and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program ($150 million) would bring the FY2016 NIH program level to $31.411 billion.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2016 Labor/HHS/ED appropriations bill ( S. 1695 ) would have provided NIH with a total of $32.084 billion, including $940 million provided by the evaluation tap and an estimated $650 million in new funding from the HHS Non-recurring Expenses Fund (NEF). Adding to this total the amount for Superfund-related activities ($77 million) and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program ($150 million) would bring the FY2016 NIH program level to $32.311 billion.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( H.R. 2029 , P.L. 114-113 ) provides $32.084 billion for NIH in Division H (the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations act): $31.304 billion for the ICs plus $780 million in funding via the PHS Act transfer. With the addition of the $77 million for Superfund-related research and the $150 million in diabetes funding, the NIH program level is $32.311 billion in FY2016, an increase of $2 billion (7%) over FY2015.", "The overview below outlines research priorities in the FY2016 NIH budget and selected responses from the House and Senate appropriation committee report language as well as the explanatory statement that accompanies the final bill, H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ). ", "BRAIN. About 54% of the proposed NIH budget focuses on basic biomedical and behavioral research. The Brain Research through Application of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative is a collaborative effort with the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It develops and applies new tools for the study of complex brain functions. The Administration requested a $70 million increase over FY2015 for the NIH portion of BRAIN, bringing the total to about $135 million in FY2016. The House report on H.R. 3020 stated that it would provide an $85 million increase for BRAIN in FY2016. The Senate report on S. 1695 stated that it supported a $70 million increase. P.L. 114-113 provides an $85 million increase for BRAIN.", "Alzheimer's Disease. To continue implementing the research components of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD), NIH estimated it would spend $638 million on AD research in FY2016, an increase of $51 million over FY2015. In a section on the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the House report on H.R. 3020 specified funding for Alzheimer's disease research at $886 million, an increase of $300 million over FY2015. In contrast, the Senate report on S. 1695 stated, \"In keeping with long-standing tradition, the Committee has not earmarked funding for research on specific diseases. However, the Committee has included a $350,971,000 increase for NIA and expects that a significant portion will be dedicated to high quality research on Alzheimer's disease, subject to the scientific opportunity presented in the peer review process.\" The explanatory statement on H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) states that an increase of $350 million is provided for Alzheimer's disease research.", "Antimicrobial Resistance. NIH would target $461 million in FY2016 to support the Administration's National Strategy to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, an increase of $100 million over FY2015. The increase is supported by both House and Senate appropriation committees as well as the explanatory statement on H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ).", "Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) . The FY2016 budget request proposed a total of $215 million for a multi-agency precision medicine initiative: $10 million to FDA to support the development of the necessary regulatory approaches, $5 million to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology for developing relevant data privacy and sharing requirements, and $200 million to support biomedical research at NIH. Of the amount for NIH, $130 million is for the development of a national research cohort composed of 1 million or more volunteers. The cohort's health, genetic, environmental and other data would be collected and used in research studies to identify novel therapeutics and prevention strategies. The proposal would use existing smaller research cohorts rather than recruiting 1 million new participants. The National Cancer Institute would use the remaining $70 million of NIH funds to explore the genetics of tumor cells that are resistant to therapy, to determine the efficacy of combination therapies that target specific tumor mutations, and for research on non-invasive methods to track response to cancer treatment. Both House and Senate appropriation committees indicated support for PMI and the explanatory statement states that it includes $200 million for PMI in FY2016.", "Biomedical Research Workforce. NIH estimated it would spend $785 million\u2014$23 million more than in FY2015\u2014to support 15,735 individuals, with a 2% stipend increase for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, in its major research training program, the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards. The explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) states it \"expects NIH to support the number of Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards and other training grants in proportion to at least the general IC level funding increase. The agreement expects NIH to provide a stipend level and inflationary increases to grantees that is at least consistent with any fiscal year 2016 Federal employee pay raise.\"", "National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) indicates that funding is provided directly to NLM for NCBI \"to meet the challenge of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and disseminating the increasing amounts of data related to research in molecular biology and genomics and to support the deposit of manuscripts in PubMed Central under the NIH Public Access Policy.\"", "Pediatric Research. NIH estimated it would spend over $3.6 billion on pediatric research in FY2016, an increase of $75 million over FY2015. The $13 million authorized for pediatric research by the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-94 ) would continue in FY2016. The House and Senate appropriation committees allocated $12.6 million for pediatric research via the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act as did the explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) which encouraged NIH to prioritize research on childhood cancer and provide an update in the FY2017 NIH budget request. ", "National Children's Study. Both committees commented on the cancellation of the National Children's Study (NCS) by NIH in December 2014. The House Appropriations Committee \"directs and provides funding for the continuation of the NCS in an alternative form\" while the Senate Appropriations Committee \"urges NIH to recalibrate and realign the investment already made in the NCS to initiate new and focus existing longitudinal studies to address the objectives identified for the NCS.\" The explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provides funding to the NIH Office of the Director for the follow-on to the NCS and \"expects NIH to continue to move forward based on the directions provided by the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"", "Research Project Grants. The main funding mechanism for supporting NIH extramural research is research project grants (RPGs), which are competitive, peer-reviewed, and largely investigator-initiated. The FY2016 budget requested total funding for RPGs of $17.2 billion, representing about 55% of NIH's proposed budget. The request would support an estimated 35,447 RPG awards. Within that total, 10,000 would be competing RPGs, an increase of over 1,200 grants compared with FY2015. (Competing awards are new grants plus competing renewals of existing grants.) NIH estimated the average amount of a competing RPG in FY2016 would be about $461,000, up from about $457,000 in FY2015.

Today, DOE conducts basic scientific research in areas ranging from nuclear physics to the biological and environmental sciences, basic and applied R&D relating to energy production and use, and R&D on nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and defense nuclear reactors. The department has a system of 17 national laboratories around the country, mostly operated by contractors, that together account for about 40% of all DOE expenditures.", "The Administration requested $14.178 billion in FY2016 for DOE R&D and related activities, including programs in three major categories: science, national security, and energy.

The FY2016 budget request did not mention the Obama Administration's previous goal of doubling the combined funding of the Office of Science and two other agencies. (For more information on the doubling goal and how it has evolved, see \" Efforts to Double Certain R&D Accounts .\") The original target, announced by the Bush Administration in 2006, was to achieve the doubling in the decade from FY2006 to FY2016. The FY2016 request for the Office of Science was 47% more than its FY2006 baseline. The House bill would have provided $5.100 billion, 40% above the baseline. The Senate bill would have provided $5.144 billion, 42% above the baseline. The final bill provided $5.350 billion, 47% above the baseline.", "The Office of Science includes six major research programs. The request for the largest program, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), was $1.849 billion, an increase of 6.7%. Within BES, a proposed increase of $62 million for continued construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) was slightly less than previously projected; however, the projected future cost of completing the project in FY2017 through FY2019 increased. A proposed increase of $35 million for Scientific User Facilities was to support increased operating hours at multiple BES research facilities. Energy Frontier Research Centers were to increase by $10 million to support up to 10 new centers. The House bill would have provided $79 million less than the request, including $8 million less for LCLS-II construction, $57 million less for Scientific User Facilities, and $12 million less for Energy Frontier Research Centers. The Senate bill would have provided the requested amount for LCLS-II construction, but $5 million less than the request for the remainder of the program.

Within this program, a proposed increase of $15 million for continued construction of the Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment (Mu2e) was slightly less than was previously projected; however, the projected future cost of completing the project in FY2017 through FY2019 increased. In the program's three major experimental research areas, proposed increases for cosmic frontier physics and energy frontier physics were approximately offset by a proposed decrease for physics at the intensity frontier. The House bill would have provided $12 million less than the request, including $9 million less for accelerator stewardship. The Senate bill would have provided approximately the requested amount overall, with $10 million more for construction of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility offset by $10 million less for research. Both bills would have funded Mu2e construction at the requested level. The final bill provided $795 million, an increase of $7 million above the request.

Essentially the entire increase was to be allocated to the Research and Evaluation Prototypes program. This activity supports R&D partnerships with vendors to influence and accelerate critical technologies for next-generation systems, system integration research, and development and engineering efforts. The Advanced Scientific Computing Research program is the focus of exascale computing activities in the Office of Science, accounting for $178 million of the $209 million requested for this crosscutting initiative.

Construction funding for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) was to be $150 million, the same as in FY2015. In 2008, the cost for the U.S. share of ITER, a multi-year international construction project, was estimated to be between $1.45 billion and $2.2 billion. Schedule delays, design and scope changes, and other factors have delayed formal approval of a revised cost estimate. According to DOE, the current best estimate of the total U.S. cost for ITER construction (which is 9.09% of the total international cost) is between $4 billion and $6.5 billion. In June 2014, the Government Accountability Office found that the cost of ITER has increased, its schedule has slipped, the international project schedule is \"not reliable,\" and DOE can \"only partially\" influence the international project's performance. All other major program areas in Fusion Energy Sciences were to decrease under the Administration's request. The Alcator C-MOD facility was to cease operations at the end of FY2016.

Funding for the Naval Reactors program was to rise by 11.5%, including increases for technology development, systems development, and facility operations and maintenance. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D was to increase by $26 million, but this was to result largely from a transfer of funding for materials characterization research and diagnostic equipment development to this account from Weapons Activities. The House bill would have provided $109 million less than the request for R&D in Weapons Activities, including $18 million less for Advanced Simulation and Computing, $16 million less for Advanced Manufacturing Development, and a number of other changes.

The request for Advanced Manufacturing was to support the establishment of two additional Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes (see \" National Network for Manufacturing Innovation \"). The proposed increase for Nuclear Energy reflected a rescission of unobligated prior-year balances in FY2015; without this rescission, the FY2016 request for Nuclear Energy would have been a $6 million decrease.

However, the request seeks slightly more (on average, as a percentage over the prior year) for accounts that did not receive extra funding over requested levels in FY2015 (i.e., GEO, SBE, IIA/OISE, and USARC). Nevertheless, more than half of the total requested increase for RRA in FY2016 (54% of $253 million) would have gone to BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS. ", "H.R. 2578 , as passed by the House, would have provided a total of $5.984 billion to RRA in FY2016\u2014about $50 million more than the FY2015 estimate. The House report further directed NSF to provide no less than 70% of total FY2016 RRA funding to BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS. Under these provisions, BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS would have split $4.189 billion in FY2016. This amount represents an 8% increase ($307 million) over the combined total that these four major subaccounts received in FY2015 ($3.882 billion). ", "The remaining major RRA subaccounts (GEO, SBE, OISE, IA, and USARC) would have split $1.795 billion. This amount was $257 million or -13% less than the combined total these accounts received in FY2015 ($2.052 billion). Other House report provisions further directed NSF to provide at least FY2015 levels to OISE, IA, and USARC. Therefore, of the $1.795 billion total provided for GEO, SBE, OISE, IA, and USARC in the House report, at least $475 million would have gone to OISE, IA, and USARC, while GEO and SBE would have split $1.320 billion. GEO and SBE received $1.577 billion (combined) in FY2015, which is $257 million (16%) more than they would have received in FY2016 under the House report. If NSF distributed these funds proportionally, which the House report did not require but has been past practice at NSF in some instances, the 16% decrease in funding would have reduced support for GEO by $212 million (from $1.304 billion in FY2015 to $1.092 billion in FY2015) and would have reduced support for SBE by $44 million (from $272 million in FY2015 to $228 million in FY2016).

The Senate report was silent on the question of the distribution of funding by major subaccount within RRA. Provisions in the Senate report included $15 million for research in biomanufacturing; $159 million for cybersecurity research; and $10 million for a pilot program to provide research funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) from within RRA. (HBCUs already receive targeted funding through EHR.) ", "The House report would have provided $160 million for the EPSCoR program; the Senate report would have provided just under this amount. The Administration requested $170 million for EPSCoR in FY2016, $10 million (6%) more than the FY2015 estimated funding level of just under $160 million.", "Education . P.L. 114-113 provides $880 million for EHR, $14 million (1.6%) more than in FY2015 and $153 million (2.5%) less than the request.

Most of the requested increase ($81 million or 83%) would have gone to activities classified as R&D. This additional investment in R&D would have further shifted the balance between R&D and education and training within EHR. The President's FY2016 request for EHR allocated 49% to R&D activities. By comparison, in FY2008 (the earliest year for which comparable budget data are available), R&D activities constituted 11% of EHR funding. The character of EHR's R&D funding has also shifted, moving from about 91% basic research in FY2008 to about 34% basic research in the FY2016 request. It is not entirely clear what has driven these changes or how these changes have affected program activities and constituencies.", "By program, the largest increase in the FY2016 EHR request was for Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE). The Administration requested $121 million in EHR funding for IUSE in FY2016, a $36 million (43%) increase over the FY2015 estimated level of $84 million. In addition, IUSE would have received $15 million in FY2016 RRA co-funding (from GEO, ENG, and BIO). The second-largest increase in the FY2016 EHR request was for EHR Core Research (ECR): STEM Learning, within the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings. The FY2016 request for ECR:STEM Learning was $49 million, or $24 million (92%) more than the FY2015 estimate of $26 million.

The FY2016 request for GRF was $338 million, $4 million (1%) over the FY2015 estimated level of $333 million. GRF funding have been split equally between RRA and EHR, which would each have contribute $169 million. The FY2016 request for NRT was $62 million, which is essentially the same as the FY2015 estimate. Funding for the NRT would not have been evenly split between EHR and RRA. The RRA contribution would have been $27 million, $7 million below the FY2015 estimate of $33 million. The EHR contribution would have been $35 million, $7 million above the FY2015 estimate of $28 million. EHR would have provided the majority of NRT program funding for the first time in at least five fiscal years.", "The House-passed and Senate Committee on Appropriations-reported versions of H.R. 2578 agreed on topline funding for EHR in FY2016. Each would have provided $866 million. This amount was equal to the FY2015 estimate and $97 million below the request.

Congress provided $69.7 million in FY2013, $80 million in FY2014, and $100 million in FY2015 for formulation of a Europa mission, which was a high priority of the 2011 National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey of planetary science. The NRC expressed reservations, however, at the mission's estimated cost of $4.7 billion, and in April 2014, NASA issued a request for information seeking Europa mission concepts costing less than $1 billion. NASA expects to formulate cost and schedule range estimates for a Europa mission during FY2016; it notes that the \"mission concept may require significant modification.\" The House bill would have provided $140 million for a Europa mission. Other Planetary Science increases in the House bill (relative to the request) included an additional $36 million for Mars Exploration, $20 million for production of plutonium-238 by the Department of Energy for use as an energy source in future NASA spacecraft, and $19 million for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Senate bill would have provided $40 million less than the request for Planetary Science. The Senate committee report was silent on funding for a Europa mission, but directed NASA to use the Space Launch System (see below) to launch the mission. The final bill included $175 million for a Europa mission; the explanatory statement \"clarified that this mission shall include an orbiter with a lander that will include competitively selected instruments and that funds shall be used to finalize the mission design concept with a target launch date of 2022.\" Overall, the final bill provided $270 million more than the Administration had requested for Planetary Science.", "Also in the Science account, the Administration requested an increase of 9.9% for Earth Science to support, among other initiatives, an expansion of the Sustainable Land Imaging program. Over several years, this program is to develop and launch the Landsat 9 land imaging satellite for the U.S. Geological Survey as a duplicate of the currently operational Landsat 8. The budget request also proposed development of a lower-cost Thermal Infrared Free Flyer satellite to reduce the risk of a gap in data availability prior to the launch of Landsat 9, and initiation of a technology development program to inform the future design of Landsat 10.

In the FY2015 budget, NASA proposed placing the SOFIA aircraft in storage unless international partners could support the U.S. share of its operating costs. Rejecting this proposal, the 113 th Congress provided $70 million for SOFIA in FY2015 and directed NASA to \"continue to seek partners to restore SOFIA to its full operational level.\" The House and Senate bills would both have provided the requested amount for SOFIA. The House bill would have prohibited NASA from using FY2016 funds to shut down SOFIA or prepare to shut it down.

Space Technology was first established as a separate account in FY2011. Each year since then, the Administration has proposed to increase Space Technology funding. Congress has provided increases each year except FY2014, but always less than the Administration's request. This pattern was repeated for FY2016. The House bill would have provided $625 million, including $25 million for icy satellite surface technology and $20 million for nuclear propulsion. The Senate bill would have provided $600 million, including $150 million for on-orbit satellite servicing and $20 million for the Flight Opportunities program.

Other recent Administration budgets similarly proposed to decrease Exploration Systems Development funding while increasing commercial crew funding. Many in Congress have seen these proposals as evidence of a difference in human spaceflight priorities between Congress and the Administration. Congress has generally appropriated less than the Administration's request for commercial crew and more for Exploration Systems Development. This pattern was again evident in the House and Senate bills for FY2016: the House bill would have provided $3.409 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $1.000 billion for commercial crew, while the Senate bill would have provided $3.510 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $900 million (in a different account, as noted above) for commercial crew. The pattern was less clear in the final bill, which provided $3.680 billion for Exploration Systems Development in the Exploration account and \"up to\" the requested amount for commercial crew in a different account. NASA argued that the requested amount for commercial crew was necessary to maintain the scheduled availability of commercial crew transportation to the International Space Station (ISS) starting in 2017. It noted that without a U.S. commercial capability, it will need to pay Russia for additional Soyuz flights to transport U.S. ISS crews (although it has also stated that it will likely purchase some additional Soyuz flights in any case). It asserted that the schedule for initial operation of Orion and the SLS (NASA plans a first crewed test flight for 2023) depends primarily on testing and development schedules and would be difficult to accelerate, even with additional funds. Some congressional supporters of Orion and the SLS argued that those programs have not received the funds they need to stay on schedule.", "Lastly, the Administration's FY2016 request included $3.106 billion for the ISS. Funding for the ISS includes the cost of commercial cargo flights for ISS resupply, as well as the cost of Russian Soyuz flights for U.S. ISS astronauts. The House bill would have provided $3.076 billion. The Senate bill would have provided $3.952 billion. As noted above, $900 million of the Senate provision for the ISS would have been for the commercial crew program, which was funded under Exploration in FY2015, the FY2016 request, and the FY2016 House bill.
