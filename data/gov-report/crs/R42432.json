Higher rents for offshore leases were imposed by the Secretary of the Interior in 2009 to discourage holding unused leases and to move more leases into production, if possible. Rents escalate over time. The escalation in annual rents is significant, as they rise from $7/acre to $28/acre (in year-8 forward) in water depths less than 200 meters, and increase from $11/acre to $44/acre (in year-8 forward) in water depths between 200 and 400 meters. However, Congress has not established a similar escalation for onshore leases, as they remain $1.50/acre for years 1-5, and then rise to $2/acre thereafter. ", "A nonproducing fee or an escalation of rents may not increase production but may increase the ratio of producing leases to active leases if some leaseholders relinquish their leases rather than pay the fee. Thus, there might be fewer \"idle\" leases and acreage not in production or exploration. The BLM can re-lease acreage that has been relinquished or passed over at a future lease sale.
