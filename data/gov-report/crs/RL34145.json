These people lack the food that they would need to lead active and healthy lives. FAO points out, however, that the amount of food aid that has been provided, an average of about 10 million metric tons per year from all donors, would make barely a dent in global hunger. The average annual total volume of food aid is equivalent to about 2% of world grain trade and less than 0.5 % of world grain production. If all the food aid in the world were distributed evenly among the 850 million hungry people, FAO calculates, it would provide only about 12 kilograms of grain per person per year.

USAID reports that in FY2006, more than 70% of U.S. food aid (Title II) was provided as emergency aid. In addition, FAO says, the timely delivery of food aid in emergency situations can relieve the pressure on poor people to sell scarce productive assets, thus enabling them to resume normal livelihoods when the crisis passes. But even in emergency situations other ways to enable people to get the food they need, such as providing cash vouchers for the poor to purchase food on local markets, may be preferable to in-kind food aid from overseas.", "While food aid can contribute to reducing chronic food insecurity, it alone is not sufficient. USAID notes in its Food Aid Strategic Plan for 2006-2010, that distributing food commodities by themselves is of limited use in reducing food insecurity.

Other major donors have different food aid policies. Most food aid provided by the European Union, the world's second largest food aid provider, is purchased in developing countries. The EU has transformed its food aid policy into a food security policy, with food aid being restricted to humanitarian crises and no longer used to support development activities. Canada, the world's third largest provider of food aid, since 2005, allows up to 50% of its food aid to be purchased locally or regionally.

Estimates are that it can take from three to five months for commodities shipped from U.S. ports to reach emergency destinations. Such delays make it difficult to get food to people, especially when there is a rapid onset of food need as in the 2004 Asian tsunami or more recently in response to food emergencies in East Africa. When commodities arrive late, they may no longer be needed or, if distributed, may disrupt local markets. In an effort to expedite arrivals, USAID has been pre-positioning commodities in ports nearer to where the emergencies are occurring. P.L. 480 legislation permits pre-positioning of commodities, but the current legislation limits the amount of funds that can be spent on pre-positioning.", "The cost-efficiency of delivering food commodities is affected by transportation costs and by the requirement that some portion of U.S. food aid be shipped on U.S. flag vessels (cargo preference). Transportation costs are high. According to USAID and USDA budget data, in FY2006, 55% of the funds allocated to P.L. 480 Title II ($930 million out of $1.7 billion) went to cover transportation costs, including both ocean freight and internal shipping, handling, and transportation. Ocean freight rates vary from year to year, but paying such costs is one reason why the Administration, in its farm bill proposals and in recent budget submissions has called for allocating some portion of funds available to P.L. 480 Title II to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are needed. This proposal is discussed below.", "The Cargo Preference Act (P.L. 83-644, August 26, 1954 as amended) contains legislation concerning the transportation of waterborne cargoes in U.S.-flag vessels. The act requires that 75% of the volume of U.S. agricultural commodities financed under P.L. 480 and other concessional financing arrangements be shipped on privately owned U.S.-registered vessels. Maritime interests generally support cargo preference, but opponents argue that it increases the costs of shipping U.S. commodities to poor countries and potentially reduces the volume of food aid provided. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that shipments of food aid on U.S.-flag vessels did little to meet the cargo preference law's objective of helping to maintain a U.S. merchant marine and that cargo preference requirements adversely affect operations of the food aid programs, chiefly by raising the cost of ocean transportation and reducing the volume of commodities that can be shipped. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), which reimburses food aid agencies for the costs of cargo preference, maintains, however, that its reimbursements \"appropriately and expeditiously\" compensate for the costs of using U.S. vessels.

CARE, which has been a supporter of monetization in the past, has decided to transition out of monetization over the next two years. According to CARE, monetization is management-intensive, costly, fraught with legal and financial risks, and economically inefficient. As CARE notes in its food aid policy paper: \"Purchasing food in the U.S., shipping it overseas, and then selling it to generate funds for food security programs is far less cost-effective than the logical alternative\u2014simply providing cash to fund food security programs.\" Echoing criticisms of commodity food aid heard in WTO Doha Round negotiations (discussed below), CARE notes that when monetization involves open-market sale of commodities to generate cash, which is almost always the case, it inevitably causes commercial displacement. As such, it can be harmful to traders and local farmers and undermine the development of local markets, and be detrimental to longer-term food security objectives. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has taken a similar position with respect to monetization, but has not announced a phase-out of monetization.", "Monetization has its supporters among the PVOs and cooperatives that implement development projects that use food aid. Supporters maintain that monetization can have multiple benefits particularly in low-income countries that depend on imports to meet food needs. In such circumstances, monetization, supporters say, can compensate for limited liquidity or limited access to credit for international purchases of food. Other benefits of monetization cited include its use to increase small-scale traders' participation in local markets and financial systems and its use to control urban price spikes. Furthermore, supporters say, monetized commodities can be integrated into agricultural processing operations, helping to establish feed mills, fortified foods, or other locally important products. In all such cases, proponents maintain, monetization programs should be subject to a market analysis (required in P.L. 480 legislation) to ensure that commodities monetized will not interfere with local production or marketing and that there is adequate storage for the commodities provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WTO Food Aid issues", "paragraphs": ["Food aid has become one of several unresolved issues in the current World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations that has been ongoing since November 2001.

The United States has, for the most part, argued for a continuation of commodity food aid, while the European Union has proposed that food aid be subject to rules that apply to other forms of export subsidies. The EU has offered to eliminate its agricultural export subsidies, a long-standing aim of U.S. agricultural trade policy, worth about $3 billion, if the United States will make parallel reductions in food aid and export credit guarantees. U.S. PVOs who monetize in-kind food aid commodities to finance projects in developing countries are concerned that new WTO disciplines aimed at preventing commercial displacement could severely limit their ability to do development work. Other U.S. PVOs that have made extensive use of monetization, however, have indicated that they will begin to phase out monetization as a source of funding for their development projects.", "Some agreement was reached on how to curb the export subsidy aspects of food aid at a Doha Round negotiating session in Hong Kong in December 2005.

The rationale for this proposed new authority is that it would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the U.S. response to food aid emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by ocean carriers.

The funds would have been used to purchase food for emergency relief in markets closer to their final destinations rather than in the United States as required under P.L. 480. The proposal, however, proved controversial with farm groups, agribusinesses, and the maritime industry that supply and ship commodities for Title II, and with many PVOs (PVOs) that rely on food aid to carry out development projects in poor countries.

This volume of commodities would not be subject to a waiver by the Administrator of USAID as is provided under current law. Mandates such as this one, especially without the possibility of a waiver, have generally been resisted by USAID, the Title II-administering agency. USAID's argument is that such mandates deny the Agency flexibility, especially, in responding to emergency food needs. The Administration's FY2007 budget request for P.L. 480 food aid included a proposal to eliminate the requirement in current law that 75% of Title II commodities be allocated to non-emergency food aid programs. The existing non-emergency commodity mandate has not been met in recent years ( Figure 2 ).

Current law provides that between 5% and 10% of Title II funds can be used for administrative and operational expense in connection with food aid programs. Also the Alliance proposes that such funds be used by eligible organizations to improve needs assessments and monitoring and reporting on the effects of monetization and other aspects of food aid programs. Increasing the cash available and broadening the purposes for which it can be used would, the Alliance maintains, enable food aid organizations to substitute cash for monetization in carrying out development projects where monetization is not appropriate. Despite calling for more cash to be made available for non-emergency programs, the Alliance stresses its continued support for monetization \"where appropriate, based on market analysis.\"", "The Alliance also calls for changes in current law regarding the Emerson Trust in order to make it a more reliable contingency for food aid emergencies. One rationale for making changes in the Trust is to enable it to respond in a more timely manner to emergencies. In addition, the Alliance wants to make Emerson Trust commodities more available so that non-emergency food aid would not be shifted to emergency relief. To accomplish these aims, the Alliance suggests increasing the amount of P.L. 480 Title II funds that can be used for BEHT reimbursements from $20 million per year (as provided in current law) to $60 million per year. This funding would be made available annually until the Trust reached its maximum level of 4 million metric tons, or the dollar equivalent. The Alliance contends that the Trust should be replenished with funds rather than commodities so that the most appropriate commodities can be procured when needed. Currently the Trust holds only wheat, which is not always the most needed commodity in emergency situations.", "The Alliance does not endorse the Administration's proposal for local or regional purchase of commodities for emergency food relief. It does, however, call for a pilot local purchase project to \"assure that accepted practices of food aid program are followed and to identify future methodologies and best practices for future programs.\" Neither does the Alliance endorse legislation introduced in the 110 th Congress to substantially increase funding for the McGovern-Dole program.

The group of four PVOs proposes the following changes in the BEHT:", "(1) Liquidate the current stocks in the Trust so that it will hold only cash;", "(2) Allow the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to invest the cash in the Trust in conservative short-term instruments for an appropriate return;", "(3) Require the Administration to use the Emerson Trust, once Title II emergency funding allocations have been made (to avoid the need to use development food aid to fund emergency responses); and", "(4) Provide authority to the CCC to automatically replenish the Trust in a fiscal year.", "Second, the group of four PVOs calls for establishing a \"bridging mechanism\" to ensure that there are no funding breaks in the food aid pipeline. The bridging mechanism would consist of authority for the Administrator of USAID to draw on CCC funds to contract for commodities and freight to meet programming needs in the next fiscal year prior to the actual enactment of an appropriation. The CCC would be reimbursed promptly from the Title II appropriation when it becomes available. The group argues that such a bridging mechanism would avoid small scale commodity purchases and shipments that occur early in the year, which push up both commodity and freight costs, and generally force PVOs to scale back or stretch out program resources to try to minimize harm to participants enrolled in planned or approved programs.", "The main issue raised by proposals such as these is cost. Using CCC funds to finance the operations of the BEHT or to establish a bridging mechanism as described by the group of four PVOs would be subject to \"pay-as-you-go\" budget rules, which means that any increase in mandatory spending that resulted from reforms of the BEHT would have to be offset by reduced mandatory spending elsewhere or with increased revenues.", "The third proposal from the group of four PVOs is to make more cash available to PVOs through Title II. This group argues that cash would provide greater flexibility in carrying out programs to fight world hunger. It maintains that the real causes of food insecurity and hunger cannot be solved over the long term by the provision of food aid alone and that additional resources in the form of cash are essential to address the hunger problem. Like the Alliance, the group of four focuses on Section 202(e) cash, but unlike the Alliance it calls for substantially increasing the funds available from 202(e) for both program operations and program costs to not less than 25% of funds available to Title II. The group of four also calls for using authorizing language patterned after that in the McGovern-Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. The legislative authorization for McGovern-Dole, the group notes, allows for a mix of commodities, cash, and technical assistance to carry out its programs. A strength of such authorizing language, according to the four PVOs, is that it discourages implementing organizations from monetizing commodities because it is much easier and more cost effective to use cash."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["Title III of the House- and Senate-passed versions of the farm bill reauthorizes and amends U.S. international food aid programs.
