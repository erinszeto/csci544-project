The electoral votes are scheduled to be opened before a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2017. Federal law specifies the procedures which are to be followed at this session and provides procedures for challenges to the validity of an electoral vote. This report describes the steps in the process and precedents set in prior presidential elections governing the actions of the House and Senate in certifying the electoral vote and in responding to challenges of the validity of one or more electoral votes from one or more states.", "This report has been revised, and will be updated on a periodic basis to provide the dates for the relevant joint session of Congress, and to reflect any new, relevant precedents or practices."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he House and Senate are scheduled to convene in joint session on January 6, 2017, for the purpose of opening the 2016 presidential election electoral votes submitted by state government officials, certifying their validity, counting them, and declaring the official result of the election for President and Vice President. This report describes the steps which precede the joint session and the procedures set in the Constitution and statute by which the House and Senate jointly certify the results of the electoral vote. It also discusses the procedures set in law governing challenges to the validity of an electoral vote, and makes reference to the procedures followed during the joint session in 2005 by which the election of George W. Bush was certified.", "Much of what follows in this report is based on the United States Constitution (particularly Article II, Section 1, and Amendment 12), and on a federal law enacted in 1887 (the Electoral Count Act of 1887) and amended in 1948, now codified in Title 3 of the United States Code . Reference is also made to congressional precedent and practice. Early congressional precedents on the counting of electoral votes, which may be found in Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives , are sometimes inconsistent with each other and with more recent practice. This record, coupled with disputes over the electoral count in 1877, provided the impetus for codifying procedure in the 1887 law. Precedents which pre-date the 1887 act may be primarily of historical significance, particularly to the extent that they are inconsistent with express provisions of the 1887 act, as amended.", "Due to the absence of specific and persuasive authority on some issues, and in the interest of brevity, this report attempts to at least identify and present some of the possible issues and questions that have been raised, even when not necessarily resolving them by reference to authoritative source material or decisions.

The first was an instance of what has been called the \"faithless elector\" problem. In 1969, a Representative (James O'Hara of Michigan) and a Senator (Edmund S. Muskie of Maine) objected in writing to counting the vote of an elector from North Carolina who had been expected to cast his vote for Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, but who instead cast his vote for George Wallace and Curtis LeMay. Both chambers met and voted separately to reject the objection, so when the joint session resumed, the challenged electoral vote was counted as cast. In that instance, the elector whose vote was challenged was from a state that did not by law \"bind\" its electors to vote only for the candidates to whom they were pledged. The instance of a \"faithless\" elector from a state that does, in fact, bind the elector by law to vote for the candidate to whom listed or pledged has not yet been expressly addressed by Congress or the courts.", "The second instance was related to reported voting irregularities in Ohio.

In one instance in 1969, the Speaker inquired whether a Member supported or opposed the challenge before he agreed to recognize him to speak.

The statutory provision first provides in the negative that \"no electoral vote ... regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified ... from which but one return has been received shall be rejected\" (3 U.S.C. \u00a715), and then reiterates for clarity that both houses concurrently may reject a vote when not \"so regularly given\" by electors \"so certified\" (3 U.S.C. \u00a715). It should be noted that the word \"lawfully\" was expressly inserted by the House in the Senate legislation (S. 9, 49 th Congress) before the word \"certified.\" Such addition arguably provides an indication that Congress thought it might, as grounds for an objection, question and look into the lawfulness of the certification under state law. The objection that votes were not \"regularly given\" may, in practice, subsume the objection that the elector was not \"lawfully certified,\" for a vote given by one not \"lawfully certified\" may arguably be other than \"regularly given.\" Nevertheless, the two objections are not necessarily the same. In the case of the so-called \"faithless elector\" in 1969, described above, the elector was apparently \"lawfully certified\" by the state, but the objection raised was that the vote was not \"regularly given\" by such elector. In the above-described 2005 case, the objection was also based on the grounds that the electoral votes \"were not, under all of the known circumstances, regularly given.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Receipt of Two Certificates from the Same State", "paragraphs": ["Influenced by its historical experience prior to 1887, Congress was particularly concerned in the statute of 1887 with the case of two lists of electors and votes being presented to Congress from the same state. Three different contingencies appear to be provided for in the statute for two lists being presented. In the first instance, two lists would be proffered, but the assumption presented in the law is that only one list would be from electors who were determined to be appointed pursuant to the state election contest statute (as provided for in 3 U.S.C. \u00a75), and that in such case, only those electors should be counted. In the second case, when two lists were proffered as being from two different state authorities who arguably made determinations provided for under 3 U.S.C. \u00a75 (a state statutory election contest determined at least six days prior to December 18, the winner of the state presidential election), the question of which state authority is \"the lawful tribunal of such State\" to make the decision (and thus the acceptance of those electors' votes) shall be decided only upon the concurrent agreement of both houses \"supported by the decision of such State so authorized by its law.... \" In the third instance, if there is no determination by a state authority of the question of which slate was lawfully appointed, then the two chambers must agree concurrently to accept the votes of one set of electors; but the two chambers may also concurrently agree not to accept the votes of electors from that state.", "When the two houses disagree, then the statute states that the votes of the electors whose appointment was certified by the governor of the state shall be counted. It is not precisely clear whether this provision for resolving cases in which the House and Senate vote differently applies only to the last two situations (that is, when either two determinations have allegedly been made under state contest law and procedure, or no such determination has been made); or, instead, also when only one such determination is present. Although this section of the statute is not free from doubt, its structure and its relationship to \u00a75 (and to give effect to \u00a75) seem to indicate that when there is only one determination by the state made in a timely fashion under the state's election contest law and procedures (even when there are two or more lists or slates of electors presented before Congress), then Congress shall accept that state determination (3 U.S.C. \u00a715) as \"conclusive\" (3 U.S.C. \u00a75). By this interpretation, the language providing that if the House and Senate split, the question shall be decided in favor of the choice certified by the governor, may not have been intended to be applicable to cases covered by the first clause in the statute in which only one slate or group has been determined, in a timely fashion, to be the electors through the state's procedures for election contests and controversies. Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives suggests that when a state has settled the matter \"in accordance with a law of that state six days before the time for the meeting of electors,\" then a controversy over the appointment of electors in that state \"shall not be a cause of question in the counting of the electoral vote by Congress.\" It should be noted that Hinds' cites no precedent or ruling, but merely paraphrases the statute, and it seems likely that this issue of the lawfulness of the determination and certification by a state could be raised and dealt with in the joint session.", "Precedent subsequent to the statute's original enactment in 1887 has been sparse. There appears only to have been one example, in 1961, when the governor of the state of Hawaii first certified the electors of Vice President Richard M. Nixon as having been appointed, and then, due to a subsequent recount which determined that Senator John F. Kennedy had won the Hawaii vote, certified Senator Kennedy as the winner. Both slates of electors had met on the prescribed day in December, cast their votes for President and Vice President, and transmitted them according to the federal statute. This was the case even though the recount was apparently not completed until a later date, that is, not until December 28. The presiding officer, that is, the President of the Senate, Vice President Nixon, suggested \"without the intent of establishing a precedent\" that the latter and more recent certification of Senator Kennedy be accepted so as \"not to delay the further count of electoral votes.\" This was agreed to by unanimous consent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Electoral Vote Timetable and Subsequent Action", "paragraphs": ["The timetable for the certification, transmission, review, and approval of the electoral votes was established by Congress to avoid a repetition of the extraordinary delay incident to the electoral vote controversy surrounding the 1876 presidential election.
