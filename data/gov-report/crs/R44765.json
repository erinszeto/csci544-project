India has the potential to be a much larger producer and consumer of natural gas. Competing political and economic factors have limited the government's effectiveness in changing the country's energy mix, which is heavily weighted toward coal and oil. Continually beset by high-profile environmental issues such as major air pollution and contaminated water supplies due to their reliance on coal and oil, the Indian government is now setting policies to increase lower-carbon energy use, but whether the government can overcome the economic and political hurdles remains a question. The portion of natural gas in India's energy mix, 7%, remains small compared to that of the United States, though it is comparable to similar emerging economies like Brazil, China, and South Africa. Despite India's intentions to double the proportion of natural gas consumption by 2022, achieving this goal would require major upstream, midstream, and downstream investments as well as the continued political will to enact the necessary changes to decrease reliance on coal and oil.", "India's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which Congress has expressed an interest. Those issues include the prospects for U.S. hydrocarbon exports, U.S. energy companies' investments, Indian investments in U.S. natural gas production, India's ability to meet its international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, and India's plans for integrating itself into the growing South Asian energy market. In the mid-2000s, Members of both houses of Congress expressed interest to formalize closer energy ties between the United States and India, and legislation was introduced. The legislation was not enacted into law; however, the executive branch has implemented programs to further improve the energy partnership between the two nations.", "India's central government manages its energy sector mainly via four ministries: Power; Coal; Petroleum and Natural Gas; and New and Renewable Energy; along with the Department of Atomic Energy. Decades ago the Government of India created entities designated \"Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)\" to ensure complete control of the petroleum logistics chain. These PSUs have become some of India's largest companies. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), and Indian Oil Corporation Limited are consistently ranked among the world's bigger energy companies. The PSUs are India's primary international and domestic energy actors, although some private sector companies have become key players as well. However, government control of the energy sector has stymied India's development of its domestic resources and hindered its efforts internationally. In the past decade, India has incentivized foreign access to its upstream sector as a way to increase domestic production. Some of India's energy companies are also investing more in U.S. energy projects and have signed contracts to import U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG).", "Due to limited drilling activity and available information, how much technically recoverable natural gas exists in India is unclear. However, India's current assessment of total reserves\u2014resources that are economically and technically viable under existing market conditions\u2014is estimated to represent less than 1% of the global natural gas total. As India attempts to shift away from coal and oil over the coming decades, natural gas production, especially from offshore resources, is seen as a way to increase domestic supply. Combined with improving infrastructure for imported LNG, India could become a bigger natural gas consumer in the future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["As India's economy continues to grow, its energy needs, including for natural gas, will likely grow as well.

In 2015 India accounted for 5.3% of global primary energy consumption, while China was the largest consumer with 22.9%. Overall, India imports almost three-quarters of its energy needs, making it highly dependent on other countries. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) believes India will remain the fastest-growing G20 economy in 2017-2018, with an annual projected growth rate of 7.5%. By 2050, India has the potential to overtake the United States as the world's second-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).

Similarly, natural gas accounts for 6% of China's energy mix, though China uses almost four times as much natural gas as India (see Figure 1 ). With an eye on increasing this percentage, India is instituting a number of policy initiatives like the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) and major infrastructure investments such as expanding domestic gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals. If global natural gas prices continue to be relatively low, natural gas consumption in India will likely grow in the coming decade. However, these changes likely will take significant investment and commitment from the Indian government to reach fruition.", "India's natural gas demand is forecasted to grow at about 6% annually over the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) due to increases in domestic production and falling LNG import prices. India is continuing to build its energy infrastructure for natural gas, which had previously been almost exclusively configured for coal and oil, to reverse the recent declines in natural gas consumption. In 2015, India's natural gas consumption declined almost 18% since its peak in 2011, two-thirds of which occurred between 2012 and 2013, in part because of large drops in domestic production and an inability to compensate for the drop in domestic production with LNG imports. The Government of India (GoI) has indicated it will change this in the short term, but the GoI's commitment and resources necessary for these changes are uncertain.", "India has not been a major factor in global natural gas markets as a producer, but is growing as an importer. India is the 27 th -largest natural gas producer in the world, accounting for less than 1% of global production, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy . In 2015, India's natural gas production fell by 3.8%, its fifth straight year of decline. This has been due to a variety of factors, including difficult geology, cheaper alternative energy sources, and lagging infrastructure development.

In 2015, India was the United States' 10 th -largest trading partner, comprising $39 billion in U.S. exports and $69 billion in U.S. imports. The two nations have also pledged to increase their annual trade about five-fold to $500 billion by 2024. India's relationship with the United States on energy issues, though not significant to the broader energy market, has grown closer in recent years.
