Diamonds used in this fashion, labeled \"conflict diamonds,\" were estimated to havecomprised an estimated 3.7 % to 15% of the value of the global diamond trade in 2000. The presentvolume of such trade appears is difficult to estimate. Several diamond-related conflicts have ended,but others have burgeoned. Policy makers' attention has also increasingly focused on the possiblerole that diamonds may play in the financing of terrorist operations.", "In response to public pressure to halt trade in conflict diamonds, and due to the persistence of several diamond-related conflicts, governments and multilateral organizations have pursued effortsto end such trade. Several international policy forums, national legislatures, and diverse privateparties have proposed various reforms and legislation to achieve such goals. Effective regulation ofthe diamond trade is difficult. Diamonds are a highly fungible, concentrated form of wealth, and theglobal diamond industry is historically insular and self-regulating. The illicit diamond trade exploitsthese factors. Proposals to end illicit trading generally center on legally identifying the origin ofdiamonds and requiring the registration, identification, and monitoring of cross-border trade indiamond, as is common for trade in other goods. Methods for achieving such ends include thecataloging of unique physical diamond features; the \"tagging\" of diamonds with minute markings;and the creation of certification-of-origin laws to document the origin of diamonds.", "The Clinton Administration worked to create a certificates of origin-based international diamond trade regime, but sought to ensure that such efforts would not negatively affect thelegitimate industry.

The BushAdministration has pursued policies that broadly mirror those of its predecessor.", "The United States participates in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, a global diamond trade regulation framework. The Administration began implementing the Scheme in the UnitedStates with voluntary interim compliance measures, prior to the passage of H.R. 1584 (see below). Several congressional hearings have addressed trade in conflict diamonds. Potentiallinks between terrorism financing and trade in diamonds have garnered increasing congressionalattention. The 106th and 107th Congresses considered several diamond-related bills. The108thCongress passed H.J.Res. 2 in February 2003; it contained several conflictdiamond-related provisions.

Observers have concluded that conflictdiamonds regularly enter into the legitimate international market through illicit trading practices andactors.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Magnitude of the Global Diamond Market", "paragraphs": ["Trade in conflict diamonds, and regulatory proposals to end trade in such gems, are associated primarily with the rough diamond market. In 2001, world-wide diamond mine output, that is,production of rough diamonds, was estimated to be worth $7.885 billion, compared to $7.86 billionin 2000 and between $6.857 and $7.25 billion in 1999. (32) An industry trade group has reported thatworld exports of rough diamonds rose by 25.32% in carat terms and 20.8% in price in the first 8months of 2002. (33) In most years, more roughdiamonds -- a mix of new production plus pre-existinginventories -- are sold on world markets than are produced during a given year. In 2000, a total ofnearly $9 billion of rough diamonds was estimated to have come to market globally, of which $5.67billion was reportedly sold by the De Beers Diamond Trading Company (DTC, formerly called theCentral Selling Organization). (34)", "U.S. Diamond Imports and Trade. U.S. market demand for diamonds is the largest in the world, and the vast majority of diamonds sold in theUnited States are imported. The value of rough diamonds imported into the United States totaled$597.38 million in 2001, $815.96 million in 2000, and $754.6 million in 1999. The value of workedbut unmounted diamonds imported into the United States is exponentially larger than that of roughdiamonds, amounting to approximately $9.17 billion in 1999, $11.28 billion in 2000, and $10.06billion in 2001. (35)", "U.S. diamond imports bolster a large U.S. diamond retail jewelry market. Estimates of the total size of the jewelry market vary widely; one published source estimates that the total U.S. retailmarket for diamond jewelry was worth $11.71 billion in 2001 and $11.54 billion in 2000. The samesource estimated the aggregate market value for all U.S. retail jewelry sales as being worth $39.53billion in 2001 and $39.8 billion in 2000. (36) Othersources suggest that the U.S. jewelry market maybe smaller, worth an estimated $26 billion in 2000, an increase of about 6% over 1999, representingabout 48% of a global $57.5 diamond jewelry retail market in 2000, which had itself grown from anestimated $56 billion in 1999. (37)", "Conflict Diamonds in Global Diamond Markets. De Beers/DTC, a large diamond mining and marketing business group, estimated that conflictdiamonds comprised approximately 3.7% of world diamond production in 1999. (38) That figure wasoften rounded up to 4% in press reports. Other estimates, cited by human rights and natural resourceactivist groups, suggest that the conflict diamond trade might have comprised as much as 15% of theworld trade in recent years. Some analysts, however, dispute such figures, asserting that they includeillicitly traded diamonds that are not associated with the funding of conflict.", "Some press accounts in 2002 have continued to cite estimates that indicate that about 4% of diamonds are conflict diamonds, but such references do not appear to be based on new orindependently obtained and verifiable data. The current proportion of the world diamond marketcomprised of conflict-related stones is difficult to reliably estimate, but it may be smaller than it wasin 2000 or 2001. In an April 2002 presentation, Rory More O'Ferrall, Director Public & CorporateAffairs for the De Beers Group of Companies, stated that \"conflict diamonds account for less than2% of world rough diamond production.\" (39) Thehypothesized decrease in the volume of trade inconflict diamonds may be attributable to the termination of wars in Angola and Sierra Leone,formerly two of the key sources of such gems. In addition, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) an on-going war appears to be waning, and to the extent that this conflict was fueled bydiamond wealth, trade in conflict diamonds from the DRC may also be diminishing. ", "Reliability of Conflict Diamond Statistics: Discussion. As previously noted, many aggregate diamond trade statistics aremerely approximations, based on assumptions about mining methods, rates of extraction, tradevolume trends, and other market factors. Some estimates take into account only official productionfigures, which ordinarily reflect state-reported or sales and production, and which may or may nottake into account -- or may erroneously estimate -- artisanal and unofficial production. (40) Estimatesof annual diamond production and trade value in countries where conflict diamonds are mined, inparticular, vary widely because credible or detailed data during periods and in sites of conflict areoften unavailable. The volumes and value of unreported or unofficial trade and production fromconflict-affected areas are particularly difficult to estimate, and as a proportion of such categoriesthat comprised of diamonds that directly fund military or associated activities is especially difficultto measure. Differentiating conflict diamonds from other types of illicitly-traded diamonds isextremely difficult; both varieties tend to be traded in a covert manner, and many of the same marketactors may engage in unofficial or illicit transactions involving both conflict and non-conflictdiamonds. (41)", "Conflict Diamonds as a Current Policy Challenge. Despite the paucity of current, independently verifiable data about the present extent of the conflictdiamond trade, advocates of diamond trade regulation maintain that regulatory efforts remainnecessary regardless of the current level of such trade. They stress that the regions that have beenaffected by diamond-related political unrest and conflict over the last decade remain volatile. Observers note that many of the same actors who were accused of being responsible for conflictsinvolving diamonds remain associated with diamond extraction and marketing operations. Inaddition, they note that diamonds continue to be the source of localized conflicts over control ofmining or trading rights. Advocates argue that bolstering states' ability to regulate the diamond trademay prevent future diamond-related conflict and, in addition, may enable countries to moreeffectively use their diamond wealth to fund national development efforts. Some industryrepresentatives broadly agree with such views.

Three primaryapproaches for determining the origin of diamonds have been proposed. (44)", "1. Physical or \"Geo-Chemical\" Identification of Diamonds. Research on geo-chemical methods for identifying diamonds by typeor as individual units focuses on the comparative analysis of trace elements and impurities withindiamonds. Such information would be used to establish common characteristics of diamonds fromsimilar areas or to pinpoint unique characteristics, in a manner analogous to fingerprinting, ofindividual diamonds. This research employs plasma mass spectrometry and related technologies.", "A related approach for purposes of tracking is to classify diamonds by their place of origin, and possibly on an individual stone-specific basis, by correlating surface, crystalline, and otherstructure-related features of rough diamonds. Such identification would be based on visualassessments and on the use of spectral refraction methods or optical, laser, x-ray, and other scanningtechnologies.", "Geo-chemical and automated physical characteristic identification technologies have not yet been perfected, according to many experts, many of whom also assert that such technologies arelikely to remain prohibitively expensive in the short to medium term. Another limitation of suchtechnologies is that some of the physical characteristics upon which identification methods dependare permanently altered or destroyed when diamonds are cut or polished. A third challenge is thatalluvial (surface) diamonds are often carried far from their points of origin by water or movementsof geologic elements. This means, in many cases, that diamonds from a particular country or sub-region cannot bephysically differentiated from those found in neighboring countries or regions.", "2. Tagging of Diamonds. This approach seeks to use laser and focused ion beam technologies to inscribe on individual diamonds identifyinginformation, such as microscopic bar codes, which can then be used to register and track stones.Several firms market such technology. Other firms offer technology that use laser scanningtechnologies to identify unique spectral features of individual, cut diamonds. The costs of taggingtechnology currently represent a barrier to their widespread use in diamond commerce, but expertopinion suggests that these prices may fall in the near to medium future. Critics point out that it maybe possible to cut off or otherwise physically alter or obliterate identifying marks that are cut ontodiamond surfaces.", "3. Certificate of Origin Laws. This approach seeks to create a legally-binding chain of warranties from the point of mining origin to the countryof importation or, in some proposals, to the retail level. The objective is to create tradedocumentation that, based upon verification by the authorities of an exporting country, validates thelegal origin of diamonds. Such documentation would form the basis for findings of legal fact inefforts to track and monitor the diamond trade, and in determining the legitimacy of commercialdiamond transactions. The approach relies on diamond importing countries to implement effectiveadministrative processes and law enforcement procedures and adhere to shared regulatoryprocedures.

Administration witnesses at these two hearings expressed the Bush Administration'scommitment to working with the Congress to craft a legislative response to help end the conflictdiamond trade, as did U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick in testimony before the SenateCommittee On Finance on February 6, 2002. (66)", "On November 5, 2002, the Bush Administration signed the Interlaken Declaration. In doing so, the Administration agreed that the United States would abide by and implement the KimberleyProcess Certification Scheme. Administration officials are now initiating a consultation process withrelevant congressional committees in support of that goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Role", "paragraphs": ["Members of the 107th Congress showed interest in ending the conflict diamond trade, as had some in the 106th Congress. Members' interest centered on the reported link between diamonds,human rights abuses, and threats to peace and security in affected regions and -- increasingly -- onpotential threats that the trade may pose to U.S. national security interests, especially in relation tothe possible role of diamonds in terrorist financing. Congressional policy makers' legislativeinitiatives generally sought to curtail the ability of rebel groups fighting established governments tofund their armed activities through diamond export sales. Allegations that diamonds may play a rolein financing of international terrorist groups have also drawn congressional attention. Severalcongressional committees have held hearings that have assessed the reported connection betweendiamonds and financing of terrorist groups.", "Several hearings in both the House and Senate have directly addressed the conflict diamond trade. These hearings include:", "Africa's Diamonds: Precious, Perilous Too? , hearing held before the House Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on Africa on May 9,2000.", "Trade in African Diamonds , hearing held before the House Ways and Means Committee, Trade Subcommittee on September 13, 2000.", "Conflict Diamonds , hearing held before the House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Trade on October 10, 2001.", "Illicit Diamonds, Conflict and Terrorism: The Role of U.S. Agencies in Fighting the Conflict Diamond Trade , hearing held before the Senate Committee on GovernmentalAffairs, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring and the District ofColumbia on February 13, 2002.", "Conflict diamonds have also been addressed in the context of hearings on U.S. policy on Sierra Leone, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and with regard to U.N. activities in Africaand to terrorism financing. During a September 19, 2002 hearing on terrorist financing andimplementation of the USA PATRIOT Act before the House Committee on Financial Services, forinstance, Robert Mueller, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called for legislation thatwould allow for the pre-trial freezing of fungible assets linked to alleged criminal offense, includingdiamonds, gold and other precious metals, \"without requiring strict tracing to the offense.\" (67)", "In addition to addressing human rights and conflict-related concerns, conflict diamond hearings n the 106th and 107th Congresses highlighted congressional interest in ensuring thatproposals toregulate international trade in diamonds and any U.S. legislation to implement such proposals beconsistent with relevant World Trade Organization trade rules. Hearing witnesses called forlegislative solutions that would not penalize legitimate producers of diamonds, such as Botswanaand South Africa. Some witnesses expressed concern that a failure to enact legislation to curtail theconflict diamond trade and to introduce methods of separating legitimate diamonds from illicitdiamonds might lead to a consumer-driven decrease in market demand for all diamonds, thusdamaging the revenue base of legitimate diamond producing nations. In the October 2001 hearingbefore the Subcommittee on Trade of the House Committee on Ways and Means, industry and non-governmentalrepresentatives described growing consensus between their respective interest groupson the need to finalize the Kimberley Process.", "Legislation: 107th Congress. As in the 106thCongress, several conflict diamond-related bills were introduced in the 107th Congress.

Among these bills, H.R. 2506 (Kolbe) [ P.L. 107-115 ] was the only onein which diamond-related provisions were included in the final version of legislation signed into law.It prohibited certain OPIC and Ex-Im Bank diamond-related projects in countries not implementinga system of rough diamond export and import controls, as defined in the Act. It also prohibited theuse of funds appropriated by the Act to assist countries that the Secretary of State determines,according to criteria outlined in the Act, to have actively destabilized the democratically electedgovernment of Sierra Leone or aided or abetted illicit trade in Sierra Leonean diamonds.", "108th Congress. The 108th Congress, like the pasttwo Congresses, has demonstrated continuing interest in ending the conflict diamond trade.", "H.J.Res. 2. Several conflict diamond-related provisions were included in H.J.Res. 2 , the ConsolidatedAppropriations Resolution, 2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ). These include Section 570, which imposes restrictionson assistance to governments destabilizing Sierra Leone, and Section 583, which imposes conflictdiamond-related restrictions on the use of Overseas Private Investment Corporation andExport-Import Bank funding allocations. Section 583 prohibits the use of such funds in connectionwith any project involving the mining, polishing or other processing, or sale of diamonds in acountry that fails to implement the Kimberley Process recommendations, obligations orrequirements, or fails to undertake other measures to effectively prevent and eliminate trade inconflict diamonds. The Resolution also recommended that \"$2,000,000 should be made availablefor assistance for countries to implement and enforce the Kimberley Process ImplementationScheme\" from allocated Economic Support funds.", "The committee of conference managers' Joint Explanatory Statement for H.J.Res. 2 (see conference report, H.Rept. 108-10 ) also contains two provisions related to conflict diamonds.First, conferees stated their expectation that of funds provided to the Council of American OverseasResearch Centers, \"necessary funds\" would be granted for research to develop a diamondfingerprinting technology to facilitate monitoring of the international trade in conflict diamonds.Second, the Statement, reflecting the language of the Joint Resolution, as passed, recommended the$2,000,000 technical assistance, and noted that the Senate amendment to H.J.Res. 2 would have provided $3,500,000 for such a purpose, but that the House bill did not address thismatter.

In early January 2003, Representative Thomas, chairman of the HouseWays and Means Committee, announced that he would seek \"to enact legislation as soon as possiblethat meets the Kimberley Process goals, is administrable, and complies with our World TradeOrganization (WTO) obligations.\" (68) SenatorGrassley also announced his intention to sponsorKimberley Process implementing legislation. (69)", "Representative Thomas later tied the introduction of such legislation to receipt of an understanding from the European Union (EU) that it would not oppose a WTO waiver for theKimberley Process. According to Inside U.S. Trade , EU policy makers did not see a need for a WTOwaiver for the Kimberley Process, a position that reflected a \"broad interpretation of which traderestrictions require a waiver from WTO obligations.\" (70) An Inside U.S. Trade source postulated thatif a broad interpretation were upheld \"the EU would be free to invoke certain trade restrictions ofits own without first getting a waiver, which has become increasingly difficult.\" (71) Pendingindications from the EU that it would not oppose U.S. Kimberley Process legislation, RepresentativeThomas stated that he would not move U.S. legislation intended to bring the United States intocompliance with a ruling by the WTO on certain provisions of U.S. export tax laws relating to U.S.Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) export tax benefits and related extraterritorial income replacementprovisions. (72) The concerns raised byRepresentative Thomas appear to have been resolved by theissuance of a February 26, 2003 WTO waiver for the Kimberley Process (see below), followingwhich he again stated his intention to introduce supporting legislation.

The Campaign is a coalitionof non-profit groups that have advocated strong regulation of the trade in conflict diamonds and haveparticipated in the Kimberley Process. (74)", "H.R. 1415 and H.R. 1584. To prevent conflict diamonds from entering or exiting the United States, and to provide authority toimplement the Kimberley Process in this country, Representative Houghton introduced two bills, H.R. 1415 , on March 25, 2003, and H.R. 1584 , on April 3, 2003. Both billswere entitled the Clean Diamond Trade Act and were broadly similar, but differed on certain points,primarily relating to provisions specifying which agencies would have the duty and authority toadminister the law, if passed.", "Among other provisions, both bills would have required the President to prohibit the import or export to or from the United States of \"any rough diamond, from whatever source, that has not beencontrolled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\" Both would have allowed a waiverof such a prohibition for up to a year if the President determines and reports to Congress that a roughdiamond exporting or importing country is taking effective steps to implement the KimberleyProcess Certification Scheme or the President determines that such a waiver is in the nationalinterests of the United States, and reports such a determination and the reasons for it to Congress.Both bills also included a range of enforcement provisions and policy recommendations, some in\"sense of Congress\" language, as well as reporting requirements. ", "H.R. 1584 , as introduced, differed from H.R. 1415 primarily in that it specified additional reporting requirements and references the U.S. Trade Representative in astatement of policy. It also authorized the President to direct the Bureau of Customs and BorderSecurity, among other potential agencies, to assist countries seeking to export rough diamonds to theUnited States by providing them with technical assistance related to compliance with U.S. tradelaws.", "On April 8, 2003, an amended version of H.R. 1584 was passed by the House. Key amendments to the bill included changes to the specification of appropriate committees ofjurisdiction ( viz. Section 3 of the bill) and to related reporting requirements. A statement of policyremoved reference to particular agencies and instead expressed support for \"the policy that thePresident shall take\"; similarly, another provision on potential technical assistance to third countriesseeking to implement the Scheme removed reference to the Bureau of Customs and Border Security.Expeditious Senate consideration of the amended bill was expected by some observers.", "On April 9, 2003, H.R. 1584 , as amended, was received in the Senate. During Senate consideration of the measure on April 10, Senator Hatch proposed a substitute amendmentto H.R. 1584 , S.Amdt. 529 , on behalf of Senator Grassley. The Senate thenby unanimous consent passed S.Amdt. 529 , which reflected the language of S. 760 , as reported on April 9, 2003 by Senator Grassley (see below), and the measurewas sent to the House. The two chambers' versions of H.R. 1584 , which were largelysimilar, differed with regard to the wording of a shared provision, Section 11, that deals with theestablishment of a proposed Kimberley Process Implementation Coordinating Committee. On April11, 2003, Representative Thomas, speaking in favor of the bill, asked unanimous consent that theHouse agree to the Senate amendment, which was agreed to without objection. The enrolled bill wassigned into law by President Bush on April 25, 2003, and became P.L. 108-19 .", "When President Bush signed H.R. 1584 into law, he did so after referring to several significant caveats relating to the manner in which he stated that he will construe the dutiesthat the law gives discretion to the president to carry out. Some may view these caveats as lendinga novel interpretation to the effective date on which the law is to take effect, and the manner in whichit is to be implemented. President Bush stated that:", "Although under this Act I have discretion to issue regulations consistent with future changes to the KPCS, under the Constitution, the President cannotbe bound to accept or follow changes that might be made to the KPCS at some future date absentsubsequent legislation. I will construe this Act accordingly. [...] If section 15 imposed a mandatoryduty on the President to certify to the Congress whether either of the two specified events hasoccurred and whether either remains in effect, a serious question would exist as to whether section15 unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to international bodies. In order to avoid thisconstitutional question, I will construe the certification process set forth in section 15 as conferringbroad discretion on the President. Specifically, I will construe section 15 as giving the Presidentbroad discretion whether to certify to the Congress that an applicable waiver or decision is in effect.Similarly, I will construe section 15 as imposing no obligation on the President to withdraw anexisting certification in response to any particular event. Rather, I will construe section 15 as givingthe President the discretion to determine when a certification that an applicable waiver or decisionis no longer in effect is warranted. (75)", "S. 760. On April 1, 2003, Senator Grassley introduced S. 760 , entitled the Clean Diamond Trade Act. The bill was referred to theCommittee on Finance, which on April 2 ordered it reported out favorably with an amendment( S.Rept. 108-36 ) offered by Senator Baucus. On April 9, 2003, S. 760 was reported bySenator Grassley with amendments (see S.Rept. 108-36 ) and placed on Senate Legislative Calendarunder General Orders, Calendar No. 62. S. 760 appears to be a companion bill to H.R. 1415 and H.R. 1584 ; most of its language is identical to that of theHouse bills, particularly H.R. 1584 , though some of its provisions are distinct anddifferent. In particular, it specifically requires the Secretary of State to publish in the FederalRegister certain information pertaining to countries and foreign authorities responsible for regulatingtrade in rough diamonds. The version of the bill passed out of the Finance Committee also amendedSection 10 (c) of the bill as introduced, which reflected the language in H.R. 1584 , byrequiring the establishment by the President of a U.S. Kimberley Process [interagency] CoordinatingCommittee and by specifying the officials and agencies that would comprise that panel. The versionof H.R. 1584 enacted into law (see discussion above) is virtually identical to S. 760 .", "H.Con.Res. 239. On June 26, 2003, following the enactment of P.L. 108-19 , Representative Watson introduced H.Con.Res. 239 , the Conflict Diamonds Resolution , for herself, Representative Lantos, and RepresentativePayne. H.Con.Res. 239 proposes, in \"sense of the Congress\" language, that theinternational diamond industry, \"as represented by the World Diamond Council,\" should provide\"transition development assistance\" to communities and specific groups in Sierra Leone, Angola,and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Specific groups that it proposes be assisted include ex-combatants, femalevictims of war-related sexual and gender-based violence, war-injured amputees,and African diamond industry workers. It proposes that an international diamond industry fund beset up to finance initiatives in these countries to assist these groups, as well as programs in supportof HIV/AIDS programs, economic development, social service provision, and political reconciliationprocesses in these countries. It also lays out a number of steps that the international diamondindustry should be encouraged to continue to take in support of the development and implementationof the Kimberley Process. These include the development and implementation of \"a comprehensive,reliable, standardized, and auditable chain of warranty system to support the Kimberley Process.\"", "Discussion. In contrast to some bills introduced in the 107th Congress, H.R. 1415 , H.R. 1584 , and S. 760 didnot attempt to regulate trade in polished diamond or jewelry provisions, primarily because these billsappear to be intended solely to provide authority to implement the Kimberley Process CertificationScheme (KPCS), which pertains only to rough diamonds. ", "Some groups who have sought a strict and more comprehensive regulation of the international diamond trade have criticized the KPCS for not including measures to control diamonds that havebeen rudimentarily processed, polished, or made into jewelry. They see the omission of suchrequirements in the KPCS as a \"loophole,\" and assert that unscrupulous diamond traders might skirtthe spirit of the KPCS by: ", "Superficially altering a diamond to make it meet minimal standards qualifying it as polished or otherwise processed, and thus not subject to KPCS regulations or;", "Setting a diamond in a temporary mounting, for purposes of export or import,thus qualifying it as jewelry. ", "To prevent the potential use of such alleged loopholes, these policy advocates generally call for all rough and loose polished diamonds, as well as mounted diamonds (i.e., diamond jewelry), to beaccompanied by a certificate of origin, in order to offer a consumers a more robust guarantee thata diamond being purchased is legitimate and not of conflict-related origin. (76)", "Some in the diamond trade have generally argued against a more extensive certificate regime. They assert that the financial, administrative, and logistical costs of such an approach wouldoutweigh the benefits and might negate what are often described as marginal profit margins in thediamond industry generally. Some have also argued that the imposition of such costs might alsosharply cut revenues earned by developing nations, such as Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa,which rely significantly on diamonds to fund socio-economic development. Proponents of moreextensive certification approaches have generally maintained that the kinds of administrative andother overhead costs cited by the diamond industry are minimal and marginal when weighed againstthe social costs -- lost human lives, mutilated limbs, emotional damage, and social disintegration-- of not enacting strong laws to end the conflict diamonds trade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Kimberley Process: U.S. Implementation. The Administration signified its intent to implement the KPCS by signing on to the InterlakenDeclaration (see section on Kimberley Process).
