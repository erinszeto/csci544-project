(1) Contract authority, provides obligationalauthority for the funding of trustfund financed programs, such as the federal-aid highway program. Prior to TEA-21,changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had beenachieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budget/contractauthority and placing limitations on obligations. The principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds tocongressional budget agreements. ", "Contract authority is tantamount to, but does not actually involve, entering into a contract to pay for a project at some future date. Under this arrangement, specifiedin Title 23 U.S.C., which TEA-21 amends, authorized funds are automatically madeavailable to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligatedwithout appropriations legislation. Appropriations are required to make outlays atsome future date to cover these obligations. As will be discussed, TEA-21 greatlylimits the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programsbecause the Act sets the limitation on obligations level for the period FY1999through FY2003.", "Highway and transit grant programs work on a reimbursable basis: states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work iscompleted and vouchers are presented, perhaps months or even years after the projecthas begun. Work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds andalthough they are considered \"used\" and remain as commitments against the trustfund balances, they are not subtracted from balances. Trust fund balances, therefore,appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected futurecommitments must remain available.", "Both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short- and long-term commitments. These include payments that will be made in the current fiscal yearas projects are completed and, to a much greater extent, outstanding obligations tobe made at some unspecified future date. Additionally, there are unobligatedamounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects, but have not beencommitted to specific projects.", "Two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs. The first of these, apportionments, refers to fundsdistributed to the states for formula driven programs. For example, all nationalhighway system (NHS) funds are apportioned to the states. Allocated funds, arefunds distributed on an administrative basis, typically to programs under directfederal control. For example, federal lands highway program monies are allocated;the allocation can be to another federal agency, to a state, to an Indian tribe, or tosome other governmental entity. These terms do not refer to the federal budgetprocess, but often provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients, whomay assume, albeit incorrectly, that a state apportionment is part of the federal budgetper se. ", "For FY1999, the DOT requested total funding of $43.259 billion, about a 1.0% increase from the FY1998 enactment of level $42.828 billion.

The act, whichauthorizes appropriations for key transportation programs through the fiscal year2003, emphasizes certain programs and de-emphasizes others. The general sense ofCongress appears to be that, although transportation trust funds are not sacrosanct,proceeds from the gasoline tax must be targeted towards the maintenance of the vastU.S. highway and transit network, and not viewed as a source of revenue for thegeneral treasury. Although attempts to move highway and transit programs\"off-budget\" were unsuccessful, Congress did insert language within TEA-21toprotect specific funding by creating \"fire walls\" around programs.

Finally, the Administrationcontends that it has accomplished all of these advances and provided for futureimprovements in a fiscally responsible manner.", "In reality the Administration's FY1999 request is very similar to the levels of funding provided in the FY1998 Act. This is very much the result of the BalancedBudget Act of 1997. The Administration request has now been somewhatsuperceded by passage of TEA-21. By signing this legislation the Administration hasagreed to a somewhat higher level of spending for surface transportation in FY1998then it had proposed earlier in the year. In addition, the Administration has agreedto much higher levels of spending in the period FY1999-FY2003. ", "One of the principal provisions of TEA-21 is a change in the budget treatment of the highway and transit programs. This new legislation sets a limitation onobligations for program spending in each of the next 6 fiscal years and does so bycreating \"fire walls\" that prevent reductions in spending below agreed upon levels. This action deprives the House and Senate Appropriations Committees of theirtraditional authority to determine the absolute level of spending for these programs. Instead the committees now control spending of only a small portion of the highwayand transit programs.", "Over the last several years the Administration has attempted to find more funding for infrastructure by changing the way infrastructure was financed.

Although the SIB program had been adopted by 10 states, with an additional 15expressing interest, the program was reduced to four states by language in TEA-21.

One importantprovision in the Act is a clarification of TEA-21's distribution of high priority projectfunds. The Act gives the states considerable leeway in their treatment of these fundsand allows the states to set overall priorities without having to treat each high priorityproject as a separate pot of money. Finally, the Act provides no funding in thetransportation section for the Appalachian highway program.", "The Act also provides some highway funding in the emergency supplemental portion of the omnibus act.

Appropriators's had the ability tomake specific decisions about a number of smaller highway and highway safetyprograms.", "The Senate Committee on Appropriations bill set core spending at the TEA-21 limitation on obligation level. Total FHWA spending was just over $27.0 billion. The committee did make a number of recommendations about spending for particularactivities. For example, FHWA operating expenses were increased over the FY1998level, but not to same degree as proposed by the Administration. The committee alsomade a number of recommendations about the ITS program aimed primarily atincreasing spending for actual ITS projects, as opposed to ITS promotion. Finally,spending for the Appalachian highway system was set at $200.0 million. This is$100.0 million less than the FY1998 level and below the spending level that couldbe supported by TEA-21.", "The House Committee on Appropriations also respected the TEA-21 fire walls for core highway spending. Total funding for FHWA was set at $26.7 billion, whichis somewhat below the Senate level.

Recent Administrations, beginning withthe Reagan Administration, have proposed reductions and/or outright elimination ofthese programs. Transit tends to be supported on a local basis, with the majority ofsupport coming from urban areas. Support for sometimes competing highwayprograms is seen as having a much broader base, especially because of the absenceof transit systems in rural areas. Transit programs have continued largely, due tostrong congressional support from Members representing urban areas.", "For FY1999, the Clinton Administration proposed a slight decrease in total FTA funding over FY1998 levels, $4.78 billion. Essentially, the Administration's proposalwould have consolidated most of the existing programs into a $3.6 billion formulaprogram. The Administration's proposal would have consolidated the discretionarybus and bus related program and fixed guideway modernization program into theformula grants program All funding for this program would have come from thetransit account of the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Only the fixed guidewaymodernization formulas would have been retained as a separate component of theconsolidated program. The new starts programs, renamed the Major CapitalInvestment Program, would have continued to allocate discretionary funds for fixedguideway systems.
