An RLF, which requires a matching contribution from the grantee, allows the grantee to award low-interest loans to businesses that can demonstrate that they are unable to obtain bank financing. Loan repayments by qualified businesses to an RLF are used to cover administrative costs of the program and to recapitalize the RLF in order to make additional loans. Local administrators of RLFs are required to operate the funds in perpetuity as long as there is a federal interest in assets of the RLF. However, RLFs may be terminated for cause by EDA. According to EDA, in FY2009, 458 recipient organizations administered 578 RLFs with total capital assets of $852 million. This amount is approximately three times the size of the EDA total appropriation for FY2010 and represents a significant source of funding for the recipient organizations.", "EDA's RLF program has not been without controversy, including issues of inadequate monitoring and reporting. In March 2007, the Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released an audit report that was critical of EDA's administration of RLFs. The report noted the following: ", "EDA (1) failed to ensure efficient capital utilization by RLF grantees, (2) did not ensure grantee compliance with critical reporting requirements, (3) does not have an adequate tracking and oversight system, and (4) does not utilize single audit reports to improve grantee monitoring.", "The report also noted that much of the RLF information available to EDA that would allow it to administer the program effectively was incomplete or inaccurate. The OIG recommended that EDA take the following actions: ", "develop a plan of action to address the problems in the program; require EDA regional staff to provide written evaluations of appropriate capital utilization percentages for all RLFs with a capital base exceeding $4 million; develop policies and procedures that will promote a uniform approach to sequestering excess cash; consistently collect and evaluate grantee financial reports; and develop and implement a database and reporting requirements that will allow EDA to monitor RLF programs effectively. ", "On January 27, 2010, EDA published in the Federal Register final rules intended to address the unresolved issues discussed in the OIG report. The revised regulations noted that EDA had developed a web-based reporting system allowing grantees the option of uploading or manually entering data into the system. The agency also:", "revised its semi-annual reporting forms to allow it to monitor program performance more closely, including identifying RLFs with high loan default rates; identified specific violations of policies that would cause EDA to suspend or terminate an RLF program, in an effort to encourage grantees to comply with program reporting requirements; and required each grantee administering an RLF to hire an independent third party to conduct a compliance and loan quality review of its RLF every three years. ", "Although EDA has moved to address many of the management concerns identified in the OIG report, other issues may require congressional action. Of particular concern to local administrators of RLF programs is the permanent federal nature of RLFs, which they find too restrictive. Local administrators would like the flexibility of using RLFs to cover the costs of other EDA-eligible activities. This view was articulated during May 21, 2009, testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works by a representative of the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), who complained that the permanent federal nature of RLFs inhibits local flexibility and requires RLF grantees to comply with \"costly reporting and audit requirements.\" The NADO representative recommended that the committee, when amending the PWEDA, consider provisions that would allow EDA-capitalized RLFs to relinquish their federal identity after initial funds have been loaned, repaid, and fully revolved. The economic development analyst argued that this would reduce EDA's management burden and allow local grantees greater flexibility in the use of funds than federal regulations currently allow. ", "It might be argued, however, that recent regulatory changes allow grantees more flexibility. For example, current regulations allow RLF administrators to use repayments to RLFs to cover the cost of administrative expenses, including a compliance audit that must be conducted every three years by a qualified independent third party. In addition, according to EDA, the new streamlined web-based reporting system eliminates duplication and will \"reduce the average paperwork burden per RLF [semi-annual] report on the RLF recipient from 12 hours to 2.9 hours.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relative Needs Thresholds and Federal-Local Cost Share Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Currently, the statute governing EDA assistance limits the federal contribution for an EDA-financed project to no more than 50% of a project's total cost when the project is located in an area whose unemployment rate for the latest 24-month period is at least one percentage point above the national average or whose per-capita income for the latest 24-month period is not more than 80% of the national average. ", "A community that successfully competes for EDA funds, having met the minimum unemployment and per-capita income thresholds for eligibility, is required to provide 50% of the cost of a project from non-EDA funds. For a community whose unemployment rate exceeds or whose per-capita income falls below the minimum eligibility thresholds for EDA assistance, EDA may provide additional (supplemental) grants to reduce the community's 50% cost-share obligation, resulting in an increase (of up to 30%) in the percentage of a project's cost covered by EDA. As directed by the statute, EDA has developed and established in regulations a set of thresholds intended to measure an applicant's relative need for the purpose of identifying the maximum amount of a project's cost EDA will cover by awarding a supplemental grant. EDA's cost-share thresholds are based on the extent to which an applicant's unemployment rate or per-capita income exceeds the national average (see Table 1 ). ", "It might be argued that the thresholds for receiving a higher federal cost share are arbitrary and artificially high, with the result that few areas qualify for the maximum percentage of EDA supplemental assistance. For example, of the approximately 750 areas that received grants from EDA in FY2008, fewer than 100 counties were eligible for the 80% federal cost share. A provision included in S. 782 would establish in statute lower eligibility thresholds for EDA supplemental grants.
