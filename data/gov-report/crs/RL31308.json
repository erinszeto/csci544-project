TEA-21 created a mechanism called Revenue-Aligned Budget Authority (RABA),which was intended to prevent revenues from accumulating in the Highway TrustAccount. While TEA-21 set guaranteed spending levels for the highway programthrough FY2003, based on forecast of future Highway Trust Account revenues,RABA allowed the highway spending level to increase automatically if HighwayTrust Account revenues exceeded the forecasts. It also provided that the highwayspending levels would be reduced if revenues fell below the forecasts.", "For several years, the RABA adjustment mechanism provided windfall gains for highway funding: increases of $1.5 billion in FY2000, $3 billion in FY2001, and$4.5 billion in FY2002 over the guaranteed funding levels. However, the recessionof 2001 slowed receipts into the Highway Trust Account, and in January 2002 itbecame clear that revenues had dropped below the forecast levels. The result was anautomatic cut in the FY2003 highway program funding level of $4.4 billion. Theimpact of this cut was magnified by the RABA boost to FY2002 highway funding of$4.5 billion over the guaranteed level. This meant that RABA, by giving a $4.5billion \"bonus\" in FY2002 and a $4.4 billion cut in FY2003, created an $8.4 billiondifference between FY2002 highway funding and FY2003 funding (for moreinformation, see CRS Report RS21164 , Highway Finance: RABA's Double-edgedSword , March 5, 2002).", "On August 2, 2002, the President signed the second FY2002 emergency supplemental legislation ( P.L. 107-206 ), which included a provision setting theRABA adjustment for FY2003 to zero (Section 1402).

It provided $31.8 billion for FY2003, the same amountprovided in FY2002. P.L. 108-7 provides $31.8 billion.", "The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) budget. TSA was created by the Aviation and TransportationSecurity Act (ATSA)( P.L. 107-71 ) in November 2002 in response to concerns aboutthe security of aviation and other transportation systems. Congress required TSA toassume responsibility for screening passengers and checked baggage at airports, andto hire screeners and purchase equipment to carry out this task, by the end of calendaryear 2002. Initial estimates were that TSA would need to hire around 25,000-30,000screeners to do this, giving it a total workforce of 35,000-40,000 people. However,this estimate was based on the existing number of screeners, and overlooked theimpact of other ATSA requirements, such as the screening of checked baggage; thisactivity was virtually non-existent before September 11, so there were no preciseestimates of the total workforce this task would require. As the scale of that taskbecame clearer, estimates of the workforce needed by the TSA increased by another25,000 or so screeners, to screen checked baggage, to a total workforce of as manyas 70,000 people. Some members of Congress expressed concern about TSAgrowing to such a size; the FY2002 emergency supplemental act capped TSA'sfull-time screener positions at 45,000, the House Appropriations Committeerecommended that cap be extended for FY2003, and P.L. 108-7 extended that cap. Currently, TSA employs nearly 62,000 screeners, of whom 28,000 are temporary.

Some members of Congress questioned the amounts being requested, and criticizedthe lack of detail about how the money will be used. At the same time, TSA wasunder pressure to hire and train as many as 50,000-60,000 screeners, and to purchaseand install thousands of baggage-screening devices at 429 airports, by December 31,2002. The DOT Inspector General has noted resulting inefficiencies. (6)", "When it created the TSA, Congress gave it the power to levy two fees, one on passengers and one on airlines. The expectation, at least on the part of some inCongress, was that these fees would provide enough revenue to cover the TSA'sannual budget requirements.

If this fee proves to beinsufficient to pay for the cost of security services, TSA may impose a fee on aircarriers-as it has done.

In addition, core highway and mass transit program funding wasgiven special status in the discretionary portion of the federal budget by virtue of thecreation of two new budget categories. The Act thereby created a virtual \"firewall\"around highway and transit spending programs.

The FY2000 Act called for the redistribution of some fundsamong programs and added two significant spending projects. In the FY2001appropriations act, the appropriators continued in this vein by adding funds for largenumbers of earmarked projects. Further, the FY2001 Act called for redirection of alimited amount of funding between programs and includes significant additionalfunding for some TEA-21 programs.
