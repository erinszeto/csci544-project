Under current practices, fracturing typically is a water-dependent activity, often requiring between a few million and 10 million gallons of water per fractured horizontal well. This water demand often is concentrated geographically and temporally during the development of a particular shale formation.

Shale oil and gas represent substantial fossil fuel resources for heating, electricity generation, transportation fuel, and industrial use. Economical extraction relies on directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"). This well-completion technique involves the injection of large volumes of water, along with water-conditioning chemicals and sand or other proppants, to pressurize and fracture shale formations to increase reservoir permeability. The proppant holds the fracture open, allowing gas and oil to move to the well bore. A portion of the injected water, commonly referred to as \"flowback,\" and naturally occurring water from the shale formation itself, referred to as \"produced water,\" then return to the surface with the oil and/or gas.", "For the purposes of this report, the combination of flowback and produced water, unless distinguished separately, will be referred to as \"produced fluids.\" The term \"wastewater\" is also used, and includes produced fluids as described above, but may also contain other fluids produced during the drilling and development of shale energy wells.", "The current level of freshwater used for fracturing and the management (reuse or disposal) of the produced fluids from the extraction are seen by some stakeholders as limiting factors in shale energy development. Shale energy development also poses the potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater resources through multiple pathways:", "accidental surface spills of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; accidental spill of wastewaters from well operations; improper disposal of wastewaters; well fluids leaking from valves and casings, including uncontrolled blowouts; and leakage and migration of gas and fluids at wells (e.g., improper well construction).", "While some of these concerns are specific to shale development, others are common to most energy development activities. However, the large volumes of fluids, chemicals, and injection pressures associated with high-volume hydraulic fracturing have posed new well development and wastewater management challenges for the industry and regulators.", "This report discusses the water inputs to shale energy development, wastewater management related to shale energy development (including some related topics such as induced seismicity), and emerging water technologies for both the production of shale energy and the disposal of wastewaters.

Additionally, shale gas contributes to the United States' effective independence regarding natural gas. When used as a fuel, natural gas, composed primarily of methane, is viewed as having lower emissions of many air pollutants relative to coal or oil as a fuel source, and is seen by some as a \"bridge fuel\" to a less greenhouse-gas-intensive energy future. While these are some of the drivers behind interest in shale energy, how shale energy is developed bears directly upon its impact on water resources. This section provides a brief introduction to how shale energy is developed in the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Location of Shale Resources", "paragraphs": ["Shale energy deposits vary in size, depth, and quality across the United States. Some deposits occur primarily in one state\u2014for example, the Barnett Shale in Texas. Others underlie multiple states, such as the Marcellus Shale in New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The Marcellus Shale is currently considered the largest potential resource of shale gas, and is close to large energy-demand centers in the Northeast. The Utica Shale in Ohio and portions of the midwestern United States represents another sizable natural gas resource that is just starting to be developed. Figure 1 illustrates key shale energy formations in the lower 48 states.", "Some deposits are primarily natural gas-bearing formations, while others contain significant oil resources. For example, well development in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota is often performed in pursuit of oil resources, while wells in the Eagle Ford Shale of Texas produce gas and oil in varying ratios depending largely on a well's location in the shale formation. Although interest in recovery of shale oil from the Monterey Shale of California continues, uncertainties remain about the near-term prospects for this development. Shale energy resources can typically be extracted economically only by using the hydraulic fracturing technique. This technique requires large volumes of water to pressurize the formations to increase reservoir permeability. Water is used in conjunction with a proppant for this purpose; proppant composition varies, but generally consists of sand or ceramic beads designed to be emplaced into fractures to maintain sufficient fracture width. The injected water opens up fractures and then delivers the proppant. Together, the injected mixture is known collectively as \"fracking fluids.\"", "To fracture a well, water is pumped from its storage site and mixed with the desired proportion of proppants and water-conditioning chemical additives. Once blended, the mixture is injected into the well at pressures typically ranging from 8,000 pounds per square inch (PSI) to 10,000 PSI to achieve enhanced formation permeability. The volume of water, sand, and additives used for fracturing a horizontal well is typically about 4 million to 5 million gallons, but can vary from 2 million to 10 million or more gallons depending on the fracturing design and well type (e.g., fracturing of a vertical well often uses less water than fracturing a horizontal well).", "In addition to commodity prices and market fundamentals of supply and demand, there are three key, interrelated sources of uncertainty affecting the pace of shale energy development: market structures, regulation, and public perception. Regarding market structure, shale gas and shale oil face some similar and some different uncertainties. Despite commonalities in current shale energy development technologies for shale oil and shale gas, the logistics of transporting oil versus natural gas to market are very different, as are pricing structures for the two commodities. Thus not all sources of uncertainty are likely to affect all segments of the shale energy industry uniformly.", "The second source of uncertainty is regulatory in nature. The policy attitude toward shale gas is evolving at multiple levels including local, state, and federal. Policy is evolving in the areas of air and water quality, water utilization, and land use (zoning). Substantial variations in regulatory approaches exist among states with active shale energy industries. Many such states, for example, permit some form of forced pooling , which allows for horizontal drilling underneath a landowner's property (with compensation) even if the landowner has not explicitly signed a lease. Among active shale energy states, Pennsylvania and West Virginia do not have forced pooling in deep geologic formations (but do in shallower geologic formations from which oil and gas have been extracted for decades). As of the end of 2013, Pennsylvania was in the process of developing policy that would permit forced pooling in the Marcellus Formation.", "Regulatory uncertainty is challenging for shale energy production and transportation, particularly natural gas, due to the sunk nature of capital investments (power plants cannot quickly be repurposed, for example). Virtually all energy projects require large investments in capital that are sunk, but natural gas delivery is especially dependent on sunk capital, particularly pipelines and, where appropriate, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Since the mode of transportation for natural gas is not fungible (i.e., transportation cannot easily be shifted from one mode to another, as is the case with oil and coal), stable long-term supply contracts are generally required to encourage investment in gas transmission infrastructure in emerging gas shale plays (and in some shale oil plays where substantial flaring of natural gas occurs, such as the Bakken Formation in North Dakota), but such contracts are difficult to establish when future regulatory costs are unknown.", "The third source of uncertainty is caused by substantial gaps between risks as understood and communicated by scientists; risks as communicated in media reports; and risks perceived by the general public. These gaps emphasize the importance of science-driven policymaking, and seem especially prominent in the case of risks to environmental resources, particularly drinking water quality. There is no systematic scientific consensus that hydraulic fracturing of deep shale formations, if done properly, poses threats to local drinking water supplies. Nevertheless, public perception in many areas is otherwise. Moreover, regulators have determined in various cases that shale energy well development and operations (separate from hydraulic fracturing) have impacted water quality. Homes near drilling sites in southwestern Pennsylvania that rely on piped water systems have, on average, increased in value, while those that use on-site wells have, on average, declined in value. Similar evidence regarding public perceptions surrounding water quality issues has been gathered in the United Kingdom. Several studies in 2011 and 2012 demonstrating some hydrologic connectivity between groundwater supplies and fracture zones in the Marcellus Formation have been variously interpreted as suggesting an explicit link between drilling activities, and suggesting exactly the opposite. A 2013 study suggested a geospatial connection with drilling activities that may warrant further scientific and regulatory investigation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently studying this issue, pursuant to a congressional request, but to date has not released any findings. Gaps in scientific understanding on the potential impacts of shale energy development using high-volume hydraulic fracturing can heighten public concern and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty\u2014note, for example, moratoria in Maryland, New York, and North Carolina."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Water Inputs into Shale Development", "paragraphs": ["Hydraulic fracturing fluid must exhibit the proper viscosity and low friction pressure when pumped and used for well development. The fluid chemistry may be water-based, oil-based, or acid-based, depending on the properties of the formation. Water-based fluids, sometimes referred to as slickwater, are the most widely used, especially in shale formations because of their low cost, high performance, and ease of handling.", "Water used in hydraulic fracturing may be piped or trucked from the source to the well-drilling area, depending on distance, rights-of-way, access, and topography. Water storage will typically occur on or near the well pad in either lined or earthen impoundments (typically built to codes determined at the state and local level), steel tanks, or temporary above-ground modular storage impoundments. The water is pumped from storage through a system of pipes, chemical blenders, pump trucks, valves, and pressure control devices (i.e., blowout preventers), and is then mixed with the desired proportion of proppants and chemical additives.", "Fracturing initially requires significant water inputs, but while a well is producing there are few freshwater requirements unless refracturing is performed. Refracturing might be used to stimulate a well as production declines, possibly after a number of years. There are alternatives to water use for such procedures, but it is not known presently whether most shale energy wells will require refracturing or whether it will be economical to do so. Second, industry practices for water utilization, transportation, and treatment (or disposal) are evolving rapidly.", "The following water sourcing topics for shale energy development are discussed below:", "water sources; costs associated with water inputs; water transport and storage; and access to water sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Water Sources: Availability of Groundwater and Surface Water", "paragraphs": ["Regional differences in water availability may affect shale energy development over time. The most obvious constraints are likely to arise in arid to semiarid regions (but are not exclusive to arid and semiarid regions) that are already marginally to severely water-limited, and may become more so in the future. ", "The typical sources of water for well development have been surface or groundwater. Using surface water may require water transport to the well site via truck or pipeline, which may increase water-related costs and environmental and community impacts. Generally, surface water is a reliable water source in temperate regions, although it may become more difficult to access during drought periods or in isolated portions of a watershed. That is, although water may be regionally abundant in some regions, significant withdrawals can impact small streams in low flow periods. Groundwater can often be sourced at or near the drilling location, thereby reducing the costs and impacts associated with its transport for use in shale energy development. Water quality also must be considered for compatibility with hydraulic fracturing.", "Shale energy projects in temperate regions, such as the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale of the Appalachian Basin and the Haynesville Shale of East Texas and Western Louisiana, have used a combination of water purchased from municipal systems, industrial wastewater, and surface waters. In the Marcellus Shale in 2012, direct withdrawal from surface water represented 73% of shale energy water use; 27% of the water used came from municipal water systems. In contrast, in the Eagle Ford Shale, aquifers have been the source for 90% of the water used in hydraulic fracturing; the other 10% is from surface supplies. The following three figures illustrate where surface water and groundwater may be constrained given current levels of water use. Figure 2 shows that the levels of use of existing surface water supplies (using precipitation as a simple measure of surface water availability) are already intensive in some locations. Figure 3 shows that groundwater use in some locations exceeds aquifer recharge rates. For example, Figure 3 shows that portions of Texas experiencing shale energy development like the Eagle Ford Shale (south Texas) and the Permian Shale (west Texas) had overdraft of aquifers at the onset of much of the shale energy development in 2005. Figure 4 illustrates the variation in cumulative groundwater depletion over the course of more than a century for 40 U.S. aquifers. ", "Although groundwater and surface water supplies are the most common sources for shale energy development, there is interest in and some use of other supplies. The use of freshwater has raised concern that valuable water resources could be removed from the hydrologic cycle as a result of injection into shale, where the majority of injected water remains bound. Alternative sources of water such as treated industrial and municipal wastewaters or saline groundwater are often technically viable, and used to some degree. However, while the broader use of alternatives to surface water or groundwater is encouraged, economic, regulatory, legal, and technical conditions may limit their adoption. The reuse of some wastewaters (e.g., abandoned mine drainage, produced fluids) as a substitute for freshwater may not only mitigate environmental damage or reduce disposal requirements for these wastewaters, but also reduce freshwater withdrawals. A concern, however, may be that those reusing these wastewaters may face liability risks under federal and state law. Several water source options and related issues are discussed below. Management practices from the American Petroleum Institute (API) stipulate that \"whenever practicable operators should consider using non-potable water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recycled Produced Fluids", "paragraphs": ["The recycling of produced fluids for well operation in hydraulic fracturing has been increasing over the last several years, especially in Pennsylvania. Based on a review of available Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) records, produced fluid recycling increased from approximately 10% in 2009 to 90% by mid-2012. The advent of brine-tolerant friction reducers in slickwater fracking operations has allowed produced fluid reuse without compromising the effectiveness of well completions. Where produced fluids are being recycled in subsequent fracturing activities, the volume of recycled water may constitute between 10% and 30% of the total fluids composition. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission's (SRBC's) estimates indicate that approximately 70% of Marcellus wells recycled some produced fluids for hydraulic fracturing purposes. An increasing reuse trend is also occurring in other states such as Texas and Colorado, where water resources are scarcer. For example, in Colorado some operators indicate that all produced fluids were reused in hydraulic fracturing operations in the Piceance Basin.

From a practical standpoint, the location of an AMD source must be sufficiently close to development activities to allow cost-effective transportation to well site(s), as shown in Table 1 . Additionally, AMD chemistry must be carefully considered, as there is the potential for downhole precipitation of metals with sulfates that could cause fracture plugging and potentially impede gas flow and production. Therefore, the use of AMD, even from active discharge sites, may require treatment or at least significant dilution prior to use to minimize fracture-plugging potential.", "Use of AMD for fracturing would face many challenges. Some abandoned mines have a clear line of ownership and liability for contamination of pristine waters with acidic mine drainage. In Pennsylvania, under the state's Clean Streams Law, waters from these mines must generally be treated to drinking-water quality before being released to streams. Other mines (referred to as \"abandoned mines\") do not have such a clear line of ownership and liability because the operators have ceased to exist. Waters from abandoned mines could potentially be captured for fracturing; however, potential liability under federal and state laws likely would discourage use of AMD waters. Under Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law, for example, any company engaged in the transportation and treatment of waters from abandoned mines would assume liability in the case of spillage or other infiltration into waterways. This is a potential disincentive for oil and gas operators to tap AMD from abandoned mines.

Oftentimes, the system is somewhat modular so that it can be moved for safety reasons such as during a severe flood. Some designs include an intake built into the streambed, which reduces sediment loading over time. Other designs are connected to a stream flow monitoring device to shut down the pump when flows go below permitted levels. Groundwater supply wells can also serve as intake systems, if properly constructed and designed to withdraw a volume of water needed to meet the demands of hydraulic fracturing operations.

Thus, assuming all water is trucked in from a location that is a one-hour round trip from the well, water costs to develop a single unconventional shale well would be between $85,000 and $260,000, or between $1.21 to $1.84 per barrel of water ($13.80 to $17.75 per thousand liters). The transportation cost figure scales linearly with distance, while water cost is fixed; therefore, a well that is a two-hour round trip from a freshwater source would incur estimated costs of $2.21 to $2.84 per barrel of water ($27.60 to $35.50 per thousand liters), depending on the cost of water."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Pipelines", "paragraphs": ["Direct piping of water from a source to a well-pad impoundment occurs in locations where operational costs are less than water transfer by truck and where pipelines can obviate the challenges and risks of transport by road.

Wastewaters from shale energy wells in the Appalachian region are more likely to be managed using a combination of underground injection, surface disposal (such as impoundments), onsite treatment and blending for reuse or transport to water treatment plants for reuse, surface discharge, or other disposal. Surface disposal represents one of the lowest-cost ways to manage wastewaters from shale energy projects, but also introduces contamination pathways if impoundments are not properly constructed or managed. Hauling of water by truck to treatment facilities (or to geologic disposal wells if these wells are not located close to production areas) is among the highest-cost management strategies, and introduces potential contamination pathways if spills or other incidents occur during the transportation process.", "Proper management of fluids derived from drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations remains a substantial environmental management challenge.

Collectively, Class II wells accept an estimated 2 billion gallons of brine per day. The special class of oil and gas waste fluid disposal wells is collectively known as Class\u00a0IId UIC wells. There are more than 30,000 such wells in the United States today, though the distribution of these wells among shale drilling areas is uneven. Texas hosts approximately 52,000 Class II injection wells, of which approximately 10,000 are disposal wells. Hence produced water recycling rates in Texas are generally less than 10%. In contrast, the Appalachian Basin contains a limited number of Class IId injection wells, apparently due in part to the lack of suitable injection reservoirs with sufficient depth and permeability to accept significant volumes of waste, but also partly because of a lack of need for such disposal capacity before the emergence of shale gas. Through 2013, Ohio had approximately 180 active Class IId wells, while Pennsylvania had eight active disposal wells.

Records from the first half of 2012 indicate that a total of eight barrels of produced fluids were generated for each million cubic feet of produced gas. Of the eight barrels of produced fluids, approximately 1.1 barrels were disposed of via injection wells.", "Of the total produced fluids from all Pennsylvania oil and gas operations, 97% were disposed of in injection wells in Ohio.

Figure 9 shows the projected volume of fluids that may be generated from Marcellus Shale gas development in Pennsylvania based on trends from existing data, assuming a 5.2% annual increase in Marcellus gas production, as predicted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Also shown in Figure 9 is the current case of 1.1 barrels of produced fluids injected into UIC wells for each 1 million cubic feet of gas produced when 90% reuse is occurring. In addition, hypothetical scenarios are shown with an assumed 0.55 barrels and 2.2 barrels for each 1 million cubic feet of produced gas, and similar scenarios assuming only 2.6% year-over-year growth in Marcellus gas production.", "Many factors can influence the volume and management of shale gas produced fluids. Lower-volume scenarios could result for a variety of reasons, such as low natural gas prices that might discourage the drilling of new wells and prevent previously drilled wells from being brought into production. New technologies may allow for more economical treatment and reuse of produced fluids, thus decreasing the percentage of the total amount produced sent for injection.", "One significant unknown variable is the ultimate disposal capacity in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York. If it is assumed that 1.1 barrels of produced water are injected into disposal wells per million cubic feet of produced gas, then the volume of produced fluids requiring injection well disposal is projected to be 3.3 million barrels of Marcellus produced water (138 million gallons) from Pennsylvania alone by 2022. This would represent a 65% increase in injection well use as compared to the rates for the first half of 2012. The 179 injection wells used in Ohio (including 40 new wells brought on line over the last decade) were apparently able to handle an increase of approximately 6 million barrels (252 million gallons) annually over the course of a decade. In addition to possible limitations on capacity to inject all of the produced fluids if natural gas-related activities continue at the current pace or increase, the increased scrutiny on a possible link between injected fluids and earthquakes (discussed below) may also constrain the ability to install injection wells to handle all the disposal needs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Related Issues: Induced Seismicity and Abandoned Wells", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential for Induced Seismicity", "paragraphs": ["Induced seismicity is not a concern related to surface or groundwater resources, per se, but has been raised as a potential issue.

Reports of minor earthquakes possibly induced by fracturing occurred in Garvin County, OK, in 2011, but no definitive connection to fracturing per se has been made. There is, however, a potential for induced seismicity anywhere that wastewater is pumped into deep rock units at high rates, regardless of regional geologic contrasts. One theory suggests that \"fluid injection may trigger earthquakes if pressures, rates, and permeability are sufficient to allow fluid to reach a favorably oriented fault and reduce the normal stress, decreasing fault strength.\" The potential depends on a number of factors, including (1) the state of subsurface stresses (i.e., whether stress buildup has been relieved by previous earthquakes); (2) the presence or absence of through-going faults; (3) porosity and permeability (transmissivity of fluids) of the unit into which fluids are being pumped; and (4) the rate at which fluids are being pumped and the relative pressure differential developed.

These attributes also allow FO to achieve very high theoretical recoveries while minimizing energy and chemical demands; in practice, the recovery rate may be closer to 70%."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Common approaches for shale energy water management have included trucking of water from the source to the site; storing water in lined, earthen impoundments; and recycling of some portion of produced fluids for reuse in hydraulic fracturing, either at a fixed site or in the field, with the remainder of the fluids disposed of through injection wells or by some other treatment and disposal method. This type of water management approach has limitations, including the production of wastes requiring disposal and the use of significant volumes of fuel for water and waste transport, typically at significant cost. In order to make the process more cost-effective with less environmental impact, new approaches are being sought\u2014for example, the use of lesser-quality sources of water, piping of water where possible, modular water storage, and recycling of produced fluids. Chemical precipitation for scalant removal and mechanical vapor recompression for desalination appear to be the most widely used treatment approaches to date; however, emerging technologies including electrochemical treatment and forward osmosis appear promising. The use of UIC wells for disposal is also heavily relied upon, especially in Ohio and Texas, as a means to manage the portion of produced fluids not being recycled. Long-term viability and capacity of disposal wells are an area of active research to better understand the sustainability of this practice in various shale plays.", "Technological progress or changes in water management practices could address some of the most visible impacts on water resources and reduce the risk of impacts on groundwater and surface water quantity and quality. Widespread adoption of fracturing practices that minimize the use of freshwater (groundwater, surface waters, or municipally sourced waters) may reduce pressures from the shale energy sector on scarce water supplies in more arid areas such as Texas and the Rocky Mountain states. In the Appalachian region, overall water supplies are not scarce, but the transportation of water from source to drilling site can involve high trucking costs. Wastewater management practices that minimize the handling of produced fluids and the use of multiple transportation and storage modalities could reduce the risk of impacts to water supplies. Adoption of drilling and completion practices that are less water-intensive and that minimize truck transportation could benefit water quality through reduced erosion along dirt and gravel access roads constructed alongside streams.", "While reduction of stresses on water supplies and water quality would represent an environmentally positive step, it is important to realize that water management issues will not disappear entirely. Some freshwater will still be required for shale energy production\u2014for example, in mixtures with flowback water for reuse in subsequent fracturing jobs. The shale energy sector is increasingly recognized as a water consumer (alongside agriculture, municipalities, industry, and electric utilities and other forms of energy production and conversion) in regional water planning and state and local allocation practices.", "Adoption of emerging technologies and processes that minimize the water-use intensity of fracturing will have its own challenges, beyond the key issue of cost. For example, public perception is an important consideration in determining which technologies or processes are ultimately adopted and widely deployed. The use of carbon dioxide foam for fracturing, for example, replaces one intensive transportation need with another, since trucks will be required or a dedicated pipeline network will need to be built to deliver the fracking fluid commodity to the drilling location. Industry may be hesitant to adopt alternative technologies and processes if their use reduces energy production or increases costs from shale energy formations.", "There continue to be fundamental uncertainties surrounding the acceptable or optimal chemical composition of fracking fluids that would meet emerging environmental concerns but still be effective fluids for hydraulic fracturing and shale oil and gas extraction. For example, even when treated to drinking water standards, acidic mine drainage may still have high sulfate concentrations that increase the potential for downhole precipitation with metals. Metal precipitation could cause plugging of fractures, thereby lowering rates of oil and gas production. The treatments required to lower sulfate concentrations in abandoned mine drainage, and even the extent to which different sulfate concentrations are associated with higher or lower oil and gas production rates, are uncertain and require more study.", "The equipment, personnel, and other capital needed for the production of shale energy are highly mobile. Costs can increase or decrease as regional shale development patterns shift. Drilling rigs tend to be moved to those areas with the highest economic returns (for example, away from dry gas to oil producing areas). The mobility of drilling capital suggests that the demand for fracking fluids and wastewater management or treatment services will vary over the course of years or even months. Most treatment facilities, on the other hand, are built in fixed locations, and movement of treatment facilities imposes high costs. Mobile treatment facilities could be developed, but first-generation systems would likely have high costs due to first-of-a-kind engineering and an inability to take advantage of scale economies in water treatment. Variable demand for such facilities may imply that truck transportation, which can be costly and variable, will likely continue to be used until the costs of mobile treatment facilities decline.", "Water management issues are relevant to the entire life cycle of shale energy development, because fluids will continue to be produced even after a well is drilled, fractured, and producing oil and/or natural gas. There also are multiple pathways for potential freshwater contamination. Therefore, research that views shale energy production in a life-cycle and materials-flow context may facilitate the identification of technologies and processes that can mitigate potential impacts along different stages of the shale energy development life cycle."], "subsections": []}]}}
