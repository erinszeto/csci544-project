Its portfolio includes courthouses, land ports of entry, and federal office space.", "Prior to seeking appropriations, GSA is required to obtain congressional authorization for constructing, purchasing, leasing, or renovating real property. To that end, GSA submits a prospectus to two committees\u2014the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\u2014for each proposal that exceeds $2.85 million. The prospectus provides detailed information about the project, including its location and estimated cost. By law, a project that exceeds the $2.85 million threshold may not receive appropriations unless both committees pass resolutions approving of the prospectus.", "While the prospectus process provides Congress an opportunity to evaluate GSA real property activities, oversight may be limited by data that are not available to the authorizing committees. GSA's prospectuses, for example, do not always include a comparison of the costs of leasing versus owning space over time, which means Congress is making decisions without knowing whether a proposed project is the most cost effective option. Similarly, many lease prospectuses do not include the cost of altering space to meet agency needs, such as upgraded security, which means authorizing committees may not be aware of the full costs of the projects they are considering. In addition, there are instances where GSA fails to submit prospectuses for projects that exceed the threshold.", "Several bills in the 113th Congress propose reforms to the real property process, particularly the process for disposing of unneeded buildings. Examples include the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act (H.R. 328), the Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act (S. 1398), and the Civilian Property Realignment Act (H.R. 695 and S. 1715). Another bill, the Public Building Service Savings and Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 2612) proposes changing the prospectus approval process. The bill would require GSA to include in its prospectuses a plan to offset any new space acquired by eliminating an equal amount of existing space from its inventory. It would also require GSA to ensure it is obtaining the best possible rental rate for leases that fall below the prospectus threshold. Other provisions would require GSA to provide the authorizing committees with an annual report listing all of the leases it entered into during the previous fiscal year; to notify Congress if a project's costs increased by 5% or more; and, when requesting authorization to acquire space, to explain why existing federal space could not be used.", "H.R. 2612 could mitigate several long-standing weaknesses in the prospectus process. The bill proposes to help control costs by ensuring that the authorizing committees have access to comparative cost data, and by requiring GSA to provide cost estimates of alterations associated with a new lease that are not included in the estimate of rent. In addition, H.R. 2612 might enhance oversight by requiring GSA to provide a more detailed justification for requesting new space, and to notify Congress when a project exceeds the cost and size parameters established in the prospectus.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Government's Landlord", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) is the federal government's primary civilian real property management agency with 11 regional offices that oversee GSA owned and leased properties across the nation.

Given the breadth of GSA's holdings, the agency is sometimes referred to as \"the government's landlord.\"", "Until Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act in 1926, construction authority for each federal building was approved and funded in separate pieces of legislation. The 1926 act provided the basic authority for the construction of federal buildings through the congressional authorization and appropriation process. Congress later enacted the Public Buildings Act of 1949 to authorize the planning, site acquisition, and design of federal buildings located outside of Washington, DC, and for improvements to existing federal buildings. Congress also enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which established the General Services Administration (GSA), and gave the GSA Administrator (Administrator) responsibility for administering federal real property. In 1954, Congress amended the Public Buildings Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator to acquire titles to real property and to construct federal buildings through lease-purchase contracts. Under this procedure, a building was financed by private capital, and the federal government made installment payments on the purchase price in lieu of rent payments. Title to the property was vested in the federal government at the end of the contract period, which could range from 10 to 30 years. When authority for lease-purchase contracts expired in 1957, Congress approved a successor statute, the Public Buildings Act of 1959. The 1959 act re-established earlier requirements to provide for direct federal construction of public buildings through the congressional authorization and appropriation process. This act, as amended and re-codified over the years, remains the basic statute authorizing the Administrator to construct, own, lease, operate, maintain, and renovate buildings to serve civilian agencies of the federal government. Notably, while GSA works with many executive branch agencies and the judiciary to meet their space needs, it generally does not perform real property functions on behalf of the legislative branch.", "GSA is responsible for the design and construction of its buildings and courthouses, and for repairs and alterations to existing facilities, including those that are leased.

With a multi-billion dollar budget and thousands of buildings under its control, GSA manages one of the government's largest and most diverse real property portfolios. Moreover, given its role as the procurer of space for numerous other agencies, congressional oversight of GSA's prospectus-level proposals has broad implications. In recent years, for example, GSA has submitted prospectuses to consolidate the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security at the St. Elizabeth's Campus in Washington, DC; construct a new courthouse in Rockford, IL; and expand a land port of entry in San Diego, CA. These projects illustrate the central role GSA-controlled buildings often play in helping federal agencies fulfill their unique missions. The prospectus process provides an opportunity for Congress to assess how well GSA's proposals meet the needs of its clients and to reject those that it finds poorly conceived or unnecessary.", "Congress may also use the prospectus approval process to evaluate cost and space projections. It is not uncommon for GSA to estimate that a single real property project will cost hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars. Poor project planning may result in cost escalation and unneeded space. The 33 courthouses built between 2000 and 2010, for example, included 3.56 million square feet of unneeded space, which in turn resulted in an additional $835 million in construction expenditures. This prompted Congress to ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to audit multiple courthouse construction and renovation projects to identify the origins of widespread cost overruns, and to hold hearings on how to address courthouse cost escalation.

One study of 27 long-term leases estimated that the government will spend $866 million more than it would have spent building or buying comparable space. Nonetheless, GSA's lease prospectuses do not include a comparison of the costs of leasing versus owning space over time, known as an alternative analysis.

An agency may determine, for example, that while the location and square footage are suitable, security features may need to be enhanced, technological capabilities upgraded, or conference rooms added. Such alterations are not necessarily included in the cost estimate of a lease prospectus because the actual building in which space will be leased has not been selected when GSA submits a prospectus. Typically, GSA first seeks authorization to enter into a lease and then identifies suitable space through a competitive process. Moreover, any investment in alterations will be lost if the agency moves to another location at the end of the lease term\u2014a factor that may dissuade the agency relocating, even if a different property was less costly or otherwise more suitable.

While the same rule applies to leased space, there is evidence that GSA does not consistently submit amended prospectuses when the cost of a previously authorized lease increased by more than 10%.

In essence, the proposed language would prevent GSA from signing a lease where the rental rate would be greater than that paid for comparable properties in a geographic area. This language would apply specifically to leases that fall below the annual threshold and therefore do not have prospectuses approved by authorizing committees.

These requirements, found in Section 2 of the bill, would prohibit GSA from increasing the size of its portfolio above its FY2012 level. Any proposal to build, lease, or purchase new space would have to be offset by an equivalent reduction in existing GSA space, and the details of that offset would have to be included in the project's prospectus. The government owns tens of thousands of properties with unused space\u2014including approximately 11,600 buildings that are less than half-occupied\u2014and GSA is currently required to first try to fill new space needs at those underutilized federal properties before constructing, purchasing, or leasing space from the private sector. ", "H.R. 2612 would go further, mandating that GSA actually dispose of\u2014rather than merely consider utilizing\u2014unneeded federal building space as a condition of obtaining new space. The principle of offsetting space is consistent with current legislative proposals to streamline and accelerate the disposal of unneeded federal property. With regard to H.R. 2612 , the current disposal process presents a challenge of timing: statutory disposal requirements and local market conditions make it difficult to estimate how long it will take to dispose of a property. Agencies are required by statute, for example, to first offer to transfer unneeded property to other federal agencies that may need it, then offer to convey it to state or local governments and non-profits that might use it for a public benefit, such as a homeless shelter or medical center, and, finally, if the property was neither transferred nor conveyed, offer it for sale to the public. Each step can take weeks\u2014or months\u2014as properties are assessed by interested parties, applications are submitted and reviewed, and financial and legal terms established. Moreover, the condition of the building, the need for the kind of space that is available, and the cost of any required historical or environmental remediation are all local factors that could affect how long it takes to dispose of the property. Some properties may generate no interest at all. It is not clear how H.R. 2612 would take the unpredictable nature of disposition into account. The bill requires \"the details of the elimination\" of space, but it does not specify whether the space must have already been disposed of prior to the submission of the prospectus, or whether GSA would meet the offsetting requirement by providing a plan for disposing of equivalent space within a given timeframe. It is also not clear how Congress would track proposed disposals to ensure they are completed as detailed in the prospectus. Congress may consider requiring GSA to include in its Performance and Accountability Report or annual budget justification a list of the status of all offset activities approved through the prospectus process.", "A related provision of H.R. 2612 , the zero-space justification requirement, would also use the prospectus process to constrain the size of GSA's portfolio. By requiring GSA to justify, in its prospectuses, why it must obtain the space requested from a private landholder instead of a federal agency, the provision would increase transparency into GSA's decision-making. Currently, GSA is required to first consider acquiring space in underutilized federal buildings before looking to the private sector to lease or buy space, or to construct new buildings. It is not known how consistently it is undertaken or what criteria are evaluated when determining suitability. The bill does not establish what specific information should be included in the explanation, which could limit the usefulness of the prospectus as an oversight mechanism. GSA could simply state, for example, that there was no suitable space available given the tenant's requirements. Congress may wish to consider whether to require certain information, such as the criteria used to determine whether a federal property was suitable for the tenant, the properties evaluated, and the factors that disqualified each property from consideration.", "H.R. 2612 also includes provisions designed to monitor and control real property acquisition costs. As noted, project cost escalation has become a concern to many Members of Congress, highlighted by massive cost overruns among courthouse construction projects. The bill proposes a new requirement that may provide Congress with a \"red flag\" for projects at risk for significant cost escalation. This requirement\u2014that GSA notify the authorizing committees in writing of any increase or decrease of more than 5% of the estimated maximum cost or scope or size of a project\u2014may give Congress an opportunity to hold hearings and work with GSA to prevent further cost escalation. The 5% requirement also stipulates that GSA must provide an explanation of why a project's cost or size exceeds the amount authorized. The explanation may be useful in making revisions to the project management plan and preventing further escalation, but it also may help identify factors that contribute to escalation across projects. It was determined, for example, that courthouse costs often escalated because the method for calculating the amount of courtroom space needed was flawed, resulting in costly over-building, and GSA agreed to use a new asset management planning method for courthouses going forward. Quickly identifying the factors that drive cost escalation may allow GSA to take steps to prevent similar problems in other projects.", "A second cost containment measure in the bill would require GSA to notify the authorizing committees in writing before entering into certain leases that fall below the prospectus threshold. This provision would apply specifically to leases for which a prospectus is not required to be submitted and therefore have little congressional oversight. It reaffirms the principle that the government should obtain suitable space in the most cost-effective manner, regardless of the amount of funds involved. As policy, the bill would require GSA to ensure it is not paying above the local market rate for the type and amount of space being leased, even if the lease is below the prospectus threshold. With little data available on these leases, Congress may wish to request periodic audits from the GSA Inspector General or from GAO to (1) determine the extent to which GSA complies with the requirement and (2) estimate of the cost of leases that exceed local market rates.", "H.R. 2612 would require additional reporting on GSA leases. Much, but not all of the information the bill would require to be reported is already made available in spreadsheets on GSA's website. These lease inventory reports provide data on the size, address, tenant agency, and rental rate of GSA's leases\u2014which represents four of the five data elements GSA would be required to report under H.R. 2612 . The one required data element that GSA does not currently report is the amount authorized for leases that exceed the prospectus threshold. GSA's inventory reports also differ from the requirements of H.R. 2612 in that they are issued monthly, rather than annually, and they include data on all of GSA's active leases, not just leases entered into during the previous fiscal year. However, given that the data required by the bill are either already being reported or should be readily accessible, there should not be significant burden placed on GSA in meeting these requirements. In addition, given the limitations on oversight discussed in this report, Congress may wish to consider whether to require GSA to provide additional data, either through the report mandated by H.R. 2612 or through GSA's monthly lease inventory reports. Congress may find it useful to know, for example, the projected and actual costs invested in each lease beyond rent (i.e., upgrades and renovations), whether the lease has increased 5% in cost or size beyond authorized parameters, whether GSA has notified the authorizing committees of this increase, whether the lease has increased 10% in cost or size beyond authorized parameters, and whether an amended prospectus has been approved.
