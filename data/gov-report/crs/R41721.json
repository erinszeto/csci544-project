This increase was to be offset by other savings and efficiencies identified by the Administration. Both the Senate and House marks would have resulted in reductions in ATF services and activities in FY2012. ", "In the past year, ATF's efforts to reduce illegal gun trafficking from the United States to Mexico under Project Gunrunner have generated controversy on two counts. First, the DOJ and ATF obtained approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an information collection initiative, under which federally licensed gun dealers in Southwest border states are required to submit multiple sales reports on certain rifles, as a means of more readily identifying possible straw purchasers and gun traffickers. Second, ATF is alleged to have allowed firearms to be transferred to suspected straw purchasers. Then, either intentionally or unintentionally, ATF allowed those suspected criminals or their associates to smuggle those firearms across the border, in an effort to build more complex investigations designed to uncover and dismantle larger gun trafficking conspiracies. In a tragic twist of fate, some of those firearms were allegedly used in the deaths of two U.S. federal agents and perhaps hundreds of these firearms have been seized by authorities in Mexico. ", "In November 2010, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released an evaluation of Project Gunrunner and, among other things, recommended that ATF work with DOJ to develop a reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales because Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations have demonstrated a marked preference for military-style firearms capable of accepting high-capacity magazines. The OIG also recommended that ATF focus its investigative efforts on more complex criminal conspiracies involving high-level traffickers rather than on low-level straw purchasers.

While OMB initially denied ATF emergency approval, it later approved the initiative on July 11, 2011. Under this initiative, ATF is poised to require federal firearms licensees (FFLs) in Southwest border states to report to ATF whenever they make multiple sales or other dispositions of more than one rifle within five consecutive business days to an unlicensed person. Such reporting would be limited to firearms that are (1) semiautomatic, (2) chambered for ammunition of greater than .22 caliber, and (3) capable of accepting a detachable magazine. In addition, while ATF originally requested a one-year \"pilot\" program, OMB approved the initiative for a three-year period (through July 31, 2014). However, some Members of Congress oppose the multiple rifle sales reporting requirement. They maintain that if Congress authorized multiple handgun sales reporting in statute in 1986, then it is incumbent upon ATF to request that Congress provide it with similar statutory authority for a multiple rifle sales reporting requirement. During House markup of H.R. 2596 , the House Committee on Appropriations adopted an amendment that would have prohibited ATF from implementing its multiple rifle sales reporting requirement. However, the conference agreement did not include this House language."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operation Fast and Furious", "paragraphs": ["In February 2011, ATF and Project Gunrunner came under renewed scrutiny for a Phoenix, AZ-based investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious. ATF whistleblowers have alleged that suspected straw purchasers were allowed to amass relatively large quantities of firearms as part of long-term gun trafficking investigations. As a consequence, some of these firearms are alleged to have \"walked,\" meaning that they were trafficked to gunrunners and other criminals before ATF moved to arrest the suspects and seize all of their contraband firearms. Some of these firearms were possibly smuggled into Mexico. Two of these firearms\u2014AK-47 style rifles\u2014were reportedly found at the scene of a shootout near the U.S.-Mexico border where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was shot to death. Press accounts assert that ATF has acknowledged that as many as 195 firearms that were purchased by persons under ATF investigation as part of Operation Fast and Furious were recovered in Mexico. Questions, moreover, have been raised about whether a firearm\u2014an AK-47 style handgun\u2014that was reportedly used to murder U.S. ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata and wound Special Agent Victor Avila in Mexico on February 15, 2011, was initially trafficked by a subject of a Houston, TX-based ATF Project Gunrunner investigation. ", "On June 14, 2011, Representative Darrell E. Issa and Senator Charles E. Grassley issued a joint staff report on Operation Fast and Furious, which chronicled that ATF line supervisors became increasingly concerned when they witnessed hundreds of firearms being illegally transferred during surveillance operations, but they were reportedly directed not to arrest the suspects and interdict those firearms. Those agents contend that this was a questionable departure from past investigative practices. On June 15, 2011, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on these matters. Representative Issa, chairman of the committee, expressed his concern that DOJ had not been entirely cooperative with his committee's efforts to investigate how some of those firearms found their way to crime scenes in Mexico and on the Southwest border. Following the hearing, on June 29, 2011, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the committee's ranking minority Member, issued a report and held a forum during which the minority explored issues raised by some of those same ATF line supervisors, who had suggested during the House hearing that the penalties for firearm straw purchases under current law are arguably not stringent enough. The minority also discussed other gun control proposals related to gun shows, semiautomatic assault weapons, .50-caliber sniper rifles, and additional penalties for gun trafficking offenses. ", "On July 26, 2011, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a follow-up hearing on Operation Fast and Furious. As preceded the earlier hearing, a joint staff report was issued. This report found that ATF and DOJ leadership had not informed its own Attach\u00e9 serving in Mexico City, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, nor the Mexican authorities about the investigation. As recovered firearms in Mexico increased, the ATF Attach\u00e9 in Mexico City became more alarmed and contacted his superiors at ATF headquarters to express his grave concerns about the implications that this increased flow of illegal firearms could have for both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officers as well as the public on both sides of the border. He and others were told by both ATF and DOJ officials that the investigation was under control and was having positive results. As noted above, however, Border Patrol Agent Terry was killed in a firefight in December 2010, and firearms connected to Operation Fast and Furious were found at the site of that firefight.", "According to the Washington Post , the investigation ultimately involved 2,020 firearms, of which 227 have been recovered in Mexico and 363 have been recovered in the United States. So far, Operation Fast and Furious has resulted in indictments of 20 individuals on multiple counts of straw purchasing and other federal offenses. ATF officials maintain that the investigation has yet to be concluded and additional arrests of \"high-level traffickers\" may be forthcoming.", "As Senator Grassley originally called for, the House Committee on Appropriations included report language that recommends the appointment of \"an outside, independent investigator,\" who would be charged with conducting \"a thorough investigation of the allegations against ATF with respect to Operation Fast and Furious and policies guiding this and similar operations.\" In addition, the committee called on both DOJ and ATF to cooperate fully with related oversight investigations, whether they be conducted by congressional committees, the DOJ OIG, or an independent investigator. ", "In report language, the Senate Committee stated that the OIG would fulfill its oversight duties, and that Operation Fast and Furious was but a small part of ATF's Southwest border operations, which should not detract from the agency's efforts to protect Americans from illegal gun trafficking and other forms of cross-border crime. Nevertheless, Operation Fast and Furious has led to the reassignment of Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson to another part of DOJ. Conference report language ( H.Rept. 112-284 ) included language that is similar to the Senate language, so an independent investigator was not called for. However, conference report language followed House report language and called on DOJ and ATF to fully cooperate with congressional oversight efforts.

In the past, ATF issued similar reports on semiautomatic firearms that were considered to be \"assault weapons,\" which foreshadowed and justified further restrictions on the importation of such firearms. Some observers anticipated that ATF was poised to implement similar restrictions on the importation of shotguns. To prevent this from happening, the House Committee on Appropriations adopted an amendment during the committee's markup that would prevent ATF from implementing new restrictions on the importation of shotguns.

With regard to explosives, the OIG found that DOJ's ability to respond effectively to crimes involving explosives had been hindered, because the ATF and FBI had developed parallel capabilities, but had not adequately coordinated investigations. With regard to ESF #13, the OIG found that ATF had drafted a concept of operations plan, but it was incomplete as of March 2010.

BOP currently operates 117 correctional facilities across the country.

It also provides funding for the incarceration of federal inmates in state, local, and private facilities. The B&F account (i.e., the capital budget) provides funding for the construction of new facilities and the modernization, repair, and expansion of existing facilities.

As a point of comparison, BOP reports that in FY2007, the five states with the largest prison populations had a staff-to-inmate ratio of 3.33 to 1. The growing federal prison population has also required BOP to dedicate more resources to caring (e.g., providing health care, food, and clothing) and providing programming (e.g., substance abuse treatment, educational programming, and work/vocational opportunities) for inmates.
