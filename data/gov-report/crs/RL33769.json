Congress has consistently supported humanitarian efforts as a means of saving lives, promoting stability, and furthering U.S. foreign policy objectives. Intervention results in varying amounts of relief and recovery assistance and can have an important impact not only on the relief operation itself but on broader foreign policy issues. In the 114th Congress, international humanitarian and refugee assistance is expected to continue to have a strong measure of bipartisan interest, with key policy issues focused on budget priorities, levels and types of funding, the sources of other support available worldwide, and the ways in which operational assistance is delivered.", "Factors that may impact decision-making include the type of humanitarian assistance required, the impact of conflict and refugee flows on stability in the region in question, and the role of neighboring countries in contributing to the relief effort. Examples of issues likely to remain of congressional interest include competing aid and budget priorities, reimbursing U.S. government agencies for their expenditures (to replenish the emergency accounts or other accounts that have been used to provide assistance), and civilian and military coordination, including the evolving role of the Department of Defense in humanitarian assistance. Other priorities may include an examination of the disparity between numbers of internally displaced persons and refugees worldwide and the available funding for these groups; physical access to and protection of refugees and other vulnerable populations in addition to the protection of human rights; programs to address gender based violence; and the creation of durable solutions for displaced populations.", "The President can provide emergency humanitarian assistance through several sources whose funding is authorized and appropriated by Congress. These are funds currently appropriated to the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) through the International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDA) account; U.S. Department of Agriculture food aid programs under Title II of the Food for Peace Act; the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) through the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) and the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) accounts; and funds appropriated to the Department of Defense, Overseas Humanitarian and Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) account.", "In addition, the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters and provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster. Finally, the President can request other government agencies to assist within their capabilities. In FY2015, estimated funding for global humanitarian accounts is $6.4 billion. The Administration's FY2016 budget request for global humanitarian accounts is $5.6 billion, but the decrease assumes carryover balances from FY2015 will be available to meet projected needs for humanitarian responses.", "This report examines U.S. humanitarian assistance in international crises and disaster situations.

Beginning in the 1990s, crisis operations increased in war-torn countries and regions throughout the world along with the numbers of those providing relief, primarily humanitarian organizations and international actors. Multinational military forces also served a greater peacekeeping role in these internal wars. The media added a new measure of influence to the response to such crises in the form of greater access and live reporting. ", "Population displacement is often a significant consequence in crises resulting from conflict. This may occur within the affected country or because people flee to countries in close proximity. In these situations the plight of the refugee is one critical element of population movement; the internally displaced person (IDP) is another. The displaced require particular protection, the basis of which may be found in international humanitarian law, and sustained emergency assistance, which is usually provided by U.N. system agencies, governments, international entities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In many protracted civil conflicts, where groups within a country are fighting and in the absence of a political solution, the course agreed on by the international community might be to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims. This assistance may last for many years. Refugees and IDPs may be stranded in camps, urban areas, or informal settlements and separated from their homes for long periods. Conducting a humanitarian operation in an area of conflict often means that access to populations in need and the distribution of emergency relief supplies is hampered by security concerns, not only for those needing assistance but for humanitarian personnel as well. Thus, providing humanitarian and refugee assistance is increasingly complicated and expensive\u2014sources of funding, civil-military relations and operations, human rights concerns, aid worker security, protection, and access are just some of the central issues facing the aid community. The ongoing conflicts in and around Syria and Iraq demonstrate some of these challenges.", "In addition, natural disasters affect millions of people each year who require prolonged and urgent assistance. The event may be sudden (like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, or the 2014 earthquake in Nepal) or protracted (like drought conditions in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa, food insecurity in the Sahel, and the possible long-term effects of climate change).

Moreover, while conditions and time limits have been proposed by Congress as a means of ensuring greater accountability, they can also add pressure for organizations to spend contributed funds quickly, sometimes leading to unnecessary spending, waste, and duplicated efforts. Many also argue that restrictions on use of funds often do not allow flexibility to adapt projects to better meet the changing needs on the ground."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Humanitarian Operations and Security Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1990s, limitations on the operating environment of humanitarian agencies have been a topic of intense debate and discussion. A number of reports have highlighted increased incidences of insecurity and attacks on humanitarian staff. While a more consistent and expanded response by the international community to humanitarian crises over the past two decades has meant that a greater number of aid workers are operating in crisis areas, most security incidents tend to be concentrated in a limited number of high-profile contexts. At the same time, other reports indicate that the ability of aid workers to access populations at risk has decreased over time. This could in part be due to operations taking place in a greater number of conflict areas, but other factors may include the actions of multiple non-state actors or the role of sovereign governments in denying access. ", "Furthermore, some experts stress that humanitarian agencies need to be able to operate independently of external military and political agendas but may not be able to do so. One reason that humanitarian workers may be less secure than in the past is that they are often not viewed as neutral. For example, some contend that, increasingly, the lines are blurred between humanitarian and other actors, such as the military, in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, the inclusion of humanitarian response in counter-insurgency operations, and the incorporation of humanitarian action within integrated U.N. missions. ", "Adherence to international humanitarian law and the traditional humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence are often cited as the underpinnings of the provision of humanitarian assistance, but their application may vary by organization mandate and situation. The security of the environment in which humanitarian organizations are operating is complicated not only by the specific crisis itself, but the ways in which humanitarian actors define their roles and responsibilities. A growing number of humanitarian workers have been put at great risk or lost their lives in providing humanitarian assistance. The degree to which a security force protects humanitarian relief workers and parties to the conflict will have some bearing on who is in charge, the security measures taken and provided, and the perception of whether the humanitarian community has taken sides in the conflict. Security and access are serious concerns and remain key priorities within the humanitarian community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unintended Consequences of Humanitarian Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The provision of humanitarian assistance raises the potential for unexpected consequences. First, it is important to examine whether humanitarian assistance is going to those for whom it is intended. Evaluating and tracking provision of supplies is difficult during a conflict and impossible to completely control. Second, there is the role of the NGO, including its mission and sources of funding, in what has become a major independent enterprise in conflict areas. There is the potential for misuse, intended or unintended, which may require closer analysis of the performance of providers. Third, there is the question raised by some experts as to whether the provision of humanitarian assistance is helpful\u2014particularly in cases where there is no consensus on how or when to intervene but only on the need to demonstrate action. Some question whether humanitarian assistance in some instances actually prolongs conflict."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Branding and Foreign Policy Goals", "paragraphs": ["A related issue concerns an interest on the part of many Members of Congress in the labeling or \"branding\" of U.S. humanitarian aid delivered to areas of conflict so that recipients are aware of its origin. The U.S. government tries to balance the desire to maintain visibility as a contributor of humanitarian assistance with concerns for the security of aid recipients and implementing partners who could become possible targets of attacks. Finding appropriate ways for the United States to leverage its political objectives without politicizing humanitarian aid remains a significant challenge. There has been some debate about whether the United States receives adequate political benefit from its humanitarian assistance efforts and whether those who receive assistance remain unaware of its origins, or assume it is from a foreign government other than the United States. Syria is a case in point where some Members of Congress and observers have argued that the United States should begin to more aggressively brand U.S. aid to enhance local perceptions that the people of the United States stand in solidarity with Syrians. Humanitarian groups argue that strategic objectives such as winning hearts and minds potentially compromise the neutrality of humanitarian assistance in general. Others contend that a targeted attack on a U.S.-labeled humanitarian organization could jeopardize broader humanitarian efforts and perhaps funding. It is often unclear whether raising awareness of U.S. humanitarian assistance would do much to change local perceptions in conflict areas. ", "More broadly, political considerations play a role in the way assistance is given and to whom. While the images of human suffering portrayed by the media only reinforce the need to do something, humanitarian assistance carries some weight as an instrument of \"neutral\" intervention in crises and is the most flexible policy tool that can be quickly brought to bear in a crisis. It can buy time and keep options open, and it may be an avenue to achieve minimal consensus on an international response. Sometimes humanitarian assistance can also expand beyond its immediate function. It may provide the means to maintain some form of contact with a country/region, or mitigate tensions over policy towards a region within the U.S. government or with and among its allies. Sometimes humanitarian assistance is expanded beyond its immediate function to avert a crisis, to provide support to allies, and to maintain a presence in the region. How it is used and whether it becomes more of a strategic, policy tool depends upon the situation, what other governments are doing, and the degree to which the United States has further interest in the region. ", "Providing humanitarian assistance also raises questions about implications for future action. On the one hand, if the United States decides to reduce its humanitarian support, would this diminish U.S. standing among its allies or affect its interests in other ways? On the other hand, since the President has a great deal of flexibility over U.S. involvement, once commitment to a humanitarian effort is made, does this make the long-term U.S. participation in reconstruction and political solutions more likely? Regardless, it is clear that as crises proliferate, the level and sources of U.S. humanitarian assistance will inevitably have an important impact not only on the relief operation itself, but on broader foreign policy goals."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
