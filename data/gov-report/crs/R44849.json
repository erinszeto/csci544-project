A key argument made in support of this change concerned the need to restore protections for U.S. and foreign workers. For example, a 2011 DOL proposed H-2B rule stated:", "[T]here are insufficient worker protections in the current attestation-based model in which employers merely assert, and do not demonstrate, that they have performed an adequate test of the U.S. labor market and one which is in accordance with the regulations.

In some cases, they seek to replace existing labor certification requirements with labor attestation requirements, while generally retaining the current two-stage process in which employers first test the labor market and then, after receiving certification, petition for guest workers.

Employers have long maintained that the AEWR, as traditionally calculated using USDA's Farm Labor Survey data, results in inflated wage rates.

With respect to the H-2A program, it means that the program cannot be used to meet employers' year-round agricultural labor needs absent a statutory provision. There are some long-standing exceptions to this year-round restriction, such as for sheepherding on the open range.

In some years, a temporary statutory provision has been enacted to exempt certain H-2B returning workers from the cap (see \" H-2B Statutory Provisions \" above).

Among the related regulatory provisions currently in effect are provisions establishing notification requirements for H-2A and H-2B employers. DHS regulations on the H-2A visa and the H-2B visa require petitioners to notify DHS within two work days when an H-2A or H-2B worker fails to report at the start of the employment period, absconds from the worksite, or is terminated prior to completion of the work, or when the work for which H-2A or H-2B workers were hired is completed early.
