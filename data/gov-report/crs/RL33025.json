Legislation for fundamental tax reform was introduced, and some bills proposed to change the tax base such that income tax credits and deductions, like the mortgage interest deduction, would have been eliminated. Late in the first session of the 110th Congress, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel indicated that fundamental tax reform might still be considered in the 110th Congress.", "There are many possible options to alter the mortgage interest deduction. If the deduction were eliminated as a result of fundamental tax reform, the resulting effects would depend on a variety of variables, including the nature of tax reform, the resulting changes in the tax base and tax rates, changes in interest rates, and other economic variables. If the deduction were eliminated without other tax policy changes, federal income tax revenues would increase, the tax base could be broadened, and the federal budget deficit could be reduced.", "Modifications to the mortgage interest deduction could take any one of several approaches. Congress could choose to allow the deduction for only one residence and/or to reduce the allowable principal debt, which is currently $1 million. These changes would reduce the amount of tax revenue loss associated with the provision. Congress could choose to improve equity by allowing more low-income households to claim mortgage interest, either as an above-the-line deduction or as a tax credit.

Mortgage interest associated with recreational vehicles and boats can be included in the deduction as long as the vehicles have sleeping, cooking, and toilet amenities. The debt must also be collateralized by the vehicles to be eligible for the mortgage interest deduction.", "Two types of indebtedness are associated with the interest that can be deducted: acquisition and home equity. Acquisition indebtedness is debt incurred in acquiring, constructing, or substantially improving a qualified residence and secured by such residence. Home equity indebtedness is all non-acquisition debt that is secured by a qualified residence. The interest on such debt can be deducted even if the proceeds are used for personal expenditures unrelated to the home. The underlying mortgage loans can represent acquisition indebtedness of up to $1 million, plus home equity indebtedness of up to $100,000.", "Any secured debt used to refinance home acquisition debt is treated as home acquisition debt, up to a certain point. The new debt qualifies as home acquisition debt only up to the amount of the balance of the old mortgage principal just before the refinancing. Any additional debt is not home acquisition debt, but may qualify as home equity debt. Thus, when refinancing, acquisition debt may not rise and home equity loans may not exceed $100,000. For example, if a homeowner with a $150,000 mortgage refinances the debt for $300,000, the original $150,000 would be considered as acquisition debt, an additional $100,000 would be considered as home equity debt, and the interest on these amounts would be deductible. The interest on the remaining $50,000 of debt would not be deductible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of the Deduction", "paragraphs": ["The mortgage interest deduction was not introduced as a provision to subsidize homeownership. It evolved over time as a result of the tax treatment of interest. Initially, the federal income tax, instituted in 1913, contained a deduction for all interest paid with no distinction between interest payments made for business, personal, living, or family expenses. At that time, most interest payments represented business expenses. For example, farmers borrowed money to buy land that would be used for both their residence and their business. Mortgages and other consumer borrowing were much less prevalent than in later years. Over time, and with the increasing sophistication of lending markets, mortgage interest became distinguishable from other kinds of interest.", "For several decades, up until the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA; P.L. 99-514 ), there were no restrictions on either the dollar amount of residence interest that could be deducted or the number of homes for which the interest deduction could be claimed. As part of an effort to limit deductions for personal interest, the TRA imposed limits on the amount of underlying mortgage loans for which interest could be deducted. These limits restricted loan amounts up to the purchase price of the home, plus any improvements, and debt secured by the home but used for qualified medical and educational expense. The interest deduction was also restricted to mortgage debt on a first and/or second home.", "In addition to changes to the deduction of mortgage interest, the Tax Reform Act also eliminated the deduction of personal interest, creating tax treatment distortions between homeowners and renters. Homeowners with sufficient equity and credit worthiness could use home equity loans to replace personal credit card debt, thus preserving the income tax deduction for interest on their debt. Renters and homeowners without sufficient home equity or credit worthiness became unable to transfer personal debt in order to continue the tax savings, and thus were made worse off relative to some homeowners by the 1986 tax law.", "As part of a group of revenue raising provisions, the deduction of home mortgage interest was further restricted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-203 ). That act created an upper limit of $1 million ($500,000 for married filing separately) on the combined acquisition indebtedness for a principal and second residence. Acquisition indebtedness included any debt incurred to buy, build, or substantially improve the residence(s). Additionally, the exception for qualified medical and educational expenses was eliminated and an explicit provision for home equity indebtedness was enacted. In addition to interest on acquisition indebtedness, interest can be deducted on loan amounts up to $100,000 ($50,000 for married filing separately) for other debt secured by a principal or second residence, such as a home equity loan, line of credit, or second mortgage.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) enacted another group of revenue raising provisions that further influenced the mortgage interest deduction. That act limited the amount of itemized deductions that upper-income households could claim. Some high-income taxpayers face reduced marginal benefits from the deduction of mortgage interest due to the limitation on itemized deductions.

This net imputed rental income is not taxed, unlike the rental housing market where owners of rental property receive income from their tenants and are taxed on that income, net of the same expenses as homeowners. Economists contend that if net imputed rental income were taxed similarly to income from rental housing, then the deduction of mortgage interest, real estate taxes, maintenance and depreciation costs, and other expenses would be considered appropriate for homeowners.", "Congress considered the taxation of net imputed rental income for homeowners during tax reform efforts in 1986. Congress believed that it would not be advisable to tax imputed net rental income, though it continued to allow the deduction of mortgage interest.

In recent years, from 1999 through 2004, real estate prices increased more than 56% as compared to the S&P 500 index that declined 6% over the same time period. When the mortgage interest deduction is combined with other housing tax provisions, like the deduction for state and local real estate taxes, the value of housing as an investment good rises even further.

The cost of equity financing is the after-tax yield that would be earned if funds were invested elsewhere. The cost of debt financing is the after-tax debt interest rate. Because interest earned is taxable income and mortgage interest is deductible, the choice of financing the cost of buying a home is tax neutral. As an example, if a taxpayer chooses to withdraw $250,000 from an investment account to purchase a home, the cost of that equity financing option is the interest earnings forgone after taxes. Assuming an interest rate of 6% and a marginal tax rate of 28%, the annual earnings would have been $15,000 and the after-tax yield would have been $10,800. Alternatively, if the taxpayer borrows $250,000 to purchase a home, assuming the same interest rate of 6% and marginal tax rate of 28%, the after-tax cost would be $15,000 in interest paid, reduced by $4,200 in mortgage interest deducted, for a total cost of $10,800.

An externality exists when the activity of an individual directly affects, positively or negatively, the welfare of another and that effect is not incorporated in market prices. Proponents claim that homeownership causes positive externalities since it generates not only private benefits for individuals but also social benefits for the public at large. The individual does not capture all of these social benefits and, thus, under invests in real estate.

In these studies the authors have noted their inability to distinguish whether homeownership caused the desirable behaviors that led to positive externalities, or, rather, people who possessed the desirable behaviors tended to become homeowners. Thus, the individual, not homeownership, would be the source of the positive externality. For instance, Cox found that homeowners as compared to renters were more likely to be civically involved, as did Rohe and Stegman. Yet these studies showed that the type of involvement varied widely across levels of activity, and was not correlated with any of the expected homeownership and neighborhood attributes (like house price, level of crime, and voter participation). If the source of the positive externality lies with the individual and not with their ownership status, then the arguments in favor of subsidizing homeownership would be diminished.", "Even if the existence of positive externalities from homeownership goes unquestioned, the appropriate magnitude of subsidies for homeownership is difficult to quantify.

Thus, the subsidy is perceived to have given homeowners a capital gain in the past, but new buyers entering the market face higher prices that offset the subsidy.
