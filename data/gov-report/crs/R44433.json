Many policy decisions since the 1990s that deal with spectrum assignment and allocation have focused on assuring the \"highest and best use\" for spectrum rights by assigning them through competitive auctions. To facilitate the transfer of federal spectrum to commercial wireless services, Congress, in 2004, created the Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse federal agencies for costs incurred in vacating spectrum.", "In recent legislation, the 2012 Spectrum Act (Title VI, Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, P.L. 112-96) includes provisions to increase the amount of spectrum licenses available for auction and to improve management of the Spectrum Relocation Fund. The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 (Title X, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74) has a similar focus on providing new spectrum licenses for auction but takes a somewhat broader approach to meeting spectrum needs, offering more support for spectrum sharing and for federal research to improve spectrum and network efficiency. Both acts also include provisions to provide unlicensed spectrum (typically allocated for Wi-Fi applications).", "Additionally, the Spectrum Act (sometimes referred to as the Public Safety and Spectrum Act) establishes a process for television broadcasters to release spectrum licensed to them to be auctioned as commercial licenses for mobile broadband (Broadcast Incentive Auctions). The act also includes provisions to apply spectrum-license auction revenues toward deficit reduction; to establish a planning and governance structure to deploy public safety broadband networks, using some auction proceeds for that purpose; and to assign additional spectrum resources for public safety communications. Two auctions required by the Spectrum Act have been completed. The final auction required by the Spectrum Act is the Broadcast Incentive Auction, which began in March 2016 and may conclude by year-end.", "The Spectrum Pipeline Act requires the release of 130 MHz of federal and commercial spectrum in three phases, with the process beginning in 2022. Licenses for exclusive use and shared spectrum as well as allocations for unlicensed spectrum are allowed uses for repurposed federal spectrum. The act gives priority to using auction proceeds deposited in the federal Spectrum Relocation Fund for research programs that improve spectrum efficiency.", "A number of bills concerning spectrum policy may be considered during the second session of the 114th Congress. These are likely to include the MOBILE NOW Act (S. 2555); and the DIGIT Act (S. 2607) and its companion bill (H.R. 5117). In brief, MOBILE NOW might be described as meeting the needs for growth within the existing wireless industry, and the DIGIT Act as expanding the availability of spectrum to meet the needs of the industries developing products and services for the Internet of Things. Both of these bills reaffirm the role of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in directing spectrum policy. The FCC, meanwhile, is moving forward with a \"Spectrum Frontiers\" ruling to make additional spectrum available for new technologies. As in past proceedings regarding the allocation and assignment of spectrum rights, the FCC appears to be basing many decisions on enhancing mobile broadband services for consumers as the \"best use.\" However, the consumers of wireless access to the Internet of Things, by most accounts, will include many other categories of users. The customers of wireless carriers have in the past been drivers of industry growth; in the future, substantial growth is expected from industry and other business sector demand for wireless access to the Internet of Things."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spectrum Management", "paragraphs": ["Electromagnetic spectrum refers to electromagnetic waves that, with applied technology, can transmit signals to deliver voice, text, video, and other wireless communications.

Geographic coverage for many licenses has been expanded as well, providing economies of scale for larger carriers while sometimes raising barriers to entry for smaller businesses.

The FCC, over many years, has developed and refined a system of exclusive licenses for users of specific frequencies. Auctions are perceived by many to be a market-driven solution to assigning licenses to use specific frequencies and are a comparatively recent innovation in spectrum management and policy. Previously, the FCC granted licenses using a process known as \"comparative hearings\" (also known as \"beauty contests\"), and has used lotteries to distribute spectrum licenses.

For example, using auction rules that allowed only for Economic Areas (EAs), the FCC created 176 licenses for the H Block auction (Auction 96), as compared to a potential 700 CMA licenses. For the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the FCC created Partial Economic Area licenses within Economic Areas, to allow for a greater choice between urban and rural coverage among bidders for licenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spectrum Caps and Screens", "paragraphs": ["The history of spectrum caps as a policy to promote competition dates to preparations for the first spectrum license auctions in the 1990s. The FCC decided to set caps on the amount of spectrum any one company could control in any geographically designated market. The FCC's support of spectrum capping was based on the theory that each license has an economic value and a foreclosure value. The economic value is derived from the return on investment in spectrum licenses and network infrastructure. The foreclosure value is the value to a wireless company that already has substantial market share and wants to keep its dominant position by precluding competition. Spectrum caps were chosen as the method to prevent foreclosure bidding. The intent was to ensure multiple competitors in each market and to restrict bidding to only the licenses that could be used in the near term.", "Beginning in 2001, spectrum policy placed increased emphasis on promoting spectrum and market efficiency. The FCC ruled to end spectrum caps, citing greater spectral efficiency from larger networks as one benefit of the ruling. Spectrum caps were seen as barriers to mergers within the wireless industry, to the growth of existing wireless companies, and to the benefits of scale economies. The spectrum caps were eliminated on January 1, 2003. Auction rules requiring the timely build-out of networks became a key policy tool to deter hoarding. The FCC instituted a policy for evaluating spectrum holdings on a market-by-market, case-by-case basis\u2014a practice referred to as spectrum screening\u2014as a measure of competitiveness.", "The FCC will apply new criteria for the Broadcast Incentive Auction intended to limit the ability of Verizon and AT&T to acquire licenses in certain areas, noting their substantial holdings of licenses below 1000 MHz. These criteria will limit the amount of spectrum that any one carrier may hold, by placing restrictions on bidding activity. The majority of the 700 MHz band commercial licenses were purchased at auction in 2008 (Auction 73) by Verizon and AT&T, which together also hold approximately 70% of commercial spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz. The other two national carriers, Sprint (majority-controlled by SoftBank, Corp., a Japanese telecommunications provider) and T-Mobile, Inc. (majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, AG), own 15% of commercial licenses below 1000 MHz. Although T-Mobile is generally viewed by observers as the primary beneficiary of the bidding rules, the rules are also intended to provide opportunities for smaller carriers to bid successfully. Based on the amount of spectrum released by the broadcasters, a block of spectrum will be set aside in each market with bidding priority for bidders deemed not to have national network coverage. If, for example, 60 MHz of spectrum is made available by broadcasters, 20 MHz will be reserved; as described by the staff report, all registered bidders would be eligible to compete for licenses not acquired in priority bidding as well as in the remaining 40 MHz. T-Mobile and smaller carriers, among others, have unsuccessfully pressed the FCC to increase the amount of spectrum reserved for priority bidding. Although some would like to see Verizon and AT&T excluded entirely from participation in the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the Spectrum Act prohibits exclusion of any qualified bidder.", "How spectrum caps might be implemented and how limitations might affect auction revenue have been topics of spirited debate. Numerous position papers have argued that any form of spectrum cap would depress auction revenues or, from a different perspective, that spectrum caps would have no impact on revenue and might even enhance it. The Department of Justice has filed comments regarding the important role of spectrum access for competition and innovation. It has urged the FCC to promulgate auction rules that would prevent bids based on the foreclosure value of spectrum and that would enhance bidding opportunities for smaller carriers.

A Designated Entity meets established criteria for size and revenue and is awarded a credit against the purchase price of an auctioned license, based on these criteria. Presently, small businesses with average gross revenue of no more than $40 million in the preceding three years receive a credit of 15%. A very small business, with revenue of $15 million or less over three years, receives a credit of 25%. Rules governing eligibility for designated entity status include restrictions on the use of spectrum assets acquired through a successful bid at auction. For example, currently not more than 25% of spectrum assets acquired with a bidding credit can be leased to a larger partner with which the company has what is described as an attributable material relationship (AMR). ", "The FCC has reconsidered the rules for designated entities in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Among the rules reevaluated are those for AMR, which the FCC believes may be discriminating against entrepreneurs that have formed partnerships with larger companies.

It would expand on provisions in the Spectrum Pipeline Act to make additional federal spectrum available for commercial use by 2020. In referring to the Administration goal of repurposing 500 MHz of federal and nonfederal spectrum for mobile broadband, the act would require that at least 225 MHz of new spectrum be released below 6 GHz. Of this, at least 100 MHz would be made available for unlicensed use and 100 MHz would, where possible, be auctioned as exclusive use licenses. Where exclusive use is not deemed feasible, spectrum might be shared using procedures similar to those for the AWS-3 auction. Some bands of federal spectrum, where discussions on possible reassignment or sharing have commenced, would be excluded from consideration. The act also includes several provisions that would facilitate the release of federal spectrum.

For example, the bill would require the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish a database to provide information on communications facilities installed on federal property or where communications equipment might be installed, including new properties when acquired. In general the database would be available to states and localities, which would be encouraged to include comparable data for properties under their jurisdiction.

Other millimeter wave bands were included in an FCC Notice of Inquiry (NOI), covering high-band and millimeter wave frequencies. On July 14, 2016, the FCC followed up on the NOI by proposing rules that would make high-band spectrum available for 5G. The proposed rules, referred to as the \"Spectrum Frontier Order\" would make a total of 10.85GHz of high-band spectrum available for licensed, unlicensed, and shared use.

There is no measure that would create additional revenue for the Treasury. It seems likely that, either on the Senate floor or in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, provisions will be added that identify new bands of spectrum for auction.
