This is particularly important for rural broadband, since the Senate bill would have given all broadband money to the Department of Commerce with a carve-out for rural areas. Amounts for USDA facilities and computer infrastructure follow Senate-passed levels rather than higher House-passed amounts, which was a particularly large reduction for requested Farm Service Agency computer improvements. The farmer assistance programs, originally only in the Senate-passed bill, remained in the enacted law. But the supplement for farm loan programs was reduced, despite the increased demand for USDA farm loans as a lender of last resort in the financial crisis.", "The enacted ARRA does not fund a USDA biorefinery program, the Rural Energy for America Program, or agricultural research grants.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates total new spending on these initiatives at $11.5 billion in the first two years (FY2009-FY2010) and $20.8 billion over ten years (through FY2019). The lion's share would go to pay for added benefits, loosened eligibility standards, and administrative costs under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program), as well as more money for nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa (these grants operate in lieu of the SNAP). Other nutrition programs in the ARRA include the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program), Older Americans Act nutrition programs for seniors, equipment assistance for school meal programs, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR).", "The House-passed version of the new law included eight items that would have increased spending on domestic food assistance programs. CBO estimated total new spending on these initiatives at $11.4 billion in the first two years (FY2009-FY2010) and $21.2 billion over ten years (through FY2019). As with the final law, the majority of spending would have gone to added benefits, loosened eligibility standards, and administrative costs under the SNAP, along with more funding for nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa. Other programs included in the House bill were management information system support for the WIC program, Older Americans Act nutrition programs, child nutrition after-school efforts, and TEFAP.", "Although its provisions differed, the Senate-approved version covered seven of the eight areas touched on by the House (it did not include money for after-school programs) and added three new items affecting equipment assistance for school meal programs, contingency funding for the WIC program, and the new money for the FDPIR. Preliminary CBO estimates indicated that total new spending under the Senate's proposals would have been $13.8 billion in the first two years (FY2009-FY2010) and $17.5 billion over ten years (through FY2019)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Under the ARRA, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) benefits will be increased significantly, and time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents will, in most cases, be suspended. Moreover, state agencies operating SNAP will receive extra administrative funding.", "SNAP benefits add to eligible low-income households' ability to cover their food costs out of their own income. Monthly allotments are based on the estimated cost of a minimally adequate diet. This means that the benefit for any recipient household equals the inflation-indexed cost of USDA's \"Thrifty Food Plan\" (its least costly diet calculation, the maximum benefit) varied by household size and adjusted for household income. In recognition of relatively rapid food-price inflation (benefits were last adjusted in October 2008), the new law substantially raises SNAP benefits (based on provisions in the House bill). The ARRA provides an immediate (effective in April 2009) across-the-board increase in SNAP benefits. This add-on is accomplished by raising by 13.6% the base Thrifty Food Plan amounts normally used to calculate benefits. This effectively boosts each recipient household's monthly benefit by an amount equal to 13.6% of the maximum (Thrifty Food Plan) benefit for its household size. For a one-person household, the added benefit will be $24 a month; for two persons, $44 a month; for three persons (the typical household) $63 a month; for four persons, $80 a month; and for larger households, higher amounts. As a result, the ARRA benefit will provide new support boosting present average household benefits by about 20%. The new law also will increase present nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa by 13.6%, enabling them to raise benefit levels and cover higher administrative costs. SNAP benefit and the grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa will continue at the new, higher levels set by the ARRA until normal annual indexing rules provide benefits/grants that surpass the value of the new add-on. Finally, states are protected from federal financial penalties under SNAP \"quality control\" rules for most of the mistakes they or recipients may make under the new benefit provisions (as proposed in the Senate bill). CBO estimates that new SNAP benefits will cost $9.9 billion for FY2009-FY2010, noticeably increasing the $100 billion anticipated under pre-ARRA law. Added spending for Puerto Rico and American Samoa is expected to equal some $375 million for FY2009-FY2010. The House effectively provided the same increase in SNAP benefits and new money for Puerto Rico and American Samoa set out in the final law. On the other hand, the Senate would have immediately increased the base Thrifty Food Plan amounts used to calculate SNAP benefits by 85% for one month. For the remainder of FY2009, it would have boosted benefits by 12%. In FY2010 and FY2011, basic benefits would have remained 12% higher, until normal indexing rules caught up (similar to policy followed in the final law and the House bill). Nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico would have been increased by 12% through FY2011 (or until normal inflation indexing caught up). In FY2009 and FY2010, the Senate initiatives (including those for Puerto Rico and American Samoa) were expected to cost $12.5 billion, significantly more than the House provisions. SNAP eligibility for most able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least half-time is limited to 3 months out of every 36 months (without regard to their financial status). States have the option to waive this requirement in a number of circumstances, and most states take advantage of this option. Reacting to high unemployment rates, the ARRA (as in the House bill) effectively suspends this requirement for those who cannot find a job through FY2010. In the Senate version, the suspension would have lasted through FY2011. CBO estimates the cost of this suspension in the final bill at $300 million through FY2010. While SNAP benefit costs are entirely a federal responsibility, states operating SNAP share administrative costs with the federal government. Approximately half of administrative costs are picked up by states\u2014estimated at between $2.5 and $3 billion in FY2008. Participation in the SNAP is rising dramatically, leading to higher administrative costs. Closely following provisions in both the House and Senate bills, the new law provides $145 million (FY2009) and $150 million (FY2010) in additional federal money for SNAP administrative costs, distributed based on state SNAP participation levels (including measures for recently increasing caseload burdens) and without requiring normal state matching funds. A small amount ($4.5 million) of this is set aside for federal oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of the effects of the new SNAP benefit and eligibility rules.

USDA's RUS has many years of successful management of telecommunication loans and grants, but the sheer size of the proposed expansion and the speed of implementation could prove challenging even for this agency. Moreover, it was concern with RUS's difficulties implementing Enhanced Access to Rural Broadband in the 2002 farm bill that led to the Senate bill putting the rural broadband stimulus funding in the Department of Commerce. That 2002 farm bill provision authorized loan guarantees under conditions that broadband service providers have capital reserve requirements, matching funding, and preparation of a sophisticated business plan, among other requirements. After making some initial loan guarantees and reviewing the quality of applications for funding under the Enhanced Access program, RUS determined that they needed to initiate an education program for would-be providers and reconsider the original program requirements before approving new loan guarantees\u2014fulfilling the agency's due diligence obligations.

The largest of these programs is the SURE program for crop producers, which is designed to supplement payments made by two ongoing federal programs\u2014the federal crop insurance program and the noninsured crop disaster assistance program (NAP).", "Although enrollment in crop insurance and NAP is a prerequisite for receiving a SURE payment, the enacted ARRA would allow crop producers who did not enroll in either program for 2008 to participate in the SURE program, as long as the producer pays a $100 administrative fee normally paid for the lowest level of crop insurance coverage or NAP assistance. The 2008 farm bill made a similar exception for those not enrolled in crop insurance or NAP for 2008, but the buy-in fee had to be paid by September 16, 2008. Under the ARRA, the producer would be required to pay the fee within 90 days of enactment of the conference agreement (by about May 18, 2009), and would have to commit to purchasing a crop insurance policy or NAP coverage for the next available crop year.", "Additionally, the enacted law would allow all producers to receive potentially higher SURE payments than they otherwise would have received by altering the payment formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aquaculture Grants", "paragraphs": ["The enacted ARRA authorizes a new $50 million grant program for aquaculture producers to compensate them for their share of high feed prices in 2008.

The House-passed version had no funding for farm loans ( Table 3 ).", "FSA lends to farmers and ranchers who are not able to obtain credit from commercial lenders. It makes direct loans and services them, and guarantees some loans made by commercial lenders to farmers. As such, it is often referred to as a \"lender of last resort.\" FSA's regular annual budget for farm loans is usually about $150 million to support $3.5 billion in loans.", "The loans supported by the stimulus are targeted to direct farm operating loans because the demand for FSA direct loans is increasing much faster than the demand for guaranteed loans in the current financial environment. The demand for direct farm operating loans (the loans farmers use to buy seed, fertilizer, and fuel to plant a crop), in particular, is up about 200% or more from this time last year, according to agency officials. Thus, FSA is expecting\u2014and is already experiencing\u2014significantly higher demand for its loans in FY2009. However, funding for these loans is nearly constant under both the continuing resolution and the Senate-reported agriculture appropriations bill for FY2009. Consequently, FSA was expecting to not have enough funding available for the increased demand for farm loans in FY2009. The stimulus funding will satisfy some, but likely not all, of this demand. ", "While the global financial crisis has been slower to affect the balance sheets of farmers and agricultural lenders than the housing market, it has begun to take its toll. Farm commodity prices have fallen since last summer with the rest of the market, reducing expectations for farm income in 2009. USDA expects net farm income to decline 20% in 2009, and this may reduce some farmers' ability to repay loans later in the year. And while default rates have been historically low in recent years for all farm lenders, they appear to have bottomed out and begun to rise since the middle of 2008. For example, Farm Credit System nonperforming loans more than tripled (albeit from historically low levels) in 2008, rising from 0.43% to 1.5%, a level not seen since the mid-1990s, when the system had finally recovered from the farm financial crisis of the 1980s ( Figure 3 ).

While some independent rural banks may be less affected than urban money center banks, the rural banks are not immune to the financial crisis. For example, the Farm Credit System (FCS)\u2014a private entity but still a government-sponsored enterprise\u2014is very dependent on the bond market and has felt the shock of the financial crisis in its ability to sell bonds to fund its loans. Although its bonds are still credit-worthy and able to be sold, the terms of FCS's recent bond sales reflect the change and turmoil in the financial markets.
