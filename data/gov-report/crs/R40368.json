The act extended the temporary EUC08 program through December 26, 2009 (with grandfathering), to be financed by federal general revenues. The EUC08 program's expiration date has since been further extended. It provided for temporary 100% federal financing of the EB program, to be financed by the federal government through the Unemployment Trust Fund. ARRA allowed states the option of changing temporarily the eligibility requirements for the EB program to expand the number of persons eligible for EB benefits, to end before June 1, 2010. It provided for an additional 13 weeks to the maximum amount of time railroad workers may receive extended unemployment benefits. The legislation suspended income taxation on the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits received in 2009, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008. It provided relief to states from the payment and accrual of interest on federal loans to states for the payment of unemployment benefits, from enactment of the stimulus package on February 17, 2009, through December 31, 2010. ARRA provided for a special transfer of up to $7 billion in federal monies to state unemployment programs as \"incentive payments\" for changing certain state UC laws. All incentive payments must be made before October 1, 2011. States do not need to repay these sums to the federal government. Any changes that states make to state unemployment programs as a result of ARRA's modernization provisions would be permanent. Finally, the act transferred a total of $500 million to the states for administering their unemployment programs, within 30 days of enactment of the 2009 stimulus package. States do not need to repay these sums to the federal government.", "This report addresses some of the more common questions about unemployment insurance in the 2009 stimulus package as Congress approved it in February 2009.

As the EB program has operated in the past, a beneficiary had to be within his/her original \"benefit year\" when the EB program triggered \"on\" in the state in order to receive EB benefits. The benefit year is a one-year period during which a worker may receive benefits based on a previous period of unemployment. Thus, on the condition that the state triggered \"on\" during an individual's benefit year, he or she could receive EB benefits during the benefit year, or even after the benefit year expired, that is, at the time he or she exhausted regular unemployment compensation or EUC08 benefits even if this occurred after the expiration of the benefit year. However, if the state's most recent EB period triggered \"on\" after the individual's benefit year ended , the beneficiary would not receive EB, under law prior to ARRA. As a result, in states that have recently triggered \"on\" to EB because of rising unemployment rates, many individuals may be ineligible for EB benefits if their benefit years expired before the state triggered \"on\" to the EB program.", "ARRA allows states the option of temporarily ignoring the benefit year requirement. Instead, states can choose to use exhaustion of EUC08 benefits as an eligibility requirement, for weeks of EB benefit payments that fall between ARRA's enactment and expiration of 100% federal funding of the EB program, and as long as the state was triggered \"on\" for EB during the period when the individual was receiving EUC08. This has the effect of allowing more individuals to be eligible for the EB program.", "One issue for states considering adopting the temporary expansion in eligibility is that while ARRA provides for temporary 100% federal financing of EB, this federal financing does not apply to unemployed former state and local government employees.
