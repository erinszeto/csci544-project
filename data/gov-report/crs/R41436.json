Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A, or Hospital Insurance (HI); Part B, or Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI); Part C, or Medicare Advantage (MA); and Part D, the outpatient prescription drug benefit. The Part A program is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers; these are credited to the HI trust fund. The Part B program is financed through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues. Income from these sources is credited to the SMI trust fund. Beneficiaries can choose to receive all their Medicare services, except hospice, through managed care plans under the MA program; payment is made in appropriate parts from the HI and SMI trust funds. A separate account in the SMI trust fund accounts for the Part D drug benefit; Part D is financed through general revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state contributions. The HI and SMI trust funds are overseen by a Board of Trustees that provides annual reports to Congress.", "The 2014 report of the Medicare Board of Trustees estimates that the HI trust fund will become insolvent in 2030, four years later than it had predicted in the 2013 report. Because of the way that it is financed, the SMI fund cannot face insolvency; however, the Trustees project that SMI expenditures will continue to grow rapidly, and thus place increasing demands on Medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers. Additionally, unlike in prior years, the projections in the 2014 report assume that reductions in physician payment rates scheduled under current law will not occur, because these reductions have usually been overridden by Congress. The Trustees estimate that total Medicare costs will increase from 3.5% of GDP in 2013 to 6.9% in 2088.", "Although the Medicare Trustees report that the financial outlook for the Medicare program appears to have improved as a result of changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended (ACA, P.L. 111-148), they caution that the projections in the report are somewhat uncertain, due to the potential for future expenditure reductions not to materialize. As it has done each year subsequent to the enactment of ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary issued a supplemental analysis that provides illustrative alternative projections based on the assumption that certain ACA provisions affecting Medicare provider payments will be phased out."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as a federal entitlement program to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. Generally, individuals are eligible for premium-free Part A of Medicare if they or their spouse paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters, are at least 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals under 65 may also qualify for coverage if they have a permanent disability, have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant), or have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease).", "Medicare consists of four parts\u2014A through D. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B covers a broad range of medical services, including physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Enrollment in Part B is optional, however most beneficiaries with Part A also enroll in Part B. Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, provides private plan options, such as managed care, for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Parts A and B. Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage through private plans.", "Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and over. In 2013, the program covered 52.3 million persons (43.5 million aged and 8.8 million disabled) at a total cost of $583 billion, accounting for about 20% of national health spending and 3.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for covered services provided to enrollees so long as specific criteria are met.", "Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended), made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modify provider reimbursements, provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhance certain Medicare benefits. For example, under the legislation, annual updates of the prices paid by Medicare for almost all non-physician categories of health services are being reduced by the growth in economy-wide productivity (productivity adjustments). The ACA also established a new Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which is required to make recommendations to reduce Medicare spending in years in which Medicare costs are projected to exceed a target growth rate. The legislation did not, however, make changes to the physician sustainable growth rate (SGR) payment system; unless Congress takes action before April 1, 2015, reductions in physician payment rates of about 21% will be required. ", "Additionally, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) provided for increases in the debt limit and established procedures designed to reduce the federal budget deficit, including the creation of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The failure of the Joint Committee to propose deficit reduction legislation by its mandated deadline triggered automatic spending reductions (\"sequestration\" of mandatory spending and reductions in discretionary spending) in fiscal years 2013 through 2021. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA, P.L. 112-240 ) delayed the automatic reductions by two months, while the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA, P.L. 113-67 ) extended sequestration for mandatory spending for an additional two years\u2014through FY2023. On February 15, 2014, the President signed into law an amended version of S. 25 ( P.L. 113-82 ), which, among other things, included a provision to extend BCA's sequester of mandatory spending through FY2024. ", "Section 256(d) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA, P.L. 99-177 ) contains special rules for the Medicare program in the event of a sequestration. Among other things, it specifies that for Medicare, sequestration is to begin the month after the sequestration order has been issued. Therefore, as the initial sequestration order was issued March 1, 2013, Medicare sequestration began April 1, 2013, and will continue through March 31, 2025. Under sequestration, Medicare's benefit structure generally remains unchanged; however, benefit related payments are subject to 2% reductions. In other words, most Medicare payments to health care providers, as well as to MA and Part D plans, are being reduced by 2%. Certain Medicare payments are exempt from sequestration and therefore not reduced. Some non-benefit related Medicare expenses, such as administrative and operational spending, are subject to higher reductions, 7.3% in 2014.", "This report provides an overview of how the Medicare program is financed, including a description of the Medicare trust funds and a summary of key findings and estimates from the 2014 Report of the Medicare Board of Trustees regarding 2013 program operations and future financial soundness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Trust Funds", "paragraphs": ["Medicare's financial operations are accounted for through two trust funds maintained by the Department of the Treasury\u2014the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D.

The primary source of income credited to the HI trust fund is payroll taxes paid by employees and employers; each pays a tax of 1.45% on earnings. The self-employed pay 2.9%. Unlike Social Security, there is no upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. ACA imposes an additional tax of 0.9% on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers, and $250,000 for joint filers effective for taxable years beginning in 2013. (ACA also imposes an additional tax on unearned income beginning in 2013; however, this tax is not credited to the trust fund.)", "Additional income to the HI trust fund consists of premiums paid by voluntary enrollees who are not entitled to premium-free Medicare Part A through their (or their spouse's) work in covered employment; a portion of the federal income taxes paid on Social Security benefits; and interest on federal securities held by the trust fund.", "The HI trust fund is primarily an accounting mechanism used to track whether the program has sufficient income and assets to make payments for Part A benefits. When the government receives Medicare revenues (payroll taxes), income is credited by the Treasury to the appropriate trust fund in the form of special issue interest-bearing government securities. (Interest on these securities is also credited to the trust fund.) The tax income exchanged for these securities then goes into the general fund of the Treasury and is indistinguishable from other cash in the general fund; this cash may be used for any government spending purpose. When payments for Medicare Part A benefits are made, the payments are paid out of the general treasury, and a corresponding amount of securities is deleted from (written off) the HI trust fund.", "The trust fund surpluses are not reserved for future Medicare benefits, but are simply bookkeeping entries that indicate how much Medicare has lent to the Treasury (or alternatively, what is owed to Medicare by the Treasury). From the unified budget perspective, these \"asset\" balances are regarded as future spending obligations and are thus treated as liabilities. (See the \" Medicare Expenditures and the Federal Budget \" section for an overview of differences in trust fund and unified budget accounting conventions.)", "As long as the HI trust fund has a balance, the Treasury Department is authorized to make payments for Medicare Part A services. To date, the HI trust fund has never run out of money (i.e., become insolvent ), and there are no provisions in the Social Security Act that govern what would happen if that were to occur. For example, there is no authority in law for the program to use general revenue to fund Part A services in the event of such a shortfall. Since the beginning of the Medicare program, the payroll tax rate has been adjusted periodically by Congress as one of the mechanisms to maintain the financial adequacy of the HI trust fund.

Instead, it relies primarily on general tax revenues and beneficiary premiums as revenue sources.

As a result of a provision in ACA, the income thresholds used to determine which beneficiaries are subject to higher Part B premium rates will be frozen at 2010 levels through 2019.

Although under current law, physician payments are scheduled to be reduced by close to 21% in April 2015, the Trustees recognized that in every year since 2002, Congress has overridden these reductions.

The difference, the actuarial balance , is -0.87%. Because this is a negative number, the HI trust fund fails to meet the Trustees' long-range test of actuarial balance. This means that the income rate would need to increase by 0.87% of taxable payroll throughout the next 75 years for the trust fund to reach actuarial balance (e.g., by increasing the standard payroll tax from 2.90% to 3.77%), program spending would need to be reduced by a corresponding amount, or some combination of the two would need to occur. (The Trustees note that if no changes in the payroll tax or HI spending occur prior to 2030, then the required increase after that time would be 1.21% of taxable payroll.)

If the slower ACA price updates were to continue indefinitely, then the HI financial imbalance actually improves beyond the 75-year period.

In response, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) required the Trustees report to include an expanded analysis of Medicare expenditures and revenues.

This is the additional amount that is expected to be needed in order to pay HI benefits at the level expected under current law over the next 75 years.

Budget experts have expressed concern about the long-run implications of Medicare expenditures on federal deficits; for example, in its long-term budget forecast, CBO noted:", "The long-term budget outlook is much less positive, however. The combination of three factors\u2014the aging of the population, growth in per capita spending on health care, and an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance\u2014is expected to significantly boost the government's spending for Social Security and major health care programs. Barring changes to current law, that additional spending would contribute to larger budget deficits toward the end of the 10-year period that runs from 2015 to 2024, causing federal debt, which is already quite large relative to the size of the economy, to swell even more.", "The Medicare Trustees caution that it is difficult to forecast health and economic indicators over an extended period of time. For example, forecasts are based on the assumption that health spending will outpace GDP growth in the future because it has consistently done so in the past. It is possible that in the future, advances in medical technology, changes in consumer preferences, shifts in the health status of the population, or changes in the way health care services are delivered could result in very different financial outcomes from those estimated in the Trustees report. Further, as evidenced by the issuance of an illustrative alternative to the 2014 Trustees report, if changes to current health care policies are enacted (most notably these affecting provider productivity adjustments), future Medicare costs could be significantly different from current projections.", "There are no simple solutions to address the problems raised by the rapid growth in health care costs, the economic conditions, and the aging of the population. Additionally, as an entitlement program, Medicare must pay for all medically necessary covered benefits for enrollees; except for constraints placed on the program by the HI financing mechanism, there are no limits on overall Medicare spending. As such, policy options to restrain the growth of Medicare spending will continue to attract considerable interest.", "Proposals to reduce Medicare spending generally fall into one of two categories: (1) those that would reduce the federal share of Medicare spending (for example, by increasing beneficiary premiums and/or cost-sharing, changing Medicare eligibility criteria such as age, reducing the range of covered benefits, reducing provider payment amounts, establishing defined federal contributions, or setting federal spending limits); and (2) those that would reduce U.S. health care spending regardless of who is paying (e.g., decreasing medical errors, reducing unneeded, duplicative and/or ineffective care, and reducing fraud and abuse). On the revenue side, options to increase program income may include modifying dedicated Medicare payroll taxes or general income taxes, and/or imposing new fees or dedicated taxes. Some of the above changes could be made while still retaining Medicare's current structure, while others could only be made in the context of major program restructuring. Many of the proposals could be combined as part of an overall reform package.", "The challenge to policy makers will be to slow the growth in Medicare spending over the long term, to establish fair levels of contributions from beneficiaries and taxpayers, and to ensure continued beneficiary access to needed health care services.
