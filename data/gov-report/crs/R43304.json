The PHS agencies are funded primarily with annual discretionary appropriations. They also receive significant amounts of funding from other sources including mandatory funds from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), user fees, and third-party reimbursements (collections).", "The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funds research on improving the quality and delivery of health care. For several years prior to FY2015, AHRQ did not receive a direct appropriation. Instead, it relied on redistributed (\"set-aside\") funds from other PHS agencies for most of its funding, with supplemental amounts from the ACA's Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF). In FY2015, AHRQ received its own appropriation in lieu of set-aside funds. Overall, the agency's total funding rose from $403 million to $465 million between FY2010 and FY2015. That increase came despite a decrease in discretionary funding over that period, which was more than offset by increasing amounts of PCORTF funding. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the federal government's lead public health agency. CDC obtains its funding from multiple sources besides discretionary appropriations. The agency's funding fluctuated between FY2010 and FY2015, with the overall level increasing slightly from $10.9 billion to $11.3 billion over that period. CDC experienced a drop in its discretionary appropriations during that time, which was offset by funding from other sources, primarily the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigates the public health impact of exposure to hazardous substances. ATSDR is headed by the CDC director and included in the discussion of CDC in this report. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates drugs, medical devices, food, and tobacco products, among other consumer products. FDA saw its funding increase significantly between FY2010 and FY2015 from $3.1 billion to $4.5 billion. The agency is funded with annual discretionary appropriations and industry user fees. While appropriations increased modestly over the FY2010-FY2015 period, user fees more than doubled and now account for 42% of FDA's total funding. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funds programs and systems that provide health care services to the uninsured and medically underserved. HRSA, like CDC, relies on funding from several different sources. The agency's funding increased from $8.1 billion in FY2010 to $10.3 billion in FY2015 despite a significant drop in its discretionary appropriation during that time. The growth in overall funding was driven largely by increasing amounts from the ACA's Community Health Center Fund (CHCF). The Indian Health Service (IHS) supports a health care delivery system for Native Americans. IHS's funding, which includes discretionary appropriations and collections from third-party payers of health care, increased between FY2010 and FY2015 from $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion. Appropriations and collections both increased during that period. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds basic, clinical, and translational biomedical and behavioral research. NIH gets more than 99% of its funding from discretionary appropriations. Its funding dropped from $31.2 billion in FY2010 to $30.3 billion in FY2015. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funds mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. SAMHSA's funding, about 95% of which comes from discretionary appropriations, has remained at about $3.6 billion over the FY2010-FY2015 period.", "Congress has yet to complete work on any of the regular appropriations bills for FY2016, which began on October 1, 2015. On September 30, the President signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-53). The measure provides continuing appropriations through December 11, 2016. It funds discretionary programs at the same rate (and under the same conditions) as in FY2015, minus an across-the-board reduction of 0.2108%. For entitlement and other mandatory spending that is funded through appropriation acts, P.L. 114-53 provides funding to maintain program levels under current law.

Finally, FDA is primarily a regulatory agency, whose mission is to ensure the safety of foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, and the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and other health products. In 2009, Congress gave FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products in order to protect public health.", "The programs and activities of five of the PHS agencies\u2014AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA\u2014are mostly authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA).

Congressional appropriators must be notified in advance of any transfer.", "The HHS Secretary used this transfer authority in FY2013 and again in FY2014 as part of a broader effort to provide the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with additional funding to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In FY2013, for example, NIH was the primary source of transfers both to CMS for ACA implementation and to CDC and SAMHSA to help offset a loss of funding for those two agencies from the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). A significant portion of the FY2013 PPHF funds that were originally allocated to CDC and SAMHSA were reallocated to CMS for ACA implementation.

This long-standing budgeting authority is known as the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside (set-aside), or PHS budget \"tap.\" ", "Under this authority the appropriations of a number of HHS agencies and offices are subject to an assessment. Although the PHSA limits the set-aside to no more than 1% of program appropriations, in recent years the annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act has specified a higher amount. The FY2015 Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act capped the set-aside at 2.5%. Following passage of the annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act, the HHS Budget Office calculates the assessment on each of the donor agencies and offices. These funds are then transferred to various recipient agencies and offices within the department for evaluation and other specified purposes, based on the amounts specified in the appropriations act. ", " Table 1 shows the total assessments and transfers for FY2013, by HHS agency and office, and indicates whether the entity was a net donor or recipient of set-aside funds that year. NIH, whose annual discretionary appropriation exceeds that of all the other PHS agencies combined, is subject to the largest assessment of set-aside funds. NIH contributed almost $710 million (69%) of the $1.026 billion in set-aside funds in FY2013. The agency received $8 million in set-aside funding, making it a significant net donor of such funds. Similarly, HRSA contributed more set-aside funds than it received in FY2013. On the other hand, AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA each were net recipients of set-aside funding in FY2013. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Office of the Secretary (OS) also received set-aside funds.", "The FY2013 assessments and transfers of set-aside funding shown in Table 1 are broadly representative of the distribution of such funds during each of the preceding fiscal years extending back to the mid-2000s. In FY2014, the allocation of set-aside funding was comparable to that of FY2013 but with one key difference. For the first time, CMS was a recipient of set-aside funds.", "In FY2015, congressional appropriators made substantial changes to the allocation of set-aside funds by transferring most of the funding to NIH and eliminating any transfers to AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. As shown in Table 1 , NIH went from being by far the largest net donor of set-aside funds to a net recipient of such funding in FY2015. Meanwhile, AHRQ and CDC experienced a significant net loss of set-aside funding in FY2015. The situation with AHRQ is of particular interest. From FY2003 through FY2014, AHRQ did not receive an annual discretionary appropriation. The agency was supported by set-aside funds and, in recent years, by smaller amounts from other sources. In FY2015, however, AHRQ received a discretionary appropriation for the first time in more than a decade in lieu of receiving any set-aside funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Funding, User Fees, and Collections", "paragraphs": ["Although the bulk of PHS agency funding is provided through annual discretionary appropriations, agencies also receive mandatory funding, user fees, and third-party collections.

These programs provide FDA with additional resources that allow it to hire more personnel and expedite the process of reviewing new product applications. Some user fees also pay for information technology infrastructure and post-approval regulation of safety and effectiveness. FDA's user fee programs now support the agency's regulation of prescription drugs, animal drugs, medical devices, tobacco products, and foods, among other activities. The amount of user fees that FDA collects under these programs has increased steadily since PDUFA was enacted, both in absolute terms and as a share of FDA's overall budget.

The BCA established enforceable discretionary spending limits, or caps, for defense and nondefense spending for each of FY2012 through FY2021 and triggered annual spending reductions, equally divided between defense and nondefense spending, beginning in FY2013. Within each spending category the cuts are divided proportionately between discretionary spending and nonexempt mandatory spending. All the spending summarized in this report falls within the nondefense category.

First, the funds for the CDC-administered Vaccines for Children program come from Medicaid, which is exempt from sequestration. Second, funding for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) also is exempt from sequestration. Third, under the sequestration special rules, cuts in CHCF funding for community health centers and migrant health centers and the cuts in mandatory diabetes funding for IHS are capped at 2% (see Table 2 ).", "While all the nonexempt PHS programs with mandatory funding were sequestered in FY2013 and FY2014, several of them avoided sequestration in FY2015 and/or FY2016 because there were no budgetary resources at the time the sequestration was ordered by the President. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, administered by HRSA, is one example of this anomaly. The ACA authorized the Home Visiting program and funded it through FY2014 (see Table 6 ). Pursuant to the BCA, the President ordered the FY2015 sequestration on March 10, 2014, the day the FY2015 budget was released.

But it concluded that IHS's third-party collections in FY2013 were exempt from sequestration.", "For each of the remaining years (i.e., FY2014 through FY2021), the annual reductions in discretionary spending required under the BCA are achieved by lowering the discretionary spending caps by the total dollar amount of the required reduction. This means that congressional appropriators get to decide how to apportion the cuts within the lowered spending cap rather than having the cuts applied across-the-board to all nonexempt accounts through the sequestration process.", "For FY2014, OMB lowered the NDD spending cap by about $37 billion. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) subsequently amended the BCA by establishing new NDD spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015 and eliminating the BCA requirement that these caps be lowered.
