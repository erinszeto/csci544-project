The census long form, which for decades collected detailed socioeconomic and housing data from a sample of the population, was replaced by the American Community Survey, a \"continuous measurement\" survey of about 250,000 households per month from 2005 through 2011 (now about 295,000 per month), which gathers largely the same data as its predecessor.", "Another innovation for 2010 was to have been the development of highly specialized handheld computers to automate two essential census field operations: address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up (NRFU). The goal of pre-census address canvassing was to verify and correct census maps and addresses for mailing census forms and sending enumerators. During NRFU, census workers tried repeatedly to visit or telephone people who had not completed their questionnaires and obtain information from them. Testing had revealed such serious problems with the handheld devices that although the Bureau used them for address canvassing, it resorted to the traditional paper-based approach for NRFU. The change required the Bureau to hire and train more NRFU staff, at increased expense. In 2012, the total life-cycle cost of the 2010 census was estimated at about $13 billion, instead of the previously estimated $11.5 billion. The problems with the handhelds fueled concerns that the success of the census could be at risk.

In 2000, for example, the Bureau sent a set of basic questions on a short form to most housing units; a sample of units\u2014about 17%\u2014received a long form containing these questions and others designed to gather socioeconomic and housing data for various legislative and program purposes.

It asked for the age, sex, race, and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) of each person in a household, as well as the individual's relationship to the person filling out the form. The form also included a question about tenure, that is, whether the housing unit was rented or owned by a member of the household.", "The long form was replaced by the American Community Survey (ACS), a \"continuous measurement\" survey of, from 2005 to 2011, about 250,000 households per month, totaling about 3 million annually (now about 295,000 households per month, totaling about 3.54 million a year), which, with few exceptions, gathers the same data as its predecessor.

Heading the list was the need to \"overcome the setbacks experienced in reengineering decennial processes and conduct a successful 2010 Census.\" The failure of the handhelds was prominent among the setbacks noted. According to the report, the Bureau \"originally intended to develop the handhelds in-house and tested prototypes in ... 2004 and 2006. The devices had serious problems in both tests,\" which, in the OIG's view, \"should have better informed the Bureau's efforts to define requirements.\" The decision to contract for FDCA came \"too late in the decade ... to meet ambitious fixed deadlines for the dress rehearsal tests starting in 2007 and decennial operations starting in 2009.\" Not until January 2008, almost two years after awarding the contract, did the Bureau deliver \"a first draft of a complete, user-validated set of requirements for the handhelds and supporting infrastructure.\" By then, the MITRE Corporation, which periodically advised the Bureau about its information technology (IT) programs for the 2010 census, had found that", "FDCA is in serious trouble. It is not clear the system will meet Census' operational needs and quality goals. The final cost is unpredictable. Immediate, significant changes are required to rescue the program. However, the risks are so large considering the available time that we recommend immediate development of contingency plans to revert to paper operations.", "The OIG report acknowledged that the Bureau had taken important actions, such as management changes and better oversight, to address these problems, but stated that \"significant risks remain for the 2010 decennial.\"", "Similarly, the Government Accountability Office pointed out vulnerabilities in the Bureau's management of its information technology systems, including the handheld computers. In a November 6, 2008, press release to announce its presidential transition website, GAO included the upcoming census among its 13 \"urgent issues ... needing the attention of [then-] President-Elect Obama and the 111 th Congress during the transition and the first year of the new administration and Congress.\" The 2010 census, in large part because of IT problems and a substantial total estimated cost, remained one of the areas GAO designated as \"high risk\" in a January 2009 update of its high-risk series. Among the concerns GAO noted in a March 2009 report were the following:", "The Dress Rehearsal was originally conceived to provide a comprehensive end-to-end test of key 2010 census operations; however, ... because of the problems encountered with the handheld devices, among other things, testing was curtailed. As a result, although several critical operations underwent end-to-end testing in the Dress Rehearsal, others did not. According to the Associate Director for the 2010 census, the Bureau tested approximately 23 of 44 key operations during the Dress Rehearsal. Examples of key operations that underwent end-to-end testing ... are address canvassing and group quarters validation. An example of a key operation that was not tested is the largest field operation\u2014nonresponse follow-up....", "In December 2008, after additional development and improvements to the handheld computers, the Bureau conducted a limited field test for address canvassing, intended to assess software functionality in an operational environment. We observed this test and determined that users were generally satisfied with the performance of the handhelds.... However, the test ... included only a limited subset of functionality to be used during the 2009 address canvassing operations.", "GAO further observed that although nonresponse follow-up was paper based in previous censuses, the paper-based NRFU in 2010 would rely on \"newly developed systems\" that had \"not yet been fully tested in a census-like environment.... Any significant change to an existing IT system introduces the risk that the system may not work as intended; therefore, testing all systems after changes have been made ... is critical to the success of the 2010 census.\" GAO noted that testing had \"only recently started\" for the 2010 NRFU, including the IT systems and infrastructure necessary to support this operation and certain other activities, such as group-quarters enumeration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Their Assessments in 2010", "paragraphs": ["At a March 25, 2010, congressional hearing, as nonresponse follow-up was about to begin, the Commerce Department's OIG again identified \"serious issues\" facing the Bureau: ", "Much of the ... plan is on track, but the success of NRFU\u2014which is critical\u2014hinges on how effectively Census controls the enormous NRFU workload and workforce.... [I]t must do so using a Paper-Based Operations Control System (PBOCS) with less functionality than planned and currently experiencing significant performance problems. PBOCS is essential for efficiently making assignments to enumerators, tracking enumeration forms, and reporting on the status of operations. And Census must recruit, hire, and pay its massive temporary workforce with a Decennial Applicant, Personnel, and Payroll System (DAPPS) also experiencing persistent performance limitations.", "At the same hearing, GAO, too, expressed reservations about the Bureau's IT systems, especially DAPPS and PBOCS. GAO called them \"the most significant risk jeopardizing the cost and quality of the enumeration.... Indeed, neither system has yet demonstrated the ability to function reliably under full operational loads.\" Since December 2009, GAO noted, the Bureau had \"completed many steps to improve DAPPS performance,\" and more were planned. The system still, however, was \"experiencing capacity limitations and slow response ... even though approximately 100,000 temporary employees were ... being paid using the system versus the more than 600,000\" who would require payment \"at the peak of field operations.\" With respect to PBOCS, continued GAO, early releases in January and February 2010 had \"known defects, such as limited functionality, slow performance, and problems generating certain progress and performance reports.\" Moreover, testing for \"the component of the second release that will be used to manage NRFU\" was incomplete as of mid-March.

The Bureau attributed these problems, GAO continued, \"in part, to the compressed development and testing schedule, as well as to inadequate performance and interface testing.\" The problems led to a backlog of census questionnaires in local census offices, and impaired the Bureau's ability to monitor NRFU workers' productivity and the quality of their interviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO's Statement in 2012", "paragraphs": ["Nevertheless, in July 18, 2012, congressional testimony, GAO offered this largely positive assessment of the Bureau's 2010 census operations: \"despite some significant initial setbacks that raised the cost of the enumeration, the Bureau eventually developed workarounds to the challenges facing the 2010 Census and it was ultimately an operational success as the Bureau generally completed its peak census data collection activities consistent with its plans.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Census Accuracy and Coverage", "paragraphs": ["As noted at the beginning of this report, the idealized expectation that the decennial census should count every person once, only once, and in the right place is deceptively simple.

Many households consist of racial and ethnic minorities; multiple families; low-income people; inner-city residents; those whose living circumstances are atypical; international migrants to the United States who may lack English language proficiency, lack legal status in this country, or distrust all governmental activities; or various combinations of these attributes. Any of them can make enumeration difficult, and some of them contribute markedly to recurrent undercounts of racial and ethnic minorities.", "Overcounts of some groups within the population can occur to the extent that the Bureau receives multiple census forms from the same people or households, then does not capture and eliminate the duplications. A husband and wife, for example, might own a vacation home and fill out a questionnaire there as well as at their usual residence. Another example would be parents who erroneously list a child on the form for their household, when the child actually is away at college and, in accordance with census residence rules, has been correctly enumerated there.", "The greater tendency for minorities and less affluent members of society than for whites and wealthier people to be undercounted can lead to differential undercounts of the former.

DA uses administrative records, including birth and death records, together with estimates of net international migration to the United States during a decade, to estimate the population size at a given census date. This figure was compared with the population count for each actual census from 1940 through 2000 to arrive at estimates of coverage and net undercount. After the 2000 census, the Bureau described the DA process as follows:", "The traditional DA population benchmarks are developed for the census date by analyzing various types of demographic data essentially independent of the census, such as administrative statistics on births, deaths, authorized international migration, and Medicare enrollments, as well as estimates of legal emigration and net unauthorized immigration. The difference between the Demographic Analysis benchmarks and the census count provides an estimate of the census net undercount. Dividing the net undercount by the DA benchmark[s] provides an estimate of the net undercount rate.", "Despite its utility, demographic analysis has limitations. Among them are the feasibility of producing estimates only at the national level, not at lower geographic levels, and only for broad racial categories (black and non-black). Uncertainty in estimating the components of net international migration to the United States, particularly emigration, temporary migration, and unauthorized migration, is another concern with DA. According to the Bureau, \"the research effect on immigration, births, and deaths led to Revised DA estimates\" for 1990 and 2000. \"The Revised DA lowered the estimated net undercount rates from 1.85% to 1.65% in 1990, and from 0.32% to 0.12% in 2000, but did not alter the DA finding that the estimated net undercount rate in 2000 was substantially lower than in 1990.\"", " Table 2 shows net percentage undercount estimates for the 1940 through 2000 censuses, as derived by demographic analysis. The last two columns of the table, for 1990 and 2000, reflect the revised DA estimates discussed above. The table indicates a decrease in the estimated net undercount rates for the total population, blacks, and non-blacks in every census year except 1990, when the rates increased for the overall population and the two groups within it. In each of the seven censuses, a differential undercount was noted: the estimated net rate was higher for blacks than for non-blacks.", "On December 6, 2010, the Bureau issued DA estimates of the population as of Census Day.

The cut, in GAO's assessment, would \"reduce precision of the estimates, yet the proposed changes should reduce nonsampling errors and thus provide users with more reliable estimates.\" Perhaps because of what the 2010 census was estimated to cost, the option of making changes to improve CCM data quality without decreasing sample size was not addressed.", "The report critiqued certain aspects of the CCM program. One observation was that even though the Bureau had \"stated the importance of using 2010 evaluation data ... for 2020 Census design,\" it had \"not yet taken steps to link CCM data\" to improvements for 2020. Another point, particularly relevant for future census evaluations, was that the Bureau should ascertain the \"optimal time\" to start person interviewing for coverage evaluation. If this operation begins too early, it can overlap \"with census data collection, possibly compromising the independence of the two different operations and introducing a 'contamination bias' error\" into the data for coverage evaluation. Starting person interviewing too late \"increases the chance that respondents will not accurately remember household information from Census Day ... introducing error (known as 'recall bias')\" into the coverage evaluation data.

The 2003 decision of [then-Census Bureau] director Kincannon, consistent with this, assured that no implementation infrastructure for adjustment was put in place for 2010.\"", "The committee's ranking Member observed that although sampling could not be used to adjust the census apportionment numbers, \"There is ... some question over whether sampling could be used for redistricting and for the allocation of federal funds.\" She then asked Groves, \"Will you advocate for the statistical adjustment or use of sampling during the 2010 Census?\" He answered, \"No, Senator,\" and added in response to the same query about the 2020 census, \"I have no plans to do that for 2020.\"", "In April 2010, as previously discussed, GAO reported its findings to that point about the 2010 Census Coverage Measurement program. The report, requested by the ranking Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Information Policy, Census, and National Archives Subcommittee, repeated others' earlier assurances that the \"Bureau is not planning to use CCM to adjust the 2010 Census.

The various components of the Bureau's integrated communications strategy were designed to meet this two-part goal. As GAO observed, however, motivating the public to respond to the census was \"a far thornier task\" than raising awareness about it.", "On September 6, 2007, the Bureau announced that it had awarded the 2010 census communications contract to Draftfcb of New York City. Draftfcb headed a team of communications firms that specialize in reaching minority groups: Global Hue, for blacks and Hispanics; IW Group, for Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; G&G, for American Indians and Alaska Natives; and Allied Media, for \"emerging\" groups, such as Arabic-speaking people and Eastern Europeans. The integrated communications strategy was built on the partnership and Census in Schools programs, as well as on paid advertising via network and cable television, radio, the Internet, newspapers, and magazines.", "For the 2010 census, as for that in 2000, the Bureau partnered with local governments, businesses, community organizations, neighborhood groups, and the media to help inform the public about the census and encourage participation in it, including cooperation with enumerators during nonresponse follow-up. The Bureau's website presented partnership information, for example, a list of partners. ", "Among the Bureau's suggested activities for partners were distributing census promotional materials, sponsoring events to raise awareness of the census, and disseminating information about it through newsletters. Partnership staff, working with elected officials, formed Complete Count Committees to reach groups with a history of being undercounted. Early in 2009, the Bureau mailed Complete Count Committee guides to the highest elected officials in 39,000 state, local, and tribal governments.", "Partners also could identify possible candidates for temporary census work, such as enumerators to conduct NRFU, and provide space for testing job applicants and training new hires. The Bureau's website gave information about 2010 census employment. As of April 11, 2010, the Bureau had slightly exceeded its goal of recruiting 3.7 million applicants for more than 600,000 census-taker and other positions related to NRFU. The weak economy may have given the Bureau a recruitment advantage, even for short-term, often part-time, jobs.

LUCA was made possible by P.L. 103-430 (108 Stat. 4394) to assist the Bureau in improving the Master Address File. Under the program, local, state, and tribal governments could review MAF and document any mistakes they found in it. LUCA for the 2010 census began in January 2007. According to the Bureau, it received the LUCA data and entered them into MAF. LUCA participants could review the changes made and appeal requested changes that were not accepted.", "The Census in Schools initiative for 2010 focused on educating children in kindergarten through 12 th grade about the importance of census participation, so that they could convey this message to their parents.

According to March 25, 2010, congressional testimony by GAO, about 22% of those hired for address canvassing had unclassifiable prints, generally due to local census office workers' errors in taking the prints for submission to the FBI. The Census Bureau tried to obtain clearer prints of nonresponse follow-up hires through improved training of the local census office workers and by supplying each office with at least one digital fingerprint scanner. The Bureau estimated that about 10% to 12% of workers, instead of 22%, would have unclassifiable prints when the scanners were used. If, as GAO testified, the fingerprint check during address canvassing revealed \"a criminal record that made an employee unsuitable for employment, the Bureau either terminated the person immediately or placed the individual in a nonworking status until the matter was resolved.\" Address-canvassing hires whose prints were unclassifiable \"were allowed to continue working if their name background check was acceptable.\" GAO \"did not receive a response from the Bureau\" about whether it would \"allow ... workers with unclassifiable prints to continue\" NRFU work.

News articles, early in the Obama Administration, stating that the Director might report to the White House, instead of, as Title 13 U.S.C. stipulates, the Commerce Secretary, raised concern among some Members of Congress that the 2010 count could be subject to political manipulation. Subsequent articles about Administration assurances that the Director would continue reporting to the Secretary did not entirely allay this concern. Gary Locke, speaking to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on March 18, 2009, before his confirmation as Commerce Secretary, emphasized that the decennial census \"will be run out of the Department of Commerce and by a Director who will work with the Congress, the Administration, and our state and local leaders ... in making this a successful count.\" Robert M. Groves's written opening remarks to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee at the May 15, 2009, hearing on his nomination to be Bureau Director stated that \"government statistical agencies must be independent of partisan politics\" and that \"this country needs an objective, nonpartisan, professional Census Bureau.\" ", "The Bureau, in all matters related to the decennial enumeration and the rest of its activities under Title 13 U.S.C., is subject to oversight.

A change in the 112 th Congress was that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Health Care, District of Columbia, Census, and National Archives Subcommittee had Census Bureau oversight. In the 113 th Congress, Bureau oversight rests with this committee's Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service, and the Census Subcommittee, and with the full Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The relevant Appropriations Subcommittees in the 113 th Congress are those on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, as they were in the 111 th and 112 th Congresses. The Government Accountability Office also evaluated various aspects of the 2010 census and issued many reports, some of which this CRS report has cited.

The Bureau reported an encouraging national participation rate of 74% for the mail-out, mail-back part of the 2010 census, which matched the rate in 2000. The Census Coverage Measurement estimates indicated a net percentage overcount of the total population and of non-Hispanic whites in 2010, as the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation estimates indicated for the 2000 census. The estimates suggested that in 2010, as in previous decades, the census tended to undercount racial minorities and Hispanics.
