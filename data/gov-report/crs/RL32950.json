The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended) included a provision providing a disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment for states that have experienced a major, statewide disaster. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA, P.L. 111-3) included a provision allowing a state's FMAP rate to be adjusted if the state had significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contributions in any calendar year since 2003.", "Legislation was enacted during the 111th Congress that impacts the FMAP rate. First, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) provided assistance to states through a temporary FMAP rate increase that was later extended by P.L. 111-226. Also, ACA contains a number of provisions affecting FMAP rates. Most notably, ACA provides initial FMAP rates of up to 100% for certain \"newly eligible\" individuals.", "During the 112th Congress, there has been a focus on reducing the federal deficit; controlling federal Medicaid spending is often discussed as a means to reduce federal expenditures.

For example, the 2008 state per capita personal income data published by BEA in September 2010 (used in the calculation of FY2012 FMAP rates) differed from the 2008 state per capita personal income data published in September 2011 (used in the calculation of FY2013 FMAP rates).", "It should be noted that the NIPA definition of personal income used by BEA is not the same as the definition used for personal income tax purposes.

The first is the nature of the state economy and, to the extent possible, a state's ability to respond to economic changes (i.e., downturns or upturns). The impact on a particular state of a national economic downturn or upturn will be related to the structure of the state economy and its business sectors. For example, a national decline in automobile sales, while having an impact on all state economies, will have a larger impact in states that manufacture automobiles as production is reduced and workers are laid off.", "Second, the FMAP formula relies on per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average per capita personal income . The national economy is basically the sum of all state economies. As a result, the national response to an economic change is the sum of the state responses to economic change. If more states (or larger states) experience an economic decline, the national economy reflects this decline to some extent. However, the national decline will be lower than some states' declines because the total decline has been offset by states with small decreases or even increases (i.e., states with growing economies). The U.S. per capita personal income, because of this balancing of positive and negative, has only a small percentage change each year. Since the FMAP formula compares state changes in per capita personal income (which can have large changes each year) to the U.S. per capita personal income, this comparison can result in significant state FMAP rate changes.", "In addition to annual revisions of per capita personal income data, comprehensive NIPA revisions undertaken every four to five years may also influence regular FMAP rates (e.g., because of changes in the definition of personal income). The impact on FMAP rates will depend on whether the changes are broad (affecting all states) or more selective (affecting only certain states or industries)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2013 Regular FMAP Rates", "paragraphs": ["Regular FMAP rates for FY2013 (the federal fiscal year that begins on October 1, 2012) were calculated and published November 30, 2011, in the Federal Register.

First, program enrollment increases at a faster rate than otherwise anticipated, when job and income losses lead more people to become eligible. Second, it can be more difficult to finance the nonfederal (i.e., state) share of Medicaid costs, when state revenues fall below expected levels. ", "Regarding enrollment, researchers have estimated that for every 1% increase in national unemployment, Medicaid enrollment increases by 1 million individuals. During the 2007 national recession period (i.e., December 2007 through June of 2009), the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate rose from 5.0% in December of 2007 to 9.5% in June of 2009, peaking at 10.1% in October 2010 (four months after the official end of the national recession). Over roughly the same period, the estimated number of individuals ever enrolled in Medicaid increased by 8.7%, from 58.8 million in FY2008 to an estimated 67.7 million in FY2010. On the revenue side, it is estimated that total state tax revenues declined by 10.2% from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the 2007 recession. To help mitigate state fiscal conditions, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) included a temporary increase to FMAP rates to help states maintain their Medicaid programs and free up funds that states would have otherwise used for Medicaid to address other state budgetary needs. ", "When viewed nationally, the growth in Medicaid expenditures has caused Medicaid to become the largest or second-largest item in state budgets depending on how it is measured. Medicaid accounted for 22.3% of total state budgets (i.e., includes funds from all state and federal sources) in state fiscal year (SFY) 2010. To date, most of the increase in Medicaid expenditures has been absorbed by the federal government through the temporary increase to FMAP rates. While total Medicaid expenditures grew as a proportion of total state budgets, state Medicaid expenditures as a percent of state general fund spending (i.e., the portion that states must finance on their own through taxes and other means) fell from 16.9% in SFY2008 to 15.8% in SFY2010. ", "Even with the temporary increase to FMAP rates moderating the impact of Medicaid expenditure growth on the state-funded portion of state budgets, many states faced budget deficits. A recent study from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that while these fiscal tensions exist universally across all states during an economic downturn, any given state's capacity to finance the state share of Medicaid costs to support new program enrollment may differ based on variables such as the state's economic condition, revenue structure, Medicaid program design, etc. Moreover, among states, economic downturns vary widely in their onset, depth and duration, and generally do not coincide exactly with national recessions. ", "Even though the national recession has officially ended and state tax revenues have shown continued consecutive quarters of growth, state revenues have not fully rebounded. State tax revenues at the national level were still 5.5% lower in the first quarter of 2011 than in the same quarter of 2008. As a result, nearly every state implemented at least one new Medicaid cost containment policy in SFY2010, SFY2011, and SFY2012. Because states are prohibited from curbing the cost of Medicaid through restricting eligibility standards due to the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements initially enacted under ARRA and later expanded and extended under ACA, over the past few years, states have focused cost containment strategies on reducing provider rates, making changes to their benefit packages, or implementing limitations on the use of benefits.", "In compiling their SFY2012 budgets, states faced difficult decisions with respect to the Medicaid program because the temporary FMAP rate increase ended on June 30, 2011 (the last day of SFY2011 for most states). States had to make up for the loss of the enhanced federal Medicaid funding before state revenues have rebounded. Further, because of Medicaid's federal-state financing structure, for states to generate $1 of savings in the state share of Medicaid spending, they will be required to reduce their overall Medicaid spending by $2 to almost $4, depending on each state's regular FMAP rate. For example, in a state with a FMAP rate of 50%, to obtain state-share savings in the amount of $20 million would require total federal and state Medicaid spending to be reduced by approximately $40 million. In a state with a FMAP rate of 65%, to obtain state-share savings in the amount of $20 million would require total federal and state share Medicaid spending to be reduced by approximately $57 million. The degree to which a state is willing to cut the nonfederal share of its Medicaid spending might depend in part on the loss of federal dollars it would also face as a result of these deductions.", "Historically, it has taken three to five years from the onset of a recession for state revenues to recover, and there is evidence that states' recovery from the most recent recession will take longer than other recent recessions.

One of the proposals would restructure the Medicaid program from an individual entitlement to a block grant, starting in FY2013. According to CBO's long-term analysis of the proposal, when compared to long-term estimates of current law, federal spending for Medicaid would be 35% lower in FY2022 and 49% lower in FY2030.", "Proponents of the block grant model suggest that this design would make federal Medicaid spending more predictable and provide states with stronger incentives to control the cost of their Medicaid programs. Additionally, this design could relieve some of the cost burden to states by removing certain federal Medicaid requirements. However, this proposal would shift the responsibility for the growth in Medicaid spending over the federal block grant amount to states. According to CBO, the magnitude of the federal Medicaid spending reductions under this proposal would make it difficult for states to maintain their current Medicaid programs. As a result, states would have to weigh the impact of maintaining current Medicaid service levels against other state priorities for spending.
