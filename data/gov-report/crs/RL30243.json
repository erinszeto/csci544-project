The \"Flag Code\" includes instruction and rules on such topics as the pledge of allegiance, display and use of the flag by civilians, time and occasions for display, position and manner of display, and how to show respect for the flag. The \"Code\" also grants to the President the authority to modify the rules governing the flag.", "The report also addresses several of the frequently asked questions concerning the flag. The subject matter of these questions includes the pledge of allegiance and the court decisions concerning it, the nature of the codifications of customs concerning the flag in the \"Flag Code,\" display of the flag 24 hours a day, flying the flag in bad weather, flying the flag at half-staff, ornaments on the flag, destruction of worn flags, display of the U.S. flag with flags of other nations or of states, commercial use of the flag, size and proportion of the flag, restrictions upon display of the flag by real estate associations, and the country of origin of flags used on the caskets of veterans."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Public concern and confusion regarding the proper respect shown to the United States flag has given rise to many questions on the law relating to the flag's handling, display, and use.

In addition to the Code, Congress has by statute designated the national anthem and set out the proper conduct during its presentation. The Code is designed \"for the use of such civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments\" of the federal government. Thus, the Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include enforcement provisions; rather the Code functions simply as a guide to be voluntarily followed by civilians and civilian groups.", "The Federal Flag Code does not purport to cover all possible situations. Although the Code empowers the President of the United States to alter, modify, repeal, or prescribe additional rules regarding the flag, no federal agency has the authority to issue \"official\" rulings legally binding on civilians or civilian groups. Consequently, different interpretations of various provisions of the Code may continue to be made. The Flag Code itself, however, suggests a general rule by which practices involving the flag may be fairly tested: \"No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America.\" Therefore, actions not specifically included in the Code may be deemed acceptable as long as proper respect is shown.", "In addition to the Flag Code, a separate provision contained in the Federal Criminal Code established criminal penalties for certain treatment of the flag. Prior to 1989, this provision provided criminal penalties for certain acts of desecration to the flag. In response to the Supreme Court decision in Texas v. Johnson (which held that anti-desecration statutes are unconstitutional if aimed at suppressing one type of expression), Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act of 1989 to provide criminal penalties for certain acts which violate the physical integrity of the flag. This law imposed a fine and/or up to one year in prison for knowingly mutilating, defacing, physically defiling, maintaining on the floor, or trampling upon any flag of the United States. In 1990, however, the Supreme Court held that the Flag Protection Act was unconstitutional as applied to a burning of the flag in a public protest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Flag Code\u2014History and Text", "paragraphs": ["On June 22, 1942, President Franklin D.
