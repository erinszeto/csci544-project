Funding is used for such activities as capacity building, processing complaints, administrative costs, and training. In FY2018, the appropriation for FHAP was $23.9 million. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) funds eligible entities, most of which are private nonprofit organizations. Funds are used for investigating complaints, including testing (comparing outcomes when members of a protected class attempt to obtain housing with outcomes for those not in a protected class), education, outreach, and capacity building. In FY2018, the appropriation for FHIP was $39.6 million.", "Another provision of the Fair Housing Act requires that HUD affirmatively further fair housing (AFFH). As part of this requirement, recipients of certain HUD funding\u2014jurisdictions that receive Community Planning and Development grants and Public Housing Authorities\u2014go through a process to certify that they are affirmatively furthering fair housing. In July 2015, HUD issued a new rule governing the process, called the Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH). The rule provided that funding recipients are to assess their jurisdictions and regions for fair housing issues (including areas of segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs), identify factors that contribute to these fair housing issues, and set priorities and goals for overcoming them. HUD is to provide data for program participants to use in preparing their AFHs, as well as a tool that helps program participants through the AFH process. However, as of May 2018, HUD has indefinitely delayed implementation of the AFFH rule. In response, a group of advocacy organizations has filed a lawsuit challenging HUD's failure to implement and enforce the rule.", "Among other activities undertaken by HUD's FHEO are efforts to prevent discrimination that may not be explicitly directed against protected classes under the Fair Housing Act. This includes issuing a regulation to prohibit discrimination in HUD programs based on sexual orientation and gender identity and releasing new guidance in 2016 addressing several issues: the use of criminal background checks in screening applicants for housing, local nuisance ordinances that may disproportionately affect victims of domestic violence, and failure to serve people who have limited English proficiency.", "FHEO also oversees efforts to ensure that clients with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) have access to HUD programs. Guidance from FHEO helps housing providers determine how best to provide translation services, and HUD also receives a small appropriation through the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity account for the agency to translate documents and provide translation on the phone or at events.

In addition, the law gives residents with disabilities the right to request \"reasonable accommodations\" in the rules, policies, practices, or services that may ordinarily apply to housing residents. It is considered discrimination under the Fair Housing Act to refuse to make a reasonable accommodation in order to give residents with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling unit. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making parking spaces available to residents with disabilities or allowing assistance animals in a property that does not otherwise allow pets. An accommodation is not considered reasonable if it imposes an undue financial or administrative burden, or if it fundamentally alters the nature of the housing provider's operations.

GAO reported that among current AIs, many lacked timelines for accomplishing goals. A limitation identified by GAO as contributing to the problems was that regulations included very few requirements regarding AIs, with most procedures suggested in HUD guidance.
