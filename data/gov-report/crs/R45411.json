The ESCO typically guarantees a fixed amount of energy savings and cost savings throughout the term of the contract, bearing the risk of the improvement's failure to produce a projected amount of energy savings and cost savings. The efficiency improvement provided by the ESPC is referred to as an \"energy or water conservation measure,\" and includes improvements such as energy- and water-saving equipment, energy savings measures such as better insulation or windows, and renewable energy systems such as solar energy panels.
