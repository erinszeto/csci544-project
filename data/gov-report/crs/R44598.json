This sequence of events is depicted in the following figure:"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Ideally, an APS should provide \"hemispheric\" coverage to combat vehicles. This is particularly important, as some advanced countries have designed weapons that can use advanced infrared or radar sensors and guidance to attack the tops or engine compartments of vehicles, which are usually less armored than the front, sides, and underside of armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). However, absent hemispheric coverage, APS coverage of certain aspects of a vehicle might still be sufficiently effective to justify its adoption for use. Another important aspect of coverage is the APS's ability to address multiple incoming attacks. Common enemy tactics involve using multiple RPGs and/or ATGMs against a single vehicle, as was seen in Gaza in 2006. The aim of these \"swarm\" attacks is to overwhelm a vehicle's defenses and improve the chances of disabling or destroying the vehicle with multiple hits. APSs that cannot respond to multiple, incoming threats from different directions are considered by some experts as of limited utility. Also, it is considered an important capability that, after being attacked, an APS can quickly be reloaded or \"reconstituted\" to respond to further attacks.

However, countermeasures have proven difficult to implement in practice because they must be tailored to a particular threat; they are not an umbrella defense that would work on a wide range of threats. For example, a millimeter wave radar jammer will not work against an infrared tracker.", "Furthermore, when jammers offer umbrella coverage (broadband or barrage jamming), they can also have negative effects on friendly communications and electronic systems. That drawback limits their usefulness in some situations. For example, some barrage jammers used to counter IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan disrupted normal radio communications for U.S. soldiers.", "Employing defensive electronic countermeasures in ground combat can have unexpected consequences: small changes in some parameters, such as radio frequencies, antenna shapes, or orientation, can cause large changes in effectiveness.

The size of the intercepting projectiles varies from 105 mm high-explosive fragmenting warheads similar to artillery shells to smaller shaped charges. The risk of injury that the fragments and blast from those intercepting rounds would present to nearby soldiers, civilians, or other vehicles is a great concern. The fact that the intercepting rounds must be launched automatically without human intervention in order to meet the required timelines increases that concern. The United States and Israel have studied this problem and have tended to select interceptors for their systems that minimize\u2014but do not eliminate\u2014the hazard to people outside the vehicle.", "Army officials further note the long-standing nature of the unintended casualties vs. effectiveness debate and point out that in a similar manner, reactive armor also can pose a hazard to dismounted troops and civilians. It is possible the threat posed to friendly soldiers and civilian non-combatants by the APS can only be reduced and not entirely eliminated, which poses a dilemma for the U.S. military.

Hard-kill APS carries an inherent risk of collateral damage, with the primary hazard being the automatic launch of an explosive counter-munition against an incoming high-velocity explosive threat. In this regard, hard-kill APS may pose a threat to private property\u2014including religious and historically significant property. If the avoidance of collateral damage is of overriding military concern, the employment of APS in and around structures and property could be limited, adding another level of restriction to APS use and potentially further reducing its utility in a growing list of combat scenarios. Army officials contend, however, due to the relatively small size of counter-munitions, that incoming threat projectiles might pose a much more significant collateral damage threat. In addition to limiting effectiveness, operational APS limitations could present tactical opportunities to potential adversaries who could take advantage of self-imposed APS restrictions.

CBO's 2012 report raises a number of battlefield-related considerations related to APS effectiveness:", "The available time [for the APS to activate] may be shortened further if the control system has trouble detecting the incoming rounds. Battlefield clutter (man-made objects or natural features that create false signal echoes) can reduce the detection range of the system and create false targets. Enemy radar jammers may have the same effect. As a result, the active protection system may be delayed in detecting, or not ever detect, the less time it has to react.", "Once the active protection system detects an incoming round, it must track the round for a period of time to determine if the trajectory poses a danger to the vehicle. Most systems do this by calculating whether the round will pass through a zone it deems a protected area. The system will attempt to intercept any incoming round that it predicts will enter this area. Demonstrations by contractors suggest that the systems may be capable of doing this in simple one-on-one situations, but how the systems will work in a situation where many active protection systems are operating side by side, with overlapping sectors of coverage and with multiple incoming threats, remains to be seen [emphasis added by CRS]. What will happen when multiple vehicles classify an incoming round as a threat? How do they coordinate a response? Those questions remain largely unanswered.", "Coordinating the defensive fire among vehicles implies that the systems communicate with each other. Can the communications networks handle that traffic in the very short time required? Furthermore, there is the potential for mutual interference from having many radar systems transmitting in close proximity. Will the systems end up jamming each other? How to address mutual interference and how to allot defensive fire from multiple systems that might be in the protected area are technical issues whose solutions have not yet been determined.", "APS might also have an impact on a combat vehicle's overall electro-magnetic \"signature.\" Based on the number of APS sensors employed in a given area, the Army might need to limit the number of systems in that area to avoid mutual interference. These considerations are illustrative of the challenges of integrating APS for use on the battlefield. It is not just enough that the system functions as the scientists and engineers envision, but it must successfully operate in a complex physical and electronic combat environment as well, where, all too often, the \"fog of war\" greatly affects the actual performance of weapon systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Size and Power Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The components of an APS include some form of threat detection, a tracking system, signal processing systems, and the actual countermeasures systems. These components are mounted both outside and inside of the protected vehicle. In addition, these components require power\u2014either from batteries or power generated from the vehicle. Because U.S. APS systems could initially be retrofitted to existing combat vehicles, there could be difficulties in installing APS components inside already space-constrained vehicles. How to power the APS, particularly if it relies on power generated from the vehicle, is another question for retrofits. It is possible that size, weight, and power constraints (referred to as SWAP) could dictate what type of APS is adopted for use, which could result in a less than optimal design and a decreased level of protection. The Army notes legacy combat vehicles, such as the M-1 Abrams tank, were not designed to support the additional size, weight, and power that APS would require. In the case of vehicles under development, it is likely APS size and power requirements will be incorporated into the vehicle's design so SWAP requirements should be less of a factor when selecting an APS system. In this regard, Army officials point out that the Israeli Merkava Mark 4 tank was designed around the Trophy APS.

Closed APS systems are described as being \"hard-wired\" together, which, while having certain attributes such as lower initial development costs and high levels of performance, are not considered by some officials as adaptable as open or \"modular\" systems. For example, in an open architecture APS, if the enemy figures out how to jam radars or defeat countermeasures, theoretically affected sensors and countermeasures can be removed and new sensors and/or countermeasures can be \"plugged\" in their place; in a closed system, the entire system might have to be redesigned or upgraded. U.S. defense officials are said to favor an open architecture for any new APS development so that \"new features can be fielded quickly as new anti-vehicle threats emerge.\" The Army notes their emphasis on open architecture is derived from broad DOD guidance issued in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook and DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System. The Army also has contracts and is working with industry to develop standards for implementing an open systems approach for APS. Furthermore, the Army warns there would likely be significant costs to bring what they refer to as \"vendor locked\" APSs (APSs fielded or nearly fielded) into full compliance with U.S. safety boards and testing organizations requirements.", "Some in industry contend their systems are not truly \"closed\" systems as DOD suggests and incorporate modular design features, and that they are not \"vendor locked\" and are more safety compliant than has been suggested.

The Army, however, notes it is the vehicle's base armor requirements that drive the selection of an APS, and APS efforts associated with Abrams, Bradleys, and Strykers might not prove feasible. Should the Army opt to adopt a NDI APS, there could be several hundreds of vehicles in active and reserve forces receiving a NDI APS. Fielding a NDI APS capability could prove to be a highly expensive undertaking for the Army and Marines, particularly if the APS adopted for use has a high per-unit cost. Other associated costs that could affect the overall affordability of APS include associated training, installation, and maintenance costs\u2014including the cost of repair parts and components, as well as who does the repairs and maintenance (contractors or servicemembers).

The first operational APS\u2014the Drozd\u2014was developed by the Soviet Union between 1977 and 1982. Designed to protect against RPGs and ATGMs, it used primitive millimeter-wave radar sensors mounted on each side of the tank's turret to detect incoming rounds. The Drozd covered only the forward 60 degrees of the turret, but the tank crew could rotate the turret to change the tank's protective profile. The Drozd was reported 80% successful against RPGs in Afghanistan. In the late 1990s, France mounted the Galix countermeasures system on its Leclerc main battle tanks. The turret-mounted Galix provided 360-degree coverage and could automatically fire 80 mm smoke rounds, anti-personnel rounds, or decoy rounds. Israel has employed APS operationally on selected vehicles since the late 1990s and, as previously discussed, has recently employed its Trophy APS extensively in combat in 2014, with plans underway to expand its use with Israeli forces. Currently, Russia's newest tank, the T-14 Armata, has separate hard kill and soft kill APSs.
