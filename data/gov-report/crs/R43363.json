Several proposals would base the COLA on other measures of inflation produced by the BLS. Some would set the Social Security COLA equal to growth in the Chained CPI for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), which is projected to reduce Social Security COLAs. Other proposals would use a measure of inflation experienced by older consumers, which is projected to increase benefits.", "Proponents of using the C-CPI-U have included the 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (chaired by former Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles) and the Bipartisan Policy Center's 2010 Debt Reduction Task Force (chaired by former Senator Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin). The President's 2014 budget (but not subsequent budgets) proposed using the C-CPI-U to compute COLAs for Social Security and in some other federal spending programs; it also proposed indexing the tax code to the C-CPI-U, which would increase federal revenues.", "Proponents of basing the COLA on the C-CPI-U argue that it is a more accurate measure of changes in the cost of living because it more fully accounts for how consumers adjust their purchases as relative prices of various items change and, unlike the traditional CPI, does not have a statistical bias that increases measured inflation. Using the C-CPI-U to compute COLAs is projected to reduce overall Social Security outlays by the government, because the C-CPI-U tends to grow more slowly than does the CPI-W, which in turn would result in lower Social Security COLAs.", "Other proposals would link the Social Security COLA to a measure of inflation that is based on purchasing patterns of the elderly, such as the BLS's Experimental Consumer Price Index for Americans Aged 62 and Older (CPI-E). The CPI-E grows faster than the CPI-W, on average, because a larger portion of spending by the elderly goes toward health care expenditures and other items whose prices tend to rise more rapidly. As a result, switching to such a measure is projected to result in larger COLAs and higher Social Security benefits.", "This report explains how the Social Security COLA is computed under current law and explains some criticisms of using the CPI-W to compute COLAs. It discusses two alternative measures of inflation, the C-CPI-U and the CPI-E.

", "They have also incorporated procedures that partially account for the \"substitution effect\"\u2014the fact that consumers cushion themselves from the effect of relative price increases by adjusting their purchasing patterns, and they take advantage of relative price decreases. For example, if the price of apples grows much faster than the price of pears, people often buy more pears. Conversely, if apples go on sale and pears do not, sales of apples would increase.

The CPI-W adjusts for the effects of substitution within those \"item-area\" categories, but not between them.

The CPI-W tracks the spending habits of urban wage and clerical workers, but about 80% of Social Security beneficiaries are aged 62 or older and therefore tend to have different spending patterns. Persons aged 62 and older spend around twice as much of their direct outlays on health care as does the rest of the population, a difference that accounts for about half of the difference in the growth rates of the CPI-W and the Experimental Consumer Price Index for Americans Aged 62 and Older (CPI-E), a price index for the elderly.

On average, people who had higher earnings over their lifetime live longer, so they would be most affected.", "However, older beneficiaries tend to have lower current income and to depend more on their Social Security benefits than younger groups. At advanced ages, most beneficiaries are no longer able to work, and many beneficiaries who had savings at retirement have depleted those savings. For the minority of the elderly with defined benefit pensions, the purchasing power of those payments generally declines over time because it is not usually indexed to inflation. As a result, poverty rates increase with age. Among beneficiaries aged 65 to 69, 5.7% were poor in 2012; the poverty rate for those 80 or older was 9.2%.", "As shown in Figure 2 , older beneficiaries depend more on their Social Security benefits than do younger ones.
