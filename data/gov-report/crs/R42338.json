As the meters multiply, so do issues concerning the privacy and security of the data collected by the new technology. This Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) promises to increase energy efficiency, bolster electric power grid reliability, and facilitate demand response, among other benefits. However, to fulfill these ends, smart meters must record near-real time data on consumer electricity usage and transmit the data to utilities over great distances via communications networks that serve the smart grid. Detailed electricity usage data offers a window into the lives of people inside of a home by revealing what individual appliances they are using, and the transmission of the data potentially subjects this information to interception or theft by unauthorized third parties or hackers.", "Unforeseen consequences under federal law may result from the installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them. This report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters. It begins with an examination of the constitutional provisions in the Fourth Amendment that may apply to the data. As we progress into the 21st century, access to personal data, including information generated from smart meters, is a new frontier for police investigations. The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to have probable cause to search an area in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, courts have used the third-party doctrine to deny protection to information a customer gives to a business as part of their commercial relationship. This rule is used by police to access bank records, telephone records, and traditional utility records. Nevertheless, there are several core differences between smart meters and the general third-party cases that may cause concerns about its application. These include concerns expressed by the courts and Congress about the ability of technology to potentially erode individuals' privacy.", "If smart meter data and transmissions fall outside of the protection of the Fourth Amendment, they may still be protected from unauthorized disclosure or access under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). These statutes, however, would appear to permit law enforcement to access smart meter data for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the SCA, ECPA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), subject to certain conditions. Additionally, an electric utility's privacy and security practices with regard to consumer data may be subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently focused its consumer protection enforcement on entities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect data from unauthorized access. This authority could apply to electric utilities in possession of smart meter data, provided that the FTC has statutory jurisdiction over them. General federal privacy safeguards provided under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (FPA) protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies, including data held by federally owned electric utilities.", "A companion report from CRS focusing on policy issues associated with smart grid cybersecurity, CRS Report R41886, The Smart Grid and Cybersecurity\u2014Regulatory Policy and Issues, by [author name scrubbed], is also available."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Smart meter technology is a key component of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) that will help the smart grid link the \"two-way flow of electricity with the two-way flow of information.\" Privacy and security concerns surrounding smart meter technology arise from the meters' essential functions, which include (1) recording near-real time data on consumer electricity usage; (2) transmitting this data to the smart grid using a variety of communications technologies; and (3) receiving communications from the smart grid, such as real-time energy prices or remote commands that can alter a consumer's electricity usage to facilitate demand response.", "Beneficial uses of AMI are developing rapidly, and like the early Internet, many applications remain unforeseen. At a basic level, smart meters will permit utilities to \"collect, measure, and analyze energy consumption data for grid management, outage notification, and billing purposes.\" The meters may increase energy efficiency by giving consumers greater control over their use of electricity, as well as permitting better integration of plug-in electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. They may also aid in the development of a more reliable electricity grid that is better equipped to withstand cyber attacks and natural disasters, and help to decrease peak demand for electricity. To be useful for these purposes, and many others, data recorded by smart meters must be highly detailed, and, consequently, it may show what individual appliances a consumer is using. The data must also be transmitted to electric utilities\u2014and possibly to third parties outside of the smart grid\u2014subjecting it to potential interception or theft as it travels over communications networks and is stored in a variety of physical locations. ", "These characteristics of smart meter data present privacy and security concerns that are likely to become more prevalent as government-backed initiatives expand deployment of the meters to millions of homes across the country. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Congress appropriated funds for the implementation of the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) program administered by the Department of Energy. This program now permits the federal government to reimburse up to 50% of eligible smart grid investments, which include the cost to electric utilities of buying and installing smart meters. In its annual report on smart meter deployment, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cited statistics showing that the SGIG program has helped fund the deployment of about 7.2 million meters as of September 2011. At completion, the program will have partially funded the installation of 15.5 million meters. By 2015, the Institute for Electric Efficiency expects that a total of 65 million smart meters will be in operation throughout the United States.", "Installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them may have unforeseen legal consequences for those who generate, seek, or use the data recorded by the meters. These consequences may arise under existing federal laws or constitutional provisions governing the privacy of electronic communications, data retention, computer misuse, foreign surveillance, and consumer protection. This report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters. It examines the legal implications of smart meter technology for consumers who generate the data, law enforcement officers who seek smart meter data from utilities, utilities that store the data, and hackers who access smart grid technology to steal consumer data or interfere with it. This report looks at federal laws that may pertain to the data when it is (1) stored in a utility-owned smart meter at a consumer's residence; (2) in transit between the meter and the smart grid by way of various communications technologies; and (3) stored on computers in the grid. This report does not address state or local laws, such as regulations by state Public Utilities Commissions, that may establish additional responsibilities for some electric utilities with regard to smart meter data. It also does not discuss the mandatory cybersecurity and reliability standards enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which impose obligations on utilities that participate in the generation or transmission of electricity.", "General federal privacy safeguards provided under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (FPA) protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies, including data held by federally owned electric utilities. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to bring enforcement proceedings against electric utilities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect meter data from unauthorized access, provided that the FTC has statutory jurisdiction over the utilities. ", "It is unclear how Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizures would apply to smart meter data, due to the lack of cases on this issue. However, depending upon the manner in which smart meter services are presented to consumers, smart meter data may be protected from unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). If smart meter data is protected by these statutes, law enforcement would still appear to have the ability to access it for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the SCA, ECPA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smart Meter Data: Privacy and Security Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Residential smart meters present privacy and cybersecurity issues that are likely to evolve with the technology. In 2010, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a report identifying some of these issues, which fall into two main categories: (1) privacy concerns that smart meters will reveal the activities of people inside of a home by measuring their electricity usage frequently over time; and (2) fears that inadequate cybersecurity measures surrounding the digital transmission of smart meter data will expose it to misuse by authorized and unauthorized users of the data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Detailed Information on Household Activities", "paragraphs": ["Smart meters offer a significantly more detailed illustration of a consumer's energy usage than regular meters. Traditional meters display data on a consumer's total electricity usage and are typically read manually once per month. In contrast, smart meters can provide near real-time usage data by measuring usage electronically at a much greater frequency, such as once every 15 minutes. Current smart meter technology allows utilities to measure usage as frequently as once every minute. By examining smart meter data, it is possible to identify which appliances a consumer is using and at what times of the day, because each type of appliance generates a unique electric load \"signature.\" NIST wrote in 2010 that \"research shows that analyzing 15-minute interval aggregate household energy consumption data can by itself pinpoint the use of most major home appliances.\" A report for the Colorado Public Utilities Commission discussed an Italian study that used \"artificial neural networks\" to identify individual \"heavy-load appliance uses\" with 90% accuracy using 15-minute interval data from a smart meter. Similarly, software-based algorithms would likely allow a person to extract the unique signatures of individual appliances from meter data that has been collected less frequently and is therefore less detailed.", "By combining appliance usage patterns, an observer could discern the behavior of occupants in a home over a period of time. For example, the data could show whether a residence is occupied, how many people live in it, and whether it is \"occupied by more people than usual.\" According to the Department of Energy, smart meters may be able to reveal occupants' \"daily schedules (including times when they are at or away from home or asleep), whether their homes are equipped with alarm systems, whether they own expensive electronic equipment such as plasma TVs, and whether they use certain types of medical equipment.\" Figure 1 , which appears in NIST's report on smart grid cybersecurity, shows how smart meter data could be used to decipher the activities of a home's occupants by matching data on their electricity usage with known appliance load signatures.", "Smart meter data that reveals which appliances a consumer is using has potential value for third parties, including the government. In the past, law enforcement agents have examined monthly electricity usage data from traditional meters in investigations of people they suspected of illegally growing marijuana. For example, in United States v. Kyllo , a federal agent subpoenaed the suspect's electricity usage records from the utility and \"compared the records to a spreadsheet for estimating average electrical use and concluded that Kyllo's electrical usage was abnormally high, indicating a possible indoor marijuana grow operation.\" If law enforcement officers obtained near-real time data on a consumer's electricity usage from the utility company, their ability to monitor household activities would be amplified significantly. For example, by observing when occupants use the most electricity, it may be possible to discern their daily schedules.", "As smart meter technology develops and usage data grows more detailed, it could also become more valuable to private third parties outside of the grid. Data that reveals which appliances a person is using could permit health insurance companies to determine whether a household uses certain medical devices, and appliance manufacturers to establish whether a warranty has been violated. Marketers could use it to make targeted advertisements. Criminals could use it to time a burglary and figure out which appliances they would like to steal. If a consumer owned a plug-in electric vehicle, data about where the vehicle has been charged could permit someone to identify a person's location and travel history.", "Even privacy safeguards, such as \"anonymizing\" data so that it does not reflect identity, are not foolproof. By comparing anonymous data with information available in the public domain, it is sometimes possible to identify an individual\u2014or, in the context of smart meter data, a particular household. Moreover, a smart grid will collect more than just electricity usage data. It will also store data on the account holder's name, service address, billing information, networked appliances in the home, and meter IP address, among other information. Many smart meters will also provide transactional records as they send data to the grid, which would show the time that the meter transmitted the data and the location or identity of the transmitter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Potential for Theft or Breach of Data", "paragraphs": ["Smart grid technology relies heavily on two-way communication to increase energy efficiency and reliability, including communication between smart meters and the utility (or other entity) that stores data for the grid. Many different technologies will transmit data to the grid, including \"traditional twisted-copper phone lines, cable lines, fiber optic cable, cellular, satellite, microwave, WiMAX, power line carrier, and broadband over power line.\" Of these communications platforms, wireless technologies are likely to play a \"prominent role\" because they present fewer safety concerns and cost less to implement than wireline technologies. According to the Department of Energy, a typical utility network has four \"tiers\" that collect and transmit data from the consumer to the utility. These include \"(1) the core backbone\u2014the primary path to the utility data center; (2) backhaul distribution\u2014the aggregation point for neighborhood data; (3) the access point\u2014typically the smart meter; and, (4) the HAN\u2014the home network.\" Energy usage data moves from the smart meter, and then to an \"aggregation point\" outside of the residence such as \"a substation, a utility pole-mounted device, or a communications tower.\" The aggregation points gather data from multiple meters and \"backhaul\" it to the utility using fiber, T1, microwave, or wireless technology. Utilities typically rely on their own private networks to communicate with smart meters because they have found these networks to be more reliable and less expensive than commercial networks.", "As NIST explains, consumer data moving through a smart grid becomes stored in many locations both within the grid and within the physical world. Thus, because it is widely dispersed, it becomes more vulnerable to interception by unauthorized parties and to accidental breach. The movement of data also increases the potential for it to be stolen by unauthorized third parties while it is in transit, particularly when it travels over a wireless network \u2014or through communications components that may be incompatible with one another or possess outdated security protections."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Smart Meters and the Fourth Amendment", "paragraphs": ["The use of smart meters presents the recurring conflict between law enforcement's need to effectively investigate and combat crime and our desire for privacy while in our homes. With smart meters, police will have access to data that might be used to track residents' daily lives and routines while in their homes, including their eating, sleeping, and showering habits, what appliances they use and when, and whether they prefer the television to the treadmill, among a host of other details. Though a potential boon to police, access to this data is not limitless. The Fourth Amendment, which establishes the constitutional parameters for government investigations, may restrict access to smart meter data or establish rules by which it can be obtained. The Fourth Amendment ensures that the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\" This section discusses whether the collection and use of smart meter data may contravene this protection. Although there is no Fourth Amendment case on point, analogous cases may provide guidance. ", "To assess whether there has been a Fourth Amendment violation, two primary questions must be asked: (1) whether there was state action; that is, was there sufficient government involvement in the alleged wrongdoing to trigger the Fourth Amendment; and (2) whether the person had an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to deem reasonable. If the first question is answered in the affirmative, then the analysis moves to the second question. But if no state action is found, the analysis ends there and the Fourth Amendment does not apply. This subpart will first determine whether access to smart meter data by police, or by privately and publicly owned utilities, satisfies the state action doctrine, thereby warranting further Fourth Amendment review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Action: Privately Versus Publicly Owned Utilities", "paragraphs": ["Most of the safeguards for civil liberties and individual rights contained in the U.S. Constitution apply only to actions by state and federal governments. This rule, known as the state action doctrine, arises when a victim claims his constitutional rights have been violated, and therefore must prove the wrongdoer had sufficient connections with the government to warrant a remedy. Applying the state action test is intended to determine whether a utility's collection and dissemination of smart meter data is governed by the Fourth Amendment, and if so, to what extent. Although there are many variations in the governance and ownership of utilities\u2014some are privately owned, others publicly owned, some federally operated, and still others nonprofit cooperatives\u2014they generally fall into two broad categories: public and private. This section will analyze the constitutional differences between privately and publicly owned utilities under the state action doctrine and a public records theory."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Privately Owned and Operated Utilities", "paragraphs": ["It is broadly said that the Fourth Amendment applies only to acts by the government. But there are at least two exceptions to this rule. First, if a utility performs a function traditionally exercised by the government, it may be considered a state actor under the public function exception. Second, the Fourth Amendment may apply when a private utility acts as an instrument or agent of the police. ", "Under the public function exception, a nominally private entity is treated as a state actor when it assumes a role traditionally played by the government. Determining when this exception applies has not proved easy, but it is reasonably clear that private utilities do not, in most instances, satisfy it. In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. , a customer sued a privately owned utility under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 for improperly shutting off her service without providing her notice or a hearing. The Supreme Court asked whether there was a close enough nexus between the state and the utility for the acts of the latter to be treated as those of the former. Although the utility was heavily regulated by the state, it was held not to be a state actor. The Court reasoned that the provision of utility service is not generally an \"exclusive prerogative of the State.\" Also absent was the symbiotic relationship between the utility and the state found in previous cases. Though its holding was broad, the Court did not foreclose the possibility that a privately owned utility could be a state actor under different circumstances. This possibility, however, appears narrow.", "The Fourth Amendment may also apply to a private utility if its acts were directed by the government. Generally, searches performed by private actors without police participation or encouragement are not governed by the Fourth Amendment. A search by a private insurance investigator, for instance, was not a \"search\" in the constitutional sense, though the evidence was ultimately used by the government at trial. This result differs, however, if there is sufficient government involvement. If the search has been ordered or requested by the government, the private actor will become an \"instrument or agent of the state\" and must abide by Fourth Amendment strictures. For example, the Fourth Amendment does not apply when a telephone company installs a pen register on its own initiative. The same action constitutes a search, however, if requested by the government. ", "This theory applies not only to direct instigation, but also on a broad, programmatic level. In the 1960s and 1970s the federal government required privately owned and operated airlines to institute new security measures to combat airline hijacking. In United States v. Davis , the airline searched a passenger based on these requirements and found a loaded gun. The Ninth Circuit held that it made no difference whether the search was conducted by a private or public official: \"the search was part of the overall, nation-wide anti-hijacking effort, and constituted 'state action' for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\" Thus, if a private party is required to perform a search or collect data under federal or state laws or regulations, there will be sufficient state action for the Fourth Amendment to apply. Or, put another way, the government cannot circumvent the Fourth Amendment by requiring a private party to initiate a search or implement an investigative program.", "This agency theory might apply to the collection of smart meter data. If the utility is accessing this information \"independent of the government's intent to collect evidence for use in a criminal prosecution,\" the utility will not be considered an agent of the government for Fourth Amendment purposes. But there might be instances when government instigation will trigger further analysis. If, for example, the government requested the utility to record larger quantities of data than was customary (e.g., increasing the intervals from sub-15 minute intervals to sub-five minute or sub-one minute intervals), this would likely warrant Fourth Amendment scrutiny. Also, if the police requested the utility to hand over customer data, say, for spikes in energy commensurate with a marijuana growing operation, this would likely be a sufficient instigation to trigger further constitutional review. Other situations may arise where the government establishes a dragnet-type law enforcement scheme in which all smart meter data is filtered through police computers. This could also implicate the agency theory and warrant a finding of state action. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Publicly Owned and Operated Utilities", "paragraphs": ["Although the Fourth Amendment (with its warrant and probable cause requirement) typically applies to public actors, in certain instances their collection of information may not fall under the Fourth Amendment or may prompt a lower evidentiary standard. The Supreme Court has infrequently considered the scope of the Fourth Amendment \"on the conduct of government officials in noncriminal investigations,\" and even less frequently as to \"noncriminal noninvestigatory governmental conduct.\" Nonetheless, there are two lines of cases that may apply to smart meters in which the Fourth Amendment may not apply at all (noncriminal noninvestigatory conduct) or may be reduced (noncriminal investigations). The key to this analysis is the government's purpose in collecting the data.", "The Supreme Court has developed a line of cases dubbed the \"special needs\" doctrine that permits the government to perform suspicionless searches if the special needs supporting the program outweigh the intrusion on the individual's privacy. It is premised on the notion that \"'special needs,' beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.\" If, on the one hand, the objective of the search is not for law enforcement purposes but for other reasons such as public safety or ensuring the integrity of sensitive government positions, then the doctrine will apply. If, however, the \"primary purpose\" or \"immediate objective\" was \"to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes ,\" then application of the special needs doctrine is not appropriate, and the government must adhere to general Fourth Amendment principles. Again, the primary inquiry is the purpose of the search. ", "Some circuit courts of appeal have extended the special needs theory, holding that the Fourth Amendment does not apply (in contrast to a reduced standard of suspicion as with the special needs cases) unless the \"conduct has as its purpose the intention to elicit a benefit for the government in either its investigative or administrative capacities.\" In United States v. Attson , the Ninth Circuit held that the collection of blood by a government-employed physician, which was subsequently used by the police in a drunk driving prosecution, was not within the scope of Fourth Amendment protection. The panel reasoned that the doctor drew the blood for medical purposes, not to further a governmental purpose in obtaining evidence against the defendant in its criminal investigation, so the Fourth Amendment did not apply. ", "Applying these two theories to smart meters, a court would focus on the publicly owned utility's purpose in collecting the data. If it were for ordinary business purposes such as billing, informing the customer of its usage patterns, or aiding the utility in making the grid more energy-efficient, then it would not violate the Fourth Amendment. If, however, the public utility began aggregating data at the request of a law enforcement agency, with the purpose of aiding a criminal investigation or other administrative purpose, the Fourth Amendment would seemingly apply. As with private utilities, if the government requested that the public utility report any suspicious electricity usage, or created a program where certain data was regularly transmitted to the police, this might become investigatory and warrant Fourth Amendment protections. It appears law enforcement cannot evade Fourth Amendment restrictions by requesting a publicly owned utility to collect data for it. ", "Law enforcement might also request smart meter data under a public records theory. It is generally accepted that public records are not accorded Fourth Amendment protection. Unless there is a state or federal statute prohibiting disclosure, \"law enforcement access to state public records is unrestricted.\" Thus the inquiry hinges on whether a document is a public record. Whether a person's utility records are public records differs from state to state. Some states deem records of a municipally owned and operated electric utility as public records open for public inspection, while others have accorded these records statutory and constitutional protections.", "In Florida, for example, records kept in connection with the operation of a city-operated utility are considered public records. A similar policy applies in Georgia, where all records of a government agency, including utility records, must be open for inspection. South Carolina, too, takes a similar approach. It is not clear, however, from the reported cases whether these statutes permit access to personally identifiable information or simply operating records of the utility. Oklahoma is more explicit, permitting access to \"records of the address, rate paid for services, charges, consumption rates, adjustments to the bill, reasons for adjustment, the name of the person that authorized the adjustment, and payment for each customer.\" Oklahoma does protect some confidentiality, including \"credit information, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, social security numbers, [and] bank account information for individual customers.\" Other states, like Washington, specifically protect personally identifiable utility records. Washington does not require a showing of probable cause, but instead \"a reasonable belief\" that the record will help establish the customer committed a crime. North Carolina likewise states that any \"[b]illing information compiled and maintained by a city or county or other public entity providing utility services in connection with the ownership or operation of a public enterprise\" is not a public record. ", "Determining whether a utility is a state actor or whether smart meter data is a public record are merely threshold matters. A finding that an entity is a state actor or data is public does not foreclose law enforcement's ability to retrieve customer smart meter data, but instead activates the next step of Fourth Amendment analysis: whether the government invaded a reasonable expectation of privacy. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Smart Meter Data", "paragraphs": ["Under the modern conception of the Fourth Amendment, the government may not intrude into an area in which a person has an actual expectation of privacy that society would consider reasonable. In the case of smart meter data, the government presumably seeks records in the custody of third-party utilities on the energy use at a specific home. However, a significant body of cases has refused to recognize constitutionally protected privacy interests in information provided by customers to businesses as part of their commercial relationships. This theory, the third-party doctrine, permits police access to the telephone numbers a person dials and to a person's bank documents, free from Fourth Amendment constraints.", "There are two relevant differences, however, between smart meters and the traditional third-party cases that may warrant a shift in approach. First is the possible judicial unease with the notion that advancement of technology threatens to erode further the constitutional protection of privacy. From that perspective, as technology progresses, society faces an ever-increasing risk that an individual's activities will be monitored by the government. This is coupled with the concern that the breadth and granularity of personal information that new technology affords provide a far more intimate picture of an individual than the more limited snapshots available through prior technologies. Do the richness and scope of new information technologies warrant increased constitutional scrutiny? ", "Second, smart meters can convey information about the activities that occur inside the home, an area singled out for specific textual protection in the Fourth Amendment and one deeply ingrained in Anglo-Saxon law. Even when the Court declared that \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,\" ostensibly shifting away from a property-based conception of the Fourth Amendment, it has still carved out special protections for the home. However, concomitant with the increased use of technology in our private lives is increased exposure of our private activities, including those conducted in the home. Commonly, we share more personal information, even as our concerns grow that more individuals, businesses, and others can glean more information about our personal lives as a matter of course. As with technology generally, does the fact that more of our lives are becoming \"public\" call for lesser or greater constitutional protection, and how does a \"reasonable expectation\"-based model continue to apply in a technologically intensive society?", "This subpart will first look at the third-party doctrine as it is commonly conceived by the courts. Then it will discuss whether there are sufficient differences between the use of smart meters and traditional third-party cases to counsel against its application."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Third-Party Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["Traditionally, there has been no Fourth Amendment protection for information a consumer gives to business as part of their business dealings. This doctrine dates back to the secret agent cases, in which any words uttered to another person, including a government agent or informant, were not covered by the Fourth Amendment. It was later extended to business records, giving police access to documents such as telephone records, bank records, motel registration records, and cell phone records. The Supreme Court has reasoned that the customers assume the risk that the information could be handed over to government authorities, and also that they consent to such access. Some lower courts have applied this theory to traditional analog utility meters. This section discusses the possible application of the third-party doctrine to smart meters.", "In Miller v. United States , agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) subpoenaed several banks for records pertaining to the defendant, including copies of the defendant's checks, deposit slips, and financial statements. The defendant moved to suppress the records at trial, arguing that a warrantless retrieval of the bank records (his \"private papers\") was an intrusion into an area protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Court disagreed, broadly declaring \"the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third-party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if it is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third-party will not be betrayed.\" The Court further noted that \"the depositor takes the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the information will be conveyed by that person to the Government.\"", "Three years later, the Court extended the third-party doctrine to outgoing numbers dialed from a person's telephone. In Smith v. Maryland , the defendant robbed a woman and began making obscene phone calls to her. Suspecting Smith placed the calls, the police used a pen register to track the telephone numbers dialed from his phone. The police failed to obtain a warrant or subpoena before installing the pen register. The register revealed that Smith was in fact making the phone calls to the woman. In denying Smith's motion to suppress, the Court relied on the third-party doctrine, stating that \"this Court consistently has held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\" As applied to the telephone context, the Court found that \"[w]hen he used his phone, [Smith] voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company and 'exposed' that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business. In so doing, [Smith] assumed the risk that the company would reveal to police the numbers he dialed.\"", "Traditionally, utility records have been handled similarly to bank records and telephone records. Several lower federal courts have held that customers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their utility records, thereby permitting warrantless access to these records. In United States v. Starkweather , the Ninth Circuit held that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his utility records. The panel reasoned that (1) these records were no different from phone records, and thus did not justify a different constitutional result; and (2) the public was aware that such records were regularly maintained, thereby negating any expectation of privacy. The Eighth Circuit has also upheld warrantless police access to utility records in United States v. McIntyre . The Eighth Circuit panel distinguished Kyllo , declaring that the means of obtaining the information in Kyllo (a thermal-imaging device) was significantly more intrusive than simply subpoenaing the records from the utility company. The court held that \"the means to obtaining the information is legally significant.\" Likewise, the court in United States v. Hamilton held that the means of obtaining power records from a third-party by way of administrative subpoena as opposed to \"intrusion on the home by 'sense enhancing technology'\" is \"legally significant,\" removing this type of situation from the Kyllo -home privacy line of cases into the Miller -third-party line.", "It is difficult to predict whether a court would extend this traditional third-party analysis to smart meters. The courts may seek to ensure the predictability and stability of the third-party doctrine generally and administration of utility services specifically, thus requiring a bright-line rule for all third-party circumstances. There is an advantage to a rule that is easy to apply, that allows utilities to better govern their affairs, and does not permit \"savvy wrongdoers [to] use third-party services in a tactical way to enshroud the entirety of their crimes in zones of Fourth Amendment protection.\" However, there are three overarching considerations embodied in the use of smart meters that might weigh against the application of traditional third-party analysis. These include (a) a person's expectation of privacy while at home; (b) the breadth and granularity of private information conveyed by smart meters; (c) the lack of a voluntary assumption of the risk or consent to release of this data.

In no uncertain terms the Court has asserted that \"[a]t the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable government intrusion.\" Even as technology advances\u2014whether a tracking or thermal-imaging device or something new\u2014the Court has maintained this bulwark. Because of the significance of the home, access to smart meter data may prompt a doctrinal shift away from the third-party doctrine. Several home privacy cases shed light on this possible approach.", "In Kyllo v. United States , the Court had to decide whether the use of a thermal-imaging device from the outside of a home that detected the amount of heat coming from inside the home was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In Kyllo , an agent of the Department of the Interior suspected Danny Kyllo was growing marijuana in his home with the use of high-intensity lamps. The agent used a thermal imager to scan the outside of Kyllo's apartment to determine if he was using these \"grow\" lamps. Thermal imagers can detect energy emitting from the outside surface of an object. When scanning the home, the thermal imager produced an image with various shades of black, white, or gray\u2014the shades darker or lighter depending on the warmth of the area being scanned. From the passenger seat of his car, the agent scanned Kyllo's home for several minutes. From his scan, he determined that the area over the garage and one side of his home were relatively hot compared to neighboring homes. Based on utility bills, informant tips, and the results of thermal imaging, the agents obtained a warrant to search Kyllo's home. As suspected, inside the home the agents found a marijuana growing operation, including over 100 plants.", "Justice Scalia first posited that \"with very few exceptions, the question whether a warrantless search of the home is reasonable must be answered no.\" Searches of the home were historically analyzed under the common law doctrine of trespass, but during the mid-20 th century the Court instead anchored the Fourth Amendment to a conception of privacy. While this test may be difficult to apply in the context of automobiles, telephone booths, or other public areas, it is made easier when concerning the home:", "In the case of the search of the interior of homes\u2014the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy\u2014there is a ready criterion, with deep roots in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that exists , and that is acknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. ", "The Court ultimately held that \"obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area constitutes a search\u2014at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use.\" Kyllo affirmed the notion that \"an expectation of privacy in activities taking place inside the home is presumptively reasonable.\"", "The Court also protected home privacy by prohibiting the monitoring of the location of a beeper while inside a residence. In United States v. Karo , with the consent of a government informant the police attached a beeper to the false bottom of a can of ether, which was sold to Karo. The can of ether was transported between several residences and storage facilities. The police used the beeper to monitor the location of the can several times while it was located inside of the residences. The Court was asked to determine \"whether the monitoring of a beeper in a private residence, a location not open to visual surveillance, violates Fourth Amendment rights of those who have a justifiable interest in the privacy of the residence.\" The Court answered in the affirmative. ", "The Court reiterated the long-standing notion that \"private residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by a warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.\" Unless there are exigent circumstances, \"searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable....\" The Court ultimately held that the warrantless monitoring of the beeper in the home was a Fourth Amendment violation.", "Kyllo and Karo demonstrate that the Supreme Court \"has defended the home as a sacred site at the 'core of the Fourth Amendment.'\" Although neither the Supreme Court nor any lower federal court has ruled on the use of smart meters, a few propositions can be deduced from Kyllo and Karo bearing on this question.", "Because smart meters allow law enforcement to access information regarding intimate details occurring inside the home, a highly invasive investigation that could not otherwise be performed without intrusion into the home, a court may require a warrant to access this data. In Kyllo , the police merely obtained the relative temperatures of a house, and in Karo the police only generally located the beeper in the house. Although this information was limited, the Court nonetheless prohibited such investigatory techniques. Smart meters have the potential to produce significantly more information than that derived in Kyllo and Karo , including what individual appliances we are using; whether our house is empty or occupied; and when we take our daily shower or bath. Further, a look at Figure 1 , supra , makes it clear that this level of information is much more intimate than prior technologies used by law enforcement. This depth of intrusion suggests that customers may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in smart meter data.", "There is also a question whether smart meters are in \"general public use.\" (The police must use technology not in general public use for Kyllo to apply.) Unfortunately, the Court provided no criterion for making this determination. Several courts applying this test have held that night vision goggles were in general public use. One federal district court reasoned that the goggles were regularly used by the military and police and could be found on the Internet, so were considered in general public use. In 2009, the Department of Energy estimated that 4.75% of all electric meters were smart meters. The department projects that by 2012 approximately 52 million more meters will be installed. With little guidance on this issue, it is uncertain whether this jump in numbers would elevate smart meters into the general public use category.", "The means by which data is gathered also differentiates the thermal-imaging in Kyllo from smart meters. In Kyllo , the police independently gathered the information using the thermal imager; an agent went outside Kyllo's house and used the thermal imager himself. With smart meters, the utility company compiles the information and the police subpoena the company for the data. This difference in means was material in one lower court analyzing access to traditional utility data. It is not clear whether this difference advises against application of Kyllo here."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mosaic and Dragnet Theories", "paragraphs": ["The second factor guiding against the application of the third-party doctrine is composed of two interconnected theories: the mosaic and dragnet theories. The mosaic theory is grounded in the idea that surveillance of the whole of one's activities over a prolonged period is substantially more invasive than a look at each item in isolation. In the case of smart meters, this is the difference between knowing a person's monthly energy usage, and being able to discern a person's daily activities with considerable accuracy. This theory intersects with dragnet-styled law enforcement techniques in which the police cast a wide surveillance net, taking in a wealth of personal information with the goal of finding criminal activity among the stream of data. ", "Although the Supreme Court has never formally adopted the mosaic theory, there seems to be a ready-made majority potentially willing to consider it. In United States v. Jones , the police used a GPS tracking device to track Jones's movements for almost a month. The majority, led by Justice Scalia, held that attaching a GPS device on a vehicle for the purpose of collecting information constituted a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment. The physical intrusion, rather than a Katz -type invasion of privacy, was the lynchpin of the decision. Justices Alito and Sotomayor both agreed that this was a search, but on different grounds. Both discussed an adaptation of the mosaic theory as prohibiting police from tracking a person for an extended period of time. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Kagan, assumed that a short-term search would not violate the Fourth Amendment, but that \"the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy.\" Likewise, Justice Sotomayor agreed with this \"incisive\" observation, noting that \"GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\" Both of these comments closely mirror those of the opinion below, which relied on the mosaic theory: \"A person who knows all of another's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups\u2014and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.\"", "Although the Jones majority did not embrace the mosaic theory, the concurrences demonstrate that five justices are flirting with the idea. These arguments resemble those made against the unfettered use of smart meter data. With smart meters, police would have a rich source of personal data that reveals far more about a person than traditional analog meters. Understanding a person's daily activities, including what appliances he is using, is a far leap from knowing his monthly energy usage. This is the difference between knowing about a single trip a person took and monitoring his movements over a month-long period. The breadth and granularity of the smart meter data may be seen as warranting application of the mosaic theory and may perhaps find receptive ears on the Court.", "Additionally, the dragnet theory may apply to collection of energy usage data. This theory states that surveillance normally permitted under the Fourth Amendment\u2014such as monitoring a person's movements on a public street\u2014becomes an impermissible invasion of privacy when conducted on a prolonged, 24-hour basis. \"If such dragnet-type law enforcement practices as respondent envisions should eventually occur,\" Justice Rehnquist asserted earlier in United States v. Knotts , \"there will be time enough then to determine whether different constitutional principles may be applicable.\" Twenty-four hour access to our intimate daily activities, including what appliances we use, when we take our daily shower or bath, eat, and sleep, may push smart meters into the dragnet category.", "Coinciding with the mosaic and dragnet theories is the difference in sophistication and the quantity of the data revealed between traditional third-party cases and smart meters. Comparing Smith with Katz provides insight into this distinction. Pen registers, as used in Smith , have \"limited capabilities\"\u2014they can only record the numbers dialed from a phone. In comparison, in Katz the police listened to the contents of Katz's phone call\u2014the actual words spoken. In noting this distinction, it seems the Smith Court, in permitting the use of pen registers, intentionally limited its holding to the discrete set of data conveyed\u2014the telephone numbers dialed. Smart meters, to the contrary, have the potential to collect and aggregate precise detail about the activities inside the home. It is more than one packet of data, but reveals minute-by-minute activity, something far more revealing, and arguably more like Katz than Smith .

Assumption of the risk and consent are the two leading theories supporting the third-party doctrine. In United States v. Miller , the customer \"assumed the risk\" that the bank would turn over the bank records to government authorities. That was a risk he took in doing business with the bank. As to the consent theory, one commentator asked and answered the question as follows: \"When does a person's choice to disclose information to a third-party constitute consent to a search? So long as a person knows that they are disclosing information to a third-party, their choice to do so is voluntary and the consent valid.\"", "With banking or telephone services, a customer has the option of transferring his business to another bank or another telephone carrier. To the contrary, because electric utilities are essentially monopolies, the customer cannot simply switch services. The only way to avoid the recordation of his electric usage is to terminate his utility service altogether, an impracticable option in modern society. As one state court has noted:", "Electricity, even more than telephone service, is a \"necessary component\" of modern life, pervading every aspect of an individual's business and personal life: it heats our homes, powers our appliances, and lights our nights. A requirement of receiving this service is the disclosure to the power company (and in this case an agent of the state) of one's identity and the amount of electricity being used. The nature of electrical service requires the disclosure of this information, but that disclosure is only for the limited business purpose of obtaining the service. ", "It is not clear whether assumption of the risk or consent should apply to smart meters. It is reasonable to assume that customers understand utility companies must collect usage data to bill the customer for that usage. Customers receive their statement each month demonstrating this fact. However, most customers are probably not familiar with the sophistication of smart meters and the detailed data sets that can be derived from them. Even if customers are aware their utility usage can be recorded in sub-fifteen minute intervals, a reasonable customer would probably be surprised, if not shocked, to know that data from smart meters can potentially be used to pinpoint the usage of specific appliances. If knowledge of the sophistication of the data is a prerequisite to assumption of the risk or consent, it is difficult to say whether a reasonable customer would understand the privacy implications with this new technology.", "Because smart meters are an emerging technology not yet judicially tested, it is difficult to conclude with certainty how they would be handled under the Fourth Amendment. Further, beyond the possible constitutional implications of smart meters, federal communication and privacy statutes may also apply.

Additionally, the statute provides that interception under the procedures and exceptions set forth in ECPA, or pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, are the exclusive means for intercepting electronic communications. The unlawful interception of electronic communications in violation of ECPA is generally punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 for individuals and not more than $500,000 for organizations.", "Of particular relevance to the immediate discussion is the fact that ECPA permits interception of an electronic communication where a party to the communication has consented to such interception. In the context of a smart meter network that is the subject of this report, it appears that the utility would be a party to all of the communication sent by the smart meters, since it is primarily receiving that information for its own billing purposes. Therefore, if the utility consents to law enforcement's interception of the traffic which is addressed to it, that surveillance would not appear to violate the prohibitions in ECPA. ", "ECPA also provides a procedural mechanism for law enforcement to conduct surveillance activities for investigative purposes without the consent of any party to the communication. The statute limits the types of criminal cases in which electronic surveillance may be used and requires court orders authorizing electronic surveillance to be supported by probable cause to believe that the target is engaged in criminal activities, that normal investigative techniques are insufficient, and that the facilities that are the subject of surveillance will be used by the target. It also limits the use and dissemination of information intercepted. In addition, when an interception order expires, authorities must notify those whose communications have been intercepted. Law enforcement may also conduct electronic surveillance when acting in an emergency situation pending issuance of a court order.

FISA governs the gathering of information about foreign powers, including international terrorist organizations, and agents of foreign powers. Although it is often discussed in relation to the prevention of terrorism, it applies to the gathering of foreign intelligence information for other purposes. Although some exceptions apply, such as for emergency situations, the government typically must obtain a court order, supported by probable cause, from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a neutral judicial decision maker, in order to conduct electronic surveillance pursuant to FISA.

These transmissions would seem to fall neatly within the SCA's definition of an electronic communication. Therefore, whether a smart meter network would qualify as an ECS would likely depend on whether the deployed smart meters could be said to be providing this ability to users. ", "It is not clear whether it would be accurate to categorically describe smart meters as providing customers with \"the ability to send or receive\" communications. It could be argued that a utility customer would use the smart meter to transmit usage information to the utility, in the same way that the same customer uses a traditional meter to record household electricity usage over a billing period. However, the Ninth Circuit has suggested that an ECS should not include situations in which electronic communications are used only \"as an incident to providing some other service, as is the case with a street-front shop that requires potential customers to speak into an intercom device before permitting entry, or a 'drive-thru' restaurant that allows customers to place orders via a two-way intercom located beside the drive-up lane.\" On one hand, it may not be accurate to describe utility customers as users of smart meters at all, particularly if the deployment of such smart meters is intended principally for the benefit of the utility and does not change the experience of utility customers. On the other hand, some of the proposed uses of deployed smart meters may include using collected data for the benefit of the customers, for example by determining the energy efficiency of specific household appliances. As a result, the ultimate classification of a particular smart meter network as an ECS may depend largely on the specific facts present, such as the manner in which it is marketed, or the ostensible purposes for which the transmissions are intended to be used.

Therefore, one must first determine whether, and under what circumstances, the data collected by a smart meter network is in electronic storage in order to determine what protections apply.

As applied to the smart meter network, data residing on the smart meter itself prior to being sent to the utility would appear to be in electronic storage, as such storage is likely temporary and undertaken solely in anticipation of some eventual transmission to the utility. In contrast, once the data has arrived at the utility and resides on its servers, it may no longer be in temporary or intermediate storage. However, some form of the communications may still be being held for backup purposes, and in such a case might be considered in electronic storage under the statute. To the extent that the data would be considered in electronic storage, either while on the meter or on the utility's computers, the data would appear to be subject to the SCA's provisions applicable to providers of ECS.

Criminal penalties for violating the SCA's prohibitions on unauthorized access start at imprisonment for not more than one year (not more than five years for a subsequent conviction) and/or a fine of not more than $100,000.

However, the statute also permits certain disclosures to law enforcement. Such permitted disclosures by a provider of electronic communication services to law enforcement can be either voluntary or compelled. Normally, voluntary disclosure to law enforcement is authorized only if the contents of the communication were inadvertently obtained by the service provider and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime. However, it should be noted that the utility in this case appears to be the intended recipient of all communications sent over the smart meter network, and the SCA's restrictions on disclosures of electronically stored information held by ECS or RCS providers may generally be overcome if an intended recipient of the communication consents to the disclosure. Consequently, the utility may have more latitude to share communications in electronic storage with law enforcement than a traditional provider of ECS, such as a telephone company, would have.", "For purposes of compelled disclosures to law enforcement, the SCA distinguishes between recent communications and those that have been in electronic storage for more than 180 days. A search warrant is required to compel providers to disclose communications held in electronic storage for 180 days or less. However, communications held for more than 180 days may be obtained by law enforcement through a warrant, subpoena, or a court order supported by specific and articulable facts sufficient to establish reasonable grounds to believe that the contents are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. Customers whose communications have been disclosed are generally required to be given notice of such disclosure, but such disclosure may be delayed if notification might result in endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; flight from prosecution; destruction of or tampering with evidence; intimidation of potential witnesses; or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remote Computing Services", "paragraphs": ["It is likely that the classification of a smart meter network as an RCS would similarly be fact-dependent.

More recently, the Commission has asserted jurisdiction over state government agencies that regulate certain professions such as dentistry, optometry, and funeral services. ", "There appears to be only one court case that engages in a full discussion and interpretation of the meaning of \"persons\" under Section 5. In California State Board of Optometry v. FTC , the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals considered \"whether a State acting in its sovereign capacity is a 'person' within the FTC's enforcement jurisdiction.\" The FTC had issued a rule declaring \"certain state laws restricting the practice of optometry to be unfair acts or practices.\" Petitioners, which were state boards of optometry and professional associations, argued that the court should strike down the rule because it went beyond the FTC's statutory authority. In vacating the rule, the court found nothing in the relevant provisions of the FTC Act \"to indicate that Congress intended to authorize the FTC to reach the 'acts or practices' of States acting in their sovereign capacities.\"", "A court approaching the question of whether \"persons\" includes publicly owned utilities would start with the language of the statute. Courts traditionally give broad deference to an agency when the agency interprets the extent of its own jurisdiction unless the reach of its jurisdiction is clear from reading the statute \"under ordinary principles of construction.\" Attempting to discern the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 5 of the FTC Act is difficult, as the statute does not define the term \"persons\" for the purposes of that provision.

In Section 5, Congress listed the terms \"persons,\" \"partnerships,\" and \"corporations\" separately, which indicates that it intended to give each term independent significance. The terms \"corporations\" and \"partnerships\" would not have independent meaning in Section 5 if the term \"persons\" in Section 5 included the entities listed in the Dictionary Act. Furthermore, the FTC Act requires that \"corporations\" be organized for their own profit or the profit of their members in order for the FTC to exercise jurisdiction over them\u2014a requirement it does not impose on the other entities. By reading the term \"persons\" to include the entities listed in the Dictionary Act, the FTC could evade this additional requirement simply by bringing its complaint against an entity as a \"person\" rather than a \"corporation\"\u2014a result that Congress probably did not intend. Thus, a court that ended its analysis here could find that the meaning of \"persons\" remains ambiguous. The court could then choose to defer to the FTC's broad interpretation of its own jurisdiction under the Supreme Court's decision in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc.", "The California Optometry court, however, declined to defer to the FTC's interpretation of its own jurisdiction because it found that principles of federalism outweighed Chevron deference. Quoting the Supreme Court's decision in Will v. Michigan Department of State Police , the California Optometry court stated that \"in common usage, the term person does not include the sovereign, and statutes employing the word are ordinarily construed to exclude it.\" In the Will case, the Court considered whether the term \"person\" as it appeared in 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 included a state. The Court held that it did not, invoking the principles of federalism when it wrote that \"[t]his approach is particularly applicable where it is claimed that Congress has subjected the States to liability to which they had not been subject before.\" The Court found that the statute's language fell \"far short of satisfying the ordinary rule of statutory construction that if Congress intends to alter the 'usual constitutional balance between the States and Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so 'unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.'\"", "The Court's decision in Will , as interpreted by the D.C. Circuit in California Optometry , suggests that Congress must clearly indicate in a particular statute when it wishes to subject states to a new form of liability, particularly when this would change the balance between state and federal authority by intruding on the actions a state takes in its sovereign capacity. There does not appear to be a clear indication that Congress intended the word \"persons\" in the FTC Act to subject publicly owned utilities to FTC enforcement actions. Thus, if the FTC's enforcement of Section 5 against a publicly owned utility would alter the balance between the state and federal governments, a court might read \"persons\" to exclude these utilities. As the California Optometry court indicated, whether the balance is altered may depend on whether the operation of the utility amounts to the state acting in its sovereign capacity (balance altered) or merely engaging in a proprietary function (balance not altered). The California Optometry court suggested that whether a state is acting in its sovereign capacity or engaging in a proprietary function may vary according to the antitrust laws' state action doctrine, a multi-pronged analysis that is beyond the scope of this report. If a court found that the state was acting in its sovereign capacity when the state (or one of its subdivisions) operated an electric utility, the court could hold that the FTC does not have Section 5 jurisdiction because of the federalism principles and clear statement rule that guided the interpretation of the statute in Will and were adopted by the court in California Optometry .", "A third possible choice for a court would be to adopt the reasoning of the FTC and find that Congress clearly intended \"persons\" to include government entities, because under the other antitrust laws, the term \"persons\" includes state and local government entities, and the antitrust laws, including the FTC Act, should be read together. The California Optometry court acknowledged this argument, writing that \"several Supreme Court decisions hold that a State is a person for purposes of the antitrust laws.\" The court ultimately rejected the argument, however, because it found that \"when a State acts in a sovereign rather than a proprietary capacity, it is exempt from the antitrust laws even though those actions may restrain trade,\" and that this state action doctrine may \"limit the reach of the FTC's enforcement jurisdiction.\" Thus, if a court found that a state acted in its proprietary capacity when the state (or one of its subdivisions) operated a public utility, then the state action doctrine would not apply, and it would be possible for a court to find jurisdiction even under the California Optometry case. The FTC has advanced this reasoning, arguing that the state boards over which it asserts jurisdiction do not amount to the states acting in their sovereign capacities. Whether the operation of a particular publicly owned utility consists of the state acting in its sovereign capacity or engaging in a proprietary function may vary according to the antitrust laws' state action doctrine, a multi-pronged analysis that is beyond the scope of this report.", "Thus, whether a court would find that the word \"persons\" in Section 5 includes certain government entities such as publicly owned utilities is unclear because it may depend on which, if any, of several principles of statutory construction the court adopts. A court could, among other options: (1) find that the meaning of \"persons\" in Section 5 is ambiguous, and thus defer to the FTC's broad interpretation of its own jurisdiction because of the Chevron doctrine; (2) find that the statute is ambiguous, but that principles of federalism outweigh the court's usual Chevron deference to the Commission's interpretation of its own jurisdiction\u2014a determination that may require a court to find that the state is acting in its sovereign capacity when the state (or one of its subdivisions) operates an electric utility; or (3) find that Congress clearly intended \"persons\" to include government entities because Section 5 should be read together with the other antitrust laws, under which the term \"person\" includes state and local government entities\u2014a determination that may require a court to find that the state is performing a proprietary function when the state (or one of its subdivisions) operates a utility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federally Owned Utilities", "paragraphs": ["It is unclear whether the FTC could enforce Section 5 against a federally owned utility.

As the EIA notes, \"federal power is not sold for profit, but to recover the costs of operations and repay the Treasury for funds borrowed to construct generation and transmission facilities.\" If the Commission characterizes these utilities as \"persons,\" it is unclear whether a court would find that this term includes government entities.", "As a practical matter, FTC enforcement of Section 5 against federally owned utilities is probably unnecessary in the context of smart meter data because of other federal laws, such as the Privacy Act, that would likely protect this data when it is stored in records systems maintained by federal agencies, including federally owned utilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cooperatively Owned Utilities", "paragraphs": ["For-profit electric cooperatives would clearly fall within the Commission's Section 5 jurisdiction over \"corporations\" operated for their own profit or that of their members.

However, it appears that most electric cooperatives\u2014and particularly the cooperatives that will receive funds under the Department of Energy's Smart Grid Investment Grant program\u2014are nonprofits.

These distribution utilities are owned by the \"consumers they serve,\" and those that are tax-exempt must \"provide electric service to their members at cost, as that term is defined by the Internal Revenue Service.\" However, when the activities of a cooperative result in revenues that exceed the cooperative's costs, these \"net margins ... are considered a contribution of equity by the members that are required to be returned to the members consistent with the organization's bylaws and lender limitations imposed as a condition of loans.\" Thus, in contrast to publicly owned utilities, which typically transfer any net income to the general fund of the government that they serve, electric cooperatives return net margins to their members as equity, and when that equity is retired by the board of directors, members receive cash payments. Although it does not appear that a court has considered whether the FTC has Section 5 jurisdiction over a nonprofit electric cooperative that returns its net margins to its consumer-members in addition to providing them with electricity service, the Supreme Court, as well as lower federal courts, have issued guidance on factors that a court may consider in answering this question."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Applicable Law", "paragraphs": ["Under Section 5, the FTC Act requires that a \"corporation\" be \"organized to carry on business for its own profit or that of its members .\" In California Dental Ass'n v.

The Court found that the FTC had jurisdiction over the California Dental Association as a \"corporation,\" stating that", "the FTC Act is at pains to include not only an entity \"organized to carry on business for its own profit,\" but also one that carries on business for the profit \"of its members.\" While such a supportive organization may be devoted to helping its members in ways beyond immediate enhancement of profit, no one here has claimed that such an entity must devote itself single-mindedly to the profit of others. It could, indeed, hardly be supposed that Congress intended such a restricted notion of covered supporting organizations, with the opportunity this would bring with it for avoiding jurisdiction where the purposes of the FTC Act would obviously call for asserting it.", "The Court declined to specify the percentage of a nonprofit entity's activities that must be \"aimed at its members' pecuniary benefit\" to subject it to FTC jurisdiction. However, the Court wrote that a \"proximate relation\" must exist between the activities of the entity and the profits of its members, and implied that the activities must confer \"more than de minimis or merely presumed economic benefits\" on the members. The Court's justification for this result was that \"nonprofit entities organized on behalf of for-profit members have the same capacity and derivatively, at least, the same incentives as for-profit organizations to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair and deceptive acts.\"", "It is clear that the FTC may still have Section 5 jurisdiction even when the benefits that a nonprofit provides to its members are secondary to its charitable functions. In American Medical Ass'n v. FTC , the Second Circuit considered whether the FTC could enforce Section 5 against three medical professional associations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), a nonprofit corporation composed of \"physicians, osteopaths, and medical students.\" The court, acknowledging that the associations served \"both the business and non-business interests of their member physicians,\" found jurisdiction because the \"business aspects\" of their activities, including lobbying for members and offering business advice to them, subjected them to the FTC's jurisdiction despite the fact that the business aspects \"were considered secondary to the charitable and social aspects of their work.\"", "When determining whether jurisdiction exists, a court may consider other factors in addition to the benefits that the nonprofit provides to its members. In Community Blood Bank v. FTC , the Eighth Circuit considered whether a \"corporation\" included all nonprofit corporations. The appeals court held that the FTC lacked Section 5 jurisdiction over nonprofit blood banks because the banks' activities did not result in \"profit\" in the sense of \"gain from business or investment over and above expenditures.\" The blood banks, the court observed, lacked shares of capital, capital stock, or certificates, and were \"organized for and actually engaged in business for only charitable purposes.\" One bank's articles of incorporation touted the entity's charitable purposes, and all of the banks were exempt from paying federal income taxes. Upon dissolution, the corporations would transfer their assets to other charitable or nonprofit organizations. In addition, none of the funds collected by the blood banks had \"ever been distributed or inured to the benefit of any of their members, directors or officers.\" The court found that these factors made the blood banks \"charitable organizations\" both \"in law and in fact,\" exempting them from the FTC's Section 5 jurisdiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The case law suggests several factors that a court may weigh when determining whether a private, nonprofit entity composed of members, such as an electric cooperative, is subject to the FTC's Section 5 jurisdiction as a \"corporation.\" The most significant factor is whether the nonprofit provides an economic benefit to its members that is more than de minimis and that is proximately related to the nonprofit's activities. This benefit need not be the sole\u2014or even primary\u2014function of the nonprofit. Additional factors that the case law suggests weigh in favor of a finding of jurisdiction include that the nonprofit: (1) has gain from its business or investments that exceeds its expenditures; (2) has shares of capital or capital stock or certificates; (3) is not organized solely for charitable purposes or does not engage only in charitable work; (4) has articles of incorporation that list profit-seeking objectives; (5) is subject to federal income tax liability; (6) would distribute its assets to profit-seeking entities upon dissolution; and (7) distributes any of the funds it collects to its members, directors, or officers.", "It is possible that the FTC has Section 5 jurisdiction over nonprofit electric cooperatives, although the outcome in any particular case may depend on the characteristics of the individual utility. A court could find that the typical nonprofit electric cooperative provides \"economic benefit\" to its members in at least two ways: (a) by providing electricity service to members; and (b) by returning net margins to members in the form of patronage capital, which is an ownership interest in the cooperative that is later converted to cash payments to members when that capital is retired. With regard to (a), it is likely that a court would find that electricity service is an \"economic benefit\" as defined in the case law. In California Dental Ass'n , the nonprofit professional association provided \"advantageous insurance and preferential financing arrangements,\" as well as lobbying, litigation, and advertising services to its members. In American Medical Ass'n , the nonprofit lobbied on behalf of its members and offered business advice to members. These benefits, it is assumed, enabled the members to more easily conduct business profitably. Electricity service allows people to conduct activities at all times of the day, and thus provides a similar and clearly significant economic benefit to those who use it, whether for business or recreational purposes. As the primary objective of an electric cooperative is to provide electricity service to members, the necessary proximate relation between the activities of the nonprofit and the benefit to its members clearly exists.", "Despite its pecuniary nature, there are a few problems with considering benefit (b), patronage capital, to be an \"economic benefit\" as defined by the Court. First, it is not clear that patronage capital actually is a benefit. A court could view patronage capital as a no-interest loan from the consumer-member to the utility, or, because it is typically allocated to member accounts in a manner proportional to members' spending on electricity, simply a refund of money collected from the members that reflects the actual cost of providing service in a particular year. If adopted by a court, neither of these characterizations would appear to be consistent with the \"profit\" that the statute describes or the \"economic benefit\" that the Supreme Court requires for a nonprofit to be a \"corporation.\"", "Second, even if a court found patronage capital to be an economic benefit, it is not clear that it is more than de minimis. Patronage capital must be \"retired\" before members receive cash payments for it. Retirements are made at the discretion of the cooperative's board of directors because the capital is needed to finance the cooperative's ongoing expenses, and thus retirement of a class of capital typically occurs after a long rotation period, such as 20 years. Although the Supreme Court did not hold that an \"economic benefit\" must produce immediate advantage to the members of a nonprofit, a court could potentially view the decades-long delay in cash payments as significantly decreasing the degree of economic benefit that the capital provides. In addition, patronage capital would probably be considered de minimis if the cooperative's net margins were small, as this would mean that little capital would be issued to members. It is thus difficult to discern whether a court would find that an economic benefit accrues to members as a result of their receipt of patronage capital, which nevertheless probably bears the requisite \"proximate relation\" to the activities of the cooperative that produce any net margins distributed as capital.", "With regard to the additional factors, those favoring jurisdiction include (2) cooperatives typically have shares of capital stock, including patronage capital; (3) cooperatives do not operate solely for the benefit of the people outside of the organization like the nonprofits in Community Blood Bank did because cooperatives provide electricity service and patronage capital to their members; and (7) an electric cooperative typically returns any net margins to members in the form of patronage capital, an ownership interest refunded to consumer-members as cash when the capital is retired. Factors that cannot be evaluated because they are specific to each individual cooperative include (1) whether the revenues of the cooperative exceed its expenditures; (4) the particular objectives listed in a cooperative's articles of incorporation or other foundational document; (5) whether a nonprofit electric cooperative is exempt from federal income tax liability, which depends on whether it meets the requirements under Section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (6) whether a cooperative would distribute its assets to profit-seeking entities upon dissolution\u2014a factor that also may depend on state laws.", "It is likely that a court would find that nonprofit electric cooperatives impart economic benefits to their members by distributing electricity to them or, possibly, by issuing patronage capital to them. However, because many of the other factors that courts consider may differ for each particular cooperative, it is not possible to draw any general conclusions about whether the FTC would have Section 5 jurisdiction over these entities as \"corporations.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Enforcement of Data Privacy and Security", "paragraphs": ["If the FTC has Section 5 jurisdiction over a particular electric utility, it may bring an enforcement action against the utility if its privacy or security practices with regard to consumer smart meter data constitute \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" The FTC Act defines an \"unfair\" act or practice as one that \"causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.\" According to the FTC, an act or practice is \"deceptive\" if it is a material \"representation, omission or practice\" that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.
