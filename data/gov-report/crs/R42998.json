Medicare Parts A and B provide coverage for home health services. To be eligible for the home health benefit, a beneficiary must meet three different criteria. The beneficiary must (1) be homebound, (2) require intermittent skilled nursing care and/or skilled rehabilitation services, and (3) be under the care of a physician who has established that the home health visits are medically necessary in a 60-day plan of care. A beneficiary who meets these requirements is entitled to a 60-day episode of Medicare coverage for home health visits, and is then entitled to an unlimited number of subsequent 60-day episodes so long as he or she continues to meet the eligibility requirements. There is no cost-sharing requirement for home health services. Roughly 9.5% of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries (or 3.4 million individuals) used home health services in 2011.", "Home health services are provided through home health agencies (HHAs), most of which (85%) are freestanding\u2014HHAs not affiliated with an institution such as a hospital or a nursing facility. The number of HHAs participating in Medicare grew by 62% between 2000 and 2011 (from 7,528 to 12,199), with a vast majority of the increase in for-profit freestanding HHAs.", "Similar to most Medicare payment methods, Medicare Part A or Part B reimburses HHAs using a prospective payment system (PPS). A PPS reimburses providers with payments that are predetermined by a formula that adjusts payments for beneficiaries' expected care needs and location, among other factors. The home health PPS (HH PPS) was implemented for services beginning on or after October 1, 2000. Generally, the HH PPS provides a single payment for a 60-day episode to HHAs for the estimated costs of home health services. The 60-day episode payment is in contrast to the prior home health payment system that reimbursed HHAs retrospectively on a per visit basis.", "While total Medicare FFS expenditures have grown at an average annual rate of roughly 5.6% between 2001 and 2011, Medicare FFS expenditures on home health services have increased at an average annual rate of 8.0% over the same time period. In 2011, Medicare FFS expenditures on covered home health services totaled $18.4 billion. In addition to the high growth rate in Medicare home health payments, the home health benefit has drawn attention due to the consistently high Medicare margins (percentage of Medicare revenue that exceeds costs of services) of participating HHAs. Between 2003 and 2011, aggregate Medicare margins for freestanding HHAs have remained consistently high\u2014from 13.6% in 2003 to 14.8% in 2011.", "As deficit reduction pressures increase, the 113th Congress may debate whether to include beneficiary cost-sharing for home health services (a proposal recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and various other groups). Congress may also consider proposals to implement a value-based purchasing program for HHAs that would adjust Medicare payments based upon certain HHA quality measures. Similar proposals are currently being implemented in other Medicare payment systems. Congress may also choose to monitor the implementation of the settlement agreement of a recent class-action lawsuit between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Medicare Advocacy regarding the so-called \"improvement standard\" as well as the moratoria on new HHAs in targeted geographic areas."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries.

Currently, the regulatory definition of homebound states that a beneficiary must be confined to the home or in an institution that is not a hospital, Medicare-participating skilled nursing facility (SNF), or Medicaid-participating nursing facility. While a beneficiary must be confined to the home, the beneficiary does not have to be bedridden. Beneficiaries are considered homebound if leaving their residence requires a considerable and taxing effort. Absences from the home must be infrequent, or for periods of relatively short duration, or to receive medical treatment. In a March 2012 report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded from a medical record review sample of 495 Medicare home health claims that in 98% of Medicare home health claims the homebound requirement was met.

However, prior to payment reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97, P.L. 105-33 ), the average number of visits per home health user was much higher\u201472.6 visits per user. This decrease in home health visits per user has important implications since the current Medicare home health payment system uses a base payment rate that was constructed from 1997-1998 Medicare HHA cost reports and home health claims data, as discussed subsequently in this report.", "Similar to other Medicare post-acute care services, there is wide variation across the United States in the percentage of beneficiaries who receive Medicare-covered home health services. Geographic variation in home health admissions may in part be explained by demand factors, such as health and illness of residents in a state or treatment preferences, or supply factors, such as the number of home health agencies in the area, local practice preference, reduced nonmonetary costs (e.g., shorter distances for patient travel, shorter wait times). As shown in Figure 1 , in 2011, Medicare-covered home health admission rates were relatively higher in the West South Central region (i.e., Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). In 2011, the rate of beneficiaries who received covered home health services per 1,000 Part A enrollees was highest in Louisiana (144) and Texas (144), followed by Florida (143).

In 2010, for home health users who had a prior hospital or SNF stay, Medicare covered roughly 500,000 subsequent (second or greater) home health episodes following the beneficiaries' initial episode and roughly 3.2 million subsequent home health episodes for home health users admitted from the community. Overall, in 2010, the share of home health episodes for beneficiaries who had a prior hospitalization before beginning home health coverage was 34%.

Beginning in CY2014, the episode base rate ($2,869.27 in CY2014) will gradually change to reflect, in part, 2011 cost reports and 2012 home health claims data, inflated by the CY2013 and CY2014 home health market basket updates. This change is a result of section 3131(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ), which required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"rebase\" the home health payment rate with more recent data conducted in equal increments over four years but such increment is not to exceed a 3.5% change in the CY2010 home health payment rate ($80.95 for a 60-day episode).

The sum of the data elements score helped determine a beneficiary's severity level, and thus, expected care needs. Scores were organized by three dimensions with various levels within each dimension: clinical severity (four levels), functional severity (five levels), and services utilization severity (four levels). Clinical severity was based on the beneficiary's diagnoses, functional severity was based on how well the beneficiary performed activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, dressing, walking), and service utilization was based on whether the beneficiary received 10 or more therapy visits and/or whether the beneficiary was recently discharged from a hospital, inpatient rehabilitation facility, or SNF.

To assist the Joint Select Deficit Reduction Committee, the Bipartisan Policy Center released a set of recommendations that included policies related to Medicare savings. One recommendation suggested introducing copayments for home health services. The Bipartisan Policy Center's proposal included an estimated savings of $40 billion over 10 years.

The President's FY2014 budget included a proposal to introduce $100 copayment per home health episode for newly enrolled beneficiaries beginning in 2017. Similar to MedPAC, the copayment would apply to non LUPA episodes that were not preceded by a hospitalization. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated this proposal would reduce Medicare spending by $700 million between 2014 and 2023. While CBO does not recommend proposals, it does provide options for congressional consideration. In its March 2011 publication on deficit reduction options, CBO included an option to require coinsurance for Medicare home health.

Additionally, state and federal Medicaid expenditures may increase from covering the copayments of Medicare home health users who are also entitled to Medicaid coverage. Further, home health copayments may increase Medicare supplemental policies' expenditures, thereby increasing Medicare supplemental policy premiums.", "Beneficiary advocates contend that some beneficiaries who would have to pay for the copayments themselves will forgo needed home health services, which may lead to more expensive hospitalizations.

Many of these patients were denied coverage for skilled services needed to manage their chronic condition, maintain their existing function, and/or prevent or limit deterioration of function, because of the \"improvement standard.\" ", "On January 24, 2013, a federal district court in Vermont granted final approval of a proposed settlement agreement in Jimmo v Sebelius . The agreement requires CMS to revise its existing guidelines in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual for the home health benefit, as well as for the SNF, outpatient therapy, and inpatient rehabilitation facility benefits. Specifically, the manual's revisions for the home health benefit would be clarified to provide that home health coverage is based on an individualized assessment of the beneficiary's medical condition and need for skilled care, and not on whether the beneficiary's condition has the potential to improve, even if the therapy would simply maintain the beneficiary's current condition or slow further deterioration. While a showing that a patient's condition is expected to improve would no longer be required for home health care, a physician would still be required to certify that the patient is, in fact, homebound, and could prescribe treatment that only a skilled practitioner can provide. Further, CMS would be required to implement a nationwide educational campaign to communicate the revised standards to providers, contractors, and adjudicators.

The high rate of Medicare margins may suggest that estimating the costs of home health services through the HH PPS proves to be difficult. This difficulty may arise from large variation in agency costs of home health care, even after controlling for a beneficiary's clinical and functional factors. Further, the decline in the share of home health services that are related to prior hospital and SNF stays and the resulting rise in Medicare Part B expenditures and the notable difference in geographic variation of Part B per user payments, as shown in Figure 7 , may illustrate the changing care needs and geographic differences in health status among Medicare beneficiaries.
