The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (P.L. 108-458) provided more comprehensive language that included requirements for developing a national approach to achieving interoperability. Some of the legislative requirements were based on recommendations made by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission). Also in response to a 9/11 Commission recommendation regarding the availability of spectrum for radio operations, Congress set a date to release needed radio frequency spectrum by early 2009, as part of the Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171). The act also provided funding for public safety and for the improvement of 911 systems through a Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. In a section of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 109-295, Title VI, Subtitle D), Congress revisited the needs of an effective communications capacity for first responders and other emergency personnel and expanded the provisions of P.L. 108-458. The 109th Congress also passed provisions to improve emergency alerts, incorporated in the Port Security Improvement Act (P.L. 109-347).", "In the 110th Congress, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) was passed in the 1st Session. Sections in the act modified and expanded provisions for emergency communications passed in P.L. 109-171 and P.L. 109-295. Among introduced bills that would fund public safety are: S. 74 (Senator Schumer), to ensure adequate funding for high-threat areas; S. 345 (Senator Biden), that would provide funding and includes a requirement for the immediate release of spectrum for public safety use, now scheduled for 2009; S. 3465 (Senator Wicker), to create a First Responders Interoperable Device Availability Trust Fund that would provide grants to purchase interoperable radios for the new public safety network proposed for some of the spectrum made available by the transition to digital TV; H.R. 3116 (Representative Stupak), creating a Public Safety Communications Trust Fund to receive, among other sources of funding, the uncommitted balance remaining in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund; and H.R. 130, a funding bill for first responders (Representative Frelinghuysen), with a provision that would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a study evaluating the need to assign additional spectrum for use by public safety. The bills that carry provisions regarding spectrum are referring, for the most part, to licenses at 700 MHz that were auctioned in January-March 2008; some of the licenses have been assigned to public safety. The proceeds from the auction are to be deposited in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund, from which mandated disbursements will be made by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

Since September\u00a011, 2001, successive Congresses have passed legislation regarding technology, funding, spectrum access and other areas critical to emergency communications. These new laws have tended to address specific issues, dealing separately, for example, with interoperability for first responders, improvements in emergency alerts, and 911 call centers. When reviewing emergency communications legislation, whether for oversight or new initiatives, Congress may review the pace of technological convergence and its impact on policies for emergency communications. What once were discrete areas of emergency response are increasingly sharing common technologies. First responders and other emergency workers not only have access to better tools, but also\u2014by adopting new technologies\u2014find themselves confronted with the need to rethink their internal organizational structure and the ways that they communicate with external groups.", "Most emergency communications in use today have been built on core technologies such as two-way radio for emergency responders, telephone line switches for 911 calls, and broadcasting for emergency alerts. Operated independently of each other, these three pillars of emergency response have developed along separate technology tracks. Advances in information technology\u2014and particularly the ubiquity of the Internet\u2014have laid the groundwork for connecting the functions of communications for emergency responders, 911 call centers, and public alerts. For example: digital broadcasting used for emergency alerts can also be used to deliver information to emergency responders; the use of Internet Protocols (IP) provides a standard for network inter-connectivity; interoperable radio networks used by first responders can open a channel for real-time participation by operators in 911 call centers; these same call centers can be used to generate local alerts, over all types of communications media, to virtually any enabled device. Developing communications technologies with common elements provide synergies that benefit both provider and user.", "Federal policy and congressional action tend to treat these three important areas of emergency communications through different agencies and different committees. Some observers cite cross-agency coordination at the federal level and cross-jurisdiction cooperation at the congressional level as areas where rapprochement could facilitate homeland security. Because the preponderance of incidents involving emergency workers occurs at the local level, local, state and regional participation and coordination are included in federal solutions. Encouraging the right balance of cooperative policy and federal leadership\u2014to support both daily operations and national response in catastrophic situations\u2014is one of the goals of Congress. Through legislation, Congress has proposed methods for blending the use of advanced technology with the changes in organization that shifts in technology tend to foster. In time, the convergence of communications technology may lead to new approaches in policy-making and oversight based on a recognition that both function and technology are interconnected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "First Responders and Emergency Communications", "paragraphs": ["Congressional interest in the federal government's support of interoperable emergency communications capability has increased since September 11, 2001.

The different types of technology, operating on different radio frequencies, could not interface with each other.", "Congress first addressed interoperability in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ). Then, responding to recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission), Congress included a section in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) that expanded its requirements for action in improving interoperability and public safety communications. Also in response to a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission, Congress set a firm deadline for the release of radio frequency spectrum needed for public safety radios as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ). These laws provide the base from which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can develop a national public safety communications capability as required by the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 ( P.L. 109-295 ).

With the support of the Administration, SAFECOM was placed in the Science and Technology directorate and became the lead agency for coordinating federal programs for interoperability. The Secretary of Homeland Security assigned the responsibility of preparing a national strategy for communications interoperability to the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC), which DHS created, an organizational move that was later ratified by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act.

Furthermore, high-risk urban areas such as New York City and Washington, D.C., should establish signal corps units to ensure communications connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local first responders, and the National Guard. Federal funding of such units should be given high priority by\u00a0Congress.", "Congress addressed both the context and the specifics of the recommendation for signal corps. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act amended the Homeland Security Act to specify that DHS give priority to the rapid establishment of interoperable capacity in urban and other areas determined to be at high risk from terrorist attack. The Secretary of Homeland Security was required to work with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Secretary of Defense, and the appropriate state and local authorities to provide technical guidance, training, and other assistance as appropriate. Minimum capabilities were to be established for \"all levels of government agencies,\" first responders, and others, including the ability to communicate with each other and to have \"appropriate and timely access\" to the Information Sharing Environment, an initiative treated elsewhere in the act. The act further required the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish at least two pilot programs in high-threat areas. The process of development for these programs was to contribute to the creation and implementation of a national model strategic plan; its purpose was to foster interagency communications at all levels of the response effort. Building on the concept of using the Army\u00a0Signal Corps as a model, the law directed the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of\u00a0Defense in the development of the pilot projects, including review of standards, equipment, and protocols.", "Congress also raised the bar for performance and accountability. Section 7303 (a) (1) set program goals for the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the FCC. Briefly, the goals were to:", "Establish a comprehensive, national approach for achieving interoperability; Coordinate with other federal agencies; Develop appropriate minimum capabilities for interoperability; Accelerate development of voluntary standards; Encourage open architecture and commercial products; Assist other agencies with research and development; Prioritize, within DHS, research, development, testing and related programs; Establish coordinated guidance for federal grant programs; Provide technical assistance; and Develop and disseminate best practices.", "The act included a requirement that any request for funding from DHS for interoperable communications \"for emergency response providers\" be accompanied by an Interoperable Communications Plan, which must be approved by the Secretary. Criteria for the Plan were also provided in the act.", "The act conveyed the sense of Congress that \"interoperable emergency communications systems and radios should continue to be deployed as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community, and that upgraded and new digital communications systems and new digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus standards for interoperability.\"", "Spectrum allocation, needed for radio communications by first responders and other emergency workers, is also an important issue. The act required two studies on spectrum and communication networks for public safety and homeland security, to be prepared for Congress by year end 2005. The FCC was designated to lead a study on spectrum needs for emergency response providers. The Secretary of Homeland Security, with the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), was required to prepare a study on strategies to meet public safety and homeland security needs for first responders and all other emergency response providers.", "The FCC report was released December 2005. For the study, the FCC sought comment on whether additional spectrum should be made available for public safety, possibly from the 700 MHz band. Comments received from the public safety community overwhelmingly supported the need for additional spectrum, although other bands besides 700 MHz were also mentioned. The FCC did not make a specific recommendation for additional spectrum allocations in the short-term although it stated that it agreed that public safety \"could make use of such an allocation in the long-term to provide broadband services.\" It qualified this statement by observing that spectrum is only one factor in assuring access to mobile broadband services for emergency response. It further announced that it would move expeditiously to see whether the current band plan for the 24 MHz at 700 MHz currently designated for public safety could be modified to accommodate broadband applications.", "The second required study, to be conducted by DHS in cooperation with the FCC and the NTIA, has not been released in final form. In addition to the requirement from Congress, the Secretary of Homeland Security had also been ordered by a Presidential Executive Memorandum to participate in a national study of spectrum policy. The Presidential Spectrum Policy Initiative planning process is moving forward under the direction of the NTIA and will apparently incorporate information intended to meet the congressional study requirement.", "The act also included a sense of Congress provision that the 109 th Congress should pass legislation supporting the Commission's recommendation to expedite the release of spectrum.
