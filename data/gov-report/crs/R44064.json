The same penalties apply to anyone who attempts to violate the provisions of Section 1591.", "At first glance, Section 1591 did not appear to cover the customers of a sex trafficking enterprise. Moreover, in the absence of a specific provision, mere customers ordinarily are not considered either co-conspirators or accessories before the fact in a prostitution ring. This might be thought particularly so given the severity of the penalties that attend conviction. Nevertheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the language of Section 1591(a) applied to the cases of two customers caught in a law enforcement \"sting\" when they attempted to purchase the services of what they believed were child prostitutes. \"The ordinary and natural meaning of 'obtains' and the other terms Congress selected in drafting \u00a71591 are broad enough to encompass the actions of both suppliers and purchasers of commercial sex acts,\" the court declared.", "P.L. 114-22 confirms this construction by amending Section 1591(a) to read, in part, \"Whoever knowingly ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, maintains, or patronizes, or solicits by any means any person ...\" (language of the amendment in italics)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Age: Prosecutors' Burden", "paragraphs": ["Section 1591 absolves the government of the obligation to prove that a trafficker knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that a child prostitute was underage, if the prosecution can show that the defendant had an opportunity to \"observe\" the victim.

Even before amendment, there was some evidence that advertising might constitute a crime under either offense. Aiding and abetting would have provided the key to prosecution in both instances. Anyone who aids and abets the commission of a federal crime by another merits the same punishment as the individual who actually commits the crime. Liability for aiding and abetting requires that a defendant embrace the crime of another and consciously do something to contribute to its success. Anyone who knowingly advertised the availability of child prostitutes might have faced charges of aiding and abetting a commercial sex trafficking offense. An advertiser who profited from such activity might face charges under the profiteering prong of Section 1591.", "Yet Section 1591 might have presented a technical obstacle. One of Section 1591's distinctive features was that its action elements\u2014recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining\u2014were activities that might be associated with aiding and abetting the operation of a prostitution enterprise. Section 1591, read literally then, did not outlaw operating a prostitution business; it outlawed the steps leading up to or associated with operating a prostitution business\u2014recruiting, harboring, transporting, etc. Strictly construed, advertising in aid of recruitment, harboring, transporting, or one of the other action elements might have qualified as aiding and abetting a violation of Section 1591, while advertising the availability of a prostitute might not have.", "Nevertheless, at least one court suggested that Section 1591 did outlaw operating a prostitution business, at least for purposes of aiding and abetting liability, and thus by implication advertising might have constituted aiding and abetting a violation of the section:", "Pringler first argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for aiding and abetting the sex trafficking of a minor [in violation of Section 1591].... We disagree. The record is not devoid of evidence to support the jury's verdict and show Pringler's integral role in the criminal venture. Pringler took the money that Norman and B.L. earned from their prostitution and used some of it to pay for hotel rooms where the women met their patrons. Pringler bought the laptop Norman and B.L. used to advertise their services. He drove Norman and B.L. to \"outcall\" appointments, and he took photographs of Norman, which he had planned for use in advertisements.", "P.L. 114-22 resolves the uncertainty by adding advertising to the prostitution-assisting element of the commercial sex trafficking offense. The offense now reads in pertinent part:", "Whoever knowingly- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, or maintains by any means a person; ... knowing, or ... in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) [language added by the amendment in italics].", "After amendment, the knowledge element of \u00a71591's trafficking and profiteering offenses is slightly different. Advertising traffickers are liable if they knew of or recklessly disregarded the victim's status.

The doctrine describes the circumstances under which a jury may be instructed by the court that it may infer knowledge on the part of a defendant. Worded variously, the doctrine applies where evidence indicates that the defendant sought to avoid the guilty knowledge.", "Since the element was worded in the alternative\u2014knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact\u2014the courts have rarely distinguished the two. One possible interpretation comes from comparable wording in an immigration offense which outlaws transporting an alien knowing or acting in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien is in this country illegally: \"To act with reckless disregard of the fact means to be aware of but consciously and carelessly ignore facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the person transported was an alien who had entered or remained in the United States illegally.\" The courts refer to a similar unreasonable indifference standard when speaking of the veracity required for the issuance of a warrant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conspirators' Supervised Release", "paragraphs": ["Defendants sentenced to prison for federal crimes are also sentenced to a term of supervised release.

Section 2423(d) outlaws commercially facilitating overseas travel in order to engage in illicit sexual conduct.

P.L. 114-22 adds production of child pornography as an alternative third definition. Thus, it is a federal crime (1) under Section 2423(b) to travel in U.S. interstate or foreign travel with the intent to produce child pornography; or (2) under Section 2423(c) for a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien to produce child pornography overseas; or (3) under Section 2423(d) to commercially facilitate overseas travel in order to produce child pornography.", "Defendants previously enjoyed an affirmative defense in \"illicit sexual activity\" cases involving commercial sex trafficking, if they could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that they reasonably believed that the victim was over 18 years of age.

The difference between preponderance of the evidence and clear and convincing is the difference between more likely than not and highly probable.", "The final Mann Act amendment involves prosecutors.

Victims may appeal a failure to honor their rights by seeking a writ of mandamus, and the appellate court must decide the matter within three days (72 hours), or in the case of a stay or continuance within five days.", "Most often, mandamus is an extraordinary remedy awarded only on rare occasions and only if at least three prerequisites can be satisfied: \"First, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.... Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable. Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\"", "The federal appellate courts, however, cannot agree on whether this stringent traditional mandamus standard or the usual appellate standard (abuse of discretion or legal error) should apply in Crime Victims' Rights Act appeals.", "P.L. 114-22 resolves the dispute in favor of the less demanding abuse of discretion or legal error standard used for most appeals.
