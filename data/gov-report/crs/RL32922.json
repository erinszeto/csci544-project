Federal inspectors or their state counterparts are present at all times in virtually all slaughter plants and for at least part of each day in establishments that further process meat and poultry products. Debate has ensued for decades over whether this system, first designed in the early 1900s, has kept pace with changes in the food production and marketing industries.", "Several significant changes in meat and poultry inspection programs were included in the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246), signed into law in June 2008. These include permitting certain state-inspected meat and poultry products to enter interstate commerce, just like USDA-inspected products; bringing catfish under mandatory USDA inspection; requiring an inspected establishment to notify USDA if it believes that an adulterated or misbranded product has entered commerce; and requiring establishments to prepare and maintain written recall plans. USDA's implementation of these provisions is an oversight item for the 111th Congress. Other recent inspection issues could receive continued attention in the 111th Congress, which currently appears to be focused on broader legislation to reform food safety programs\u2014notably those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees all foods other than meat and poultry. Issues relevant to FSIS programs include the following.", "Is enough being done to address longstanding concerns about naturally occurring microbiological contamination? In 1996, FSIS added a sweeping new system known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)\u2014essentially plant-specific contamination prevention plans\u2014on top of the traditional \"sight-, smell-, and touch-based\" inspection system. However, recalls due to pathogen problems continue to occur, and the significant rates of decline in the incidence of some major foodborne pathogens have not been sustained in recent years, according to government data. Past proposals to delineate pathogen performance standards and/or safe tolerance levels could again be offered.", "Should USDA have authority to mandate recalls of meat and poultry products, as advocates have requested? FSIS now relies on the establishments to recall adulterated products but asserts that this approach, along with other enforcement tools, is sufficient to protect consumers. Those wanting mandatory recall authority also contend that an improved ability to trace animals, meat, and poultry products should be built into the system to make recalls more effective.", "Does FSIS have adequate funding and resources, and/or should industry pay more for inspection? FSIS inspection is mainly funded through USDA's annual appropriation, with some user fees authorized to cover plant overtime and holiday inspection costs. Congress has denied successive Administrations' proposals for additional user fees. Congress also has used annual appropriations measures to direct FSIS's administration of its programs. Examples include prohibiting implementation of a rule that would allow imports of some Chinese poultry products; prohibiting the use of funds to inspect horses to be used for food for humans; and slowing the agency's implementation of a controversial \"risk based inspection system\" (RBIS, now being retooled as the \"Public Health Based Inspection System\") aimed at shifting some existing FSIS resources from processing plants and products that pose relatively lower safety risks to others posing relatively higher risks."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background on the Programs", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for inspecting most meat, poultry, and processed egg products for safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling.

It also began or accelerated implementation of several other E. coli prevention initiatives that had been under development. Among the actions it cited in October 2007 were the testing (starting in March 2007) of beef trim, which is used in ground beef; requiring beef plants to verify that they are effectively controlling E. coli O157:H7 during slaughter and processing; directing its inspectors to use a new checklist to review establishment control procedures; beginning testing other types of materials used in ground beef in addition to beef trim and requiring importing countries to conduct equivalent sampling; better targeting its routine E. coli testing; and working to speed up recalls.", "Additional FSIS E. coli initiatives were announced as one of the items on the FSWG list of actions on July 7, 2009. The working group stated that FSIS is increasing its sampling, focusing on the components that go into ground beef, and also improving its instructions to field staff on how to verify beef establishment controls over the pathogen. These beef components are typically are referred to as \"bench trim\" and are the trimmings from larger cuts of primal and sub-primal cuts of beef. A notice on sampling bench trim and a directive on E. coli verification activities were issued on July 31, 2009. Meanwhile, FSIS reportedly was considering whether to define all cuts of beef as adulterated if they test positive for E. coli O157:H7, something a number of groups requested after a recent recall of 421,000 pounds of such \"muscle cuts.\"", "The agency also is planning or contemplating a number of other efforts aimed at addressing E. coli O157:H7, including directing its enforcement investigators to gather more information within 48 hours of a presumed positive test for the pathogen (to improve ability to trace contaminated products back to their source); proposing rules requiring products to be held until testing results are completed; requiring labels on whole meat cuts that have been mechanically tenderized; and possibly instituting new record-keeping requirements aimed at enhancing traceback capabilities.", "FSIS reported that, of an average of nearly 10,000 ground beef samples tested annually in 2004, 2005, and 2006, a total of 43 (less than 0.2%) tested positive for E. coli O157:H7, part of a significant decline in the percentage of positive samples since 2000, when it was 0.86%. FSIS asserted that the reduction reflected the success of its HACCP-based and related regulatory policies. However, increases were recorded in 2007, when 29 or 0.24% of 12,200 ground beef samples tested positive, and in 2008, when 54 or 0.47% of 11,535 were positive. FSIS and other food safety experts were speculating as to whether the increase was due to a higher prevalence of the bacteria, or simply to the fact that the agency had changed its testing method in 2008. It is possible, for example, that the newer method is more sensitive to the presence of E. coli. In 2009, through December 27, a total of 41 or 0.32% out of 12,685 ground beef samples tested positive.

The proposal covered over 100 different types of dried, salt-cured, fermented, and cooked or processed meat and poultry products. Lm causes an estimated 2,500 illnesses and 499 deaths each year (from listeriosis), and has been a major reason for meat and poultry product recalls.", "The proposed rule raised controversy among affected constituencies. The meat industry argued that the benefits to consumers would not outweigh the cost to packers of additional testing. Representatives of food manufacturers criticized the proposed regulations for covering some categories of foods too broadly and heavily, while not covering some other high-risk foods at all (such as milk, which is under FDA jurisdiction). Consumer groups said the proposed rule would not require enough testing in small processing plants and that products not tested for Lm should not be labeled \"ready-to-eat\" because they would still require cooking to be 100% safe.", "Interest in the Listeria issue had grown in 1998 and 1999, following reports of foodborne illnesses and deaths linked to ready-to-eat meats produced by a Sara Lee subsidiary. Interest increased significantly after October 2002, when Pilgrim's Pride Corporation recalled a record-breaking 27.5 million pounds of poultry lunch meats for possible Lm contamination after a July 2002 outbreak of listeriosis in New England. CDC confirmed 46 cases of the disease, with seven deaths and three stillbirths or miscarriages. The recall covered products made as early as May 2002, and officials stated that very little of the meat was still available to be recovered.", "In December 2002, FSIS issued a directive to inspection program personnel giving new and specific instructions for monitoring processing plants that produce hot dogs and deli meats. In June 2003, FSIS announced the publication of an interim final rule to reduce Listeria in ready-to-eat meats. Rather than set performance standards, as the February 2001 proposed rule would have, the new regulation requires plants that process RTE foods to add control measures specific to Listeria to their HACCP and sanitation plans, and to verify their effectiveness by testing and disclosing the results to FSIS. The rule directs FSIS inspectors to conduct random tests to verify establishments' programs. Plants are subject to different degrees of FSIS verification testing depending upon what type of control steps they adopt in their HACCP and sanitation plans.", "On January 4, 2005, the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) issued a report sharply criticizing USDA's Listeria rulemaking. CFA asserted that the Department essentially adopted meat industry positions in weakening the final rule, such as by deleting proposed plant testing requirements and by not explicitly requiring that HACCP plans include Listeria controls. In 2003, Listeria illnesses increased by 22%, CFA contended, citing CDC data.", "USDA and meat industry officials countered that the number of product recalls related to Listeria had declined from 40 in 2002 to 14 in 2003, that the rise in Listeriosis cases was quite small in 2003 after four years of declines, and that the interim rule provides more incentives for plants to improve safety. The CDC's 2006 and 2007 FoodNet reports indicated that the incidence of foodborne illness caused by Listeria, which had reached its lowest level in 2002 compared with a 1996-1998 baseline, has not continued to decline significantly in more recent years.", "Recalls of FSIS-regulated products continue.

In a more robust RBIS, each establishment's risk could be categorized, and the type and intensity of inspection could be based primarily on that risk.\"", "More specifically, the initiative was to enable FSIS to shift some processing inspection resources from lower-risk products and plants to relatively higher-risk products (for example, ground poultry), and to plants with relatively poor safety records. USDA in February 2007 had announced a timetable for introducing RBIS, beginning in April 2007 at 30 locations representing about 254 processing (but not yet slaughter) establishments. About a fourth of these plants would come under closer scrutiny, about a fourth less scrutiny, and about half would receive approximately the same level of attention as currently, a USDA official said. He added that all plants will still be under \"daily inspection,\" and full-time employees would not be reduced under RBIS.", "Public comments to FSIS on RBIS, and hearings by a House appropriations subcommittee, indicated that many agreed in concept with risk-based inspection but were concerned that the agency had provided too few specifics on how it would be implemented, lacked the data it needed to implement it, and should consider doing it through formal rulemaking. A few warned that it could undermine rather than strengthen safety oversight, and wondered whether the agency has the statutory authority to change inspection frequency.", "Several interest groups reiterated their concerns following the earlier, February 22, 2007, USDA announcement. The American Meat Institute, representing major meat packers, said in a statement that it was concerned that the \"hasty launch\" of the initiative could jeopardize consumer confidence in meat and poultry, and that details of exactly how the program would work still were unclear. Several consumer groups questioned the validity of the data that USDA was using to rank product risk and plant performance FY2009.", "The Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of FSIS's work on RBIS, issuing its report in December 2007. Among other findings, the OIG questioned whether the agency had the systems in place \"to provide reasonable assurance that risk can be timely or fully assessed, especially since FSIS lacks current, comprehensive assessments of establishments' food safety systems.\" OIG reported that FSIS lacks adequate management control processes or an integrated IT (computer) system to support a program, and the agency had not resolved all of the prior recommendations that OIG said were most critical to successful development of risk-based inspection. The OIG report offered 35 new recommendations around such matters as improving the use of food safety assessment-related data; determining how assessment results will be used to estimate risk; and providing clearer documentation and written procedures and guidance for all stakeholders.", "The OIG report was the major item discussed at the February 5-6, 2008, meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection.

FSIS issued a report outlining the elements of and scientific basis for the evolving PHRBIS on April 2008. The agency has been implementing the OIG recommendations, and has predicted that implementation will begin in late FY2010.", "The agency also asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to evaluate the data and methodology underlying its PHRBIS initiative. On March 23, 2009, a committee of the NAS Institute of Medicine issued its report, commending FSIS for its commitment to develop a risk-based system and agreeing with the \"general concept of using process control indicators as part of an algorithm to rank establishments in different levels of inspection.\" However, the committee also \"found it a challenge to evaluate the adequacy of indicators of process control to rank establishments and allocate agency inspection resources without a clear understanding of the rationale for the general approach,\" which the FSIS technical report did not articulate.

On the other hand, the article asserted, many of the larger fast food and supermarket chains set testing and safety standards that are far higher than those required by AMS.

The challenge, according to the Time s , has been how to keep the ammonia levels high enough to kill the pathogens but not negatively affect the taste of the product. Furthermore, the government reportedly did not require that the ammonia-treated meat be so labeled, because the government agreed with Beef Products' assertion that it was a processing agent and not an additive.", "The food safety expert quoted by USA Today , James Marsden, generally defended the AMS purchasing program in a recent Internet posting. He observed that ground beef destined for schools must be tested for both Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, both of for which AMS has a \"zero-tolerance\" policy and thus will not accept any products where it is found. Furthermore, suppliers must hold the product until tests confirm that samples are negative for the pathogens.

However, Korea first delayed implementation and then scaled back the types of products it would accept, following vigorous anti-government protests that grew from this agreement's announcement. By July, and through the end of 2008, U.S. beef again was moving into Korea. U.S. authorities have been hopeful that such positive developments could help to defuse the frustration of many Members of Congress, some of whom had been expected to reintroduce legislation calling for sanctions against trading partners that failed to accept assurances of U.S. beef safety. U.S. access to Korea's beef market has been an issue in the debate over implementation of the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement (FTA). A number of Members had signaled that their support for legislation to implement the FTA was contingent on Korea fully opening its market for U.S. beef.

This largest U.S. meat recall ever came after FSIS found that for at least two years the facility had not always notified inspectors about cattle that had become nonambulatory after they had been inspected and approved\u2014but before they were actually slaughtered\u2014for food. FSIS regulations explicitly prohibit most nonambulatory cattle which are presented for ante-mortem inspection, because of their higher risk of BSE.", "FSIS also cited evidence that the plant had violated the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA), which first came to light after animal welfare advocates secretly videotaped what they described as employees inhumanely handling downer cattle before slaughter.
