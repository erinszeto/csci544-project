Historically, high cost has been a key barrier to commercial use, which has been addressed mainly by a 51-cent per gallon tax credit for fuel use. Due primarily to the use of fertilizer, which has natural gas as a key ingredient, there has been a debate over the net energy benefit of using corn ethanol. The perception that ethanol use has significantly lower emissions of some air pollutants than gasoline helps maintain support for its incentives. However, compared with gasoline, ethanol can have higher emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) per mile traveled. Assuming that the net energy benefit of ethanol is clearly positive, then its carbon dioxide emissions are significantly lower than those for gasoline.", "National ethanol production was estimated at 4.0 billion gallons in 2005. Due to ethanol's lower heat content, this is equivalent to about 2.7 billion gallons of gasoline that year, or about 170,000 barrels of oil per day. In comparison, in 2005, U.S. transportation oil use averaged 13.82 million barrels per day (mb/d) and total U.S. oil use averaged 20.7 mb/d.

Further, EIA estimates ethanol production may reach 700,000 b/d by 2030. This would be equivalent to about 470,000 b/d of oil use.

Cellulosic ethanol can be made through gassification, thermochemical, and microbial processes. In the microbial process, cellulosic ethanol is made by breaking apart the cellulose (fiber) in plant cell walls into component sugar molecules, which microbes then convert to ethanol.", "In particular, ethanol can be produced from dedicated fuel crops, such as fast-growing trees and switchgrass. The latter is a native grass that grows well on cropland and marginal lands, needing little water and no fertilizer. Because fertilizer is not needed, the net energy production is much higher than that for corn ethanol. Due to its capacity for production on marginal lands, the potential growing area for switchgrass is much larger than that for corn. A provision in the Farm Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-171 ) encourages use of the Conservation Reserve Program lands for development of such biomass resources.", "Although cellulosic feedstocks may be cheaper and more plentiful than corn, they require more extensive processing that makes the conversion to ethanol more costly. Both DOE and USDA are conducting research to improve this technology and reduce costs. In particular, DOE is studying the use of enzymes and heat as catalysts to reduce the cost of the conversion process. Both the United States and Canada have pilot facilities for producing cellulosic ethanol, and Canada has the only commercial-scale plant in operation.", "The Administration's Biorefinery Initiative, part of its Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI), aims to increase funding for cellulosic ethanol development with the goal of accelerating its commercial use. In response to the AEI, DOE set a goal of using biofuels to displace 30% of national transportation fuel use (at the 2004 level) by 2030. In July 2006, DOE announced a partnership between EERE and the Office of Science to pursue use of biotechnology to produce cellulosic ethanol. A report on the research strategy of the partnership says that the United States could produce up to 60 billion gallons of biofuels per year, which would be equivalent to about 2.6 million barrels of oil per day. The research plan is focused on achieving breakthroughs in biotechnology to increase the quantity of biomass (e.g., corn plant waste and switchgrass) per acre and breeding the plants to have less lignin and more cellulose.

Further, DOE says biodiesel is safe and biodegradable and reduces air pollutants such as particulates, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and air toxics; but it also notes that biodiesel tends to increase emissions of nitrous oxides. Blends of 20% biodiesel (B20) with 80% petroleum diesel can generally be used in unmodified diesel engines. Biodiesel can also be used in its pure form (B100), but it may require certain engine modifications to avoid maintenance and performance problems and may not be suitable for wintertime use.

Except for biofuels and biopower, wherever renewable energy equipment displaces fossil fuel use, it will also reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, as well as pollutants that contribute to water pollution, acid rain, and urban smog. In general, the combustion of biomass for fuel and power production releases CO 2 at an intensity that may rival or exceed that for natural gas. However, the growth of biomass material, which absorbs CO 2 , offsets this release. Hence, net emissions occur only when combustion is based on deforestation.
