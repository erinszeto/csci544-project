Proponents maintain that such assistance could help promote low-emissions and high-growth economic development in lower-income countries, while simultaneously protecting the more vulnerable countries from the effects of a changing climate. Recent studies estimate the needs for climate change financing in the developing world to range from US$4 billion to several hundred billion annually by the year 2030. The United States has pledged funds in such fora as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), the Copenhagen Accord (2009), and the UNFCCC Cancun Agreements (2010), wherein the wealthiest countries, in aggregate, agreed to provide up to $30 billion in \"fast start\" financing for the 2010-2012 period and to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. Pledged funds are to come from a wide variety of sources, both public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. Lower-income countries have sought assistance that is new, additional to previous flows, adequate, predictable, and sustained.", "The fundamental dispute concerning international financing for climate change centers upon who should pay for it and how. The debate has been dominated by economic assessments of market-based mechanisms aimed at changing price incentives so that investment in low-emissions development becomes more attractive (e.g., cap and trade, carbon fees, loan guarantees). Many agree that private sector investment will likely have a significant role to play in any low-emissions future, and that establishing a price on GHG emissions will likely have a part in any effective policy agenda. However, concerns remain whether such mechanisms can induce the required shifts in production and consumption patterns, mobilize the necessary investment, and contribute adequately to international financial assistance. From this perspective, public funds\u2014including from national governments and international organizations\u2014continue to be a key driver for climate change investment, specifically in low-income countries.", "Many methods for disbursing international climate change financing currently exist. All have a role in catalyzing climate action. They include private sector funding through such avenues as foreign direct investment (FDI), export credit markets, multilateral development banks and finance corporations, and the various U.N. Kyoto Protocol market mechanisms, as well as public sector funding through official development assistance (ODA), multilateral trust funds (e.g., the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Climate Investment Funds (CIF), Green Climate Fund (GCF)), and the concessional lending windows housed at the World Bank Group. Many contend that the financial architecture is underfunded, unnecessarily complex, and lacks both strategic mandate and adequate coordination. Debate has arisen over the proper financial instruments to employ in lower-income countries as well as the role shared by the public and private spheres.", "Up to this point, the United States has relied mostly on direct budget appropriations to finance climate change actions internationally, but recent Congresses have considered several alternatives that could generate new financing for international purposes. Many in Congress and the public at large may question why the United States should help finance other countries' efforts on climate change. Some claim that international financing would incur costs to the United States, or redirect funds that could be used for domestic purposes and send them overseas. Others, however, contend that international financing may offer potential benefits to the United States in terms of global environmental protection, expanded commercial markets, and increased national security."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["While some investigators disagree with the current risk assessments of climate science, most accept the findings of the U.S. National Academies that the Earth's climate has changed over the past century and that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) through such activities as fossil fuel use, agricultural practices, and deforestation\u2014have very likely caused most of the observed effects. Broadly agreed findings conclude that the world faces risks from the damaging effects of a changing climate unless GHG emissions are limited. There is some political consensus internationally to try to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at approximately 450 parts per million by volume (ppm) carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2 e), a volume which is projected to limit global warming to around 2\u02daC above pre-industrial levels. Some people argue that a 2\u02daC target, if attained within a sufficient time frame, might prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened, and enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. Others suggest different target levels of varying stringency.", "Large-scale financial investments are projected to be needed to meet the global demand for energy, water, transportation, heating, and other infrastructure services in countries with growing populations and rising incomes. Financial requirements would be increased if countries made such investments with the additional consideration of addressing climate change. Proponents maintain that climate-relevant investments would promote low-emissions, high-growth economic development while simultaneously protecting the more vulnerable countries and communities from the effects of climate change. Some countries have begun to make moderate adjustments focusing, in particular, on energy efficiency strategies, low-emissions energy infrastructure, and sustainable land use, land use change, and forestry practices. However, despite expressions of concern and commitment, the shift toward climate-relevant investment has been deemed slow by many. Further, while industrialized countries continue to contribute a disproportionally large share of global GHG emissions, and historically have contributed most of the global GHG emissions over the past two centuries, future emission growth is projected to arise mostly from the developing world, whose populations and economic aspirations continue to grow. Thus, even if developed country emissions are significantly curtailed, climate targets may not be met without the deployment of similar abatement efforts in the developing world. ", "While there is little doubt that the most efficient GHG reduction strategy would require efforts from all countries, a fundamental dispute centers upon who should pay for them and how. Most, if not all, low-income countries have argued that their success in abating GHG emissions and curtailing deforestation would depend critically on receipt of international financial and other support. They argue that reducing their share of GHG emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change would incur costs above and beyond their normal economic growth trajectories. These costs are particularly challenging to countries that have low incomes compared to industrialized nations, consider alleviating poverty as their first priority, and conclude that they have contributed only a minor share of the historical GHG emissions that force climate change. ", "Higher-income countries, including the United States, have pledged financial assistance to lower-income countries in such fora as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992). While vaguely defined, the UNFCCC pledges are not voluntary commitments, but treaty obligations, signed and ratified by the U.S. government. More recently, the Copenhagen Accord (2009) stipulated\u2014and the UNFCCC Cancun Agreements (2010) restated\u2014that the wealthiest countries in aggregate would commit to provide up to $30 billion \"fast start\" financing in the 2010-2012 period and to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to promote mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer, and capacity building efforts in lower-income countries. The funding is to come from \"a wide variety of sources, [both] public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance.\" The Copenhagen Accord is a non-binding political agreement among countries; the implementation of the Cancun Agreements, as a product of the UNFCCC Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA), is still under negotiation by Parties.", "This report aims to inform congressional decision-making on U.S. provisions for financial assistance to low-income countries to address climate change.

They contend that the United States should not be burdened with higher taxes or prices for investments abroad. The burden is exacerbated during times of economic downturns, when governments are hard-pressed to generate fiscal resources to adequately address domestic challenges and maintain basic levels of public services and quality of life. For those who support some form of international development assistance, they may argue that aid should be directed to country priorities other than climate change, such as improving public health systems, water and sanitation resources, or infrastructure.", "Misuse of Funds: Many critics have claimed that international financial assistance targeted to help average citizens in low-income countries often ends up supporting inefficient and bloated bureaucracies (e.g., recipient governments, donor-funded multilaterals, or non-governmental organizations). They argue that the national and international institutions that dispense financial assistance focus on \"getting money out the door\" to lower-income countries, rather than on delivering services; emphasize short-term outputs like reports and frameworks but do not engage in long-term activities like the evaluation of projects after they are completed; and put enormous administrative demands on lower-income country governments. Bilateral and multilateral development agencies have also been criticized for the fragmentation of foreign assistance across many small and uncoordinated bureaucracies, the lack of transparency about project procurement practices and operating costs, and the proportion of funds that is misused or lost through instances of graft, corruption, and other political inefficiencies. ", "Poor Results: Some critics contest the overall effectiveness of foreign assistance in spurring economic development and reform in low-income countries. Many studies have examined the effects of international assistance provided to lower-income countries, including both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, and have returned mixed results. Conclusions range from ineffective, to highly effective, to effective \"in some countries under specific circumstances.\" The divergent results of these studies may make it difficult to reach firm conclusions and support continued contributions. Further, some commentators find that international environmental assistance poses even greater uncertainties than other forms of aid due to difficulties in assessing, measuring, reporting, and verifying environmental indicators. Some statistics have confirmed these perceptions, as the success rate for environmental projects is often far below those of education, health, or infrastructure. ", "Development Inefficiencies: There is no satisfactory metric on the effectiveness of international financial assistance to lower-income countries. Some critics claim that it may do more harm than good. They assert that a reliance on foreign capital fosters an unhealthy economic dependence, making poor countries poorer and economic growth slower, and leaving recipients more debt-laden, inflation-prone, vulnerable to the vagaries of the currency markets, and unattractive to higher-quality investment. They claim that grant-based assistance as a platform for development is contradictory to sustainable economic growth and can squash private sector efforts in commercial markets. They claim debt-based assistance is worse, requiring loans to be repaid at the expense of recipient country's education, health, and infrastructure investments. Further, large inflows of foreign capital may have the effect of killing off a country's export sector by causing domestic currency to strengthen against foreign ones (referred to by economists as \"Dutch Disease\"). As a counter to the practice of international financial assistance, these commentators promote a strategy of development that emphasizes the role of entrepreneurship and private markets over an aid system based on cycles of transfer flows.", "Lack of Consensus on Climate Science: Some critics point to scientific uncertainties and ambiguities within the fields of atmospheric chemistry and climatology as reasons to postpone and/or reconsider international climate change assistance policies and programs. They contend that the current scientific findings on climate change may not be sufficient to warrant government action, either domestic measures to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change or international policy actions and financial assistance to support other countries' efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Support", "paragraphs": ["Commercial In terests : Some advocates argue that international climate change assistance to lower-income countries to support low-emission economic growth could benefit U.S. businesses through increased trade, commerce, and economic activity in the global marketplace. They contend that American clean energy and environmental management companies are well positioned to provide the innovative technology and services needed to meet the rapidly growing demand in emerging economies. Increased financing would not only promote development in the host country, but allow U.S. industries to make competitive inroads into rapidly expanding markets, improve the advancement and commercialization of U.S. technologies, mobilize greater investment in domestic sectors, and enhance job creation in the United States. Decreased funding may cede American influence in global markets to other economic powers still engaged with lower-income countries on environmental and natural resource issues (e.g., the European Union, China).", "Investment Efficienc ies : Some advocates claim that the costs of responding to tomorrow's climate-related catastrophes, instabilities, conflicts, and technological needs would be much higher than the costs of working today to prevent them through emissions reductions. \"Each year of delay will lock in an increased amount of old [i.e., high-emissions] technology,\" according to the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Economists often note that lower-income countries account for nearly all of the recent growth in global emissions and represent the cheapest opportunity to mitigate GHG pollution as part of a cost-effective solution. Additionally, some are concerned that locking in the developing world to a reliance on older, more GHG-intensive technologies during economic development may limit their flexibility and increase their costs to respond efficiently to future pollution abatement or climate resilient strategies. (Sometimes this is called a problem of \"stranded capital.\") Economists view some level of early investment as efficient, to hedge against these future risks. ", "Natural Disaster Preparedness: Some advocates point to international climate change assistance as a means to assist in global disaster preparedness. They claim that recorded natural disasters continue to increase each year resulting in more casualties and mounting economic losses. They assert that extreme weather events have lead to increased droughts, food shortages, and resource competition, which, in turn, has lead in some cases to population displacement and migration. Some have proposed that increased international assistance to climate change adaptation programs could help avoid capital and other losses (e.g., buildings, infrastructure, etc.), minimize the redirection of strategic resources to ad hoc disaster response and urgent humanitarian needs, and avoid chronic humanitarian crises, such as food shortages, particularly for the resource poor in the least developed countries.", "National Security: Some advocates argue that international climate change assistance could help address risks to national security. According to a 2008 National Intelligence Assessment, the impacts of global climate change may worsen problems of poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, and weak political institutions across the developing world. In October 2010, Chairman Mullen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff highlighted that climate change creates conditions \"that could lead to failed states and make populations vulnerable to radicalization.\" Combating environmental drivers such as climate change, desertification, biodiversity loss, and deforestation could reduce the instability caused by the scarcity of, and potential competition for, resources like water, food, and habitat. Some see international financial assistance for climate change as a means to help make lower-income countries less susceptible to these threats, for the benefit of both the lower-income country and the security interests of the United States.", "International Leadership: Some advocates contend that international climate change assistance to lower-income countries helps the United States improve its leadership in global environmental issues. Through leadership, the United States may be able to influence and set important international economic and environmental policies, practices, and standards. But leadership\u2014apropos of voting share\u2014is tied directly to the level of financial contribution in many multilateral organizations. Some believe that delivering on financial pledges is an important opportunity for the United States to demonstrate credibility and support negotiations not just on environment, but on economic and security issues as well. Withdrawing commitments may cede American influence in world affairs to other economic powers still engaged with lower-income countries on environmental and natural resource issues (e.g., the European Union, China). Weakened influence could manifest in challenges to political negotiations, economic relationships, trade preferences, and future collaborations.", "International Obligations: Many advocates stress that the commitment to international climate change assistance to lower-income countries is codified in current multilateral agreements. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), signed in 1992, the United States and other industrialized countries listed in Annex II of the Convention committed to provide financial and technical assistance to help lower-income countries' efforts to meet their UNFCCC obligations. While these commitments are legally binding, they are vaguely defined, making them impractical to quantify and enforce. More recent negotiations have striven to produce more quantified figures, and the Copenhagen Accord of 2009 produced an agreement by the wealthiest countries to provide $30 billion of \"fast start\" financing in the period 2010 to 2012 and to seek $100 billion annually by 2020. However, these financial targets are not legally binding, and accounting and enforcement remain difficult.", "Equity Issues: Some advocates consider international climate change assistance to lower-income countries a moral responsibility and a matter of climate equity. Not only have today's high-income economies generated about 80% of past fossil fuel-based emissions, but those same emissions have helped carry them to high levels of social and economic well-being. Past behavior arguably calls for the industrialized countries to provide funding to reduce the current and future risks imposed on others.

These costs would aim to address some combination of mitigation activities (i.e., actions taken to eliminate or reduce the long-term risk and hazards of climate change) and adaptation activities (i.e., actions taken to adjust to climate change, moderate potential damage, or cope with the consequences). Estimates of the projected costs vary widely depending upon assumptions made about the accepted levels of pollution, the ambitiousness of the global response, its structure, timing, and implementation, the potential climate-related damages, the affected sectors, as well as the methods of sourcing and delivering the necessary funds. The stricter the emissions target, the higher the estimate.

Both mitigation costs and mitigation financing are estimated for stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at 450 ppm CO 2 e; adaptation investments are estimated for a variety of assistance categories for both 2010 and 2030.

One recent study has contributions for mitigation-specific assistance at approximately $20 billion annually. Very few studies have addressed current contributions for adaptation assistance. Many claim that assessing climate-related financial and investment flows is a formidable challenge, given the inconsistencies across reporting systems, the many data gaps (with the further challenge of identifying the contributions of underlying finance, which unlike specific climate finance is not reported as such), and the complex web of flows (with the possibility of double counting)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Estimates of the total net costs and financing requirements needed for mitigation and adaptation activities in lower-income countries are often based on economic models of pollution abatement costs and/or adaptation investments aggregated across sectors and regions.

In higher and lower-income countries alike, mitigation measures aim to reduce current levels of emissions and to emphasize low-GHG development. Strategies include transitioning to a low-emissions energy supply; capturing the opportunities in energy efficiency improvements in buildings, transportation, and industry; reducing deforestation and improving sustainable forest management to better serve as GHG emissions sinks; and employing more low-emissions and sustainable agriculture practices. In the future, it could also entail actions that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequestering it permanently, or other geoengineering technologies.", "Estimates have been made of the incremental costs of various mitigation strategies. Figure 1 shows one example of what analysts refer to as an \"Emissions Abatement Cost Curve.\" The purpose of the curve is to summarize the many emission reduction strategies available, and to characterize their emission reduction potential as well as their net costs, if the strategy is \"pursued aggressively.\" The curve charts the amount of potential reductions (expressed along the horizontal axis in gigaton of CO 2 e abated per year) against the cost of specific measures (expressed along the vertical axis in cost per ton of CO 2 e abated). Of particular note, the curve shows that many abatement opportunities exist with net negative costs (approximately one-third of potential reductions), meaning that the measures may pay for themselves within the useful lifetime of the investment through efficiency savings (e.g., switching from incandescent light bulbs to LEDs would both reduce emissions and save money in the long run due to the extended product life and energy efficiency of LEDs). These negative cost options (shown on the left of the graph) are mainly found in energy efficiency measures in building, transportation, and industry as well as some fuel switching, recycling, and waste management practices. For emission reduction strategies in the agriculture and forestry sectors (e.g., improved agriculture practices, afforestation, reforestation), most options have low to moderate costs. Many of the low to moderate cost options fall within the curve's margin for error and are arguably breakeven estimates. Sectors with relatively high cost reduction opportunities are in some energy production options, with some emerging technologies having even higher costs than are represented on the graph given their nascent state of development. ", " Figure 1 demonstrates that ideally if all possible mitigation measures were taken on the cost curve in strict order from lowest-cost to higher-cost in sequence (i.e., from replacing all residential incandescents with LEDs all the way up to retrofitting all coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage technologies), global emissions abatement of 38 GtCO 2 e could be achieved in 2030. At this rate, the average cost of the abatement opportunities would be $5 per tCO 2 e in 2030, and the total cost for realizing the whole curve would be $187.5 billion in the year 2030. Transaction and program costs\u2014not represented on the curve\u2014are often estimated at an average of between $1.25 and $6.25 per tCO 2 e abated, making the total annual global cost approximately $250 billion to $375 billion by 2030. While an abatement cost of $6 to $12 per tCO 2 e is reasonable in light of current economic discussions on climate change, many commentators stress that mitigation costs are extremely sensitive to policy choices. They increase steeply with the stringency of the emission reduction target and with the desired degree of certainty of reaching it. Global mitigation costs would likewise rise to the degree that the world deviates from a least-cost emission pathway (e.g., not tapping low cost reductions in lower-income countries in the initial mitigation effort would increase global costs significantly). Further, the failure to allow for all mitigation opportunities would likewise increase overall costs (e.g., only concentrating on energy efficiency measures and not on forest and agricultural management could increase overall costs)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Costs: Capital Intensity, or Up-Front Costs", "paragraphs": ["Many commentators note that low-emission investments for mitigation activities often have high up-front capital costs, followed later by overall savings in operating costs.

Figure 2 shows that in some cases the difference between capital intensity costs and net costs can be as much as a factor of two to four, depending on the rate of opportunity costs assumed. The McKinsey & Company estimate concludes that the total global upfront investment needed for abatement measures would be $1,012.5 billion per year in 2030\u2014incremental to BAU investments.

Lower-income countries are generally more vulnerable to climate change because their economies are more dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism. Further, with lower per capita incomes, weaker institutions, and limited access to technology, lower-income countries are considered to have less adaptive capacity. See Figure 3 for one analysis of vulnerability and social capacity by country and region. The figure shows that in many cases a lower social capacity (as measured by literacy, education, health, and governance indexes) may make countries more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.", "Estimating the costs of adaptation with precision is difficult, not only because adaptation measures are widespread and heterogeneous, but also because the measures are embedded in the broader network of economic development strategies. While any investment in education, health, sanitation, and security, for example, may constitute good development, it also may help reduce socioeconomic vulnerability to both climactic and non-climactic stress factors. A variety of studies have tried to estimate the incremental costs of adaptation in low-income countries. Methods, definitions, and scopes of adaptation in these studies vary, accounting for many of the differences in cost estimates. In particular, many estimates assume that some portion of the incremental costs will be covered by the recipient countries themselves. Some studies attempt to consider \"all\" costs of adaptation to climate change and resulting damages (although none are comprehensive); some include just large-scale adaptation costs (i.e., not private measures taken by individuals); and some try to discern just the need for public financing for adaptation. The UNFCCC Secretariat estimates that the additional annual investment and financial flows needed worldwide would be on the order of $49 billion to $171 billion by 2030, with $30 billion to $73 billion needed for lower-income countries (the largest element of uncertainty in the UNFCCC estimate lies in the cost of infrastructure adaptation).

The section below outlines possible sources for international climate change financing in a privately constituted and self-regulated market. Public sector interventions to stimulate private capital investments are addressed in the next section.", "Foreign Direct Investment : Foreign direct investment is the long-term participatory investment in the ownership of productive assets\u2014such as factories, mines, and land\u2014by a multinational corporation in a developing country's energy, industry, or transport sector. It can be a relatively stable source of financing. It has the greatest advantages in mitigation activities, in terms of transferring technology and standards which could allow economic development to leapfrog into more climate-friendly sectors such as energy efficiency and renewable energy. Many high-emission sectors\u2014such as road transport, metals, mining, chemicals, timber, and cement\u2014are dominated by large multinational corporations, and their investments and practices may likely have a big influence on the timing of alternative development pathways in lower-income countries. However, given that foreign direct investment tends to lag rather than lead economic growth, it is unlikely to play a significant role in the early stages of a shift onto such a development pathway, particularly given the initial high degree of uncertainty and the absence of the in-country inputs that large international firms need in order to operate efficiently. ", "Portfolio Investment : Portfolio investment is the purchase of stocks, bonds, and money market instruments by foreigners for the purpose of realizing a financial return but not resulting in foreign management, ownership, or legal control. It could also be a stable source of international climate change financing. Investment could be mobilized through venture capital funds or specific \"green\" funds. It could appeal to investors willing to allocate investments to options that might generate less return but have greater potential in terms of climate change mitigation and socially responsible business practices. Currently, almost all \"green\" investment opportunities are concentrated in the more industrialized countries or the countries with emerging economies. Funds made available through this channel to lower-income countries have been both limited and skewed in favor of one or two countries.

Once determined, these costs could be internalized through economic incentives (e.g., setting emissions levels or compliance pricing, etc.) to help drive pollution abatement.

For example, tradable permit programs set the amount of emissions allowable under the program (i.e., the number of permits available limits, or \"caps,\" allowable emissions), while allowing the marketplace to determine what each permit will be worth. Likewise, carbon fees set the maximum unit cost (per ton of CO 2 e) that one should pay for reducing emissions. Private decisions would determine how or how much pollution actually gets reduced.

Those that could reduce their emissions more cheaply could potentially sell their allowances on the market. Some cap and trade programs would auction all permits during the initial issuance. Some programs would phase in permits through a period of free or reduced price allocations of permits. Some programs include a mechanism whereby firms could gain emission credits through pollution reductions performed in economic sectors outside of the regulated market (e.g., agriculture, forestry, or in countries or regions not covered by the program).

AAUs are issued up to the level of initial \"assigned amount\" of an Annex 1 Party. Some countries support sourcing revenue for international climate change activities by retaining some allowances from the Annex I countries and then auctioning them. c.

By increasing the cost of emissions, emission fees raise public revenue, any or all of which could be transferred and used for international climate change assistance to lower-income countries. Emission fees are occasionally referred to as \"carbon taxes\"; under guidelines of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, a \"tax\" is primarily for generating revenues, while a user (i.e., emissions) fee is primarily to charge for an entity's use of a resource (e.g., the atmosphere as a place to discharge waste emissions).

Some are concerned that funding is not shifted merely from one type of development assistance to climate change assistance, with little or no increase comparable to the stated needs. \"Additional\" is meant to denote an increment above and beyond \"business-as-usual.\" However, speculating as to counterfactual development assistance trajectories that would have taken place if not for the \"additional\" funding is rife with debate.

Historically, bilateral assistance has dominated the foreign aid landscape, and it remains potentially the most direct and timely method of reaching a destination and working for a recipient government. Environmental contributions by multilateral organizations have been criticized for a lack of cost efficiency, a focus on economic development in lieu of the environment, and the imposition of requirements for global environmental benefits as opposed to local, environmentally sound development. But proponents stress that multilateral assistance tends to be less tied to the political self-interest of individual donor countries, allows for the efficient pooling of financial resources and the leveraging of additional monies, helps ensure that different bilateral arrangements do not work at cross-purposes, and serves to develop a sense of cooperation among nations with the additional advantage of reducing conflict.", "The Complex Institutional Architecture : Whether it is the United Nations family of agencies, the World Bank Group, or any number of countries and their development agencies, the plethora of actors engaged in climate financing is unwieldy to many recipient countries. Larger bureaucracies tend to slow and dampen performance, reduce flexibility and transparency, and heighten transaction costs. As mechanisms for climate finance proliferate, each new or special-purpose fund carries with it a set of challenges, including redesigned institutional and governance functions, inefficient allocations, and limitations on scaling up. These challenges threaten to reduce the overall effectiveness of climate finance because as transaction costs increase, recipient country ownership lags and alignment with country development objectives becomes more difficult. ", "The Limitations of Current Market Mechanism s : The UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism has demonstrated that markets can stimulate emission reductions, provide essential learning, and build capacity. But some attest that mechanisms such as the CDM contain inherent inefficiencies, including a relatively weak and inefficient UNFCCC governance structure, an inability to successfully generate local economic co-benefits, an uneven distribution of projects that is geared toward higher-income emerging economies, a weakness in incentives to foster real transformations to a low-carbon economy, and a debate over the additionality of a given project's reductions (i.e., a debate over if the enacted emission reductions paid for by the mechanism are additional to actions that otherwise would have occurred). ", "The Choice between Top-Down or Bottom-Up: Whether purposeful or not, the international community is currently operating under a disjointed set of mechanisms which encourages fragmentation of the global response to climate change. Some argue that the \"bottom-up\" approach offers competition for market share, flexibility in international commitments, and a greater leeway to manage climate change action on individual terms, including accounting for different views of national circumstances, domestic politics, legal backgrounds, economic costs, and competitiveness exposures. The United States and other higher-income countries, as well as some emerging economies such as China, often stress the bottom-up approach as a way to protect international political issues (such as sovereign rights) and international economic issues (such as the globalization of markets). Others find fragmentation to be a great detriment to effectiveness, efficiency, and equity at a time when the international community may wish to bring together a myriad of elements into a single, functioning, strategic framework. Most lower-income countries tend to support a centralized, top-down mechanism situated in the UNFCCC, or the United Nations at large. They may perceive a heightened sense of coordination, consistency, and transparency afforded by these institutions through their \"one country: one vote\" paradigm.

Similarly, no federally legislated market-based mechanism has been instituted that would contribute funds generated from the private sector for international climate change assistance (e.g., a GHG cap-and-trade program, which could incentivize international private capital investment through offset markets or provide internationally targeted funds through an allocation of auction or offset revenue)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Contributions", "paragraphs": ["U.S. participation in international negotiations for global environmental assistance stretches at least back to the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE), the first concerted effort by the international community to focus on the environment as a major topic of concern and attention. Therein, discussions among representatives from both industrialized and lower-income countries gave rise to a compromise on a doctrine to address both environmental and developmental policy. Governments at the time agreed that (1) the environment and development are two mutually reinforcing sides of the same coin, and (2) that industrialized countries would accept the principle of \"incrementality\" by which they would pay some or all of the additional costs of environmental initiatives in the developing world above and beyond the basic costs of development. The relationship between the environment and development was further developed at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in the document called Agenda 21 , wherein a blueprint was detailed for putting sustainable development into practice. Agenda 21 also doubled the pledge by the industrial world to assist lower-income countries in poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Although Agenda 21 was impressive in its scope and comprehensiveness, the policy was non-binding; and some observers note that \"the whole enterprise [was] heavily dependent on strong leadership from major countries, adequate financing, and effective institutional arrangements for follow-up ... none of which materialized.\"", "Financial pledges were made to support climate change initiatives specifically under the 1992 United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The United States, as a Party to the UNFCCC, has committed to providing financial and technical assistance to lower-income countries' efforts in meeting their respective obligations. Historically, some of this assistance has flowed through the Global Environment Facility\u2014the official financial mechanism of the UNFCCC\u2014to which the United States has contributed funding since 1993. Further, at the 2009 UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP) in Copenhagen, Denmark, and at the 2010 COP in Cancun, Mexico, the United States helped negotiate a package that included developed country pledges of an aggregated $30 billion of \"fast start\" climate financing for the period 2010 to 2012 and $100 billion annually by 2020. This funding is to come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance, and be delivered through both new and existing fund arrangements, with governance structures providing for equal representation of developed and developing countries. These negotiations are still pending and are currently non-binding. The 2011 COP is scheduled to meet during December in Durban, South Africa to further negotiations toward a potentially binding treaty. The Obama Administration has not yet specified what share of pledges it envisions the United States providing, nor a strategy for how to fulfill the long-term pledge.", "Historically, the United States' credibility on international climate change financing has been impaired by periodic under-funding. The United States is currently $217 million in arrears for its assessed contributions to the Global Environment Facility (i.e., 10% of the total U.S. pledge of $2,185 million since 1994). Also, though the Bush Administration helped establish the Clean Technology Fund in 2008 under the World Bank and pledged to help capitalize it, the U.S. Congress declined to appropriate the first U.S. payment of $400 million requested by the Administration for FY2009, and is far short of the $2 billion aggregated pledge the Bush Administration made for the period 2008-2012.
