This step has been taken to provide consistency when comparing funding levels across the fiscal years. Since the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2010, VA benefits and services (except medical programs) have been funded under a series of five continuing resolutions (CRs)\u2014 P.L. 111-242 ; P.L. 111-290 ; P.L. 111-317 ; P.L. 111-322 ; and P.L. 112-4 .

The VA's budget is comprised of both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation, life insurance, and burial benefits, among other benefits and services. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services with a majority of funding going towards providing medical care to veterans. According to the President's budget documents, in FY2010 the total VA budget authority was approximately $127.2 billion. The FY2012 budget request for the VA is for approximately $132.1 billion in budget authority. ", "The VA's health care program is funded through multiple appropriations accounts that are supplemented by other sources of revenue. The appropriation accounts used to support VA health care programs include (1) medical services, (2) medical administration (currently known as medical support and compliance), (3) medical facilities, and (4) medical and prosthetic research. In addition to direct appropriations accounts mentioned above, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-272 ), enacted into law in 1986, gave the VA the authority to bill some veterans and most health care insurers for nonservice-connected care provided to veterans enrolled in the VA health care system, to help defray the cost of delivering medical services to veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ) gave the VA the authority to retain these funds in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF).

While Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are also publicly funded programs, most health care services under these programs are delivered by private providers in private facilities. In contrast, the VA health care system could be categorized as a veteran-specific national health care system, in the sense that the federal government owns the medical facilities and employs the health care providers. The VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). Although policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters to be applied throughout the VA health care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. As of FY2010, VHA operates 152 hospitals (medical centers), 133 nursing homes, 791 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 300 Readjustment Counseling Centers (Vet Centers). In 2009, VA began a pilot Mobile Vet Center (MVC) program to improve access to services for veterans in rural areas, and the Department has deployed 50 MVCs.

Inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). The VHA also provides grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities and collaborates with the Department of Defense (DOD) in sharing health care resources and services.", "Apart from providing direct patient care to veterans, VHA's other statutory missions are to conduct medical research, to serve as a contingency backup to the Department of Defense (DOD) medical system during a national security emergency, to provide support to the National Disaster Medical System and the Department of Health and Human Services as necessary, and to train health care professionals in order to provide an adequate supply of health personnel for the VA and the nation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Veteran Patient Population", "paragraphs": ["In FY2011 approximately 8.4 million of the 22.1 million living veterans in the nation were enrolled in the VA health care system.
