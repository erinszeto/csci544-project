Tasked with providing a comprehensive review of the care provided to injured servicemembers returning from the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the commission issued several recommendations to the President, Congress, DOD, and VA in a final report. Among these recommendations were several DOD and VA recommendations to strengthen family support programs, including providing \"families of servicemembers who require long-term personal care with appropriate training and counseling to support them in their new caregiving roles.\" ", "VA Advisory Committee on OEF/OIF Veterans and Families", "In April 2007, VA established an independent advisory committee to assess the situation of OEF/OIF veterans and families. The committee was tasked with examining existing VA benefits and services and the need for new benefits and services tailored to OEF/OIF veterans. Committee membership included representation from veterans, family members, and caregivers, as well as veteran service organizations and other advocates and specialists. In 2008, the committee issued an interim report with preliminary observations and recommendations that centered around several themes, including family and caregivers. The Advisory Committee's recommendations, among others, were to increase support to families and caregivers. Specifically, the committee's recommendations and findings consisted of three priorities for caregivers: (1) mental health counseling services for those caregiving for severely injured veterans, particularly over a prolonged time period; (2) financial counseling and fiscal support while caring for severely disabled veterans, as well as training programs; and (3) enhanced efforts regarding information and education about available VA benefits and services.", "VA Caregiver Advisory Board", "In June 2008, VA established an interdisciplinary Caregiver Advisory Board to develop a caregiver assistance program. The board's chartered activities include identifying core caregiver needs, developing initial recommendations for VA caregiver support services, and overseeing eight caregiver assistance pilot programs. The pilot programs were conceptualized in December 2007 to examine ways to improve education and to provide training and resources for caregivers assisting veterans. Most of the programs focus on supporting caregivers of veterans with specific conditions, such as dementia and traumatic brain injury. These pilot programs were conducted through the end of FY2009.", "Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010", "Leading up to enactment of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-163 ), the 111 th Congress engaged in considerable debate and deliberation about various legislative proposals to assist family caregivers of veterans. The following provides a legislative history of significant proposals to address assistance to family caregivers of veterans and, more specifically, veterans injured in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. This history begins with legislation first enacted in the 109 th Congress to address greater services and support to family caregivers and ends with passage of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 in the 111 th Congress.", "The initial congressional response to providing assistance to family caregivers of veterans from recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan dates back to the 109 th Congress. On May 4, 2006, S. 2753 was introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka. The bill would have required a VA program to improve the provision of caregiver assistance services for veterans. Although the bill did not necessarily focus on caregiving assistance to veterans serving in recent conflicts, but rather all veterans, in his introductory speech Senator Akaka stated:", "With more veterans returning from combat with severely debilitating injuries, young spouses and parents have been forced to take on an unexpected role as caregivers. Many have interrupted their own careers to dedicate time and attention to the care and rehabilitation of loved ones. These caregivers do not plan for this to happen and are not prepared mentally or financially for their new role. Therefore, we must protect, educate, and lend a helping hand to the caregivers who take on the responsibility and costly burden of caring for veterans, both young and old. This legislation serves to provide comprehensive assistance to these caregivers.", "Provisions from S. 2753 were included as Section 214 of the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and Information Technology Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-461 ) and enacted on December 22, 2006. P.L. 109-461 authorized VA to conduct a two-year pilot program to improve assistance provided to caregivers, particularly in home-based settings, and authorized $5 million to be appropriated for each of FY2007 and FY2008. The 110 th Congress extended authorization of the caregiver assistance pilot programs through the end of FY2009 under Section 809 of the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-387 ).", "Assistance to family caregivers received further legislative attention in the 111 th Congress, with legislative proposals introduced to specifically target caregivers of veterans injured while serving in OEF/OIF.

In his introductory remarks, Senator Akaka stated:", "Some veterans returning from the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as previous conflicts, suffer from disabilities that prevent them from being fully independent. This is a sad fact of war. The legislation I am introducing today is designed to provide for several improvements in health care for veterans by supporting the family members who care for them. The challenges faced by family caregivers are well known to us. We have been working on this issue for nearly two years \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think we are now beyond the scope of that original pilot program and I believe that a full-fledged permanent program is needed in VA that would have a national program for the caregivers of seriously injured veterans to provide them with education, grants, counseling, and other support services.

As passed by the House, H.R. 3155 would have required VA to provide support services (including CHAMPVA medical care and stipends) to the eligible caregivers of OEF and OIF veterans. To be eligible, veterans would need to meet three conditions: (1) have a severe service-connected disability or illness; (2) be in need of caregiver services, such that without such services, the veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care; and (3) be unable to carry out the activities of daily living (including instrumental activities of daily living).", "A \"hold\" was placed on S. 801 that prevented the Senate from considering this measure. Subsequently, on October 28, 2009, Senator Akaka introduced a separate bill, the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 ( S. 1963 ), which included provisions from S. 801 , among other provisions. S. 1963 was passed by the Senate on November 11, 2009. The family caregiver provisions in the Senate-passed bill would have waived charges for humanitarian care to attendants of covered veterans under certain circumstances; provided family caregiver assistance including training, respite care, mental health services, and stipends; and provided lodging and subsistence for family caregivers. It would have also required VA, in coordination with DOD, to design and conduct a survey on caregivers and family caregivers.", "On April 22, 2010, an amended version of S. 1963 was passed by Congress.

On May 5, 2010, President Obama signed into law P.L. 111-163 , the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010. Title I of the act provides programs and services to provide support to caregivers of veterans.", "Following enactment of the 2010 legislation that established the Caregiver Support Program, there were a number of legislative attempts to expand eligibility for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to veterans of all eras.
