In the same period, foreign trade has grown dramatically; thus, pollution from shipping and port operations is growing as a percentage of total emissions. In many cities, ships are now among the largest sources of air pollution. As Congress and the Administration turn their attention to climate change, there is also a growing recognition that marine vessels are an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", "Controlling these sources of both conventional and greenhouse gas pollutants is complicated by the fact that most ocean-going ships are not registered in the United States and may not even purchase the fuel they are using here. Thus, controlling such pollution would seem to lend itself to an international approach. Such efforts have been slow to yield results: in 1997, the United States and most countries signed an international agreement known as MARPOL Annex VI, setting extremely modest controls on air pollution from ships, but the agreement did not enter into force until 2005, and the United States did not enact legislation to implement it until July 21, 2008 (P.L. 110-280). Negotiations to strengthen Annex VI accelerated in 2008, however, and amendments that will strengthen its provisions have received preliminary approval. Discussions regarding GHG emissions have also begun, although without results to date.", "While awaiting congressional action and international agreement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), port cities, and states have begun to act on their own. This report discusses a number of these efforts, including EPA measures that will require cleaner fuels and will greatly strengthen emission standards, and measures being implemented in California to reduce pollution from ships and ports.", "In the current Congress, greenhouse gas emissions from ships are addressed in H.R. 2454, the Waxman-Markey climate change bill. As passed by the House, the bill would direct EPA to establish emission standards for nonroad vehicles and engines (a category that includes ships), by December 31, 2012.", "In other action, Congress added a provision to the FY2010 EPA appropriation (P.L. 111-88) that prohibits FY2010 funds being used to implement cleaner fuel requirements as they apply to Great Lakes ships.

Although emission controls have reduced pollution from new cars and trucks by more than 90%, most ocean-going ships operate without any pollution controls at all. New and remanufactured engines on tug boats, ferries, and other smaller ships are subject to emission controls beginning in 2008 and 2009, but most existing engines in vessels of these types remain uncontrolled.", "Pollution from ships is also affected by the fuel they use. Marine vessels other than oceangoing ships have been required to use cleaner fuels, but ocean-going ships generally use bunker fuel, a fuel that contains a high level of contaminants: the average fuel used by oceangoing ships contains 27,000 parts per million (ppm) sulfur, for example\u2014almost 2,000 times as much as would be allowed in trucks operating on U.S. roads.", "In the Los Angeles-Long Beach area\u2014which is both the nation's busiest port and the nation's most polluted area \u2014the problem is particularly acute. According to the South Coast [L.A.-Long Beach] Air Quality Management District (AQMD):", "Oceangoing vessels are among the largest sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the area, emitting more NOx than all power plants and refineries in the South Coast air basin combined. NOx reacts with volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere to produce ozone/smog. 70% of the area's emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) come from ships. These emissions need to be cut by over 90%, according to the AQMD, if the area is to attain the national air quality standard for particulates by the 2014 deadline. Particulates from marine vessels also create significant cancer risks; more than 700 premature deaths are caused in the Los Angeles area annually by these emissions, according to the AQMD. ", "While the Los Angeles-Long Beach area may be the most extreme example, the problem is not limited to L.A. or to California. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), more than 40 U.S. ports nationwide are located in \"nonattainment\" areas for ozone, fine particulates, or both ( Figure 1 ). In addition, according to EPA, \"... the problem is not limited to port areas alone. Santa Barbara County, which has no commercial ports, estimates that by 2020, 67 percent of its NOx inventory will come from shipping traffic transiting the California coast.... \"", "Oceangoing ships are perhaps the largest source of port emissions, but they are not the only source. Ports make use of tug boats to guide ships entering and leaving the harbor. Ports make connections to land-based transportation networks, such as railroads, and they generally operate large truck terminals. Ships at rest in the port need a source of power, which often comes from running auxiliary engines. And, in many cases, a harbor is served by substantial local boat or barge traffic, sometimes including ferry service.

The largest of these engines\u2014the main engines on oceangoing ships\u2014are diesel engines with a per-cylinder displacement at or above 30 liters. These are referred to as \"Category 3\" or \"C3\" engines.

But it is important to bear three factors in mind, as one considers the potential impact of the new regulations. First, the new EPA emission standards will only apply to engines installed on vessels flagged or registered in the United States. In 2007, only 6.7% of the world's ocean-going ships (and only 1.2%, if measured by carrying capacity) were registered in the United States. Thus, EPA's emission standards for C3 engines by themselves (i.e., apart from the similar Annex VI rules) will have little effect on the overall level of pollution from ocean-going ships. Second, when the more stringent requirements do take effect, they will apply only to new and remanufactured engines, so improvements resulting from the standards will be gradual. Third, EPA will be able to achieve more substantial emission reductions through standards for marine fuel. These will affect emissions from both new and existing engines, and from both U.S.- and foreign-flagged ships. The new C3 standards will require substantially cleaner fuel, a point to which we will return after describing the existing and proposed rules in more detail.", "Current C3 engine standards were promulgated February 28, 2003, and went into effect in 2004. These standards mirrored the relatively lenient requirements of Annex VI, adopted by the IMO in 1997. In October 1999, EPA also established a voluntary certification program so that engine manufacturers could show that their new engines were compliant with Annex VI. EPA believes that all marine Category 3 diesel engines sold in the United States since January 1, 2000, have met Annex VI requirements. ", "When the 2003 standards were promulgated, EPA set itself a deadline of April 2007 to promulgate stronger standards for C3 engines. EPA subsequently reset this deadline to December 2009: the Administrator signed new regulations December 18. Thus, 2009 has seen several developments that will strengthen emission standards for ships and expand the use of cleaner fuels. The new standards are in line with the Annex VI amendments that were negotiated in 2008. EPA has also proposed to add U.S. waters to those areas designated as Emission Control Areas under the annex. Specifically:", "On March 27, 2009, EPA proposed that the entire U.S. coastline except portions of Alaska be designated by the IMO as an Emission Control Area (ECA), subject to the lower sulfur limits in bunker fuel discussed above. As shown in Figure 2 , the proposed ECA includes the entire coastline of the contiguous 48 states, Southeastern Alaska, and the main Hawaiian Islands, extending to a distance of 200 nautical miles from shore. EPA anticipates that this amendment will be adopted at the next IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting (MEPC 60) which is scheduled for March 2010. Adoption of the ECA will set sulfur limits of 10,000 ppm as early as August 2012, and 1,000 ppm effective January 1, 2015. On July 1, 2009, EPA proposed regulations that will strengthen emission standards for new C3 marine engines and will implement the low sulfur fuel requirements that apply in ECAs starting in 2015. These regulations were finalized, with relatively minor changes on December 18, 2009. New marine engines will be required to meet these standards in two phases: Tier 2, which would apply to new engines beginning in 2011, would require \"more efficient use of current engine technologies, including engine timing, engine cooling, and advanced computer controls,\" resulting in a 15% to 25% reduction in NOx emissions, compared to Tier 1 standards; Tier 3, effective in 2016, would reduce NOx emissions from new engines 80% below current standards through the application of aftertreatment technology such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), a technology now widely used at electric power plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reaction to the New Standards", "paragraphs": ["In general, the Category 3 engine standards and the ECA proposal have been supported by the shipping industry and by environmental groups.

Of the 2020 costs, nearly 89% are attributable to the use of lower-sulfur fuel in the proposed ECA. These costs are substantial, but they will be spread over such a huge volume of traded goods that they may be little noticed. According to the agency:", "These costs are expected to be completely passed on to the consumers of ocean transportation. The impacts of these costs on society are estimated to be minimal, resulting in a small increase in the goods transported. For example, EPA estimates it will result in an increase of about $0.01 for a pair of tennis shoes, and about $0.03 for a bushel of grain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Great Lakes Ships", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the ECA and Category 3 rules was their proposed application to the large ships that ply the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes would be included in the proposed ECA and, therefore, ships operating on the lakes would be required to burn low sulfur fuels under the ECA proposal. ", "More than 100 U.S.- and Canadian-flagged cargo ships operate on the Great Lakes. These ships generally carry bulk cargoes, including iron ore, coal, limestone, agricultural products, and rock salt. The associations that represent the U.S. and Canadian ship owners estimate that they carry as much as 150 million tons of cargo annually. ", "Many of these ships are old. The Lake Carriers' Association (LCA) identified one U.S.-flagged vessel built in 1906 and 17 others built between 1929 and 1960 that are still in operation. Thirteen of these ships have powerplants that were designed to burn heavy residual fuel. According to the LCA, ", "It is theoretically possible to switch the fuel supply system for the boilers to distillate fuel. However, it would require modifications including new fuel pumps, bypass of the fuel heating systems, new burners and burner tips, and possibly new air diffusers. A number of upgrades to the automation system would also have to have been done to ensure the proper air to fuel ratio and that the fuel cut off valves are sufficient to ensure that absolutely no diesel fuel enters the boiler in the off position.", "LCA estimated the cost of converting these 13 steamers' powerplants to run on diesel fuel or of converting them to self-unloading barges powered by tugs to be $20 million to $27 million each. Another 13 vessels were identified by LCA as facing significant impacts because of higher fuel prices, even though they are able to safely burn low sulfur distillate fuel. ", "The case made by the Lake Carriers Association and other industry commenters that older Great Lakes ships will face significant impacts appears not to have been considered by EPA when it proposed the ECA and C3 regulations. The Category 3 Regulatory Impact Analysis did indicate, however, that switching from residual fuel to lower sulfur distillate would increase costs borne by shipping companies $145 per tonne of fuel, or 44%. For ocean-going ships, this cost increase is not as great as it might seem, since they operate in an ECA only a small percentage of the time and can burn dirtier fuel outside of ECAs. Great Lakes ships, however, operate in the proposed ECA 100% of the time, and thus would face a greater increase in costs.", "The Great Lakes shipping companies made a sufficiently persuasive case that Congress addressed their concerns.

It is important that EPA structure such a waiver provision similar to the other fuels rules, where parties can apply for and receive a waiver in sufficient time prior to the implementation of the requirements.

Of the first $156 million awarded, at least $29 million went for diesel reduction activities at ports, including $8 million to California ports.

Although there is a wide range of estimates, the International Maritime Organization's consensus is that international shipping emitted 843 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, 2.7% of global CO 2 emissions in 2007. Including domestic shipping and fishing vessels larger than 100 gross tonnes, the amount would increase to 1.019 billion tonnes, 3.3% of global emissions. At these levels, only five countries (the United States, China, Russia, India, and Japan) account for a higher percentage of the world total of CO 2 emissions. ", "In addition to the CO 2 emissions, the low quality fuel (bunker fuel) that ships use and the absence of pollution controls result in significant emissions of black carbon and nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to climate change. The refrigerants used on ships (hydrofluorcarbons and perfluorocarbons\u2014HFCs and PFCs) are also potent greenhouse gases when released to the atmosphere.

Addressing the emissions, therefore, is likely to require international agreement. On the international level, however, there has been disagreement over who should take responsibility to abate GHG emissions. Rather than cover these emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, nations agreed to look to the IMO for sector-specific provisions to reduce GHG emissions from shipping. The IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee has begun negotiations on the issue, and has stated that the issue is \"high on the Committee's agenda.\" Thus far, however, it has agreed only on voluntary guidelines on ship design and operational efficiency, while continuing to discuss market-based instruments to reduce GHG emissions. Some in the industry, including shipping industry associations from several European countries, have suggested applying a cap-and-trade scheme to shipping's GHG emissions. At U.N.-sponsored climate negotiations, on the other hand, there has been talk of imposing a tax on bunker fuel.", "As with many other sectors, the European Union has been a driving force in getting international consideration of controlling the shipping sector's GHG emissions. The EU has considered adding the shipping industry to its cap-and-trade system, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), but for now is deferring to the IMO. Approving a broad package of climate measures on December 17, 2008, the European Parliament left shipping out of the package, pending the outcome of the IMO discussions. Satu Hassi, a Finnish lawmaker from the Parliament's Green Group, who oversaw negotiations on emission reduction targets for non-ETS sectors, was quoted as saying the \"EU will act unilaterally\" should IMO discussions not produce sufficient results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shipping vs. Other Transport Modes", "paragraphs": ["Ocean-going ships are already by far the most efficient means of goods movement. As noted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD):", "While in absolute terms GHG emissions from international shipping are significant, in relative terms maritime transport \u2013 in particular where larger ships are used \u2013 surpasses other modes of transport in terms of fuel efficiency and climate friendliness. On a per ton kilometre (km) basis and depending on ship sizes, CO 2 emissions from shipping are lower than emissions from other modes. For example, emissions from rail could be 3 to 4 times higher than emissions from tankers, while emissions from road and air transport could, respectively, be 5 to 150 times and 54 to 150 times higher. Equally, in terms of fuel consumption (kilowatt (kW)/ton/km), a container ship (3,700 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs)), for instance, is estimated to consume on average 77 times less energy than a freight aircraft (Boeing 747-400), about 7 times less than a heavy truck and about 3 times less than rail.", "But, in general, shipping does not compete with other modes of transport. Only in a small number of cases involving high value or perishable commodities, or relatively short distances between countries that also have land links, are mode shifts between shipping and air, truck, or rail transport possible. Ships move more than 80% of the volume of international trade, and are likely to continue doing so. As the overall volume of trade grows, GHG emissions from shipping are projected to be 2.4 to 3 times the current level by 2050 unless control measures are adopted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measures to Reduce Ships' GHG Emissions", "paragraphs": ["A number of measures might be taken to reduce the shipping sector's GHG emissions. One of the more common suggestions is that ships operate at lower speeds. The IMO's 2000 study of GHG emissions from ships concluded that a 10% reduction in speed would result in a 23.3% reduction in emissions. Slowing speeds is not without problems. According to the 2000 IMO report:", "For most ship engines, running at reduced speed / slow steaming may ... cause problems. Such problems may be vibrations (critical RPM of engine / shaft) and accelerating sooting in the exhausted gas channel. Sooting problems are normally coincident with incomplete combustion and increasing GHG emission per fuel unit consumed. For ships permanently operating at slow speed, however, engine modifications / de-rating may be a solution.", "In addition, of course, cargo owners may consider the lost time in reaching the ship's destination to be more valuable than the fuel and GHG savings. Thus, in a competitive market with low fuel costs, ship owners will tend to offer as swift a service as they can safely provide. ", "Nevertheless, it is possible without changes in technology or fuels to achieve significant GHG emission reductions, and shipping companies have begun to implement slow steaming policies to reduce their emissions. A.P. Moller \u2013 Maersk Group, the world's largest container shipper, for example, reports that it reduced fuel consumption in its transport group 6% in 2008 compared to the fuel used for the same level of business activity in 2007. In addition to slow steaming, the company has implemented waste heat recovery systems on 32 ships, has installed software in containers to reduce energy consumption for cooling, and has developed a voyage planning program to identify the most fuel-efficient routes, and a \"just in time\" steady running strategy that minimizes engine loads.", "Cleaner fuels and emission controls could also lower emissions, particularly if one focuses on emissions of black carbon and nitrogen oxides. Like slow steaming, these could be implemented without the need to replace ship engines or the ships themselves.", "The use of alternative power in ports may also reduce GHG emissions, if the shore power is derived from low-carbon sources such as natural gas, or no-carbon sources (hydropower, wind, solar, or nuclear).", "New ships may be able to reduce emissions further through better hull design, more efficient propulsion, and propeller coatings, among other options.

Simultaneously, foreign trade has grown dramatically, adding to the burden of pollution from these sources. Thus, pollution from ships and the port operations that serve them is now among the most important sources of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and other pollutants in numerous U.S. cities.", "Controlling these sources of pollution is complicated by the fact that most oceangoing ships are registered in foreign countries. As a result, initial efforts at control were focused on international negotiations through the IMO, which established a basic structure (MARPOL Annex VI) that appears likely to be the basis of more stringent future controls. Negotiating, ratifying, and implementing MARPOL agreements has been time-consuming, but now has resulted in significant levels of regulation that will gradually be implemented over the next six years. EPA and state and local agencies (particularly those in California) have also begun to address pollution from ships using the Clean Air Act and comparable state authorities.", "Not all pollution from marine vessels comes from foreign ships. Smaller craft, such as ferries, tugboats, and fishing boats do tend to be registered in the United States, and are thus more amenable to control. Even for these smaller craft, the technical issues can be complex, as the vessels include a wide variety of engine sizes and ship configurations. Safety also poses important considerations, as ships must be able to depend on their sources of power in what may be extreme weather conditions and while dealing with a variety of navigational hazards. A particular issue has arisen regarding Great Lakes freighters, many of which were built more than 50 years ago, and might face significant costs in upgrading to burn cleaner fuel. The FY2010 appropriation for EPA has prohibited the expenditure of funds in this fiscal year to issue final fuel sulfur standards applicable to existing steamships operating exclusively within the Great Lakes, and accompanying report language states that EPA should develop waiver provisions available to these ships. ", "Because ships and port operations are now such significant sources of air pollution, and because of the importance of shipping to the national and world economy, implementation of the emissions regulations for ships and ports, including the cleaner fuels requirements, may continue to be of interest to Congress. In addition, ships are a large and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions; how and whether to regulate these emissions are the subject of IMO discussions and are a small part of the larger debate over legislation to address climate change.", "Congress has begun efforts to address these problems, by enacting legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI in July 2008. But this is likely to be just the start of Congressional attention to air pollution from ships. Action at the state level, in the courts, and at U.S. EPA will continue to bring the issue to Congress's attention, with numerous opportunities for oversight and legislation."], "subsections": []}]}}
