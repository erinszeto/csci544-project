Some create new federal capital offenses making certain death-resulting maritime offenses punishable by death. Some add the death penalty as a sentencing option in the case of pre-existing federal crimes such those outlawing attacks on mass transit. Some make procedural alterations such as those governing federal habeas corpus provisions for state death row petitioners. Other proposals offered during the 109 th Congress followed the same pattern: some new crimes; some new penalties for old crimes; and some procedural adjustments. Other than the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, P.L. 109-248 , 120 Stat. 587 (2006), none of the other proposals were enacted, although one House or the other approved several. Among these, H.R. 1279 would have amended the venue provision for capital cases and made it a federal capital offense to use the facilities of interstate commerce to commit multiple murders and another to commit murder during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. As would have H.R. 4472 . H.R. 1751 and H.R. 4472 would have made it a federal capital offense to murder a federally funded public safety officer. H.R. 3132 would have created special expedited habeas review of state child murder cases. And S. 2611 would have made murder committed during the course of certain federal offenses a capital offense.", "Of the capital proposals pending at adjournment, H.R. 4923 and S. 122 would have abolished the death penalty as a federal sentencing alternative and H.R. 379 would have imposed a moratorium barring the states from imposing or carrying out the death penalty.", "This is an abridged version of CRS Report RL33395, The Death Penalty: Capital Punishment Legislation in the 109 th Congress , by [author name scrubbed] (pdf), without the footnotes, appendices, or most of the citations to authority found in the longer report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Procedural Adjustments", "paragraphs": ["The Reauthorization Act changes procedures associated with federal capital cases including those relating to air piracy cases arising before 1994 and habeas procedures for state capital petitioners."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pre-1994 Capital Air Piracy Cases", "paragraphs": ["In the early 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court held unconstitutional the imposition of capital punishment under the procedures then employed by the federal government and most of the states. In 1974, Congress established a revised procedure for imposition of the death penalty in certain air piracy cases. In 1994, when Congress made the procedural adjustments necessary to revive the death penalty as a sentencing option for other federal capital offenses, it replaced the air piracy procedures with those of the new regime. At least one court, however, held that the new procedures could not be applied retroactively to air piracy cases occurring after the 1974 fix but before the 1994 legislation, in the absence of an explicit statutory provision. The Reauthorization Act adds an explicit provision to the end of the 1994 legislation.

The earlier provision required that the mechanism include competency standards for appointed counsel. The Reauthorization Act removed the requirement, but granted the Attorney General regulatory authority sufficient to establish such standards. The act establishes a de novo standard of review for the Attorney General's determination before the D.C. Circuit.

The present Rule calls for a maximum of 6 alternates and affords the parties 3 alternate juror peremptory challenges.

The omission, although perhaps surprising to some, appeared inconsequential since execution of the mentally retarded is constitutionally proscribed. The bill also would have required notice to the government and would have permitted the government to request an independent mental health examination when a defendant intends to enter mental retardation as a mitigating factor for capital sentencing purposes, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3593(b). The existing statute mentions no such requirements. Presumably recourse to the proposed procedure would have been more infrequent in those cases where the district court conducted a pre-trial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the mental retardation of the accused precluded imposition of the death penalty following any conviction. Present law permits a capital jury to unanimously recommend a sentence of death or of imprisonment without possibility of release; if they do not, the court is to sentence the defendant to any lesser sentence authorized by law, i.e., imprisonment for life or a term of years. H.R. 5040 would have provided that if the jury cannot agree on a capital recommendation, a new sentencing jury would have been empanelled and the issue retried, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3594. Existing law specifically contemplates that the execution of federal capital sentences will be carried out in state facilities. H.R. 5040 would have granted the Attorney General regulatory implementing authority without exclusive reference to state facilities, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3596, 3597. The bill also would have rewritten 18 U.S.C. 3005 which assures defendants two assigned counsel in capital cases. The proposal would have made it clear that the statute only applied when the government sought the death penalty and not in capital cases where it had elected not to do so, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3005(a). The federal appellate courts are divided on the question over whether section 3005 now entitles a defendant to the assistance of two attorneys in all capital cases or only in those in which the government actively seeks the death penalty. The proposal also would have explicitly authorized the government to strike for cause potential jurors in capital cases whose opposition to the death penalty \"would prevent or substantially impair the performance\" of their duties as jurors, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3005(b). The proposal borrowed language from Supreme Court cases indicating that a potential juror may be struck if his views on capital punishment \"would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Federal Capital Offenses", "paragraphs": ["Title III of the Reauthorization Act, designated the Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act, creates three new federal capital offenses: (1) 18 U.S.C. 2282A (devices or dangerous substances in waters of the United States likely to destroy or damage ships or to interfere with maritime; causing a death); (2) 18 U.S.C. 2283 (transportation of explosive, biological, chemical, or radioactive or nuclear materials; causing a death); and 18 U.S.C. 2291 (destruction of vessel or maritime facility; intentionally causing a death).

One of the proposed offenses would have proscribed the use of interstate facilities with the intent to commit multiple murders and would have been a capital offense where death results. The other, modeled after the provision that condemns the use of a firearm during or in relation to a crime of violence or a drug offense, would have outlawed crimes of violence committed during or in relation to a drug trafficking offense and makes the offense punishable by death if a death results.

The statutes that outlaw treason and espionage make them punishable by death or a term of imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. 2381, 794.

It also would have amended the list of 3592(c) aggravating factors to add a fourth factor, i.e., the defense involved substantial planning by the defendant, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3592(c)(4). Assuming the conforming amendment to section 2339D\u00e2\u0080\u0094making it a capital offense\u00e2\u0080\u0094was an oversight and in spite of the proposal's caption (\"addition of terrorism to death penalty offenses not resulting death\"), it is not clear that the courts would permit imposition of the death penalty for a violation of section 2339D unless the offense also involved a first degree murder. The Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause precludes imposing the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman by an individual already under a sentence of life imprisonment at the time of the rape; it precludes imposition of the death\u00c2\u00a0penalty even in the case of murder unless the defendant at least acted intentionally or acted\u00c2\u00a0with reckless indifference to human life while participating in a felony involving a murder; and since the Court's decision in Furman v.
