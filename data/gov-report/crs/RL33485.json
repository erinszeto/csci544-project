The President proposed that most of the spending on PEPFAR programs be concentrated in 15 countries. Of the $15 billion, the President suggested spending $9 billion on prevention, treatment, and care services in the 15 Focus Countries, where the Administration estimated 50% of all HIV-positive people lived. The President also proposed that $5 billion of the funds be spent on existing bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs and research, and $1 billion of PEFPAR funds be reserved for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). Between FY2004 and FY2008, PEPFAR aims to have supported care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS, including children orphaned by AIDS; prevented 7 million new HIV infections; and supported efforts to provide anti-retroviral medication (ARV) to 2 million HIV-infected people.", "From FY2004 through FY2008 Congress provided almost $20 billion to fighting the global spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, some $5 billion more than the President proposed. The President's FY2008 budget request included about $5.8 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. The Administration proposed that the bulk of the funds, about $5.0 billion, be provided through Foreign Operations appropriations and that about $800 million be provided through Labor/HHS appropriations, of which $300 million would be reserved for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. Congress exceeded the President's request by some $560 million, providing $6.3 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts, including some $840 million for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. This report reviews U.S. appropriations for treatment and prevention of the three diseases from FY2004 through FY2008. The report will not be updated; PEPFAR authorization expires in FY2008.

More than two million of those living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2007 were children and some 330,000 of those who died of AIDS that year were under 15 years old. Nearly 90% of all children infected with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to 2.2 million of the estimated 2.5 million children living with HIV worldwide. On each day of 2007, some 1,000 children worldwide became newly infected with HIV, due in large part to little access to drugs that prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. An estimated 9% of pregnant women in low-and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns.", "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at the end of 2004, more than 14 million people were infected with TB, of whom almost 9 million were newly infected. More than 80% of those living with TB in 2004 were in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with the greatest per capita rate found in Africa. According to WHO, each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases, which cause more than one million deaths annually; in 2004, the disease killed about 2 million people.

In FY2004, Congress provided $150 million (excluding rescissions) to CDC for PMTCT programs. Conferees also expressed an expectation that $150 million would be made available for the initiative from the newly established Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI; H.Rept. 108-401 ).

The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the U.S. Department of State transfers funds from GHAI to implementing agencies and departments. The funds that Congress appropriates directly to U.S. agencies and departments are utilized in the non-Focus Countries. U.S. agencies and departments might also allocate additional resources to international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs not funded through PEPFAR. In each fiscal year since PEPFAR was launched, appropriators have included a chart in the foreign operations appropriations conference reports that itemizes how global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria funds are authorized to be spent ( Table 1 ).

When the Administration shifted leadership for bilateral malaria programs to USAID in FY2005, it determined that OGAC would no longer include malaria spending in its annual reports to Congress and that budgetary requests for the disease would be made separately from HIV/AIDS and TB requests.
