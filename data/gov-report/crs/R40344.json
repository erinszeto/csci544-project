The agreement text states the intent of both governments to cooperate in a number of areas including, but not limited to, the development of the UAE's \"civilian nuclear energy use in a manner that contributes to global efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation\" and, \"the establishment of reliable sources of nuclear fuel for future civilian light water reactors deployed\" in the UAE. In January 2010, the UAE announced that it had chosen the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO of South Korea) to construct four APR1400 reactors.

Renewed global interest in nuclear power has led some experts and observers to express concern that the projected spread of nuclear technology in coming years could contribute to nuclear proliferation. In the Middle East, added scrutiny is often applied to the motives and choices of regional actors regarding nuclear technology because of concern that Iran's nuclear program and Israel's presumed nuclear weapons may motivate other regional governments to seek nuclear technology for strategic or military purposes. Other concerns about nuclear safety relate to potential terrorist attacks or political instability, both of which have threatened some regional countries in recent years. UAE officials report that they have considered these potential risks carefully, and have announced plans and measures intended to address proliferation and security concerns. Most prominently, the UAE has based its nuclear program on a decision to forgo domestic uranium enrichment or fuel reprocessing and to rely on international market sources for its nuclear fuel services. This decision has significantly reduced proliferation concerns among many observers, including some members of Congress.", "Policymakers and advisers in the government of Abu Dhabi, in consultation with representatives from the other six emirates, have set out an ambitious agenda for the program and are guiding its implementation. In April 2008, the UAE government issued a policy statement that provides a rationale for the country's perceived need for nuclear energy and states guiding principles for the nuclear energy program. Operating and regulatory bodies have been formed and have begun their formal work.

The plant construction is to take place at Baraka, near Abu Dhabi's western border with Saudi Arabia (see Figure 1 below). All four plants are scheduled to be online by 2020. South Korea's export financing bank Kexim has agreed to supply $10 billion in financing to support the KEPCO project in Abu Dhabi.

Similarly, UAE officials believe that crude oil and diesel could be \"logistically viable\" sources of energy, but would impose high economic opportunity costs (as a result of lost export revenue) and environmental costs. Officials determined that coal could be a more economical solution, but would have even greater environmental costs and, as an import, also would raise concerns for the UAE about the security of supply.

In conjunction with the issuance of the law, a Board of Management for the FANR was announced, and the board named former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Executive Director for Operations Dr. William Travers as the FANR's first Director General. A nuclear energy policy advisory board reportedly has been formed, and UAE officials report that its members, though unnamed, include leading international nuclear energy industry officials.

For example, the statement indicates that the UAE will forgo \"domestic enrichment and reprocessing capabilities in favor of long-term commitments of the secure external supply of nuclear fuel.\" Moreover, as noted above, the nuclear cooperation agreement's text states that the United States can end nuclear cooperation with the UAE if it acquires enrichment or reprocessing facilities. Without such capabilities, a nuclear program poses little proliferation risk. IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei explained in an August 2007 interview:", "One nuclear reactor by itself means nothing, you are still far from having an atom bomb. I am more worried when a country has a plant for industrial-scale uranium enrichment\u2026 In this case it can make a nuclear bomb within a few months.

Additionally, the UAE agreed to conclude an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement. As noted, such protocols give IAEA officials greater access to an NPT state's nuclear-related facilities and information. The UAE currently has a Small Quantities Protocol to its safeguards agreement, but, according to the nuclear cooperation agreement, will terminate that Protocol before the United States issues export licenses for the export of \"nuclear material, equipment, components, or technology\" pursuant to the cooperation agreement.", "It is also worth noting that the UAE's 2008 policy statement on its nuclear program states that the government plans to rely on light-water reactors, which are considered among the most proliferation-resistant, partly because of the difficultly in producing and obtaining weapons-grade plutonium without detection. Moreover, a May 2008 International Institute for Strategic Studies report points out that \"no successful nuclear-weapons program has ever relied on commercial reactors.\" Although a civilian nuclear power program could provide cover for a country's procurement of dual-use items that could aid a nuclear weapons program, such a program would need to include some covert facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Rights Concerns", "paragraphs": ["A video depicting the torture of an Afghan grain merchant named Muhammad Shah Poor by Abu Dhabi ruling family member Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahayan and uniformed security officers has drawn widespread condemnation following its publication by ABC News in April 2009.

These fears appear to have been based largely on the perceived repercussions of Dubai Ports World's failed 2006 bid to acquire and operate U.S. port terminals.
