Upon taking office, President Portillo embraced the Peace Accords and declared themto be state policy for his Administration. Portillo survived the revelation made by the Guatemalanpress during the presidential campaign that he had fatally shot two men in Mexico in 1982, and hadbeen a fugitive from justice until a Mexican judge declared the case inactive in 1995. Portilloadmitted to having committed the murders, and said they were in self-defense.

Alvaro Colom of the left-of-center National Unity of Hope(Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza, UNE), lost with 46%. Colom, who once ran as a candidate forthe party associated with Guatemala's leftist guerrillas, had moved toward more centrist politics withUNE. The Guatemalan constitution prohibited President Portillo from running for re-election. Thenew president was inaugurated in January 2004 for a four-year term.

Berger negotiated a governing coalition with Colom's partyand his former party, PAN, which creates a 96-seat majority in the legislature.", "Some observers believe that of equal or greater importance is who did not run in the second round: retired General Efrain Rios Montt, of the FRG, whose nomination generated muchcontroversy, received only 19% in the first round presidential election. Rios Montt's candidacycaused great concern among the international community, much of Guatemalan society, and humanrights organizations. Rios Montt, age 77, took power through a coup and was military dictator from1982-1983, while the army carried out a counter-insurgency campaign resulting in what theGuatemalan Truth Commission has now characterized as genocide of the Mayan population. Hefounded the FRG, and was president of the Guatemalan Congress until he stepped down in August2003 to focus on his election campaign. The FRG named Rios Montt its presidential candidatedespite a provision in the constitution that bans participants in military coups from running forpresident and that prevented his running twice before. After the Supreme Court temporarilysuspended Rios Montt's candidacy, FRG-hired gangs launched violent protests. Guatemala's highestcourt, the Constitutional Court, decided in late July to allow Rios Montt's candidacy, supporting hisargument that he carried out his coup before the Constitution was written, and therefore theprohibition against running should not apply to him. The decision was criticized as illegal by someSupreme Court justices, and further polarized the electorate. Two appeals by opposition partieswere dismissed on September 12. ", "Although Rios Montt was far behind in polls prior to the election, some analysts believed that an electoral victory by Rios Montt could not be ruled out because of targeted spending by the FRGgovernment, strong rural support, and concerns that the FRG would use fraud to guaranteere-election. Then-President Portillo, who is also Rios Montt's son-in-law, was said to be putting the\"full weight of the government machine behind his party's contender.\" (4) According to AmnestyInternational, prior to the first-round elections, the electoral process had already been \"manipulatedvia pressure, threats, violence, terror, intimidation, and improper use of state and municipalresources,\" and more manipulation, along with \"falsification or alteration of electoral rolls andelection results\" was likely to occur.

An OASelection observation mission began operating in Guatemala months before the November election,with other groups joining in the observation efforts closer to the polling date. Observers reportedthe second round elections to be relatively peaceful and free of fraud.", "Although Rios Montt lost, analysts are concerned that he will continue to be a destabilizing element. He resigned from Congress to run and thereby lost the parliamentary immunity thatprotected him from indictment proceedings in Guatemala. Rios Montt also has indictments againsthim in Spain and Belgium. He now faces possible prosecution on charges of genocide and otheroffenses allegedly committed during his de facto regime. Opposition to such prosecution couldcome from his network of supporters in the military, judiciary, and legislature -- which includes hisson, the former army chief of staff, and his daughter, who was vice president of the Congress. President Berger has been unclear on whether he will allow genocide charges against the formergeneral to proceed.

Approximatelyhalf the population is indigenous, with about 23 different ethno-linguistic groups. The indigenouspopulation is economically and socially marginalized and subject to significant ethnic discrimination. Distribution of income and wealth remains highly skewed in Guatemala. According to a recentWorld Bank report, Guatemala ranks among the more unequal countries of the world, with the top20% of the population accounting for 54% of total consumption. Indigenous people -- constitutingabout 50% of the population -- account for less than 25% of total income and consumption.", "According to the World Bank's recent Poverty Assessment of Guatemala, past policies seeking to promote economic growth have resulted in the exclusion and impoverishment of the indigenouspopulation. Massive land expropriations, forced labor, and exclusion of the indigenous from theeducational system all served to develop coffee as Guatemala's primary export crop yet inhibitdevelopment among the indigenous rural population. By 1960, Guatemala had double the per capitaGross Domestic Product (GDP) of neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua, but lower social indicators. ", "This remains the case today. Guatemala's per capita GDP is $3,630, in the mid-range internationally. Its total GDP, $20.5 billion, is the largest in Central America. Yet the World Banksays data suggest that poverty is higher in Guatemala than in other Central American countries. Estimates of the portion of Guatemala's population living in poverty vary: the U.S. StateDepartment reports that 80% of Guatemalans live in poverty, with two-thirds of that number livingin extreme poverty. The World Bank reports that 54% of the population lives in poverty, withindications that poverty has increased slightly in 2001-2002. (9) Poverty is highest in rural areas andamong the indigenous: 75% of all people living in the countryside live in poverty, and 25% in thiscategory live in extreme poverty. Poverty is significantly higher among indigenous people, 76% ofwhom are poor, in contrast to 41% of non-indigenous people.", "Guatemala's GDP for 2001 was $22 billion. GDP growth rate was 3.3% in 2000, 2.1% in 2001, and 2.3% in 2002. Low worldwide coffee prices contributed to Guatemala's slowed growth over thelast couple of years. Despite the downturn in commodity prices, traditional exports such as coffeeand sugar continue to lead Guatemala's economic growth. Over the last decade, non-traditionalexports, such as assembled clothing, winter fruits and vegetables, furniture, and cut flowers, havegrown dramatically. Tourism also has grown, though continued growth may depend on thegovernment's ability to address security issues. Problems limiting growth include illiteracy and lowlevels of education, high crime rates, and an inadequate capital market.", "The 36-year civil war generated social and economic costs. Economic growth rates did not fall until the height of the conflict in the 1980s. But cumulatively, from 1960 to 1996, the war entailedsignificant loss of life, jobs, and productivity, and caused disruption, especially in the hard-hit ruralareas. Guatemala's social indicators continue to be among the worst in the hemisphere; itsmalnutrition rates are among the worst in the world. Its infant mortality rate is 43 per 1,000 livebirths, and its under-5 mortality rate is 58 per 1,000 children. (10) Guatemala's illiteracy rate isextremely high: at 31%, only Nicaragua and Haiti have worse levels in Latin America and theCaribbean. The average level of schooling is an extremely low, 4.3 years; among the poor it is lessthan two years. Schooling is lowest among women, indigenous people, and the rural poor. As aresult of malnutrition, 44% of children under five years of age have stunted growth. Drought andlow coffee prices triggered a rural economic crisis beginning in 2001, which has caused severemalnutrition among the rural poor.", "Throughout the Peace Accords, there are provisions seeking to reverse the historical exclusion of indigenous peoples and women. In signing them, the Guatemalan government agreed toimplement a more inclusive development strategy. It also agreed to increase investment of thenational budget in education, health, and other social sectors in order to create more equitabledistribution of wealth, reduce poverty, improve living conditions of the poor, and increase access toeducation, health, and other social services. ", "Implementation of the elements of the Peace Accords relating to improving the living conditions and the rights of indigenous people and women are far behind schedule, however. Accessto education, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, is \"still far frombecoming a reality.\" The Portillo Administration outlined a poverty reduction strategy in 2002addressing most of those issues. MINUGUA reported in 2003 that there were slight improvementsin social spending in the national budget over the previous year but that the amounts allocated to keysocial ministries \"remained extremely low in relation to the needs of the country.\" The indigenouspopulation and women continue to face limited opportunities and discrimination in the labor market. According to the World Bank's Poverty Assessment, \"The indigenous appear limited tolower-paying jobs, primarily in agriculture,\" which, the report says, is \"unlikely to serve as a majorvehicle for poverty reduction.\" Other obstacles hindering social and economic advancement amongthe indigenous poor, which the report says the government still must address, are higher malnutritionrates, less coverage by basic utility services, wage discrimination, and discriminatory treatment bypublic officials and other service providers.", "International donors and others have criticized Guatemala for not increasing the tax base to the minimum target of 12% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) agreed upon in the Peace Accords.

The Consultative Group is made up of over20 donor countries and international organizations, including the U.S., Canadian, and Japanesegovernments, the World Bank, and the IDB.

On the positive side, observers pointout that the armed conflict is definitively ended; and the state policy of human rights abuses duringthat conflict has been terminated. Sectors of society previously excluded from political processeshave been able to participate. Institutional reforms have been initiated. On the other hand, all ofthese processes remain to be deepened and consolidated, in the view of many.

These pending commitments wererescheduled to occur between 2001 and 2004. The Consultative Group for Guatemala, whichcomprises foreign donor countries and international institutions that have supported Guatemala'speace process, called on the Portillo Administration to reinvigorate the peace process in February2002.

Some progress in demilitarizing the country and strengthening civilianpower has been made, such as disbanding the Estado Mayor Presidencial, or Presidential Guard unit,known for its human rights abuses, and closing outdated military installations. Failure todemilitarize the state remains a serious problem, however. MINUGUA reported in 2003 thatthen-President Portillo violated the spirit of the Peace Accords, which call for demilitarization of thepolice, by expanding the role of the army in law enforcement functions and other areas ofgovernment, rather than separating the functions of the army and of the National Civil Police. TheNational Civilian Police Academy's budget was reduced, further weakening the force.", "Excesses in the military budget and the lack of budget transparency are reported as persistent problems. Under the accords, funds were to be directed away from the military and into theunderfunded health, education and police sectors. The government met the target for reduction ofthe military budget in 1997 and 1998, but beginning in 1999, the military budget began to exceedthe ceiling of 0.66 % of GDP set by the Peace Accords. In 2001, the Portillo Administration carriedout extraordinary supplemental transfers to the Defense Ministry, raising the budget to 0.94% ofGDP, and increasing the allocation originally approved by the Guatemalan Congress by 85%. In2002, two supplemental transfers again increased the army's budget above the targets establishedin the Peace Accords. MINUGUA warned that this increased military spending was siphoning fundsthat should be used for social spending.

President Portillo promised to dismantle thesestructures, which interfere with the administration of justice, within six months of taking office, butfailed to do so by the end of his term. He cooperated in mid-2003, however, with the U.N. informing a commission to investigate these parallel, clandestine structures. Although the PortilloAdministration complied with another part of the accords by presenting a new defense policy,important elements of it have not yet been implemented. For example, no tangible progress has beenmade in creating a civilian intelligence system to regulate or supervise intelligence agencies.", "Other observers expressed concern about the renewed prominence of retired General Efrain Rios Montt as a reflection of the ongoing difficulty in asserting civilian power over the military andin addressing military impunity for past human rights violations.

Two of the people appointed to his administration, Frank LaRue as head of the PresidentialHuman Rights Commission, and Rigoberta Menchu, have sought prosecution of Rios Montt.", "Continued Impunity for Human Rights Violations. MINUGUA has identified impunity, or failure to prosecute abusers,as the main obstacle to the effective enjoyment of human rights since it began reporting in 1994, and,in its report issued in January 2002, \"notes with profound concern that it is an entrenchedphenomenon.\" The main factors said to contribute to this continued impunity are an ineffectiveadministration of justice, and failure of the government to investigate and punish human rightsoffenders. Although the government attained convictions in a few important human rights cases,most human rights cases were not investigated for long periods of time, or experienced lengthydelays in the ineffective judicial process. High level officials have allegedly covered up or obstructedefforts to investigate human rights violations. Advances made in addressing impunity were oftenreversed. For example, three military officers were convicted in 2001 of the murder of Bishop JuanJose Gerardi, who headed the Archbishop's Human Rights Office, and was murdered in 1998, twodays after the Church's critical Recuperation of the Historical Memory report on past human rightsviolations was issued. Their 30-year, noncommutable sentences were annulled, however, and aretrial ordered, by an Appeals Court in 2002. The judicial process used to reach that decision waschallenged, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that the Appeals Court must re-examine theappeals.", "Continued Gross Violations of Human Rights by Security Forces. Guatemalan security forces continued to commit serious human rightsviolations in 2002, including extrajudicial killings and torture, according to the State Departmenthuman rights report for that year. From 2001 to 2002, there was a reported increase in attemptedlynchings, some with the participation of local leaders, former Civil Defense Patrol members, or, atan increased rate, municipal officials.
