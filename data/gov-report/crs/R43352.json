Over time there have been numerous changes to the restrictions and for five years, from 1977 until 1982, there were no restrictions on travel. Restrictions on travel to Cuba are part of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), the overall embargo regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

In addition, 15 categories of travelers engaging in a variety of activities, including educational, religious, and humanitarian activities and people-to-people exchanges may be eligible for specific licenses.

This provision would have expanded the current general licenses available for professional research and meetings in Cuba that allow full-time professionals to conduct professional research in their areas (with certain conditions), attend professional meetings or conferences in Cuba organized by an international professional organization, and attend professional meetings for commercial telecommunications transactions ( 31 CFR 515.564 ).", "Key Policy Staff"], "subsections": []}]}}
