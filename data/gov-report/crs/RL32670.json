Federal counter-terrorism funding for criticalinfrastructure guards may also present a policy challenge, since 87% of these guards are in theprivate sector. It is an open question whether private operators of critical infrastructure have hired,trained, and otherwise supported security guards to the degree warranted by the social value of thefacilities they protect.

Twenty years ago, \"infrastructure\" was defined primarily with respect to theadequacy of the nation's public works. In the mid-1990's, however, the growing threat ofinternational terrorism led policy makers to reconsider the definition of \"infrastructure\" in the contextof homeland security. Successive federal government reports, laws, and executive orders haverefined, and generally expanded, the number of infrastructure sectors and the types of assetsconsidered to be \"critical\" for purposes of homeland security. Currently, the USA PATRIOT Actof 2001( P.L. 107-56 ) defines \"critical infrastructure\" as:", "systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vitalto the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have adebilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or anycombination of those matters (Sec. 1016e).", "This definition was adopted, by reference, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 , Sec.2.4) establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The National Strategy also adoptsthe definition of \"critical infrastructure\" in P.L. 107-56 , and provides the following list of specificinfrastructure sectors (and assets) falling under that definition: ", "The critical infrastructure sectors in the National Strategy contain many physical assets, butonly a fraction of these could be viewed as critical according to the DHS definition.

(4) The 33,000 assets in the DHS database themselves constitute onlya subset of all assets in the critical infrastructure sectors. (5) Because federal agencies, state agencies and the private sector oftenhave different views of what constitutes criticality, compiling a consensus list of nationally criticalassets has been an ongoing challenge for DHS. The implications of this challenge as it relates tosecurity guards is discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Guards and Critical Infrastructure Protection", "paragraphs": ["Protecting people and property from accidents and crime is the principal role of securityguards. They monitor, patrol, and inspect property to protect against fire, theft, vandalism, and otherillegal activity. They may enforce laws on their employer's grounds, conduct incident interviews,prepare incident reports, and provide legal testimony. Guards may work at one location, or maypatrol among multiple locations to conduct security checks. Security guards typically use radios andtelephones to call for assistance from police, fire, or other emergency services as required. They maybe armed, as required by specific duty assignments, consistent with state and federal laws governingprivate ownership and use of firearms.", "Although security guards, in general, share many common responsibilities, they may alsoface unique duties at particular institutions. In banks, for example, guards protect customers, money,safety deposit boxes, and records. They may work with bank detectives to prevent theft andapprehend criminal suspects before police arrive. By comparison, transportation terminal guards(e.g., airport screeners) protect travelers, freight, luggage, and equipment. They may screenpassengers for weapons and explosives, ensure no property is stolen while being loaded or unloaded,and watch for fires and criminal activity. (6) ", "Security Guard Police Powers. Although securityguards have long supplemented public law enforcement, they typically have more limited authoritiesthan police and other law officers. Specific powers vary by jurisdiction, but they generallycorrespond to the police authorities of private citizens.", "In most states, citizens may make arrests only when acrime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And insome states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspectover to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest withcaution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody areliable for false arrest. (7)", "Security guards may have other authorities or may face further limitations to their policepower according to state licensing or other regulation, where it exists. For example, the followingauthorities are listed in California's security guard training manual:", "As an agent of the employer, a security guard can question an individual on theemployer's property and may prevent entry to the property by standing in the individual'sway.", "Although a security guard has the power of citizen's arrest, a guard is notobligated by law to make arrests.", "A security guard should never touch a criminal suspect except for self defense,or when necessary to use reasonable force in an arrest.", "If a security guard believes an arrested person is armed, the guard may searchfor weapons only.

Unfortunately, there are simply neither the public resources nor the personnel to do the job....Consequently ... security officers are being asked to fill the gap.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) there were approximately 1,022,000 securityguards working in the United States in 2003 ( Table 1 ). For the purposes of policy analysis, theseguards may be separated into two categories of employment and three categories of service.\"Contract\" guards work directly for private guard companies and are deployed under contract to otherinstitutions. \"Staff\" guards are employed directly by institutions as regular line employees. Bothcontract and staff guards may work either at private facilities, government facilities, or airports. (Guard forces at airports are mostly \"airport screeners,\" whose duties and employment characteristicswarrant their distinction from other guards.) The approximate number of contract and staff guardsworking at all three types of institutions in 2003 is summarized in Table 1 . ", "The BLS reports that over 14% of all security guards work part-time. The number ofpart-time employees is higher among contract guards than among staff guards. According to a 2002survey of major contractors, 20% to 30% of contract guards worked part-time. (11) A significant number ofthese part-time guards are off-duty police officers supplementing their incomes.

How many securityguards actually protect critical infrastructure? Only a rough estimate can be made. Although thereis no source of data detailing the number of contract security guards serving specific industry andgovernment sectors, the BLS does report such data for staff guards. By totaling 2002 BLSemployment figures for the appropriate industries, CRS estimates that approximately 122,000 (28%)of staff guards (excluding airport screeners) worked in industries corresponding to the NSPP criticalinfrastructure sectors. (14) As noted above, however, critical assets typically comprise only a fraction of a sector's total assets. Assuming, for simplicity, that guards are found only among assets in DHS's national asset database,and that guards are uniformly distributed across those assets, it may be reasonable to estimate that,consistent with DHS's critical asset ratio, up to 5% of staff guards actually protect criticalinfrastructure. Further assuming that contract guard deployment reflects staff guard deployment, thetotal number of security guards protecting critical assets could be on the order of 50,000. Such a\"critical\" guard force would be comparable in size to the 55,000 Transportation SecurityAdministration (TSA) and contract screeners working at the nation's commercial airports in 2003. Note that airport screeners are also considered to be critical infrastructure guards for purposes of thisreport.", "The Contract Guard Industry.

One reason this increase may not have occurred is because private sectorreactions to 9/11 may have been short-lived.

Both U.S. andinternational experience suggest that federal criminal background checks may be valuable forweeding out some security guard job applicants with terrorist connections. However, the FBI cannotreadily estimate how many prospective guards might fall into this category due to limitations in thefederal criminal records database.

Airport screeners likewise are reportedly subject to \"an analysis todetermine whether candidates present ... or may be associated with potential terrorist threats.\" (48) Even these higherstandards, however, which are comparable to federal security clearance requirements, might not beeffective against carefully selected terrorist operatives. Finally, if background screening laws applyonly to state-licensed contract guards, hostile insiders may still find infiltration opportunities asunlicenced staff guards.", "Federal criminal background checks may also be limited by incomplete state records.

Furthermore, as stricter criminal screening isimposed on critical infrastructure guards, terrorist groups may divert recruitment and collaborationaway from convicted criminals in a greater effort to circumvent these screening requirements.

Given the variability of these factorsacross many kinds of infrastructure, different facilities may need security guards in substantiallydifferent capacities. Telecommunications centers, for example, may require guards primarily foraccess control, whereas sports stadiums may require guards for screening and crowd monitoring. Certain electric power facilities may require no guards at all, relying instead on remote surveillanceand other means of physical protection. Because of these differences in facility guarding needs,some analysts argue that training policies for security guards may best be evaluated on asector-by-sector, or even facility-by-facility, basis. ", "Opponents of federal training regulation may, instead, wish to rely on private companiesvoluntarily providing such training to their workers. There is little public information, however, onhow many guard employers have been doing so. A 2002 survey of security guards in Californiafound that, since 9/11, 60% of guard employers had issued new \"procedures,\" 52% had conductedsome kind of emergency drill, and 33% had conducted a bomb-threat drill.

Given the importance of critical infrastructure protection in the nation's homeland security strategy,some analysts have suggested that critical infrastructure guards, specifically, should be encouragedby federal agencies to receive additional counter-terrorism training. The National Strategy , forexample, directed DHS to \"initiate a dialogue with state and local counterparts, private-sectorinfrastructure owners and operators, and private security firms concerning the creation of a trainingand certification regime for private security officers.\" (67) Likewise, a panel of drinking water experts convened by theGAO identified \"specialized training of utility security staff\" as one of the water system securityenhancements \"most deserving of federal support.\" (68) Nuclear power plant guards, for example, are required to receiveseveral months of special training in areas such as firearms, first aid, alarms, and electronic securitysystems.

A 40-hour training course developed foroffice building security guards in Manhattan, for example, was projected to cost approximately $20per hour, or $800 per guard. (70) If such training were required for 50,000 critical infrastructureguards, total costs would be $40 million. Assuming the same average hourly cost, training 50,000guards to the 260-hour Spanish standard would cost $260 million. Increased training might alsorequire higher salaries for critical infrastructure guards, as noted earlier in this report.", "DHS Grants for Guard Training. The DHSFY2004 appropriations ( P.L. 108-90 ) allocated $2.9 billion for first responders and urban securitygrants, administered through the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP). These grants areintended to assist state and local law enforcement, fire service, emergency medical service,emergency managers, and other first responders with terrorism preparedness. According to theODP's program guidance for FY2004, grant funds may be used to establish counter-terrorismtraining programs and to cover \"overtime and backfill costs\" associated with employee attendanceof such programs. ODP's guidance specifically includes \"private security providers\" in the targetaudience for these programs.

Accordingto Table 1 , however, approximately 489,000, or 48% of all U.S. guards in 2003 were staff guardsand so would not be subject to such oversight. Many of these staff guards may be subject toscreening and training by their institutional employers, but these requirements would not necessarilybe related to any government-defined standards.", "As state and federal legislators consider greater training and other licencing requirements forcontract guards, they may need to address potential disparities between standards for contract andstaff guards. Contract and staff guards may protect the same types of critical facilities, so it couldbe argued that they should be subject to the same screening and capability requirements.

A provisionin the Aviation and Transportation Security Act ( P.L. 107-71 ) allows only U.S. owned and operatedcompanies to provide contract screeners at U.S. airports, unless TSA cannot identify U.S. firms withsufficient capability to meet screening needs. This measure was presumably included in response toperceived inadequacies of airport screening contractors, several of which were foreign controlled,after the 9/11 attacks. (76) Some analysts have criticized the restrictions on foreign ownership since many foreign security firmsare located in countries that are close allies in the war on terrorism and have extensive internationalexperience in infrastructure security which could be valuable in U.S. critical infrastructureprotection. (77) (Note thatsome U.S. critical infrastructure in the private sector is actually owned and operated by foreign firms;a ban on \"foreign\" contract guards at such facilities might be difficult to implement (78) ) To date, there has beenlittle call for similar restrictions on guard contractors already serving other U.S. criticalinfrastructure.
