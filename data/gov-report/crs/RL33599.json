As a practical matter, it is virtually impossible to remove, or even to consider, all of the behavioral or structural factors that would be necessary to obtain a pure measurement of energy efficiency, however broadly energy efficiency may be defined.", "Thus, in this view, because energy efficiency is tied to energy use and demand, it must somehow be separated from other factors that affect demand, especially structural (economy), weather, and behavioral effects.", "EIA suggested that one way to achieve this separation was to focus on energy intensity as a measurement indicator of energy efficiency. The energy intensity indicator was obtained from an equation in which energy consumption is set equal to the product of energy intensity (energy use rate per unit of service) times the total amount of service provided. EIA says it adopted a comprehensive approach that starts the measurement process with the broadest available measures of energy use and demand indicators. Over time, changes in such measures reflect changes in behavior, weather, structure, and energy efficiency. Further, structures of energy measures are needed that make it possible to separate the effects unrelated to energy efficiency. EIA observes that some of the obstacles to measuring energy efficiency on an economy-wide basis are lack of consistent data, difficulties in establishing demand indicators, and absence of clarity in identifying structural and behavioral influences on efficiency.", "EIA's report concluded that further work is needed to forge a consensus on the definition of energy efficiency and the development of energy-intensity indicators that are precise, valid, reproducible, and as robust as possible. EIA offered its report as a focus point for further discussion and debate to improve energy efficiency measures.", "EIA's discussion of energy efficiency measurement was continued with an article on its website. The article noted that there are data access and processing barriers to developing energy efficiency indicators. Further, the effort to create international comparative indicators is made more difficult due to structural, behavioral, and economic differences between nations. Even a measure of energy intensity, such as energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), is difficult because of differing measures of energy, currencies, and income accounts.", "EIA suggests that different policy contexts call for the use of different energy intensity indicators. For example, a focus on climate change policy might call for an indicator that shows carbon emissions in absolute terms or expressed per unit of energy use. In contrast, a focus on economic productivity policy might call for an indicator that shows energy expenditures per dollar of GDP. EIA said that intensity may only be a \"rough surrogate\" for energy efficiency, because it may mask structural and behavioral changes that do not represent \"true\" efficiency improvements. Nevertheless, as with its 1995 report, EIA again found that energy intensity may be the best indicator of energy efficiency that can be developed with available data:", "Energy intensity is defined as the ratio of energy consumption to some measure of demand for energy services. The choice of measure of demand for energy services (a \"demand indicator\") in efficiency analysis is critical. As examples, in the transportation sector, intensity measures could include gallons per passenger mile or gallons per vehicle mile. Passenger mile and vehicle are the demand indicators in these two examples.", "EIA reported that there are four frequently used approaches to developing energy intensity indicators and indexes to measure relative changes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.", "EIA noted that the measurement of energy efficiency and energy intensity can also be affected by the choice between primary energy and site energy as the indicator of energy use. Primary energy is defined as the amount of energy delivered to an end user (e.g., residential housing unit) adjusted to account for losses in generation, transmission, and distribution. Site energy is defined as the amount of energy delivered to an end user without adjusting for these losses. EIA said primary energy is better for constructing aggregate indicators (e.g., energy use/GDP) and for showing ultimate resource or environmental impact; for example, attributing CO 2 emissions to residential electricity use. When the focus is finding differences in end-use efficiency, for example residential air conditioning compared over time, using a simple measure of site energy would be sufficient and may avoid distortions from changes in \"upstream\" efficiency. EIA asserted that from an economist's viewpoint, using cost expenditures instead of primary or site energy may be preferable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Program History", "paragraphs": ["From 1974 through 1992, Congress established several complementary programs, primarily at the Department of Energy (DOE), to implement energy saving measures in virtually every sector of societal activity.

In the early 1980s, states and utilities took an active role in promoting energy efficiency as a cost-saving \"demand-side management\" tool for avoiding expensive powerplant construction. Energy efficiency is also viewed as a tool for mitigating environmental problems such as air pollution and global climate change.

The Plan was developed with assistance from DOE (Office of Electricity) and EPA (Office of Air and Radiation, Climate Protection Partnerships Division) and is supported by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the American Council on Renewable Energy. The report projects that implementation of the Plan could defer the need for 40 new 500-megawatt power plants, avoid a substantial amount of greenhouse gases, lower the costs of air pollution controls, and reduce prices for natural gas.", "The Plan aims to help states and utilities address policy, regulatory, and other barriers that limit energy efficiency investment in more efficient homes, buildings, and industries that would provide energy savings that would cost less than new energy supplies and would reduce energy bills. The five recommendations are (1) recognize energy efficiency as a high-priority energy resource; (2) make a strong, long-term commitment to implementing cost-effective energy efficiency measures; (3) educate the public and policymakers on the benefits of and opportunities for energy efficiency; (4) promote sufficient, timely, and stable program funding to deliver energy efficiency where cost-effective; and (5) modify policies to align utility incentives with the delivery of cost-effective energy efficiency and modify ratemaking practices to promote energy efficiency investments.", "The fifth recommendation may be the most important one. It marks a return to the \"energy efficiency profitability\" issue of the early 1990s, when it was recognized that energy efficiency faced a major economic barrier because, without establishing appropriately compensating policy changes, the reduction in demand would hurt electric industry sales and profitability.

This was projected to attain a 4.5% reduction from forecast emissions in 2012. The Administration proposed this policy in place of the Kyoto Protocol, which it opposes due to concerns that it could raise energy prices and slow economic growth. Further, the Administration has stated its intent to support funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at DOE and at the Global Environment Facility.", "Also, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) contained several provisions to extend or expand energy efficiency standards programs.
