At times, warnings have been issued in a government-widecoordinated manner; other times this has not been the case. In each situation that has led toincreasing the threat level, a number of organizations have made public pronouncements regardingthe nature of the threat prior to, during, or after the raising of the alert-level. The informationconveyed to the public often has been inconsistent regarding the threat or the timing of a suspectedattack. This lack of coordination and unity in message has led to a dilution in the American public'sbelief in the pronouncements and a questioning of the utility of the Homeland Security AdvisorySystem (HSAS). The focus of this paper is the federal government's coordination efforts in publiclyalerting the Nation of threats to the homeland. The report reviews past warnings and changes in thealert level, organizations that have made public statements regarding threats to the Nation, andexamples of how this lack of unity might lead to confusion and misinterpretations of the threat level.Options for Congress are provided regarding delineation of roles and responsibilities and whichgovernment entity should be held accountable for warning the Nation of threats to the homeland .", "This paper may be updated based on future National threat notifications or changes in thenotification system.

A universally understandable, consistent, and reliable national threatnotification system is deemed necessary in today's world of increasing and time-sensitive threats tothe Nation. Many believe that the notification of a threat to the United States should be conveyedby a single entity and the message should be consistent with other communications federalgovernment officials may offer. In times of crisis or national emergency, the federal government'sunity of message and a coordinated delivery of the threat notification are widely seen as crucial tothe effectiveness of the system designed to convey the message. \"The System's color-coded warningshave become the primary means by which the federal Government communicates directly to thepublic its bottom-line judgment on the risk of terrorist attack at any given time.\" (1) However, the circumstancesand explanations surrounding the warnings and changes in the Homeland Security AdvisorySystem's (HSAS) color code to date have called into question the utility and credibility of the system.In particular:", "At times it appears the color-code has been raised based on speculation thata terrorist attack may occur rather than receipt of new threat information;", "At other times, warnings of heightened threats have been issued withoutchanging the HSAS; and ", "On numerous occasions agencies have provided different, and sometimescontradictory, information about threats to the homeland."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Threat Notification Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["On March 11, 2002, the President signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive-3 (HSPD-3) and created the HSAS (See Figure 1).

It is possible that recentchanges of Departmental and Agency leadership may assist in resolving future occurrences of uncoordinated and premature threat announcements.

We do notanticipate raising the threat level for that day.\" (5) Though it is common in the world of intelligence to receiveinformation that contradicts previous analysis, possibly explaining moving from an elevated (yellow)to a high threat (orange) environment in one-week's time, the concern is that prior to the first use ofthe HSAS, two senior members of the Administration spoke publicly to the status of the threatenvironment. In this case the Director of the Office of Homeland Security seemed to have preemptedthe Attorney General's responsibility to publicly announce information regarding the threatenvironment and the status of the HSAS.

During this same time-period DCITenet testified before Congress that the information that led to this threat alert was as specific as ithas ever been.

While DHS is statutorily responsible for public advisoriesrelating to the announcement of homeland security threats, specifically as they pertain to alertinginfrastructure owners and operators of threat related information, the advisory came solely from theFBI. As House Committee for Homeland Security Chairman Christopher Cox stated two-weeksafter this occurrence, \"Clearly this is a very troubling development. Was it simply a one-time glitchor has there been a breakdown in communications between some of our key federal agencies?\"Chairman Cox added, \"Congress and the American people need to know, given the dangerous,uncertain times we live in today, cooperation among all authorities is more important than ever.

The Attorney General announced that based on \"credibleintelligence from multiple sources, Al Qaeda intends to attack the United States in the next fewmonths. This disturbing intelligence indicates Al Qaeda's specific intention to hit the United Stateshard.\" Ashcroft said the intelligence -- along with recent public statements attributed to Al Qaeda-- \"suggest that it is almost ready to attack the United States.\" He further stated that after the March11 train bombings in Madrid, Spain, an Al Qaeda spokesman said the network had completed \"90percent of preparations\" to attack the United States. (23) ", "During this press conference a reporter asked if there was credible intelligence suggestingthe United States is going to be attacked between now and the election, why the threat level had notbeen raised. Attorney General Ashcroft responded that \"the Homeland Security Council, led bySecretary Ridge, would make such a decision, and for me to try to speak for them at this time wouldbe inappropriate.\" (24) After Mr. Ashcroft's announcement, Mr. Ridge seemed surprised by the Attorney General's warning.Asked why the National Color-code alert had not been raised, Mr. Ridge replied \"there is nothingspecific enough (to raise the alert level).\"", "This seemingly uncoordinated effort was followed by a response from RepresentativeChristopher Cox, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security. \"Disseminationby our government of sensitive terrorism warnings must be closely coordinated across ourintelligence and law enforcement communities,\" Cox said. \"In the Homeland Security Act, DHS wasassigned the central coordinating role in this process. The absence of Secretary Ridge fromyesterday's news conference held by the attorney general and the FBI director, and the conflictingpublic messages their separate public appearances delivered to the nation, suggests that the broadand close interagency consultation we expect, and which the law requires, did not take place in thiscase.\" (25) ", "These last two examples are cited by many observers as suggesting a general lack ofcoordination and unity in message of warnings to the nation of threats, and also reflecting a lack ofoverall collaboration between DHS and other federal intelligence community and law enforcementorganizations. Homeland Security employees have complained that their CIA and FBI colleaguesshow them little respect. Intelligence agents reportedly counter saying that DHS has been known togo public with terror alerts based on information that other agencies found to be sketchy.

However, she also added that themost recent intelligence included mention of threats to the U.S. Capital and Members of Congress. This prompted Washington, D.C. Capitol Police Chief to remark that the briefings he had receivedon the recent intelligence did not speak to specific, credible, direct threats against Congress as aninstitution, or its Members. (27) Secretary Ridge did not mention the Capital or Congress in hisstatement announcing the increase in the threat level. However, one month later, Secretary Ridgereportedly admitted that though the Administration viewed the threat as \"credible,\" the informationwas \"sketchy and incomplete.\" (28) ", "On October 12, 2004, in view of the uncertainty of the intelligence that was presented andthe subsequent announcements regarding the threat environment, Senator Mark Dayton temporarilyclosed his Washington, D.C.

", "One could argue that, given the uniqueness of each threat situation requiring acommunication to the public, threat notifications may not allow for a system per se. According tothis line of reasoning, each \"warning-notice\" should be handled as its own entity. Threat information,geographic location, target location, timing of perceived attack, defensive measures, and the likeshould be addressed individually and not formulated to fit into a neat category of threat-levels. Thismight be problematic for a number of reasons. First, many federal and state programs are tied to thecurrent color-code with numerous actions and funding decisions tied to a raising or lowering of thealert. Secondly, though cumbersome and non-specific, the current HSAS allows for an assessment,by federal and state governments, the private sector, and the public as to a general threat level thatcomes with certain expectations regarding the federal response. Lastly, if a warning-notice typesystem were introduced, the inevitable question would arise regarding how one compares today'sthreat warning to past color-coded warnings and other warning-notices.

One optionwould be to designate the NCTC the federal government's communicator of threat information tothe Nation. Precedence exists for this option as Secretary Ridge and the Director of the NCTC(formerly the Terrorist Threat Integration Center) held a joint press conference discussing the threatenvironment and suggested protective measures. (38) Formalizing the NCTC as the national threat messenger wouldallow Congress to hold one organization (NCTC) responsible for terrorism analysis and the warningsthat are derived therein. DHS could continue to provide specific advice regarding protectivemeasures to the private sector, state and local governments, and the public.

Undoubtedly, numerous government agencies willcontinue to comment on various aspects of a given threat condition. However, critics argue thatfuture national threat announcements should occur in a coordinated manner that allows for anunambiguous message. Due to a lack of coordination and unity in message it appears that the generalpublic and affected localities are becoming desensitized or disinterested in the information containedin national threat warning notification messages.
