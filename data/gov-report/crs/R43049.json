With the average age of each airframe being 50, 28, and 20 years old, respectively, military analysts are beginning to question just how long these aircraft can physically last and continue to be credible weapon systems. As potential adversaries acquire 21st century defense systems designed to prevent U.S. access to the global commons (sea, air, space, and cyberspace) and to limit U.S. forces' freedom of action within an operational area, the ability of these Cold War era bombers to get close enough to targets to be effective will continue to deteriorate. Although the Air Force is committed to the development and acquisition of its proposed Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B), it is anticipated that flight-testing of the new bomber will not start until the mid-2020s, with initial operational capability near 2030. With this timeline in mind, the Air Force has extended the operational lives of the B-52 and B-1 out to 2040 and the B-2 out to 2058. Air Force and aerospace industry experts insist that with sufficient funding for sustainment and modernization over their expected lifespans, all three of the existing bombers can physically last and continue to remain credible weapon systems. However, appropriations decisions made by Congress based on required military capabilities to meet national security objectives will ultimately determine how long the B-52, B-1, and B-2 will remain in service.", "The central issue for Congress is how much funding should be appropriated for the continued sustainment and modernization of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers over the remainder of their service lives. Interest in this subject stems from Congress's authority to approve, reject, or modify Air Force funding requests for bomber sustainment and modernization as well as its oversight of the nation's long-range strike requirements and capabilities. In addition, sustainment, modernization, and size of the bomber force have been perennial legislative topics since the early 1990s. As the Air Force progresses through development and acquisition of the LRS-B and begins the gradual phase-out of 50-year-old bombers, it is anticipated Congress will continue dealing with bomber sustainment and modernization legislation. Congress's decisions on appropriations for the bomber force could affect the nation's long-range strike capabilities and have unintended consequences on U.S. national security as well as the U.S. aerospace industry.", "The context through which Congress will make these decisions includes U.S. national security and defense strategies and the expectation of the role the B-52, B-1, and B-2 will play in executing those strategies. Some of the many global and strategic variables that could become central in Congress's decision making on the bomber force include the following:", "the Obama Administration's 2012 rebalance in national security strategy toward the Asia-Pacific region and the military implications applicable to the bomber force; the expected contribution of bombers in accomplishing the critical missions of U.S. forces as outlined in the Department of Defense's strategic guidance, Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for the 21st Century Defense; the effectiveness and sustainability of the Air Force's continuous bomber presence operation\u2014based in the Pacific at Anderson Air Force Base, Guam\u2014and corresponding displays of worldwide power projection missions by all three bombers; the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) challenge presented by potential adversaries and the developments related to bombers' employment in an A2/AD threat environment; and the bombers' role in nuclear deterrent operations and the impact of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on the B-52 and B-2.", "The starting point for Congress's debate on bomber modernization and sustainment is the existing Air Force bomber force, which includes", "76 B-52H Stratofortress bombers capable of both conventional and nuclear operations and capable of employing long-range standoff weapons. The B-52H first entered service on May 9, 1961. 63 B-1B Lancer bombers capable of supersonic and low-level flight, conventional only operations, and employing long-range standoff weapons. The B-1B became operational in 1986. 20 B-2A Spirit, low observable (stealth) bombers capable of both conventional and nuclear operations. The B-2A entered service in December 1993 and became fully operational capable (FOC) on December 17, 2003.", "Potential congressional oversight and appropriations concerns for the sustainment and modernization of the U.S. Air Force's bomber force may include the following:", "the potential for a shortfall in the nation's long-range strike capabilities as development of the Air Force's proposed LRS-B continues; the feasibility and affordability of Air Force bomber sustainment and modernization plans and whether those plans bridge any potential long-range strike capabilities gap until the LRS-B becomes operational; the amount of money Congress and the nation should continue spending on 28- and 50-year-old bombers; the sufficiency of acquisition plans for the 80 to 100 LRS-Bs to backfill U.S. long-range strike requirements as the legacy bomber force ages out of service; the possibility of further delaying development and acquisition of the proposed LRS-B given sufficient levels of funding for sustainment and modernization of the current bomber force; the modernization, sustainment, and development of the weapons employed by the bomber force that affect the bombers' effectiveness and ability to operate in advanced, 21st century A2/AD threat environment; the potential implications of reduced bomber sustainment and modernization, and subsequent diminishing numbers of airframes, on any future rounds of base realignment and closure efforts; and the ability of the nation's industrial base to sustain an aging bomber force."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The central issue addressed by this report is how much Congress should consider appropriating for the continued sustainment and modernization of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers over the remainder of their service lives. Many military experts note the advanced age of the United States' long-range bomber fleet. The B-52H Stratofortress, B-1B Lancer, and B-2A Spirit are now about 50, 28, and 20 years old respectively. In fact, Air Force Global Strike Command declared 2012 the \"Year of the B-52\" in honor of the 50 th anniversary of the last delivery of a B-52 and the 60 th anniversary of the first test flight of the YB-52. The B-1B celebrated its 25 th anniversary in 2010. The last B-2 delivery was in 1997. Although the Department of Defense and the Air Force are committed to the development and fielding of a new Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B), flight-testing of the new bomber will likely not start until the mid-2020s. Initial development of the B-2 began in the early 1980s and the first aircraft was delivered on December 17, 1993. If the B-2 experience is the norm, potential delivery of the first operational LRS-B may be expected sometime in the 2030 timeframe. With this in mind, can the U.S. Air Force's B-52Hs, B-1Bs, and B-2As physically last and continue to be credible weapon systems until the LRS-B is fielded? More importantly, does the nation's \"legacy\" bomber force possess the capabilities required to meet national security strategy objectives, especially in the face of potential adversaries possessing advanced, 21 st century anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) weapon systems? The U.S. Air Force and aerospace industry's answer is \"yes,\" provided sufficient sustainment and modernization funding is available over the remaining lifespan of these weapon systems.", "Without sufficient sustainment and modernization funding, many analysts argue the U.S. bomber fleet will quickly become a decrepit force ill-suited to the potential challenges posed by 21 st century adversaries. The average age of the bomber force is 33. Because of the physical wear-and-tear placed on these aircraft from the demands of military flight\u2014compounded by 11 years of continuous combat\u2014aging airframe structures need reinforcement, engines need to be replaced, and computer and electronic components need upgrading. Even if corrosion, metal fatigue, and parts obsolescence do not take their toll on the fleet, military analysts point out that potential adversaries are acquiring advanced, A2/AD weapon systems that would make it harder for the bombers to reach their targets, thus relegating them to a \"standoff\" weapons employment role. But even \"standoff\" weapons have their limits, especially against deeply buried and/or hardened targets found in places like North Korea and Iran. Consequently, most experts agree all three bombers are in need of upgrades to their systems in order to counter A2/AD-equipped adversaries and require constant operational research and testing to evaluate and incorporate new and modern weapons into their arsenal.", "This report addresses potential congressional oversight and appropriations concerns for the sustainment and modernization of the U.S. Air Force's bomber force. It does not address Air Force efforts to develop and acquire the proposed LRS-B. Congressional interest in this subject stems from Congress's authority to approve, reject, or modify Air Force funding requests for bomber sustainment and modernization, as well as their oversight of the nation's long-range strike requirements and capabilities. In addition, sustainment, modernization, and size of the bomber force have been perennial legislative topics since the early 1990s. As the Air Force progresses through development and acquisition of the LRS-B and begins the gradual phase-out of 50-year-old bombers, it is anticipated that Congress will continue dealing with bomber sustainment and modernization legislation. Congress's decisions on appropriations for the bomber force could impact the nation's long-range strike capabilities and have additional consequences for the U.S. aerospace industry.", "A key issue for Congress is whether to continue providing sustainment and modernization funding for the Air Force's B-52H, B-1B, and B-2A bombers, and if so, at what levels. Pertinent to the discussion is the potential for a shortfall in the nation's long-range strike capabilities if Congress or the Air Force chooses to minimize funding for sustainment and upgrades that would keep these weapon systems viable against A2/AD-equipped adversaries. Also, given Air Force plans to keep the B-52 and B-1 flying well beyond 2030, Congress may consider whether current bomber sustainment and modernization plans will meet the nation's long-range strike requirements until the LRS-B is operational. Additionally, Congress may also consider whether the planned 80-100 LRS-Bs will adequately replace the capabilities lost as the legacy bombers start retiring from service in the 2030s. Congress's oversight and decisions on these issues could also have implications for any potential future base realignment and closure (BRAC) decisions as well as impact the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industrial base. Ultimately, the priority the Air Force places on bomber sustainment and modernization, and any decisions considered by Congress, could have potential consequences for future national defense strategies and on U.S. long-range strike capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "United States' Military Strategy Shift: Do the Bombers' Capabilities Meet Strategic Requirements?", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration's 2012 shift in national security and defense strategy towards the Asia-Pacific region has significant implications for America's legacy bomber force. Stemming from the growing economic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, China's growing military capabilities and its increasing assertiveness of claims to disputed maritime territories, U.S. concerns with freedom of navigation and the ability to project power in the region, and the end of U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Obama directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to raise the Asia-Pacific region's priority in U.S. military planning. Many analysts agree this rebalance has placed renewed emphasis on U.S. naval forces due to the maritime character of the Pacific theater of operations. However, budgetary pressures and potential defense cuts may reduce long-term naval procurement plans and planned naval force levels in the Pacific region. Consequently, just as B-17 and B-29 bombers demonstrated the value of long-range airpower projection in the Pacific Theater during World War II, the U.S. Air Force may be planning on the current fleet of B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s to provide an essential complement to U.S. naval forces in the vast geographical expanses of the Asia-Pacific.", "In addition to the Asia-Pacific, the Administration's new defense strategy also calls for retaining emphasis on the Middle East while ensuring U.S. defense commitments to European allies. This aspect of the new strategy may prove the most challenging from a resource perspective as the DOD is forced to implement automatic spending cuts laid out in the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 / S. 365 of August 2, 2011). The BCA necessitates $55 billion a year in defense cuts over the nine years from FY2013 to FY2021. Specifically for the bomber force, Air Force leaders have said that such cuts would result in an 18% reduction in both bomber flying hours and in bomber sustainment and modernization efforts, resulting in aircraft availability and mission capable rates falling below standards. Some military analysts, consequently, are skeptical as to whether U.S. force levels will be sufficient to meet multiple, competing priorities in both the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, all the while reassuring U.S. commitments in Europe. However, some historical examples suggest the current bomber force is capable of balancing national security priorities among competing geographical regions.", "Since 2003, B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s have maintained a continuous bomber presence in the Pacific with regularly scheduled rotations to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, while simultaneously participating in continuous combat operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. An example of this is the March 2003 deployment of B-52s and B-1s to Guam (in response to North Korean nuclear weapons activities) while additional B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s participated in the opening phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom and flew combat sorties in Afghanistan. Essentially, this dual deployment of bombers to two geographical regions demonstrated the United States and the bomber force's ability to fight wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan while retaining the capability to respond to potential crises in the Asia-Pacific."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Strategic Influence of Bombers on the Administration's Strategy Shift", "paragraphs": ["The Administration's strategic guidance identifies three priorities for which the USAF bomber force could have significant strategic influence. These include reaffirming U.S. commitment to the security and prosperity of allies in the Asia-Pacific region; ensuring access to the global commons which facilitate world-wide economic opportunities and guarantee U.S. power projection capabilities; and ensuring a quick, military response capability to any hostilities from potential adversaries in the region.", "According to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the U.S. commitment to what she termed \"forward-deployed\" diplomacy would include the strengthening of bilateral security alliances with U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific and necessitate the forging of a broad-based military presence. Forward based bombers, whether deployed on a continuous basis or periodically as part of training exercises, could play a significant role in reaffirming U.S. commitments to allies in the Asia-Pacific region. Primarily through regular rotational deployments (such as the continuous bomber presence rotation at Andersen AFB, Guam) and participation in bilateral and multilateral training exercises, the visible presence of U.S. bombers abroad could potentially reinforce the U.S. commitment to deterrence (conventional and nuclear) against any potential adversary in the region and could provide an economical and effective way to increase U.S. influence there.", "Freedom of navigation and access to the South China Sea is considered by many analysts vital to the economy of every nation in North America and East Asia. More than half of the world's shipping passes through the South China Sea every year (approximately 70,000 ships carrying $5.3 trillion worth of goods). Of that, $1.2 trillion worth is trade that directly affects the United States. In addition, over 80% of crude oil supplies to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan flow through the South China Sea\u2014making these countries especially dependent on South China Sea shipping routes. Any attempt to restrict universal access to this maritime common could impact the security, political stability, and economic prosperity of the United States and its allies in the region and potentially inhibit U.S. power projection capabilities by restricting the U.S. Navy's ability to patrol and operate in the South China Sea and the Malacca Straits. Long-range bombers, conducting maritime reconnaissance and capable of anti-shipping operations, could actively and passively maintain situational awareness of the vast Asia-Pacific maritime region and possibly keep in check any potential adversary looking to threaten the United States and its allies' access to the Asia-Pacific's commons.", "Finally, the legacy bomber force is one option than can produce a quick, military response to hostile actions taken by potential adversaries in the region. Unconstrained by the need for a forward operating location within theater, the capability of bombers to reach anywhere in the Asia-Pacific, in a relatively short period of time and with a wide array of weapons, could provide national leaders a viable option for responding to encroachments on U.S. interests in the region and for honoring defense and security commitments to U.S. allies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bomber Expectations: Employment in DOD's Strategic Guidance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bomber Contribution to Critical Missions", "paragraphs": ["The Administration's new strategic guidance emphasizes the military's need to recalibrate its capabilities and make selective investments to succeed in a number of missions critical to achieving national security objectives.

These missions include the following:", "Counter terrorism and irregular warfare; deter and defeat aggression; project power despite anti-access/area denial challenges; counter weapons of mass destruction; operate effectively in cyberspace and space; maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; provide a stabilizing presence; and, conduct stability and counterinsurgency operations.", "All three of the nation's bombers have made, and are expected to continue making, significant contributions to all of the critical missions set forth in DOD's strategic guidance. Looking as far back as 1962 (coinciding with the last B-52 delivery), numerous examples describe one or more of the current bombers accomplishing these missions (see Table 1 ). However, with the rising prevalence of 21 st century A2/AD capabilities in several potential adversary countries, even the U.S. Air Force assesses that modern threat capabilities are outpacing the 20 th century capabilities and abilities of the B-52, B-1 and, in some circumstances, even the B-2, to accomplish these missions. Without funding for critical modernization and sustainment efforts, all three bombers run the risk of becoming ineffective in the face of A2/AD equipped adversaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forward Deployed Diplomacy: Continuous Bomber Presence and Worldwide Power Projection", "paragraphs": ["With the conclusion of U.S. military involvement in Iraq and U.S. forces drawing down in Afghanistan, DOD has announced it intends to shift military capacity from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region as part of the Obama Administration's rebalancing strategy. On multiple occasions, Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has stated DOD's intent to begin rotating B-1 bombers (which have been the only bomber participating in Operation Enduring Freedom since May 2006) into the Asia-Pacific region to augment B-52s already on continuous rotation there. This continuous rotation\u2014referred to by the DOD as the Continuous Bomber Presence (CBP)\u2014is based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and represents a major investment in ensuring U.S. security commitments in the Pacific.", "Capable of reaching anywhere in the U.S. Pacific Command's (USPACOM's) area of responsibility with weapons ranging from conventional to nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, the CBP is one way of reassuring allies of the U.S. commitment to their defense and deterring potential adversaries in the region, including possibly China. The CBP can potentially send the signal that no naval vessel can patrol the South China Sea and Pacific without coming under the reach of land-based bombers. According to former Pacific Air Forces commander General Gary L. North, \"Chinese military writings talk a lot about how to extend their power to the second island chain \u2026 the 1,800 mile [factor], which would enable them to prevent other nations' ability to have freedom of movement at that great range.\" Invoking the lessons learned from the Pacific Theater of World War II, the CBP, and long-range airpower projection in general, could be seen as an essential complement in dealing with potential adversary naval forces.", "Air Force Global Strike Command recently announced B-2s will begin regular worldwide training deployments to each of the regional U.S. combatant commands' areas of responsibility starting in 2013. According to 8 th Air Force Commander Major General Stephen Wilson, B-2s will rotate to forward operating locations all over the world in small numbers for a few weeks at a time, a set number of times a year beginning with a short Pacific deployment in 2013. The plan calls for B-2 deployments to all the geographic combatant commands including those in Central and South America, Southwest Asia, and Europe in addition to the Asia-Pacific. These worldwide training deployments are an exercise in power projection and meant to demonstrate U.S. commitments to allies in multiple regions of the world while providing a visible deterrent to any potential U.S. adversary.", "Military analysts point out that engaging in this type of \"forward deployed diplomacy\" with the bomber force has the potential to influence the Asia-Pacific region beyond the near-term concern of a rising China. Give the efforts by numerous Asian-Pacific states seeking to increase their diplomatic, economic, and strategic influence in the region, the potential exists for a number of regional players to acquire advanced military capabilities that could influence long-term U.S. interests and/or threaten U.S. access to the region in the future. For example, North Korea's continuing efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capability, along with its nuclear weapons program, represent a potential direct threat to the United States and threaten to undermine regional security. South Korea, in an effort to offset its strategic vulnerabilities, has undergone a vigorous procurement and acquisition of state-of-the-art weaponry and has invested over $25 billion a year since 2006 on indigenous research and development programs for its local defense industries. Japan, after years of watching its international influence eroded by a slow-motion economic decline, is attempting to raise its relevance in the region by offering military aid to regional neighbors and by stepping up training and engagement activities by its own armed forces in an effort to build regional alliances and shore up other countries' defenses. India, who until the recent global economic downturn possessed the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, became the largest weapons importer in the world in March 2011. It is anticipated that India will spend up to $80 billion on military modernization by 2015, and it is considered by many analysts to be on the verge of attaining military superpower status. Indonesia, supported by its military leadership and a $16.7 billion budget, is moving forward with a three-year plan to strengthen and modernize its military arsenal to include $2.5 billion for 10 light frigates, $2 billion for four submarines, and $6 billion for the addition of Russian Sukhoi and U.S. F-16 fighters. Taiwan, who is falling rapidly behind the unprecedented Chinese military buildup over the past decade, conducted tests of a new \"carrier killer\" anti-ship missile in late 2012. Thought to be an advanced version of the Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missile, such a weapon could pose a significant challenge to any naval vessel operating in the Taiwan Straits if developed in sufficient numbers. The point being, there is no doubt that with the enormous amount of economic, military, and political power concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, the proliferation of A2/AD weapon systems could impact the future of U.S. influence and capacity in the region, regardless of who possesses such capabilities.", "CBP rotations and regular B-2 deployments stand to play a long-term role in the United States' ability to influence and project military power in the Asia-Pacific, provided bomber sustainment and modernization efforts keep pace with current and evolving A2/AD military capabilities that are becoming prevalent in the region. However, with such emphasis being placed on military modernization by many of the major states in the region, it is hard to predict what the strategic and military landscape of the Asia-Pacific will look like in 20 or 30 years. Such a time frame could potentially see the B-52, B-1, and B-2 still in service; if so, they will be expected to be effective weapon systems if employed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meeting the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) Challenge", "paragraphs": ["A major challenge in meeting the goals of the Administration's new strategy is the rising prevalence of 21 st century anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats. Anti-access refers to those adversary actions and capabilities, usually employed from long ranges, designed to prevent an opposing force entry to an operational area by restricting its access to the global commons (sea, air, space, and cyberspace). Area denial refers to those adversary actions and capabilities, usually of shorter range, designed not to keep an opposing force out, but to limit its freedom of action within an operational area. Although not a new concept, A2/AD is a rising concern due to the proliferation of technology that places precise, long-range weapons in the hands of potential foes. Such weapons include ballistic and cruise missiles, integrated air defense systems, anti-ship missiles, submarines, guided rockets, missiles and artillery, 4 th - and 5 th -generation combat aircraft, and space and cyber warfare capabilities. Many of these A2/AD threats are specifically designed to challenge the U.S. military's power projection capabilities and potentially threaten U.S. access to key areas of strategic interest both in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.", "The U.S. military addresses the A2/AD challenge in its Joint Operational Access Concept (JOAC). Although not enemy- or region-specific, JOAC describes how joint forces will operate in response to the emerging A2/AD threat. Its central idea hinges on the joint forces' ability to leverage cross-domain synergy\u2014the complementary employment of military capabilities across the sea, air, land, space, and cyberspace domains that enhances the effectiveness of military operations and compensates for any known weaknesses in U.S. capabilities. The Air Force and Navy have embraced cross-domain synergy and have codified their approach to the A2/AD challenge in their Air-Sea Battle Concept (ASBC). ASBC seeks to achieve interoperability between air and naval forces that can execute networked, integrated attacks, in-depth, to disrupt, destroy, and defeat an adversary's A2/AD capabilities. ASBC and the idea of cross-domain synergy as an answer to the A2/AD challenge have very real implications for the modernization and operational employment of the bomber force; primarily, modernization and sustainment efforts should equip the bomber force with the capabilities necessary to operate in the extreme-, high-, and low-risk denied regions of the 21 st century A2/AD environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bomber Employment in an A2/AD Environment", "paragraphs": ["One of the objectives of an A2/AD adversary is to establish what the military terms extreme-risk geographic zones in order to deny any advantage to U.S. forces operating in them.

Due to its stealth and self-defense capabilities, the B-2 is the most capable bomber able to operate in the extreme-risk zone.", "In high-risk zones, the majority of U.S. high-signature (non-stealthy) forces require significant defense support. For the bombers, this means their defensive countermeasures and maneuvers will be effective if assisted by mutually supporting forces, but on their own, they may be operationally ineffective and limited. The U.S. bombers most capable of operating in the high-risk zone are the B-2 (because of its stealth and self-defense capabilities) and the B-1 given its speed, maneuverability, low-altitude flying capability, and electronic self-defense capabilities.", "In the low-risk zone\u2014usually found at extended ranges from the adversary's borders\u2014all U.S. forces can generally operate freely, although the adversary can potentially still pose a threat. The B-1 and B-52 are quite capable of operating in low-risk zones and would most likely employ their arsenal of long-range, standoff cruise missiles (the B-2 does not carry long-range stand-off cruise missiles). In the overall Air-Sea Battle Concept, higher-signature forces\u2014such as the B-1 and B-52\u2014would be teamed with low-signature forces as required\u2014such as the stealthy F-22 fighter\u2014in order to enhance the effectiveness and compensate for the vulnerabilities of each platform.

Consistent with prior administrations, the Obama Administration's strategic guidance requires a long-range, deep strike capability that is effective in the face of A2/AD threats and is not constrained by the lack of overseas basing. In addition, under the New START treaty, nuclear-capable heavy bombers could continue to make up one-third of the U.S. nuclear triad along with ICBMs and SLBMs. With only 20 B-2s, the recent retirement of three B-1s, and the conversion of a yet-to-be-determined number of B-52s to conventional-only roles, the potential exists for the total number of bombers to fall below the level necessary to fulfill long-range strike requirements. Currently, the DOD and the Air Force plan on a bomber force of approximately 156 aircraft out to at least 2022 (see Table 6 , below). However, with $487 billion of defense cuts over the next 10 years as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, the potential for additional budget constraints, and changing defense strategies, these numbers are subject to change. Furthermore, the potential for shortfall in long-range strike capabilities does not simply lie in the sheer number of legacy bombers in service. ", "The more pressing oversight issue is the \"capability\" of the legacy bomber force. That is, can the legacy bomber force meet the national security challenges posed by the growing number of potential A2/AD-equipped adversaries? The ability of the current bomber force to bridge a potential long-range strike capabilities gap may depend upon the feasibility and cost effectiveness of sustainment and modernization programs that will make these weapon systems viable in the 21 st century A2/AD environment while extending their service lives until the LRS-B becomes operational in the late 2020s.", "Many analysts argue that the Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is another, highly flexible alternative to the bomber and is capable of filling the nation's long-range strike needs. Indeed, the aircraft carrier's ability to dominate the seas and launch its aircraft without the need for a forward airbase is without question a valuable strategic asset. However, the relatively limited amount of fuel carried by naval fighters limits their ability to penetrate deeply into enemy territory without assistance from Air Force tankers. Without tanker support, the strategic reach of naval fighters is limited to the coastal areas of any potential adversary. Furthermore, compared to a bomber, the weapons load out capability of carrier-based aircraft is limited thus potentially requiring multiple aircraft in order to service a single target. Finally, there is also a potential concern over the carrier's survivability and ability to operate in an A2/AD environment. The primary goal of an adversary employing an anti-access strategy is to deny an outside country the ability to project power into a region. One way of doing this is with anti-ship weapons. Weapons systems such as submarines, China's version of the SS-N-22, SS-N-27, and DF-21D, and Iranian small-boat swarm tactics are all potential threats that could push a carrier task force even further out to sea, thus potentially increasing the range at which naval aviation must travel. Although most analysts will agree the aircraft carrier is an essential element in U.S. long-range strike capabilities, carrier aviation may be seen as complementary to and not taking the place of the much more powerful and flexible long-range bomber.

Current Air Force plans call for 80-100 LRS-Bs. However, since the 1970s, the number of new combat aircraft actually produced in a given program has rarely come close to the number of aircraft originally planned. In the original 1969 stated requirement, the Air Force planned a production run of 250 B-1A bombers as a replacement for the \"then aging\" B-52. However, the program was canceled by President Jimmy Carter in 1977; political support for the B-1A waned due to reduced military spending following the Vietnam War and problems within the B-1A program itself. After being revived by President Reagan in 1981, the eventual 100 B-1Bs that were built were the result of an Air Force proposal that split the original 250 B-1As envisioned between 100 B-1Bs and 132 B-2 stealth bombers. Thus, the original 1981 B-2 contract proposed to acquire as many as 132 B-2s. That number was subsequently trimmed to 75 after the end of the Cold War and ultimately only 21 B-2s were built after the program was cancelled in 1991. In fighter aircraft, the Air Force originally sought to acquire 381 F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighters in 2006. However, the resulting high cost of the aircraft ($150 million in FY2009 dollars), a U.S. ban on exports, and the ongoing development of the potentially cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in only 195 aircraft built (8 test aircraft and 187 combat aircraft).

All three of the legacy bombers receive meticulous care, with every aspect of their existence recorded and tracked to ensure long-term health and safety of flight. Based on this meticulous care, as well as ongoing structural fatigue testing and computer modeling, the Air Force insists all three bombers will meet their extended service life goals. However, whether the Air Force can further delay development of the LRS-B is not simply a matter of the legacy bombers' air worthiness. With enough funding and continued life extension programs, all three bombers could theoretically fly beyond the Air Force's target dates.

The impacts of these fiscal measures on bomber appropriations can already be seen with implementation of the FY2013 defense budget. From FY2002 through FY2012, the sustainment and modernization appropriations for the B-52, B-1, and B-2 averaged $160.15 million, $219.77 million, and $451.2 million per year respectively. For the FY2013 budget, appropriations for the B-52 were $63 million, down 61% from the prior 11-year average and the lowest amount appropriated since FY2002. FY2013 appropriations for the B-1 were $167 million, down 24% from the prior 11-year average and also the lowest amount appropriated since FY2002. The B-2 was the only bomber not affected by the budget cuts in FY2013 with $447 million appropriated, a drop of only 1% from the prior 11-year average. Meanwhile, potential foes and long-time allies in the Asia-Pacific are undergoing major (in some cases unprecedented) expansions of their defense capabilities in order to secure or expand their diplomatic, economic, and strategic influence in the region. The result is an increase in the proliferation of advanced 21 st century weapon systems and a trend of countries adopting A2/AD strategies to secure their national interests. Nevertheless, time and time again, the United States turns to its long-range bomber force as means of flexing its deterrent muscle, as it did most recently in response to renewed threats of war by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In March and April of 2013, the United States sent B-52s and B-2s on short-notice deployments for exercises with South Korean forces and for shows-of-force over the Korean peninsula as a visible signal to Kim Jong Un that such threats by the North's regime will not go unchecked. However, as potential A2/AD equipped adversaries throughout the world become more prevalent and more capable, the question remains: will the Air Force's legacy bomber force keep pace with sustainment and modernization efforts in order to remain a credible response to such adversaries, or will they become increasingly irrelevant because the nation cannot afford them?

In 2011, the B-1 Aircraft Branch contracted with the consulting firm of Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc. to research, study, and develop a cost optimized and time phased B-1 sustainment and modernization plan. The resulting B-1 SAIP provides detailed analysis and recommendations for the period 2014 to 2025 and presents optimum B-1 portfolios of sustainment and modernization efforts for the FY14, FY16, and FY18 Programs Objective Memorandum (POM). The results of this effort produced three sustainment and modernization plans designed to maximize the benefit to be received from three, assumed funding levels dependent on Air Force requested and congressionally provided appropriations.", "Appropriation of $179 million per year (out to 2022) should complete existing sustainment and modernization programs and fund only those sustainment programs needed to maintain existing B-1 capabilities. The B-1 SAIP concludes that $179 million represents the minimum feasible B-1 modernization and sustainment funding level. The B-1 SAIP concluded that appropriations of $250 million per year (out to 2022) is the minimum recommended funding level for B-1 sustainment and modernization. At this level, several high benefit capabilities could be funded, which would reduce Air Force ownership costs and potentially increase the B-1's operational effectiveness. Appropriations of $400 million per year is the highest considered funding profile recommended by the B-1 SAIP and would be sufficient to fund most of the recommended B-1 sustainment and modernization efforts out to 2022.", "The B-1 SAIP concludes that the Air Force should request at least $250 million per year for B-1 sustainment and modernization.
