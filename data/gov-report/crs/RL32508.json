ISR systems range in sizefrom hand-held devices to orbiting satellites. Some collect basic information for a wide range ofanalytical products; others are designed to acquire data for specific weapons systems. Some are\"national\" systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to Washington-area agencies;others are \"tactical\" systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield. Collectively, they account for a major portion of U.S. intelligence spending that, according to mediaestimates, amounts to some $40 billion annually.", "For some time Congress has expressed concern about the costs and management of ISRprograms. With minor exceptions, ISR acquisition has been coordinated by the Defense Departmentand the Intelligence Community. Although there are long-existing staff mechanisms for reviewingand coordinating ISR programs in the context of the annual budget submissions, many in Congressbelieve that existing procedures have not avoided duplication of effort, excessive costs, and gaps incoverage. Examples that some observers cite are separate efforts to acquire a new generation ofreconnaissance satellites and a high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as Global Hawk. Both systems acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers, but theyare acquired in distinctly different ways; moreover, in both cases procurement efforts have beenbeset by increasing costs and schedule delays.", "Recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of ISR capabilities and require that theDefense Department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of ISR capabilitiesover the next fifteen years. An effective roadmap, if developed, could potentially ensure morecomprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money. To establish responsibilityfor an Intelligence Community-wide effort, the 9/11 Commission recommended that a new positionof Director of National Intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program (butnot joint military and tactical intelligence programs, which would continue to be managed by theDefense Department). This position was included, after extended debate, in the Intelligence Reformand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) that was approved by the President onDecember 17, 2004. The implications of this legislation for ISR programs are as yet uncertain, butCongress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long-existing concernswith ISR programs.

ISR covers a multitude ofprograms ranging from billion-dollar satellites to hand-held cameras. The bulk of funding is forresearch and development (R&D) and procurement; personnel costs are comparatively low. Somesystems are used only by military units; others are national systems operated by Washington-leveldefense agencies. Most are surrounded in secrecy, but total spending on ISR, while difficult toestimate with unclassified information, undoubtedly runs into the tens of billions of dollars. The ISRprograms considered in this report are managed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and by thelarge intelligence agencies and components of the Department of Defense (DOD). (2) ", "ISR acquisition has in recent years come under strong criticism. Reportedly, there aretechnical problems with the new generation of reconnaissance satellites, along with billion dollarcost-overruns; only a small number of the planned high-altitude UAVs are actually deployed; andthere have been difficulties in ensuring that the troops who need intelligence acquire it in a timelymanner. There is a widespread awareness that ISR spending, much greater than in past years, couldeasily absorb even larger portions of defense and intelligence budgets, making the need for tradeoffseven more important. Some observers point to the possibility that satellites and UAVs potentiallyundertake the same or similar missions, but that the current system gives little opportunity for costcomparisons or trade-offs to be made in the acquisition process. Appendix A provides a case studyof the trade-offs between satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).", "Understanding the procedures for acquiring ISR systems is, however, complicated by the factthat different ISR systems are acquired in entirely different ways, by different intelligence agenciesor military services, and are designed for different users. In addition, the acquisition processes areoverseen by different congressional committees. It is difficult to ensure efficient acquisition in theseparate programs which are often based on innovative technologies. It is even more challengingto envision a seamless and comprehensive system of systems and to ensure the acquisition of anoptimal mix of specific systems.

There has been, it is argued, inadequate data to compare systems capabilities and costsacross the spectrum of intelligence programs, an imbalance between collection and analysisprograms, and an intelligence effort that does not reflect an optimal allocation of extensive resources. Expressions of congressional concern go back a number of years. In 1995, the Senate SelectCommittee on Intelligence (SSCI) expressed its misgivings about existing cooperation amongagencies and recommended a joint review by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and theDeputy Secretary of Defense to ensure that \"both Intelligence Community and Defense Departmentequities are served in the planning, programming, and management of all intelligence activities andprograms.\" (3) ", "Some believed that giving the DCI greater management responsibilities would improve themanagement of ISR programs, including those in the Department of Defense (DOD). Reflecting thatview, the FY1997 Intelligence Authorization Act ( P.L. 104-293 ) included provisions thatstrengthened the ability of the DCI \"to manage the Intelligence Community by codifying hisauthority to participate in the development of the budgets for defense-wide and tacticalintelligence....\" (4) TheConference Committee stated: \"Giving the DCI a database of all intelligence activities and requiringall National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) elements (5) to submit periodic budget execution reports should enable the DCIto make better use of his existing authorities -- given to him by Congress in 1992 -- to approve thebudgets of NFIP elements and to transfer funds and personnel with the concurrence of affectedagency heads. The conferees in considering the FY1997 legislation urged the DCI to be moreassertive in using these authorities.\" (6) ", "In May 2000, the Senate Intelligence Committee reported that, \"the budget practices of the[Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)] and the Intelligence Community as a whole are simplyinadequate to address current requirements. Upper level program managers lack sufficient insightinto the process to make informed and timely decisions regarding the allocation of funds, and toassure Congress, and themselves, that funds are being spent as appropriated and authorized.\" (7) ", "The next year the committee again argued that the Intelligence Community \"is handicappedby the lack of comprehensive strategic and performance plans that can be used to articulate programgoals, measure program performance, improve program efficiency and aid in resource planning.\" Accordingly, the Committee directed the DCI to produce a \"comprehensive Intelligence Communitystrategic plan and performance plan, as well as complementary strategic and performance plans forthe intelligence agencies within the National Foreign Intelligence Program aggregation.\" TheCommittee asked that such plans be undertaken annually and made available to congressionalcommittees by March 1 of each year. (8) ", "In 2002, the Senate Intelligence Committee acknowledged receipt of the \"first-ever planscoordinated across the Intelligence Community aimed at establishing performance measures alignedwith the stated goals and priorities of the Director of Central Intelligence.\" The Committee went on,however, to indicate that further work is needed and suggested that developing new systems merelyto acquire a new capability was insufficient; the capability had to meet validated intelligence needs. \"A key issue is the development of performance plans and measures that are not focused solely onthe attainment of intelligence capabilities but also on the value received from such capabilities inpursuit of Intelligence Community missions.\" (9) ", "Despite this admonition, the next year the Committee called attention to the absence of a2003 performance plan submission, even though the deadline had passed with no request for anextension. (10) Moresignificantly, the Committee noted that it is aware", "of no capability within DoD or the IntelligenceCommunity for objectively, independently, and comprehensively evaluating alternative sensor andplatform architecture and capabilities. There are some capabilities within different agencies anddepartments, but none that are available, independent of the program offices, to model and assesscross-program trades without regard to the location of the sensor or platform (air, space, land, or sea)or the level of compartmentation. Consequently, although DoD and Intelligence Communityofficials expend substantial effort and time evaluating program trades, they do so without the benefitof the rigorous quantitative modeling necessary to optimize collection capabilities and architectures. Given the vast sums involved in these programs, even modest increases in the efficiency of resourcesallocation could lead to substantial benefits. Further, the Committee notes that the national militarystrategy, as well as the Defense Planning Guidance, have been developed in recent years without theparticipation of the Director of Central Intelligence or his staff, notwithstanding the growingimportance of intelligence to military operations and the need to build forces commensurate tovalidated threats. (11)", "Section 355 of the FY2004 Intelligence Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-177 ) required a report from theDCI and the Secretary of Defense assessing progress in the development of \"a comprehensive anduniform analytical capability to assess the utility and advisability of various sensor and platformarchitectures and capabilities for the collection of intelligence ... [and] the improvement ofcoordination between the Department [of Defense] and the intelligence community on strategic andbudgetary planning.", "In separate legislation, Congress also urged that DOD take a greater role in managing ISR;in section 923 of the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-136 ) Congress found that:", "... there is not currently a well-defined forum throughwhich the integrators of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for each of theArmed Forces can routinely interact with each other and with senior representatives of Departmentof Defense intelligence agencies, as well as with other members of the intelligence community, toensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication of effort. (12)", "P.L. 108-136 further stated that the existing structure of intelligence programming ", "may not be the best approach for supporting thedevelopment of an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meetthe national security requirements of the United States in the 21stcentury.", "Accordingly, the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act directed the Under Secretary of Defense forIntelligence to establish an \"ISR Integration Council\" to provide a permanent forum for assessingISR capabilities. The council is to consist of senior intelligence officers of the services, the SpecialOperations Command, the Joint Staff, and the directors of DOD intelligence agencies. The DCIwould be \"invited\" to participate. The council would be charged with developing a comprehensiveroadmap \"to guide the development and integration\" of DOD ISR capabilities for 15 years. (13) ", "In addition to its general concerns about ISR programs, some Members of Congress havespecifically focused on two issues related to budget processes that they argued undermine theirabilities to conduct oversight of ISR efforts.

Justification materials on national programs are submitted to the twointelligence committees along with classified CBJBs, which include one volume for each NIPprogram plus an additional summary volume. The classified books, available to Members andcommittee staff, include explanatory narrative and resource displays for all resources requested bythe program. Also included are descriptions of base levels of efforts, ongoing initiatives and newinitiatives with associated resource displays. CBJBs are submitted to Congress within a few weeksof the delivery of the budget in early February and form the basis for the committees' review of theentire NIP prior to the drafting of annual intelligence authorization bills.

In 1997 HPSCI criticized justification books for lacking \"several criticalcomponents necessary for the Committee to ensure proper alignment of funding within the fundingappropriations categories. Clear identification of each project; its specific budget request numbers;the appropriation category (e.g., Other Procurement, Defense-wide; RDT&E, Navy, etc.); the budgetrequest line number, and if a research and development project, the Program Element number [are]essential to this task.... Therefore, the Committee directs the CMS [Community Management Staff]and the Defense Department to provide this specific data in all future budget justificationdocuments.\" (14) ", "In 2000, HPSCI expressed its continued frustration with a perceived lack of detail providedin justification books (which are classified) and strongly criticized financial management practicesat some NFIP agencies. HPSCI stated that:", "... the NFIP agencies need greater insight into theirfinancial obligations and the capabilities that they are developing. NSA's baseline activity, forexample, identified many areas of duplicative development, as well as lack of investment in keystrategic areas. Yet, due to the lack of detail, the CBJB did not provide this information. TheCommittee notes that, at least at some agencies, internal financial management practices seriouslycomplicate this process.... (15)", "In 2003, HPSCI again called attention to limitations in the data included in CBJBs which isoften less extensive than that routinely provided in DOD budget materials: ", "The Committee believes, for example, that acquisitionprogram details in the CBJBs should include major milestones and deliverables for contractedprojects for the entire length of a contract and contain more specificity for the budget year of therequest. Many of the project milestones in the CBJBs are, however, at such a high-level that theCommittee is unable to determine the stage of the development activity or what will be accomplishedin the coming year. The project descriptions are often so vague that the Committee is unable todetermine the value of, or even what is being developed.

(17) Of the $165.6 billion insupplemental appropriations that the Defense Department has received since September 2001, asignificant, but not publicly identified, portion of these sums -- at least $16 billion (not countingfunds received in the FY2004 Iraq supplemental) -- was directed at intelligence andintelligence-related activities. (18) ", "Arguably, there is less opportunity for consideration of proposed supplemental intelligencespending within the context of established programs. The HPSCI noted in July 2002:", "The \"advantage\" of the supplemental process to theIntelligence Community is that pressing budgetary demands can be met in a shorter time (and withfewer bureaucratic hurdles) than the regular yearly process. However, by continuing to rely onsupplemental appropriations year after year, the Intelligence Community risks fostering a budgetprocess that is ripe for abuse and long-term funding gaps.", "The House Committee also argued that the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) (a fundinginitiative that permits DOD to shift funds from a central fund to specific appropriations accountsafter enactment as required for counterterrorist operations) \"has turned into just another vehicle tofund items that the Intelligence Community did not get through the regular budget and planningprocess.\" (19) Inparticular, it is argued, supplemental legislation can undercut established budgeting andcongressional oversight procedures making it more difficult to weigh trade-offs and adjust overallpriorities. It can, in some situations, lead to the launching of programs that are unlikely to besustained in the regular authorization and appropriation process.", "Some question the propriety of funding \"core\" programs in emergency supplementallegislation which are intended to provide for additional unforeseen needs resulting from combat andoccupation duties. In June 2003, HPSCI reiterated its concerns, regretting that \"core mission andcore mission support programs have also been funded in supplemental appropriations.\" It arguedthat, \"The repeated reliance on supplemental appropriations has an erosive negative effect onplanning, and impedes long-term, strategic planning. The Committee hopes that the IC has finallyreached a plateau of resources and capabilities on which long-term strategic planning can nowbegin.\"", "Further, HPSCI concluded:", "The Committee cannot help but note that budgeting bysupplemental consequentially limits congressional oversight. The Committee strongly believes thatthe health of the IC is directly related to the oversight from Congress it receives. Certainly, theconfidence of the American people activities, and programs of the IC is increased significantly asa result of the transparency that exists between the IC and its congressional overseers. (20)", "Concern in not limited to the House Committee. In its report on a FY2005 IntelligenceAuthorization bill ( S. 2386 ) the Senate Intelligence Committee argued, \"While thepractice of funding baseline expenditures using supplemental vehicles has become more prevalentin the past 10 years, ... it is time to rein in this practice.\" (21) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reprogramming Issues", "paragraphs": ["A concern for some observers of the Intelligence Community are the current procedures forreprogramming of previously appropriated funds. Reprogrammings are intended to permit shiftingfunds to meet unanticipated new requirements that arise during the course the year. The NationalSecurity Act permitted the DCI to transfer funds appropriated for one program within NIP to anotherprogram within the NIP, but there were congressional concerns that reprogramming procedures didnot invariably met statutory requirements. (22) In May 2000, the House Intelligence Committee complainedabout \"significant and deleterious movements of money\" from field stations to CIA Headquartersthat were inconsistent with National Security Act provisions and asked the CIA Inspector Generalto investigate whether statutory provisions were being followed. (23) Similar concerns wereexpressed by the Senate Intelligence Committee: \"Recent actions, including taxing directorates forfunds to be used in other areas, and moving funds within expenditure centers without congressionalnotification, have eroded this Committee's confidence that appropriations are used as intended.\" (24) During floor considerationof the FY2004 intelligence authorization conference report, Senator Roberts, Chairman of the SenateIntelligence Committee, commented on \"difficulties in the out years as the National ForeignIntelligence Program becomes burdened with content that is more costly than the budgeted funding. This underestimation of future costs has resulted in significant re-shuffling of NFIP funds to meetemerging shortfalls.\" (25) ", "Congress also criticized the process for reprogramming funds between NFIP programs andnon-NFIP programs. In May 2002, the Senate Intelligence Committee expressed concern that \"thecorrespondence it receives notifying it of the reprogramming of funds from one activity to anotheroften does not set forth clearly how the ... requirements of 'higher priority' and 'unforeseen'circumstances have been satisfied.\" Section 305 of the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act\"clarifies the 'unforeseen' requirement by stating that such a requirement does not include the failureof the Director of Central Intelligence to anticipate an action by Congress, such as an authorizationor appropriation level lower than that requested in the President's budget.\" (26) The provision was not,however, included in the version of the bill that was enacted as P.L. 107-306 .

Furthermore, a senior Intelligence Community official, LarryKindsvater, the DCI's Executive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs and subsequentlyDeputy DCI for Community Management, argued the need to reorganize the IntelligenceCommunity, and proposed, among other things, to give the DCI authority to transfer funding acrossagencies with congressional approval. (28) ", "The publication of the 9/11 Commission's report in July 2004 provided the impetus forcongressional action in an election year. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations regarding therole of the new DNI appear to have been based primarily on the perceived inability of the DCI toensure interagency communications and effectively control the allocation of intelligence assets. TheCommission noted that DCI Tenet was reported to have placed the Intelligence Community \"at war\"with Al Qaeda in December 1998, but without being able to ensure that all agencies concentratedsignificant resources on the terrorist group. (29) The Commission also noted efforts in the 1990s to address theDCI's perceived lack of personnel and budget authority over intelligence agencies. It further pointedout the results of intelligence reorganization legislation introduced in the 1996:", "The Department of Defense and its congressionalauthorizing committees rose in opposition to the proposed changes. The President and the DCI didnot actively support these changes. Relatively small changes made in 1996 gave the DCIconsultative authority and created a new deputy for management and assistant DCIs for collectionand analysis. The reforms occurred only after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence took theunprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense authorization bill. Indeed, rather thanincreasing the DCI's authorities over national intelligence, the 1990s witnessed movement in theopposite direction through, for example, the transfer of the CIA's imaging analysis capability to thenew imagery and mapping agency created within the Department of Defense. (30)", "Nevertheless, as former Representative Hamilton, the Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commissiontestified: ", "I do not recall us finding a failure of a DOD agency, sofar as we know. But we certainly think that part of the problem has been an unwillingness to sharethe information that a number of agencies had. (31)", "Although some observers argued that the \"wall\" separating intelligence and law enforcementagencies may have been a primary reason for the unwillingness to share information and that the wallhad been effectively removed by the USA Patriot Act of October 2001 ( P.L. 107-56 ), therecommendation of the 9/11 Commission to establish a DNI with stronger oversight andmanagement responsibilities for all intelligence agencies (including components of law enforcementagencies) was ultimately accepted by both the Bush Administration and the Congress. ", "As described below, the Intelligence Reform Act provides the DNI with important statutoryauthorities in the intelligence budget process. It also enhances the reprogramming authorities of theDNI; the DNI may transfer or reprogram funds within the National Intelligence Program with theapproval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, after consultation with heads ofdepartment affected, and subject to provisions in annual appropriations acts. In addition, the fundsmust be transferred to an activity that is a higher priority intelligence activity, that supports anemergent need or improves program effectiveness. The transfer or reprogramming out of anydepartment or agency in a single fiscal year must be less than $150 million or 5% of the amountsavailable to the department or agency from the National Intelligence Program.

As the Intelligence ResourceManager's Guide noted, \"As systems grow in complexity and capability and methods become moresophisticated, increasing numbers of intelligence assets are capable of simultaneously serving bothnational and tactical purposes.\" (42) For example, there has been for a number of years a program,known as Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP), which is designed to facilitatethe use of satellite imagery and other NIP products by military commanders. In some militaryengagements with important diplomatic and political implications, low-level tactical intelligenceacquired through TIARA systems is also desired by senior officials to support their efforts at crisismanagement. In August 2004 testimony, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence StephenCambone stated, in response to a question about the existence of a clear line between national andtactical intelligence:", "... an irony of this, sir, is that we spent a good deal oftime, at least during my tenure, trying to merge and blur the line and distinction between what isstrategic and tactical and what is national and military, since it's increasingly difficult to distinguisheither in the product that is produced or in the capability that is applied. So Global Hawks, whichare built by the Air Force, are as significant and important as SIGINT satellites that are built by theNational Reconnaissance Office and whose take is managed by the National Security Agency.

Changing the statutes,regulations, and rules which established the three categories obviously would be difficult and wouldaffect organizational relationships in both executive and legislative branches.

A major challenge for the Office of the DNI, when activated, will be to coordinate ISR programswithin the NIP for which it is primarily responsible with those that are in JMIP and TIARA forwhich the Defense Department has primary responsibility. The same types of coordinativemechanisms that have long existed will undoubtedly continue to be required.

Observers sense that current procedures to integrateintelligence acquisition efforts have not led to a comprehensive assessment of major issues relatingto satellite and UAV programs. If UAVs can do at least part of the work of satellites then, arguably,considerable budgetary savings might be realized.
