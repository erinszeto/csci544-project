To collect these data, CRS partnered with graduate students at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. Custom programming scripts were developed that queried both Facebook and Twitter's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and pulled account-specific information from Members' official public accounts. A second dataset capturing Member adoption of Twitter and Facebook was collected in January 2012, reflecting the most recent Member additions to social media available in the data collection phase of the research project. These adoption data were used to analyze Member use of Twitter and Facebook.", "The unit of analysis is the individual Tweet or Facebook post. A total of 47,004 cases are included in the dataset\u201430,765 Tweets and 16,239 Facebook posts. Data collection was automated and characteristics, including the date, time, and content were captured. After an initial examination of the content and a review of established coding schemes used to catalog similar data, researchers devised a comprehensive set of coding categories. The research team then examined each Tweet or post and recorded the appropriate coding results. Coding was subjected to an internal reliability test to validate inter-coder consistency. Tweets or Facebook posts could be coded into more than one category.", "Several caveats accompany the results presented. First, the analysis treats all Member Tweets and Facebook posts as structurally identical, because each individual Tweet or post reveals no information about who physically typed the message. In some cases, Members might personally Tweet or post, whereas other Members may delegate these responsibilities to staff. CRS draws no distinction between the two. Second, the analysis covers only two months of Member activity. Therefore, it is inherently a snapshot in time of a dynamic process. As with any new technology, the number of Members using Twitter and the patterns of use may change rapidly in short periods of time.

As Members continue to embrace new technologies, their use of Twitter, Facebook, and other forms of social media may increase. These mediums allow Members to communicate directly with constituents (and others) in a potentially interactive way that is not possible through mail or e-mail. For Members and their staff, the ability to collect and transmit real time information to and from constituents could be influential for issue prioritization, policy decisions, or voting behavior.", "Further research on how the adoption and use of social media platforms\u2014such as Twitter and Facebook\u2014could provide insight into changing approaches to representation, messaging to constituents, communications outside a Member's district or state, and potential regulation. Traditionally, Members represent a geographic constituency. Social media, however, provides Members with an \"additional tool for contacting the geographic constituency, but ... also ... to reach groups outside of their official jurisdiction who share ideological goals and priorities.\" Subsequently, while Members represent a geographic district, social media could allow \"surrogate representation\" by Members of other non-geographic constituent groups. The consequences of such representation are not known, but could alter the representational strategies of individual Members within Congress.", "As part of representation, Members not only represent a geographic constituency, but they are also concerned with their personal message and how it impacts reelection efforts. While official Member communication cannot include campaign rhetoric, Members know that what they say on official social media channels can be used in elections. Subsequently, how Members use social media continues to evolve. Some reports have suggested that Members are dedicating additional staff (or hiring new staff) to handle social media as part of their messaging and communications strategy. In the current budget climate, how Members allocate staff is crucial. If Members are spending more resources on social media, it is possible that the priorities of other representational functions may change.", "Electronic communications have also raised some concerns. While a complete discussion of this is beyond the scope of this report, a few observations warrant mentioning. First, existing law and chamber regulations on the use of communication media such as the franking privilege have proven difficult to adapt to the new electronic technologies. Currently, House regulations treat social media communications similarly to solicited franked mail. But several key differences between electronic communications and franked mail\u2014most notably the lack of marginal cost, the inability to differentiate between constituents and non-constituents, and the ability of campaign challengers to adopt identical applications\u2014raise questions about both the suitability and necessity of applying the franking model to social media communications. ", "Second, the use of electronic communications is rapidly changing, sometimes over the course of just months. Just 10 years ago, Facebook and Twitter did not exist. There is no way to predict whether they will continue to enjoy their current popularity 10 years from now, or what future communications tools and applications will exist. Policymakers thus may choose to seek general rather than specific structures when considering social media regulation, to avoid the need to revisit policies as new technologies are developed."], "subsections": []}]}}
