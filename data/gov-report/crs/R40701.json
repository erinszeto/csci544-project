As part of these deliberations, consideration has been given to how students with disabilities are included in accountability systems. The ESEA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, P.L. 108-446) both require all students with disabilities to participate in district and state assessments. Because student achievement on state assessments is used to determine adequate yearly progress (AYP) in state accountability systems mandated by the ESEA, schools are held accountable for the achievement of all students, including students with disabilities.", "While many students with disabilities are able to participate in the general state assessments, either with or without accommodations, other students with disabilities may not be able to participate fully in the general state assessment because of the nature or severity of their disability. These students may need an alternate assessment that is tailored to their needs to allow them to accurately demonstrate what they know and can do. In response to these needs, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) created five assessment options for measuring the achievement of students with disabilities through regulations, including two options that allow students to take an alternate assessment (AA), one based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS) and the other based on modified achievement standards (AA-MAS). There are restrictions on how the performance of students participating in AA-AAS or AA-MAS assessments are included in state accountability systems. Specifically, the regulations limit the number of proficient and advanced scores based on these alternate assessments that may be included in the determination of AYP. The number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS may not exceed 1% of all students in the grades assessed in reading and in mathematics within the state accountability system. Similarly, the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-MAS may not exceed 2% of all students in the grades assessed in reading and in mathematics within the state accountability system. These limits are commonly referred to as the \"1% and 2% caps or rules.\"", "ED is currently engaged in an examination of the regulations related to AA-MAS and has proposed eliminating the use of AA-MAS entirely. Currently, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have had their applications for an ESEA flexibility package approved by ED. Under this package, states have been granted waivers of ESEA accountability requirements in exchange for meeting principles specified by ED. As part of these principles, no later than the 2014-2015 school year, states operating under the ESEA flexibility package must include students who are currently eligible to take AA-MAS in their assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards. Thus, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will no longer be able to administer AA-MAS as of the 2014-2015 school year, regardless of when or if ED enacts the aforementioned proposed regulations.", "This report focuses primarily on current law and state and local implementation of alternate assessments in state accountability systems, including the challenges in developing and implementing these assessments and an analysis of recommended changes to assessment policies for students with disabilities. In addition, it highlights some issues that may arise due to changes made by ED through waivers of ESEA accountability requirements and the associated conditions that states must meet to receive the waivers. This report does not reflect ED's proposal to eliminate AA-MAS and require states to start transitioning away from the use of AA-MAS in the near future, as the proposed changes have not been adopted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, P.L. 107-110 ), and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, P.L. 108-446 ) both require all students with disabilities to participate in district and state assessments. Because student achievement on state assessments is used to determine adequate yearly progress (AYP) in state accountability systems mandated by ESEA, schools are now held accountable for the achievement of all students, including students with disabilities. The 113 th Congress is actively considering whether to amend and extend the ESEA. As part of these deliberations, consideration has been given to how students with disabilities are included in accountability systems.", "The NCLB focus on accountability for the achievement of students with disabilities led educators, administrators, and policy makers to reexamine the appropriateness of the general state assessment for measuring the achievement of certain students with disabilities. Although many students with disabilities are able to participate in the general state assessment, either with or without accommodations, other students with disabilities may not be able to participate fully in the general state assessment because of the nature and severity of their disability. These students may need an alternate assessment that is tailored to their needs and allows them to more accurately demonstrate what they know and can do.", "There are currently five assessment options for measuring the achievement of students with disabilities: (1) general state assessment, (2) general state assessment with accommodations, (3) alternate assessment based on grade-level standards, (4) alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS), and (5) alternate assessment based on modified achievement standards (AA-MAS). The first three assessment options (general state assessment, general state assessment with accommodations, and alternate assessment based on grade-level standards) result in scores that may be counted in AYP calculations in the typical manner, as determined by a state's accountability system. Scores from the second two assessment options (AA-AAS and AA-MAS) have restrictions on the way they may be counted in AYP calculations. These restrictions are outlined in regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and have numerous implications for state accountability systems.", "In August 2013, ED proposed regulations that would require states to transition away from AA-MAS. In addition, in September 2011, the Secretary announced that states may request flexibility on various ESEA academic accountability requirements, teacher qualification-related requirements, and funding flexibility requirements that were enacted through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ) in exchange for meeting four principles established by ED. The four principles, as stated by ED, are as follows: (1) college- and career-ready expectations for all students; (2) state-developed differentiated recognition, accountability, and support; (3) supporting effective instruction and leadership; and (4) reducing duplication and unnecessary burden. ", "As of March 5, 2014, ED had approved ESEA flexibility package applications for 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Similar flexibility was also provided to a group of LEAs in California. Under the ESEA flexibility package, states are required to provide for alternate assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards or alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement standards for the students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. These assessments must be aligned with the state's college- and career-ready standards. No later than the 2014-2015 school year, states operating under the ESEA flexibility package must include students who are currently eligible to take alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards in their assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards. Thus, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will no longer be able to administer alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards as of the 2014-2015 school year, regardless of when or if ED enacts the aforementioned proposed regulations. ", "As none of the aforementioned changes have been promulgated through statutory language or regulation, this report focuses primarily on the current ED regulations that allow states to use scores from alternate assessments for AYP calculations in accountability systems. It does, however, highlight some issues that may arise due to the proposed regulations and the issuance of the ESEA flexibility package. This report also describes the current status of state implementation of alternate assessments and examines some of the challenges states have encountered in developing and implementing these assessments. This is followed by a discussion of other policy proposals for measuring the achievement of students with disabilities and including them in accountability systems. The report concludes with a brief examination of ESEA reauthorization activity in the 113 th Congress as it relates to alternate assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief Legislative History of Alternate Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Including students with disabilities in state assessments is a relatively new practice. As recently as the 1990s, students with disabilities were often excluded from general state assessments. The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA, P.L. 103-382 ) and IDEA of 1997 ( P.L. 105-17 ) were the first pieces of federal legislation that mandated the participation of students with disabilities in state assessments. By mandating participation of students with disabilities in state assessments, the legislation sought to increase access to the general education curriculum for students with disabilities and, in turn, increase expectations and achievement of students with disabilities.", "The use of alternate assessments within state assessment systems is also relatively new. In 1997, IDEA required states to develop alternate assessments for students with disabilities for whom the general state assessment was inappropriate. The alternate assessment was intended to be a more accurate measure of what some students with disabilities know and can do. Alternate assessments were intended to decrease the barriers of the general state assessments and allow students with disabilities to demonstrate their knowledge more accurately.", "Several years after IASA and IDEA required students with disabilities to participate in state assessments, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) greatly increased the emphasis on student assessment, and the academic achievement of students with disabilities gained more attention. Under NCLB, student scores on state assessments are used to measure AYP. Scores on these assessments must be disaggregated by various subgroups, one of which is students with disabilities. Although NCLB requires states to develop at least one alternate assessment to use within their state assessment systems, the law did not explicitly outline how the alternate assessments should be used within an accountability system.", "The combination of the requirement to include all students with disabilities in state assessment systems and NCLB's requirement that all subgroups of students meet AYP goals created a need for states to have more accurate assessments for all students with disabilities, including students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and other students with disabilities who were not expected to meet grade-level achievement standards within the academic year. For these students with disabilities, an alternate assessment may be more appropriate than the general state assessment. Because of the NCLB requirement to develop at least one alternate assessment, many alternate assessments were already used by states. Nonetheless, questions remained about who should be eligible to take alternate assessments and how scores from alternate assessments should be counted within state accountability systems.", "To address these concerns, ED released regulations outlining the use of two types of alternate assessments for students with disabilities: alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS) and alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards (AA-MAS). The regulations provide guidance to states on how to determine a student's eligibility for participation in alternate assessments and how to count scores from alternate assessments in state accountability systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Assessments: Description and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["An alternate assessment is an assessment designed for students with disabilities for whom the general state assessment is inappropriate even when they are provided with appropriate accommodations. It is designed to be a more accurate measure of what students with disabilities know and can do. Alternate assessments differ from general state assessments in both form and complexity. The form of an alternate assessment varies depending on the needs of the student. The assessment may include teacher observation of the student, samples of student work that demonstrate mastery of specific content (e.g., portfolio assessment), performance on tasks produced in an \"on-demand\" setting (e.g., performance assessment), or other methods of collecting data on student achievement.", "An alternate assessment is developed by adapting two parameters of the general state assessment: content standards and achievement standards. A content standard specifies what all students should know and be able to do. Content standards describe what teachers should be teaching and what students should be learning in academic areas, such as reading, mathematics, and science. An achievement standard is a predetermined level of performance that denotes proficiency within a given content area. Achievement standards describe how well a student must perform in order to be proficient within a content area. Determining achievement levels requires that achievement standards describe the competencies associated with varying levels of proficiency and set \"cut scores\" that categorize students into these levels. An example of a content standard for elementary mathematics may be: \"Know the addition facts (sums to 20) and the corresponding subtraction facts and commit them to memory.\" The corresponding achievement standard may be a level of mastery that defines proficiency (e.g., number correct, 80% accuracy, 90% accuracy, and so on).", "Understanding the difference between content standards and achievement standards is essential to understanding the way different types of alternate assessments are developed. ED regulations regarding the design of alternate assessments describe different methods for developing alternate assessments that vary according to (1) when it is appropriate to adapt and extend content standards and achievement standards, and (2) when it is appropriate to adapt only the achievement standards. In general, in AA-AAS, it is appropriate to adapt and extend content standards and achievement standards; in AA-MAS, it is appropriate to adapt only the achievement standards.", "ED issued two sets of regulations concerning the development of alternate assessments and their use in state accountability systems. In December 2003, ED finalized NCLB regulations that authorized states to use results from AA-AAS in AYP calculations for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Later, in April 2007, ED finalized NCLB regulations that authorized states to use results from AA-MAS in AYP calculations for other students with disabilities who were unlikely to reach grade-level proficiency within a year. The following sections describe the regulations issued by ED concerning the development of AA-AAS and AA-MAS and their use in state accountability systems. In addition, Appendix A provides a table that summarizes the similarities and differences between AA-AAS and AA-MAS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alternate Assessments Based on Alternate Achievement Standards", "paragraphs": ["AA-AAS are assessments designed to measure the academic achievement of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. A state that uses AA-AAS must develop alternate achievement standards through a \"documented and validated standards setting process,\" and ensure that the standards (1) are aligned with the state's academic content standards, (2) promote access to the general curriculum, and (3) reflect professional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible. AA-AAS are subject to the same technical standards as the general state assessment, including the need for them to meet professional and technical standards for validity and reliability.", "AA-AAS may cover a narrower range of content and have a different set of expectations than the general state assessment based on grade-level expectations. The content standards of AA-AAS may be \"extended\" so that students with the most significant cognitive disabilities may be tested on content that is aligned with grade-level content standards but not fully representative of grade-level content standards. The content standards of the AA-AAS may be \"substantially simplified\" and may include prerequisite skills that would be necessary to master grade-level content. The achievement standards of AA-AAS may differ from a grade-level achievement standard in the level of expectation that is necessary to denote proficiency. Alternate achievement standards are subject to the same requirements as other academic achievement standards. That is, alternate achievement standards must be aligned with the state's academic content standards, describe at least three levels of achievement, include descriptions of the competencies associated with each level, and include assessment scores (cut scores) that differentiate among the achievement levels. A state may choose to develop alternate achievement standards for grade clusters (e.g., 3-5, 6-9, or 10-12) rather than for individual grades.", "AA-AAS are used to assess students with disabilities who have the \"most significant cognitive disabilities.\" IDEA does not provide a federal definition of \"significant cognitive disability,\" and students within any of the disability categories may be eligible to participate in AA-AAS. ED describes students with the most significant cognitive disabilities as students who are \"(1) within one or more of the existing categories of disability under the IDEA (e.g., autism, multiple disabilities, traumatic brain injury, etc.); and (2) whose cognitive impairments may prevent them from attaining grade-level achievement standards, even with the very best instruction.\" ED estimates that approximately 9% of students with disabilities (approximately 1% of all students) have the most significant cognitive disabilities that may qualify them to participate in AA-AAS.", "States are responsible for defining \"most significant cognitive disability\" and establishing criteria to identify the students with disabilities who are eligible to participate in AA-AAS. Based on guidance issued by the state, the final determination of eligibility for AA-AAS is made by a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) team. In addition to providing guidance on the students who may appropriately participate in AA-AAS, the state must (1) ensure that parents of those students are informed that their child's achievement will be based on alternate achievement standards, and (2) report to ED on the number and percentage of students taking alternate assessments.", "ED regulations do not limit the number or percentage of students who may participate in AA-AAS. The regulations do, however, limit the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS that may be used in AYP calculations within a state accountability system. The number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS may not exceed 1% of all students in the grades assessed in reading/language arts and in mathematics within the state accountability system. This regulation is often referred to as the \"1% rule\" or the \"1% cap,\" and it represents approximately 9% of all students with disabilities. The 1% cap applies to both LEAs and states but not to individual schools. Under certain circumstances, however, an LEA may request an exception from the state to exceed this cap.", "The 1% cap was developed through a process of proposed rules and public comment that occurred between August 2002 and December 2003. On August 6, 2002, ED first proposed that the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS included in AYP calculations may not exceed 0.5% of all students in the grades assessed. The \"0.5% cap\" became a final rule on December 2, 2002. The 0.5% cap was based on scientific estimates of the prevalence of moderate, severe, and profound mental retardation. Moderate, severe, and profound mental retardation are often defined as intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior that are three or more standard deviations below the mean. At that time, ED proposed an operational definition of \"students with the most significant cognitive disabilities\" to mirror that of moderate, severe, and profound mental retardation (i.e., students with intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior three or more standard deviations below the mean). Many commenters objected to the 0.5% cap, citing state and LEA variation in the prevalence of students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities.\" Based on these comments, ED proposed raising the cap to 1% of all assessed students. In addition, many commenters objected to the proposed operational definition of students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" because of its implicit reliance on IQ tests (measuring \"intellectual functioning\" usually involves the use of traditional IQ tests). ED agreed that the definition would have placed unwarranted reliance on IQ tests and removed it. The final regulations maintained the 1% cap and removed the operational definition, allowing states to develop their own criteria for students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Assessments Based on Modified Achievement Standards24", "paragraphs": ["AA-MAS are assessments designed to measure the academic achievement of students with disabilities whose disabilities may prevent them from achieving grade-level proficiency within a year but who do not have the \"most significant cognitive disabilities.\" A state that uses AA-MAS must develop modified achievement standards that (1) are aligned with the state's academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled, (2) are challenging for eligible students, but may be less difficult than the grade-level academic achievement standards, (3) include at least three achievement levels, and (4) are developed through a documented and validated standards-setting process that includes broad stakeholder input. Many states found it difficult to understand how the requirements for modified achievement standards could be met. Since the student population eligible for AA-MAS was never clearly defined, developing expectations that were both \"challenging\" but still \"less difficult\" for any eligible student was a formidable task, and likely was a contributing factor in some states' decisions not to implement AA-MAS.", "AA-MAS are subject to the same technical standards as the general state assessment, including the need for them to meet professional and technical standards for validity and reliability. AA-MAS must be aligned with grade-level content standards. The content standards may not be \"extended\" or \"substantially simplified,\" and they may not reflect prerequisite skills for grade-level content. AA-MAS must represent grade-level content standards. The assessment may, however, differ from the general state assessment in terms of the expectation of achievement (i.e., the achievement standard). The achievement standards of AA-MAS may differ from a grade-level achievement standard in the level of expectation that denotes proficiency. Modified achievement standards describe achievement expectations that are less difficult than grade-level expectations. An AA-MAS, therefore, covers the same grade-level content as the general state assessment, however, questions may be less difficult and the expectation of achievement can be modified. Modified achievement standards are subject to the same requirements as other academic achievement standards. They must be aligned with the state's academic content standards, describe at least three levels of achievement, include descriptions of the competencies associated with each level, and include assessment scores (cut scores) that differentiate among the achievement levels. A state must develop modified achievement standards for each grade in which AA-MAS is implemented; it may not develop modified achievement standards for grade clusters (e.g., 3-5, 6-9, 10-12).", "AA-MAS are used to assess students with disabilities as defined by IDEA whose disabilities may prevent them from achieving grade-level proficiency within a year (the year covered by their IEP). Students in any of the disability categories described in IDEA may be eligible to participate in AA-MAS. Beyond the requirement that a student have a disability, a state must establish additional criteria for IEP teams to use in determining whether a student should participate in AA-MAS. At minimum, the criteria must include three types of evidence. First, there must be objective evidence that demonstrates the student's disability has precluded him or her from achieving grade-level proficiency. This evidence may include performance on prior years' state assessments or other assessments. Second, the student's progress to date in response to appropriate instruction must indicate that that the student would not meet grade-level proficiency within the academic year, even if significant growth were to occur. This determination is made by a student's IEP team using multiple measures of the student's progress. Third, the student's IEP must include goals that are based on the academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled (i.e., the student must have a \"standards-based IEP\"). ", "As with AA-AAS, ED regulations do not limit the number or percentage of students who may participate in AA-MAS. The regulations do, however, limit the number of proficient and advanced scores that may be used in AYP calculations within a state accountability system. The number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-MAS may not exceed 2% of all students in the grades assessed in reading/language arts and in mathematics within the state accountability system. This regulation is often referred to as the \"2% rule\" or the \"2% cap,\" and it represents approximately 20% of all students with disabilities. The 2% cap applies to both LEAs and states but not to individual schools. Under certain circumstance, however, states and LEAs may exceed this cap.", "The 2% cap is based on several studies reporting that some students with disabilities, even when provided evidence-based instruction, may not achieve grade-level proficiency within an academic year. The studies estimated that the percentage of students with disabilities who may not reach grade-level proficiency is between 15% and 22%. Again, the 2% cap translates into approximately 20% of all students with disabilities, which is reasonably similar to the results of the studies cited by ED. During the public comment period on the proposed rules, some commenters stated that the 2% cap was too low, however, many commenters stated that the 2% cap was too high, citing data reported by the National Center on Educational Outcomes. ED recognized that a greater number of studies to support the 2% cap was desirable, however, ED maintained that the 2% cap is appropriate and protects students with disabilities from being inappropriately assigned to participate in AA-MAS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Assessments in State Accountability Systems", "paragraphs": ["The previous sections have discussed general features of alternate assessments, regulatory requirements for the development of AA-AAS and AA-MAS, eligibility for AA-AAS and AA-MAS, and the basic concept of the 1% cap and 2% cap.

First, exceptions to the 1% cap and 2% cap are discussed. The next section discusses a process called redistributing scores that states must use if they exceed the 1% cap or 2% cap.

Under certain circumstances, an LEA or a state may exceed the 1% cap, the 2% cap, or both caps (i.e., the 3% total cap). Again, these caps do not apply to individual schools.", "A state may grant an exception to the 1% cap for an LEA, provided that (1) the LEA documents that the incidence of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities exceeds 1% of all students in the grades assessed, (2) the LEA explains why the incidence exceeds 1% (e.g., special services within the LEA, or a small LEA in which even one student exceeds the 1% cap), and (3) the LEA ensures that all students with disabilities continue to participate in state assessments. The state must regularly review the appropriateness of this exception. The state may not grant an LEA an exception to the 2% cap unless the LEA is below the 1% cap, and the exception to the 2% cap may only be made in the amount that the LEA is below the 1% cap. In general, an LEA is not permitted to exceed a total of 3% of proficient and advanced scores from alternate assessments (AA-AAS plus AA-MAS) that may count as proficient or advanced for AYP purposes; however, if the LEA was granted an exception to the 1% cap, the LEA may exceed the 3% total cap by the amount of the 1% cap exception.", "A state may not request from the Secretary of Education (Secretary) an exception to the 1% cap or the 2% cap.

However, a state must count the proficient and advanced scores that exceeded the cap as \"non-proficient\" for the purposes of AYP. In other words, if too many students have achieved proficient or advanced scores on AA-AAS and AA-MAS, the scores in excess of the allowable amount are treated as non-proficient scores. States must adopt a process for allocating these non-proficient scores in the AYP accountability calculations. The process of counting proficient and advanced scores as non-proficient scores for AYP purposes is called redistributing scores.", "When the number of proficient and advanced scores exceeds the 1% cap or 2% cap, the state must redistribute these scores as non-proficient scores (hereinafter referred to as \"redistributed non-proficient scores\"). The state must count the redistributed non-proficient scores in each applicable AYP subgroup at the school, LEA, and state level. ED does not mandate a procedure in regulations for redistributing scores. ED's non-regulatory guidance, however, provides a reference that describes four methods a state may use to redistribute scores: (1) random assignment, (2) proportional, (3) strategic, and (4) predetermined school cap. These four methods of redistributing proficient and advanced scores are described below; however, they do not represent all possible methods.", "The random-assignment method selects proficient and advanced scores at random to become redistributed non-proficient scores. All proficient and advanced scores from alternate assessments would have an equal chance of being redistributed. This method is relatively easy to understand and communicate to educators, and it can be done using a computerized random-number generator. Over time, random assignment should be impartial and fair because each score has an equal chance of being selected. On the other hand, random assignment can seem unfair in the short term when the selection of scores is uneven in a particular year (i.e., even when random assignment is used, a school may be randomly assigned a much higher number of scores to redistribute than another school simply due to chance). In addition, this method may be difficult to implement in small LEAs due to the small number of scores resulting from alternate assessments.", "The proportional method requires a redistribution of proficient and advanced scores in proportion to the number of students in an LEA or school that participated in alternate assessments. LEAs or schools that tested a larger number of students using alternate assessments would be required to redistribute a larger number of proficient or advanced scores. This method may deter LEAs or schools from inappropriately testing a large number of students using alternate assessments. However, it may also unfairly penalize LEAs or schools that serve a disproportionate number of students with disabilities, and therefore, appropriately test a disproportionate number of students using alternate assessments.", "The strategic method redistributes proficient and advanced scores in a manner that will result in the maximum benefit for each school. Using this method, scores may be redistributed in a way that allows a school to have a better chance of meeting AYP. For example, scores from students who belong to the fewest number of subgroups may be redistributed because a non-proficient score may have less of a negative impact on AYP. Similarly, scores from students who belong to subgroups in no danger of missing AYP may be redistributed. This method may aid schools in meeting AYP, however, it is difficult to implement and may be perceived as unethical.", "The predetermined school-cap method redistributes proficient and advanced scores based on a school's historical percentage of students with disabilities. This method may work well for schools with a relatively stable population of students; however, minor fluctuations in student attendance may make the implementation of this method difficult. In addition, using a predetermined school cap could potentially perpetuate inappropriate historical identification of students with disabilities in some schools (i.e., if a school has historically identified students with disabilities inappropriately, and a predetermined school cap is based on historical numbers of students with disabilities, the school may be incentivized to continue to identify students inappropriately).", " Appendix B provides a table that briefly summarizes the pros and cons of four methods for redistributing proficient scores that exceed the 1% and 2% caps. At times, it may be possible or beneficial for a state to use these methods in combination. For example, a state may choose to redistribute scores using a random-assignment method, which determines the number of scores per school that must be redistributed. At the school level, however, a strategic method could be employed to maximize the possibility that the school meets AYP goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Example: Calculating the Cap, Exceeding the Cap, and Redistributing Scores", "paragraphs": ["The following example demonstrates how states and LEAs calculate the 1% cap and the process of redistributing proficient and advanced scores if the 1% cap is exceeded (without exception). The 2% cap is calculated and enforced in a similar way.", "The 1% cap is calculated based on the number of students enrolled in the grades assessed for AYP. The grades assessed for AYP include grades 3 through 8 and one grade in high school (for this example, grade 10). If an LEA has a total enrollment of 10,000 students in grades 3 through 8 plus grade 10, no more than 100 proficient scores based on AA-AAS may count as proficient for AYP purposes. If the LEA had 150 students participate in AA-AAS, two scenarios could develop. In the first scenario, only 100 of the 150 students may obtain a proficient score. All of these scores would count as proficient in the calculation of AYP and the 1% cap would not be exceeded. In the second scenario, all 150 students may obtain a proficient score. Only 100 of these scores may count as proficient scores in the calculation of AYP, and 50 of the proficient scores must be redistributed as non-proficient scores. If the LEA does not receive an exception from the state, the LEA must redistribute 50 scores as non-proficient and count these redistributed non-proficient scores in AYP calculations for each applicable subgroup in the state accountability system.", "In the second scenario, participation in AA-AAS resulted in 150 proficient scores, and 50 scores must be redistributed as non-proficient scores for AYP purposes.

Using a random-assignment method, the following outcome is possible: School A must redistribute 16 scores, School B must redistribute 20 scores, School C must redistribute 8 scores, and School D must redistribute 6 scores. Essentially, any random combination of 50 scores could be redistributed.", "The state may, instead, direct the LEA to redistribute scores using the proportional method. Using the proportional method, the number of redistributed scores depends on a proportion that reflects the number of scores that must be redistributed compared to the total number of scores.

All states required documented evidence that the student had a significant cognitive disability and received an extensively modified curriculum during instruction. States defined \"most significant cognitive disability\" using criteria that describe a student's intellectual and adaptive functioning. The most common criteria used to define \"most significant cognitive disability\" included (1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or cognitive ability (40 states), (2) deficits in adaptive behavior (35 states), (3) cognitive and adaptive deficits that adversely affect academic performance (19 states), and (4) cognitive and adaptive deficits that manifest before the age of 18 (23 states).", "Thirty-one states also required IEP teams to use exclusionary criteria to determine eligibility for AA-AAS.

There are types of validity and reliability evidence that are often relevant to alternate assessments, but the type of evidence needed to establish validity and reliability may need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Because alternate assessments take various forms, such as portfolios, checklists, teacher observations, and performance assessments, traditional evidence of validity and reliability may be inappropriate. The general state assessment is usually a standardized test that uses a combination of multiple-choice and constructed-response (e.g., short answer, essay) formats.

Under this proposal, the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-AAS may not exceed 1% of all students assessed, and the number of proficient and advanced scores based on AA-MAS may not exceed 1% of all students assessed. Decreasing the 2% cap would reduce the amount of flexibility that states currently have in assessing students with disabilities and in determining how scores are included in the accountability system. In general, decreasing the 1% and 2% caps may further discourage states and IEP teams from inappropriately identifying students with disabilities and recommending their participation in alternate assessments. In addition, decreasing the caps may send a strong signal to educators that students with disabilities should have access to the general education curriculum and be measured against challenging academic standards.", "Alternatively, Congress may choose to increase the caps, providing more flexibility to states in the assessment of students with disabilities. Increasing the 1% and 2% caps may protect schools and LEAs from failing to meet AYP due solely to the students with disabilities subgroup. It may also provide educators more flexibility in determining appropriate academic goals for students with disabilities, instead of being required to teach either extended or grade-level content standards of the state. Increasing the caps, however, may incentivize states and IEP teams to inappropriately identify students with disabilities and to recommend their participation in alternate assessments.

Organizations that advocate increasing the role of IEPs propose using these annual goals and methods for measuring student progress in assessment and accountability systems. There is some disagreement, however, over the appropriate amount of independence and flexibility that should be granted to states and IEP teams for the development of annual goals, measurement of academic achievement, and determination of AYP.", "At one end of the spectrum, states could be granted a considerable amount of flexibility to direct IEP teams to determine curricula, standards, and assessments for students with disabilities. Several organizations proposed allowing states to count students with disabilities as meeting AYP if they successfully completed their IEP goals. Other organizations proposed allowing states to independently determine the percentage of students with disabilities that should participate in alternate assessments or \"out-of-level\" assessments based on the student's IEP. In this scenario, states could use separate starting points for AYP projections based on each individual student's present level of achievement, as outlined in the IEP. These methods would provide states and IEP teams the flexibility necessary to develop truly individualized education plans for students with disabilities and allow the curriculum, standards, and assessments to be adapted to suit the needs of the student. On the other hand, the focus on meeting IEP goals for AYP may inadvertently lead to setting lower goals for students with disabilities, thereby lowering overall expectations of achievement for students with disabilities. Such an outcome would be inconsistent with the original intent of including students with disabilities in state assessment and accountability systems\u2014increasing access to the general education curriculum, and, in turn, increasing expectations and achievement of students with disabilities.", "At the other end of the spectrum, states may be granted some flexibility to direct IEP teams to choose specific curricula and assessments, however, the standards would be determined by the state. In this scenario, states could require the use of a \"standards-based IEP\" document, which would require IEP teams to write annual goals that are linked to the state's academic content standards. Traditionally, a student's IEP has been considered a highly individualized document that is not necessarily linked to the state's academic content standards. \"Traditional\" IEP goals tend to focus on developmental goals, such as \"school readiness\" and functional skills. As the emphasis on academic achievement of students with disabilities increased during the 1990s, the focus of many IEP goals shifted from \"traditional\" developmental goals to academic goals. ", "Including academic goals on IEPs allows IEP teams to link the goals for students with disabilities to the state academic content standards in a way that was not possible with developmental goals. A \"standards-based IEP,\" therefore, is a document in which students with disabilities have annual goals that are aligned with, or linked to, the state's grade-level academic content standards. If students were assessed against standards-based IEP goals, they would, in essence, be assessed against state academic content standards. Requiring standards-based IEPs would provide an academic focus and structure for states and IEP teams to use when determining appropriate goals for students with disabilities. It would also allow some flexibility in the curricula chosen to teach these standards and the assessments used to measure the attainment of the standards. On the other hand, standards-based IEPs may not allow IEP teams enough flexibility to truly individualize goals and instruction, especially for students with significant cognitive disabilities. IEP teams may want to preserve some of the more traditional developmental goals for students with significant cognitive disabilities, and IEP teams may find it difficult to extend the state content standards in a meaningful way for these students.", "In general, increasing the role of the IEP in assessment and accountability systems may reduce the redundancy in setting multiple sets of goals and objectives for students with disabilities. It may also simplify the reporting of the academic progress of students with disabilities by combining reporting requirements contained within IDEA and NCLB. Nevertheless, the variability in procedures used to set IEP goals and objectives may reduce their usefulness in accountability systems. IEP goals vary greatly in their rigor, level of challenge to the student, and relationship to the state content standards.

Similarly, other organizations have proposed the use of individual student growth models that follow the progress of the same students over time at all performance levels. Such models would reward schools for improving the achievement of all students with disabilities, even those performing substantially below the proficient level.", "In November 2005, the Secretary announced a growth model program in which states could use growth models to make AYP determinations. In 2009, 15 states participated in the growth model pilot program. Requirements for the growth models in the pilot program were relatively restrictive.

Establish high expectations for low-achieving students, while not setting expectations for annual achievement based upon student demographic characteristics or school characteristics; 3.

Under the requirements of this program, it was not necessarily the case that schools and LEAs would meet AYP by improving the achievement of students with disabilities, even if the improvement was substantial. For example, if the ultimate goal of 100% proficiency by 2013-2014 was maintained (criterion 1), in many cases students with disabilities would have to make unreasonably large gains in achievement each year to make AYP. Relatively significant gains in achievement may still result in failure to meet AYP goals for the school and LEA.", "In addition, some of the criteria above may be inconsistent with the use of alternate assessments in growth models, especially for students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" who participate in AA-AAS. For example, if the assessment system must \"be based on assessments in each of grades 3-8\" and \"produce comparable results from grade-to-grade and year-to-year\" (criterion 5), it is unclear how some AA-AAS fulfill this requirement. General state assessments would reflect a progression of skills and competencies from grades 3-8 that would represent what annual growth means for students without disabilities. Regulations outlining the development and use of AA-AAS, however, allow states to incorporate \"out of level\" testing for students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" and use alternate achievement standards for grade clusters (e.g., 3-5, 6-9, 10-12). It is unclear how an \"out of level\" AA-AAS for a three to five grade cluster produces \"comparable results from grade-to-grade and year-to-year.\" Using out of level tests and grade clusters make it more difficult to define what represents annual growth.

Currently, regulations allow a student who was previously identified as having a disability but no longer receives special education services to be counted in the \"students with disabilities\" AYP subgroup for an additional two years. Some proposals may favor including these students in the \"students with disabilities\" AYP subgroup for a longer period of time because it may increase the likelihood that the subgroup makes AYP. Allowing \"declassified\" students to count in the \"students with disabilities\" AYP subgroup could be viewed as giving more credit to a school's effort to educate students with disabilities successfully so that they no longer require special education services. This provision may incentivize schools to move students in and out of special education based on academic performance, without concern over losing a \"high-achieving special education student\" from the \"students with disabilities\" AYP subgroup.", "Another option may be to maintain the \"safe harbor\" provision of NCLB.
