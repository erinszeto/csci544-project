L.C. The court held that institutionalization of persons with mental disabilities in lieu of community-based care may constitute discrimination. Shortly after the Olmstead decision, on February 1, 2001, President George W. Bush announced the New Freedom Initiative, an effort through multiple federal agencies to ensure full participation in society of persons with disabilities. Part of the New Freedom Initiative was Executive Order 13217, which implemented the Olmstead decision by ensuring (among other things) that all people with disabilities, not just those with mental illness, benefit from community-based treatment.", "In order to ensure that persons with disabilities may live in community settings rather than in institutions, affordable and accessible housing is necessary. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) operates a number of programs that provide housing for persons with disabilities in various ways. The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program is authorized to provide capital grants and project rental assistance to nonprofit developers of housing targeted specifically to persons with disabilities. Prior to creation of Section 811, persons with disabilities lived together with elderly residents (defined by HUD as households with one or more adults age 62 or older) in developments funded through the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program.", "The project-based Section 8 and Public Housing programs give project owners the option of dedicating facilities to elderly residents, residents with disabilities, or both populations together. Over the years, both the Section 811 and the tenant-based Section 8 programs have set aside housing vouchers for persons with disabilities. And two HUD block grant programs\u2014HOME and the Community Development Block Grant\u2014may be used by states and communities to construct or rehabilitate housing for persons with disabilities. In addition to these HUD programs, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), administered by the Internal Revenue Service, may be used by states to target housing to special needs populations, including persons with disabilities. The LIHTC may be used in conjunction with HUD grants, including capital grants through the Section 811 program.", "Congress has not appropriated capital funds for new Section 811 units since FY2011. In FY2012 through FY2014, Congress made Section 811 rental assistance funds available to be used in conjunction with capital funding from other sources (such as LIHTCs and HOME funds) rather than Section 811 capital grants, which were not appropriated. This use of rental assistance was authorized as part of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act (P.L. 111-374), and is referred to by HUD as the Project Rental Assistance (PRA) Program. P.L. 111-374 instituted other changes to the Section 811 program: authorizing that the source of funding for Section 811 tenant-based rental assistance be converted to the Section 8 program; decreasing the concentration of housing units for persons with disabilities by limiting the units in multifamily housing dedicated to persons with disabilities to 25% of the total; and delegating the processing of mixed finance developments to state housing finance agencies."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Persons with physical disabilities, intellectual or developmental disabilities, or mental illnesses may face difficulty in finding suitable housing, together with supportive services (often referred to as person-directed or consumer-directed services), in which they can live as active members of their community. For individuals with physical disabilities, it may be difficult to find rental units that are accessible, and some prospective residents with disabilities may face discrimination in their search for housing. Zoning laws may also prevent the construction of homes where persons with disabilities live together. In addition, the affordability of housing and services may be an issue due to lower participation in the workforce and lower incomes. Individuals with disabilities have lower employment rates than those without disabilities, which may be the result of factors like employer attitudes and insufficient or improper job training. Insufficient income can put the costs of in-home care and supportive services out of reach, and state funding of home and community-based services through Medicaid varies by state. As a result of these limitations, among other causes, persons with disabilities may have difficulty finding housing, and may live in restricted settings such as nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, or board and care homes rather than living independently. Individuals with disabilities not in such facilities may still live in group homes or small multifamily housing developments dedicated to persons with disabilities instead of on their own in the community.", "However, national recognition of the need for appropriate housing for persons with disabilities gained support after the 1999 Supreme Court decision in the case of Olmstead v. L.C. In that case, two women who had spent years in a psychiatric hospital argued that their institutionalization constituted discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Supreme Court agreed, finding that \"[s]tates are required to provide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities when the State's treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated.\" Shortly after the ruling in Olmstead , on February 1, 2001, President Bush announced the \"New Freedom Initiative,\" an effort through multiple federal agencies, in cooperation with the states, to ensure full participation in society of persons with disabilities.

They may include changes to a rental unit such as widening doorways, installing a ramp or grab bars, or lowering cabinets. The HUD/DOJ guidance requires that there be an identifiable relationship between the tenant's disability and the modification; if there is not, a landlord may refuse to allow the alteration. Landlords are not required to pay for modifications, and, if the modifications would prevent a future tenant's enjoyment of the premises, the landlord may require tenants to restore the unit to its original state when moving out.

As with reasonable modifications, there must be a relationship between the disability and the requested accommodation. However, unlike reasonable modifications, a tenant may request an accommodation that will involve a cost to the housing provider, although the requested accommodation cannot pose an undue financial or administrative burden, and cannot fundamentally alter the provider's operations. If the requested accommodation is reasonable, tenants cannot be charged an extra fee or be required to make a deposit into an escrow account.

Section 202 did not initially provide housing for persons with disabilities. Five years after the creation of the Section 202 program, the Housing Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-560) added non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals and families to the definition of \"elderly families\" under the Section 202 program. At the time, \"handicapped\" was defined by P.L. 88-560 as a physical impairment (1) expected to be of long-continued or indefinite duration, (2) that substantially impedes the ability to live independently, and (3) is of such a nature that the ability to live independently could be improved by more suitable housing conditions. Mental, intellectual, or developmental disabilities were not included in the definition. The Housing Act of 1964 also changed the name of the Section 202 program to \"Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped.\" However, the law did not require that a certain number of units be set aside for tenants with disabilities or direct that units be made accessible. Very few tenants who were considered non-elderly handicapped participated in the Section 202 program between 1964 and 1974. Although data were not collected, HUD estimated that through 1977, less than 1% of Section 202 tenants were non-elderly handicapped, and that \"the vast majority of Section 202 projects [were] not designed to serve the handicapped.\"", "The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-383 ) removed the word \"physical\" from the term \"physical impairment\" in the definition of handicap and also expanded the definition of handicap to include developmental disabilities. The removal of the word \"physical\" was meant to make persons with mental illnesses eligible for Section 202 housing. However, the development of housing for this population did not occur immediately. In 1978, in the conference report accompanying the Housing and Community Development Amendments ( P.L. 95-557 ), Congress acknowledged that \"there has been some confusion over whether chronically mentally ill persons are eligible for section 202 housing,\" and that it was \"never the intent of Congress to exclude chronically mentally ill persons from participating in the section 202 program.\" The report went on to direct HUD to develop criteria and standards for providing housing for this population. In 1978, HUD undertook a demonstration program together with the Department of Health and Human Services (then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare), \"to better understand the housing needs of the mentally ill.\" In FY1982, the Section 202 program funded housing for chronically mentally ill individuals for the first time, making funds available for group homes and independent living facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 202 Set-Aside for Non-elderly Handicapped Households", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, the Housing and Community Development Amendments ( P.L. 95-557 ) required that, beginning in FY1979, at least $50 million of the amounts available for loans under the Section 202 program be devoted to housing for non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals. The new requirement was meant to \"meet special needs [of the handicapped] which have not been adequately addressed in Section 202 projects.\" Until enactment of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, a small number of accessible units in larger Section 202 developments designed primarily for elderly residents had been dedicated to persons with disabilities (about 1% of units). These Section 202 developments tended to be large multifamily rental buildings\u2014the average number of units in Section 202 developments built prior to enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 was 135. HUD suggested that one of the reasons for the low number of units designed for persons with disabilities through the Section 202 program was the additional cost of making units accessible, putting project sponsors at a disadvantage in applying for funds. The set-aside was meant to address this issue.", "In addition, P.L. 95-557 specified that non-profit sponsors of Section 202 housing were expected to develop innovative ways of providing housing for persons with disabilities, including group homes and independent living complexes integrated into the surrounding community, together with supportive services tailored to resident needs. After enactment of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 with its set-aside for housing for persons with disabilities, the number of developments built specifically for these households (versus elderly households) increased. HUD estimates that by the end of the 1980s, approximately 10% of units funded through the Section 202 program were in facilities designed for persons with disabilities.", "Nearly 10 years after enactment of the Housing and Community Development Amendments, another law made changes to the way in which persons with disabilities were served under the Section 202 program. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-242 ) amended the law to require that 15% of the total amount available for Section 202 loans be set aside for persons with disabilities rather than the $50 million established in the 1978 Act ( P.L. 95-557 ). In appropriations acts from FY1988 through FY1991, Congress went beyond the statutory set-aside, however, and required that 25% of Section 202 loan authority be used for housing for persons with disabilities.", "Another change made by P.L. 100-242 involved rental subsidies for those Section 202 units for persons with disabilities. Since the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Section 202 units for both elderly and disabled residents had been subsidized through the project-based Section 8 rental assistance program. However, there was a growing acknowledgment that Section 8 rental assistance was not sufficient to support units for persons with disabilities because it did not take account of the higher cost of providing housing in smaller developments such as group homes. P.L. 100-242 specified that rental assistance in projects for persons with disabilities should be provided through a separate subsidy program based on the \"total actual and necessary reasonable costs of developing and operating the project,\" not including, however, the costs of supportive services. The FY1989 HUD Appropriations Act ( P.L. 100-404 ) provided rental assistance funds for housing for persons with disabilities separately from those for elderly residents.

As long as units remain affordable to very low-income residents for at least 40 years, project owners need not repay the capital grants. The law also created a new form of rental assistance similar to Section 8, called PRAC, or project rental assistance contracts. In addition, the law instituted a new way of determining development cost limitations for both Section 202 and Section 811 facilities. The new method was to take account of special design features for persons with disabilities and congregate space for supportive services, among other factors.", "The provisions creating the Section 811 program originated in the Senate version of the bill ( S. 566 ) that would become the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. The Senate Banking Committee, in its report accompanying the bill, described the reasons behind creating a program separate from Section 202:", "The Committee believes that separation of the programs for elderly and persons with disabilities would further the goal of developing a program that meets the housing and related needs of nonelderly persons with disabilities. A separate program would spur the development of a bureaucracy knowledgeable about and sensitive to the special needs of tenants with disabilities, needs which can differ from those of many elderly residents.... A separate program would also create an institutional voice for housing concerns that are particular to this constituency.", "The report also stressed the importance of changing the terminology used to refer to persons served through the Section 811 program, replacing \"handicapped persons\" with \"persons with disabilities.\" Community integration was another important goal of the new Section 811 program. In the years leading up to the enactment of P.L. 101-625 , group homes and other facilities dedicated only to persons with disabilities had been the focus of housing funded through the Section 202 set aside. Under the Section 811 program, however, the HUD Secretary was to look to a variety of housing options, including scattered units in multifamily housing developments, condominiums, and cooperative housing.", "Cranston-Gonzalez authorized capital grants for the new Section 811 program at $271 million for FY1992 and project rental assistance at $246 million.

Until the law's enactment, Section 811 PRAC was used only in conjunction with units developed with Section 811 capital grants. However, P.L. 111-374 provided that Section 811 rental assistance can be used to assist multifamily housing units developed using other, non-Section 811 sources of funding such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), HOME funds, or other public or private sources. HUD has referred to this funding as the \"Project Rental Assistance Demonstration.\" ", "To the extent that Congress may still appropriate new capital grants for Section 811, P.L. 111-374 also limited the number of units in multifamily housing developed with Section 811 funds that can be occupied by persons with disabilities to 25% of the total units in the building. Due to the need to finance the remaining 75% of units, this limitation is meant to encourage developers to use other funding sources, such as LIHTCs and HOME funds, to supplement the Section 811 funding. This 25% limitation does not apply to group homes or independent living facilities. In addition, in cases where grantees combine Section 811 capital grants with funding from other sources, the review and processing of the project will be delegated to state or local housing finance agencies (HFAs) rather than HUD. Because HFAs are the agencies that administer tax credits, delegating the processing of the Section 811 capital grant to the HFA, together with the tax credit, is thought to be more efficient. ", "Both of the changes implemented by the Melville Act could mark a move away from developments dedicated to persons with disabilities and toward units interspersed throughout larger developments. In addition, one of the justifications for the Melville Act changes is that Section 811 funding can go further (assuming similar appropriations levels) if the funds are not needed to pay capital costs.

First, a formula is used to allocate available funds to 18 multifamily hubs based on the number of non-institutionalized persons within the jurisdiction of the local office who are between 16 and 64 years of age and have a disability. HUD then awards Section 811 grants through a competitive process in which nonprofit organizations submit applications, and awards are limited by the amount allocated to the hub.

The CDBG program distributes 70% of total funds through formula grants to entitlement communities\u2014central cities of metropolitan areas, cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and urban counties\u2014and the remaining 30% goes to states for use in small, non-entitlement communities. The allocation of CDBG funds is determined through a formula that targets an area's need for community development using a variety of factors including population, poverty, overcrowded housing, age of housing, and the lag in community growth. The CDBG program is subject to the same Consolidated Plan requirements as the HOME program (described previously) in which the needs of persons with disabilities must be taken into consideration. In addition, in response to the Bush Administration's New Freedom Initiative, HUD issued guidance to assist CDBG recipients with \"identifying the needs of persons with disabilities and targeting CDBG resources to meet those needs during the development of the jurisdictions' consolidated plans.\"", "While many of the purposes of CDBG funds involve the improvement of neighborhoods, the creation of public facilities, or the promotion of economic opportunity, funds may also be used to rehabilitate housing, including making housing accessible for persons with disabilities. CDBG funds may also be used to make public facilities accessible to persons with disabilities. In addition, communities may use CDBG funds for \"public services,\" which include such services as employment counseling.

Changes occurred in both the voucher portion of the Section 811 program as well as with capital grants funding for new projects. Regarding Section 811 vouchers, the Melville Act authorized that funds to renew Section 811 vouchers could be provided through the tenant-based Section 8 rental assistance account. In FY2011, renewals were split between the Section 811 and Section 8 accounts, and starting in FY2012, all voucher renewal funding was provided through the Section 8 account. See Table 1 .", "A second change authorized through P.L. 111-374 was funding for Section 811 rental assistance only (i.e., not provided in conjunction with Section 811 capital grants), called the Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program. In FY2012, for the first time since the creation of Section 811, Congress provided no new funding for Section 811 capital grants. Instead, funds were available to renew existing rental assistance contracts and for PRA program rental assistance to be applied to units of housing developed with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, funds through the HOME program, or other funding sources. For more information, see the section \" Project Rental Assistance (PRA) Program .\"", "See Table 1 for Section 811 funding levels, including vouchers, through FY2016 and proposed FY2017 funding. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Section 811 Capital Grants with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits", "paragraphs": ["Financing affordable housing, including housing for persons with disabilities, may require multiple streams of funding in order to support the design, construction, and ongoing operating costs of a project. In addition to federal funds provided through HUD programs, affordable housing developers may use mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits, and local housing trust fund resources, among other sources, to develop housing for low-income and special needs populations. While HUD funds once might have been sufficient on their own to develop an affordable housing project, that is rarely the case today. This is true for Section 811 developers, who often must bring together multiple sources of funding to develop a project. In 2000, in order to help Section 811 developers bring together multiple financing sources, Congress enacted a law that makes the interaction of Section 811 funds and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) more feasible by changing the definition of \"private nonprofit organization\" in the Section 811 statute. This change, and its implication for Section 811 developers, is described below.", "The value of LIHTCs is determined, in part, based on the cost of developing a property\u2014referred to as the qualified basis. The costs of constructing, acquiring, and rehabilitating a property (among other costs) are included in calculating the qualified basis, but the amount must then be reduced by any federal grants received by the developer, which in turn reduces the value of the tax credits. Therefore, if a nonprofit developer were to receive a Section 811 capital grant, its value would be subtracted in calculating the qualified basis which could result in minimal LIHTCs. The Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act ( P.L. 106-569 ), enacted in 2000, allowed for-profit limited partnerships, where a nonprofit organization is the sole general partner, to be eligible Section 811 owners. The changed law allows a nonprofit Section 811 grantee to loan the Section 811 capital grant to the limited partnership. Under this arrangement, the Section 811 funds are no longer a \"federal grant\" to be subtracted in calculating the qualified basis, potentially increasing the value of LIHTCs.", "The change in the law to allow for-profit limited partnerships to own Section 811 housing developments did not immediately make mixed financing arrangements common, however. The transactions are complicated and may require extensive expertise in housing finance to make them work. HUD acknowledges that \"most developers seek to avoid the use of federal grant financing in most LIHTC projects.\" In addition, the treatment of Section 811 PRAC in tax credit transactions has been unclear. Although the IRS has created exceptions to the rule that federal grants do not count toward the qualified basis of a property for certain categories of rental assistance, Section 811 PRAC has not been among the exceptions. The programs that have been exempted from the requirement include project-based Section 8 rental assistance payments and public housing capital and operating funds, the Native American Housing Block Grant Program, Rent Supplement and Rental Assistance Payments programs, the Shelter Plus Care and Single Room Occupancy programs, and the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program. Despite language in the Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 indicating that Congress intended Section 811 assistance to be included in calculating qualified basis (rather than subtracted from it), the IRS has not issued a ruling that would be necessary to make this possible.", "Another possible limitation in developing mixed finance projects using federal grants such as Section 811 together with the LIHTC was removed with passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ). Under LIHTC law, developers may qualify for tax credits worth roughly 9% or 4%. Under previous LIHTC law, the higher 9% credit was available for new construction that was not federally subsidized, while the 4% credit was available for either federally subsidized new construction or existing buildings. The statutory definition of \"federally subsidized\" included below market federal loans (the structure used by limited partnerships to loan Section 811 capital grants). The fact that developers of federally subsidized buildings did not qualify for the higher tax credit made financing projects with the LIHTC less lucrative. Developers either had to accept the lower, 4% credit, or to set up a system through which federal grants were loaned to the project at a market rate of interest.", "However, P.L. 110-289 removed the phrase \"below market federal loans\" from the definition of federal subsidy in the LIHTC statute. This makes all federally subsidized new construction placed in service after the effective date of P.L. 110-289 eligible for 9% tax credits. The 9% credits are very competitive, however, and it may still be difficult for Section 811 developers to obtain\u00a0them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Need for Persons with Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["According to both advocates for persons with disabilities and HUD, persons with disabilities have a need for affordable housing. Since 1991, HUD has regularly released reports on the worst case needs for affordable housing in the United States. HUD defines households with worst case housing needs as very low-income renter households (households with incomes at or below 50% of area median income) that do not receive rental assistance and either (1) pay more than half their income toward rent, or (2) live in severely inadequate housing. Severely inadequate housing is measured using the American Housing Survey definition of housing with severe physical problems. These are varying degrees of problems with plumbing, heating, electrical wiring, and upkeep of the physical unit or public areas. Using data from the 2013 American Housing Survey, HUD found in its most recent report\u2014 Worst Case Housing Needs 20 15 \u2014that 18.50 million renter households were very low income. Of those, 7.72 million households had worst case housing needs, a decrease of 9% compared to 2011 but an increase compared to years prior to 2011. ", "To determine disability status, the American Housing Survey asks questions about functional limitations (hearing, visual, cognitive, and ambulatory) and ability to perform activities of daily living (self care and independent living. Using the AHS data, HUD estimated that 2.8 million very low-income rental households (15% of all households) had a non-elderly member who answered yes to at least one of the questions regarding disability in 2013. Further, 39% of very low-income renter households that included a nonelderly person with a disability (about 1.09 million) had worst-case housing needs.

Explanations for the growth in homelessness include the demolition of skid rows, the decreased availability of affordable housing generally, the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor, the reduced likelihood that relatives will accommodate homeless family members, the decreased value of public benefits, and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals.", "In the early 2000s, attention was again turned to homeless individuals, this time to those persons who experience so-called \"chronic homelessness,\" when President Bush announced an initiative to end chronic homelessness within 10 years. In the late 1990s, researchers identified chronically homeless individuals as those who have a disability (including those who suffer from mental illness and/or substance use disorders) and who have been homeless for long periods of time. Later, HUD defined what it means to be chronically homeless in regulation, and the definition was adapted and incorporated into statute in 2009 as part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act ( P.L. 111-22 ). The definition was again refined by regulation in 2015. ", "According to the definition, a person is chronically homeless if they have a disability and have been living in a place not meant for human habitation, an emergency shelter, or safe haven continuously homeless for 12 months or have experienced four episodes of homelessness totaling 12 months in the past three years. A family is chronically homeless if the adult head of household (or minor in the absence of an adult) has a disability.", "In 2015, HUD estimated that approximately 15% of the total homeless population were chronically homeless individuals and 2.3% were in chronically homeless families. Rates of mental health problems are estimated to exist in more than 60% of chronically homeless individuals, and more than 80% of individuals are estimated to have alcohol or drug problems. Medical problems, including HIV/AIDS, are also prevalent among chronically homeless individuals.", "Communities across the country have addressed chronic homelessness through a strategy called \"housing first,\" in which permanent supportive housing is found for homeless individuals prior to treatment of their illnesses and addictions. HUD makes funds available through its Homeless Assistance Grants for the construction or rehabilitation of new permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. HUD estimates that 108,000 beds in permanent supportive housing units have been funded since 2001, many devoted to individuals who had been chronically homeless. Perhaps in part for that reason, HUD estimates that the number of individuals considered chronically homeless has fallen by more than 30% between 2007 and 2015."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
