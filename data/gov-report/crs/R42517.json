This is about $4 billion less than was provided in FY2012. However, in terms of new appropriations for HUD's programs and activities, the President's budget actually requested an increase of more than $512 million compared to FY2012. The difference\u2014a decrease in net budget authority versus an increase in new appropriations\u2014is attributable to an estimated increase in the amount of excess receipts available from the FHA insurance fund, which are used to offset the cost of the HUD budget. The President's budget requested increases in funding for public housing and homelessness assistance grants. The President's budget requested decreases in funding for the project-based Section 8 rental assistance program and several community development-related programs.", "S. 2322, the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies FY2013 appropriations bill reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations in the 112th Congress, included about $35 billion in net new budget authority for HUD. That is about $1 billion more than the President's request and more than $2 billion less than was provided in FY2012. In terms of new appropriations for HUD's programs and activities (not accounting for offsets), S. 2322 proposed about $1 billion more than the President's request and $2 billion more than FY2012. The largest increase was provided for the project-based Section 8 rental assistance account.", "The House Appropriations Committee, in the 112th Congress, passed its version of the FY2013 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill on June 19, 2012 (H.R. 5972).

The bill included increased funding for the Community Development Block Grant program, but no new funding for the HOPE VI/Choice Neighborhoods program. H.R. 5972 was considered by the House the week of June 25, 2012, and was approved, as amended, on June 29, 2012. An amendment added during floor consideration would have prohibited the transfer and use of other department funds to carry out the activities of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) grant program.

Borrowers of FHA-insured loans pay both upfront and monthly fees, or premiums, for the insurance.

For the MMIF, the cash inflows are mainly the insurance premiums paid by borrowers, and the cash outflows are mainly the payments to lenders for the cost of loan defaults. The net value of these cash flows is expressed as a percentage of the volume of loans expected to be insured in that year and is referred to as the subsidy rate. If the cash inflows exceed the cash outflows, the subsidy rate is expressed as a negative number because net income from business type activities is shown in the budget as negative outlays. If the cash outflows exceed the cash inflows, the subsidy rate is expressed as a positive number. ", "When the subsidy rate is applied to the expected loan volume in a given year, the result is the amount of credit subsidy that a federal credit program is expected to need over the life of the loans. If a program has a positive subsidy rate, that program requires an appropriation of credit subsidy in the budget year that the loans are originated. If the program has a negative subsidy rate, then the program is expected to take in more money than it pays out, generating offsetting receipts. However, actual cash flows over the life of the loans are likely to differ from those projected in the first year. Therefore, agencies are required to periodically revise the initial subsidy estimates to include updated assumptions.", "For FY2013, HUD estimated that the MMIF Purchase and Refinance category (excluding HECMs) would have a credit subsidy rate of -5.38% and that about $149 billion of purchase and refinance loans would be insured, resulting in $8 billion in negative credit subsidy. HUD further estimated that the HECM category would have a subsidy rate of -0.92% and that FHA would insure about $18 billion of HECMs, resulting in negative credit subsidy of $172 million. Together, then, HUD estimated that mortgages insured under the MMIF in FY2013 would generate $8.2 billion in negative credit subsidy for the government. HUD also estimated that its other insurance fund, the GI/SRI fund, would generate $661 million in negative credit subsidy; combined with the negative credit subsidy from the MMIF, this would lead to a total of nearly $9 billion in negative credit subsidy generated by FHA that could be used as offsetting receipts.", "Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) re-estimates these numbers as part of its re-estimate of the President's budget. Depending on the assumptions it uses, CBO's numbers might be different from those in the President's budget. CBO's numbers are the ones that are used by Congress for the purpose of determining budget authority (and presented in this report, including Table 2 ).

", "The FY2013 budget showed that, for the first time, HUD anticipated that the MMIF would need to draw on this permanent and indefinite budget authority for $688 million sometime during FY2012. This money would be needed to make a required transfer of funds from the MMIF's secondary reserve account to its primary reserve account, in order to account for an increase in the estimated losses expected to occur over the life of the loans currently insured by FHA. It would not be needed immediately to cover actual claims on defaulted FHA-insured loans. FHA had about $33 billion in reserves that it could use to pay claims, and those funds would be exhausted before any additional funds from Treasury would be spent. ", "After the FY2013 President's budget was released, HUD stated that it no longer expected to need to draw on Treasury for these funds during FY2012. Increases in mortgage insurance premiums, along with funds from recent legal settlements, brought in enough money to the MMIF to cover the required transfer of funds. However, although FHA did not need to draw funds from Treasury to cover projected losses in the MMIF in FY2012, FHA did end up using its permanent and indefinite budget authority to draw $1.7 billion from Treasury at the end of FY2013 in order to make its required transfer of funds between reserve accounts in that year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mortgage Insurance Premium Increases", "paragraphs": ["In the FY2013 budget justifications, FHA indicated that it would make further increases to the insurance premiums that it charges for FHA insurance.

No new contracts have been entered into under this program since the early 1980s. When the program was active, Congress funded the contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, so the monthly payments for owners came from old appropriations. However, once those contracts expire, they require new annual appropriations if they are renewed. As more contracts expire, and assuming the owners choose to renew, more new appropriations are needed to maintain the subsidies. Further, some old contracts do not have sufficient funding to finish their existing terms, so new funding is needed to complete the contract (referred to as amendment funding).

However, the size of the increase in funding requested for the operating fund is somewhat misleading in terms of how much will be available to the program. In FY2012, Congress directed HUD to supplement the appropriations provided for the operating fund by requiring PHAs to use their reserve funds. HUD's budget documents note that no such offset will be available in FY2013, thus more funding will be required to ensure the same amount of funding is available to the program. The President's budget request included a proposal for new administrative flexibilities for PHAs administering public housing. Specifically, the budget requested the authority to permit PHAs to have full fungibility between their capital and operating funds and to test new rent policies to promote increased income among public housing tenants.
