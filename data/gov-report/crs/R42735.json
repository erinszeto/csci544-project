At its most basic, a MLR measures the share of health care premium dollars spent on medical benefits, as opposed to company expenses such as overhead or profits. For example, if an insurer collects $100,000 in premiums and spends $85,000 on medical care, the MLR is 85%. In general, the higher the MLR, the more value a policyholder receives for his or her premium dollar. The ACA requires an annual, minimum 80% MLR for individual and small group insurance plans, and an annual, minimum 85% MLR for large group plans. Congress imposed the MLR to provide \"greater transparency and accountability around the expenditures made by health insurers and to help bring down the cost of health care.\"", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued rules to implement the MLR with input from state insurance commissioners, who are the main regulators of health insurance. The ACA statute and regulations allow companies to include both quality improvements and medical services when calculating total MLR medical spending. Insurers may subtract (i.e., disregard) state and local taxes and some licensing fees from total MLR expenses. The federal ACA requirements differ from many state MLR laws, which generally compare medical claims to premiums. The ACA MLR is now the national minimum standard that must be met by covered health insurers.", "The ACA MLR is based on an insurer's annual aggregate performance, not on each individual's policy history. A consumer who paid health insurance premiums but did not file any medical claims during a plan year would not qualify for a rebate if his or her insurer met minimum MLR requirements. In addition, many Americans are enrolled in health plans that are not covered by the ACA MLR. The MLR provisions apply to fully funded health plans, which are plans where insurance companies assume full risk for incurred medical expenses. The MLR does not extend to self-funded plans, which are health care plans offered by businesses where the employer assumes the risk for, and pays for, medical care. Medicare plans were not subject to the MLR during the first two years the ACA was in effect. These insurers began complying with MLR provisions beginning in calendar 2014. The HHS granted three-year MLR waivers to select states where it determined that MLR implementation could harm the individual insurance market. Congress included language in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 (H.R. 83, P.L. 113-235) exempting expatriate insurance plans from MLR reporting requirements.", "For the 2013 plan year, insurers owed $332 million in MLR rebate payments to 6.8 million consumers. That is significantly less than the $1.1 billion in rebates to 12.8 million individuals in 2011, the first year the MLR was in effect. Insurers and employers may provide the rebates via a check, an electronic deposit in a bank account, a reduction in insurance premiums, or by spending the funds for the benefit of employees. Lawmakers have raised some concerns about the MLR provisions, including the fact that insurers are not allowed to deduct insurance agent and broker bonuses and commissions from their MLR expenses."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance provides protection against the financial risks associated with illness or injury. Consumers who enroll in health insurance plans pay premiums for a specified set of benefits.

In broad terms, a medical loss ratio (MLR) measures the share of enrollee premiums that health insurance companies spend on medical claims, as opposed to other non-claims expenses such as administration or profits. Many states, as the primary regulators of health insurance, have their own MLR requirements, which they use to evaluate companies and compare health plans. (See Appendix B for data on state MLRs.) Private entities, such as stock and bond analysts and lenders, also use various MLR data when assessing the financial performance of health insurers. ", "In general, the higher the MLR, the more value a consumer receives for each dollar of paid premium. For example, an 85% MLR means that 85% of premium dollars paid into a plan are paid out in the form of benefits. A 75% MLR means that just 75% of premium dollars are used for benefits. The MLR is an aggregate measure. Because the ratio is based on a health plan's overall performance, some enrollees may pay more in premiums during the course of a year than they receive in benefits, while others may receive benefits that far exceed their premium payments.

Beginning with calendar year 2011, covered insurers have been required to submit reports to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) detailing the share of premium dollars spent for medical benefits (which may include certain quality improvements), and the share allocated to administrative expenses and profits (minus certain taxes, fees, and other expenses). The MLR requirement is intended to provide \"greater transparency and accountability around the expenditures made by health insurers and to help bring down the cost of health care.\"", "Insurance companies must issue rebates to policyholders each year that they do not meet ACA MLR standards for individual, small group, and large group policies.

Expatriate plans are group policies that can cover employees working outside their home country or non-U.S. citizens working for American firms in their home country. Mini-medical plans subject to the additional adjustments have total annual benefit limits of $250,000 or less. Because of the unique characteristics of these plans, HHS determined that insurers would have difficulty meeting minimum MLR requirements. (See Appendix C .)

In December 2010, HHS published interim final regulations to implement the MLR provisions, based largely on a model regulation drafted by the NAIC. Since then, HHS has issued corrections and amplifications to the rule, including a final regulation on May 16, 2012.

The text box below shows the specific definition of medical claims as adopted by HHS per the NAIC recommendation.", "Medical claims are adjusted by three different reserve measures: (1) unpaid claims reserves, (2) contract reserves, and (3) claims-related reserves for contingent benefits and lawsuits. Unpaid claims reserves are premium funds that are set aside by insurers to cover claims that were incurred during a reporting period, but had not been paid by the date on which the required report was prepared. Similarly, contract reserves are established to account for the value of future benefit payments. As a policy matures, the reserves set aside at the introduction of the policy are used to cover claims that are submitted in the future. For example, an issuer may establish contract reserves to reduce the need to increase premiums for a newly introduced product as the policy matures and more claims are incurred. ", "The third reserve adjustment includes the claims-related portion of reserves for contingent benefits and lawsuits. These funds are set aside for a future event which may be beyond the control of the insurance company, such as deferred maternity benefits or potential outcome of a lawsuit. ", "There was concern from consumer groups when HHS regulations were initially promulgated that reserves could be manipulated and, in particular, overstated, which would lead to a reported MLR for a given year that was higher than the true MLR for that year.

The rationale for the credibility adjustments is that smaller plans may have more variability in annual claims, making it harder for them to plan for the MLR. ", " Table 1 specifies the credibility adjustments based on life years that insurers are permitted to use to adjust their MLR upward. For example, an insurer with an MLR of 79% would be below the MLR standard of 80% for a small group.

HDHPs tend to have a more variable (and uncertain) claims experience than other plans. Specifically, in high deductible health plans a smaller share of policyholders may end up filing medical claims during a year, but the claims that are filed are generally higher than is the case in lower-deductible insurance plans. ", "To address this variability there is a deductible adjustment to the MLR calculation, which is based on the average deductible of all policies for which experience is included in the reported MLR (see Table 2 ). This potentially increases the credibility adjustments by a multiplier of 1.0 to 1.736. This deductible factor is multiplied by the base credibility adjustment factors in Table 1 above.

This unadjusted MLR would not meet the minimum standard of 80%. In this case the insurer is allowed to apply two adjustments. According to CMS, because it has only 50,000 life years, it can use the base credibility factor of a 1.2% adjustment. Next, because it has an average deductible of $5,000, it can use the deductible factor of 1.402 as shown in Table 2 . The final MLR would be calculated by multiplying the base credibility factor of 1.2 by the deductible factor of 1.402.

Because commissions are a pass-through, rather than a part of an insurance company revenue stream, they should not be counted as an expense, according to the NAHU. Consumer organizations argued that Congress intended for the commissions to be counted as an administrative cost in the MLR calculation, and not to be excluded from the MLR like taxes and other fees.", "The NAIC in its recommendations to HHS ultimately concluded that the ACA does not provide a clear path for waiving inclusion of commissions in the calculation of the MLR, but encouraged \"HHS to recognize the essential role served by producers (i.e., agents and brokers) and accommodate producer compensation arrangements in any MLR regulations promulgated.\" The HHS, in its final regulations, noted that the ACA allowed state regulators to seek MLR waivers if they were concerned that their state's individual insurance market could be destabilized by implementation of the ACA, which would include any potentially adverse effects from the calculation of brokers' and agents' commissions.

A number of states also set separate MLR standards for other insurance products. When the ACA was passed in 2010, 34 states had established some type of MLR guidelines; required the filing or reporting of MLR information; set limits on administrative expenses for comprehensive major medical insurance; or enacted a combination of such policies. Of the total, six states required insurers that did not meet MLR standards to provide premium refunds or credits. (See Table B-1 .)", "States developed a range of MLR targets. For example, state MLR requirements for insurers selling products in the individual market ranged from 55% to 80%. MLRs in the group market ranged from 60% to 85%.

States were allowed to apply for limited waivers of the federal MLR standards for their individual insurance markets, however, if they had evidence that the ACA requirements could disrupt the state market for such policies.", "Since the ACA was enacted, several states have passed additional MLR laws including some that require insurers participating in Medicaid to meet specific MLRs or to publish their premium and profit information.

According to a 2011 GAO analysis, the combined effect of the federal allowances has been to raise federal MLRs above MLRs that are based only on medical claims compared to premium revenue. Analyzing 2010 data, the GAO said that average MLRs calculated under the ACA formula were 7.5 percentage points higher than traditional MLRs in the individual market, 6.5 points higher in the small group market, and 4.8 points higher in the large group market.", "Appendix C.

While there is substantial variability in the marketplace, mini-med plans generally have higher copayments and deductibles and provide a lower dollar-value level of benefits than comprehensive health plans. In some cases, the plans impose limits on specific types of services such as hospitalization and physician care. ", "In its December 2011 final rules, HHS noted concerns from mini-medical insurers about their ability to meet the ACA MLR. Companies issuing the policies noted that mini-medical plans were apt to have higher administrative costs, relative to benefits paid, than comprehensive health insurance; higher enrollee turnover; shorter enrollment periods; and lower incurred claims (due to higher deductibles and limited coverage). Consumer, healthcare, and labor organizations opposed efforts to relax MLR requirements for mini-medical plans. Consumer groups have said that such policies expose beneficiaries to unacceptably high costs and that insurers should be required to become more efficient. ", "In its interim final rule, HHS included a special allowance for mini-med plans (which it defines as plans with total annual benefit limits of $250,000 or less). For calendar 2011, HHS allowed insurers offering such policies to multiply incurred claims and activities (the MLR numerator) that improve health care quality by 2.00.

According to the data, 7 of the 12 issuers in the individual market and 6 of the 15 firms in the large group market would not meet the standard MLR targets.
