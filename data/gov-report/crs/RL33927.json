The first three of these are prescribed in statute and may provide federal funds to eligible individuals to pay certain health care costs. The MMTP is not explicitly authorized, but has received discretionary appropriations to pay for health care services for eligible individuals. Some Members of Congress have sought to establish explicit authority for the MMTP."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In many instances, people who suffer physical or psychological injury, disease or death due to the actions of others may gain compensation through civil actions in the courts. In addition, Congress has established a number of programs to compensate or assist victims of certain specific circumstances, including negligence, terrorism, and \"acts of God.\" The programs fall, broadly, into three categories: (1) those that primarily limit compensation or assistance to specified groups of people , with little or no limitation on the types of injury that may be compensated (e.g., workers' compensation systems); (2) those that primarily limit compensation or assistance for specified types of injuries , with little or no limitation of the classes of individuals who may be compensated (e.g., the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program); and (3) hybrid programs, which limit both the classes of eligible individuals, and the compensable injuries or diseases (e.g., the Black Lung Program).", "These compensation programs display considerable diversity in program design and implementation. In the context of considering compensation for asbestos exposure, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed four federal programs designed to compensate individuals injured by exposure to harmful substances. GAO found that design of the programs, the agencies that administer them, their financing mechanisms, benefits paid, and eligibility criteria, including their standards of proof (the evidence claimants must provide to support their claims), differed significantly.", "To assure responsible stewardship of available funds, a variety of approaches are used to determine whether conditions stated in claims are actually related to the relevant employment or incident, and should, therefore, be compensated. This matter is more easily resolved in the case of acute injuries, such as a broken leg sustained from a fall, than it is for illnesses that emerge some time following an exposure (often termed a latent period ). Some programs, such as those for workers' compensation, evaluate claims administratively on a case-by-case basis, offering claimants the opportunity to appeal denied claims. Other programs, particularly those dealing with ionizing radiation or other hazardous exposures that may cause a number of different health conditions, develop lists (often called tables) of compensable conditions. It is presumed that when an eligible individual develops a listed condition, the condition is related to the exposure, and compensation is provided. This is called a disease presumption.", "Vaccine injury compensation programs incorporate both an injury table and a time window following vaccination. Listed conditions that arise within the time window are presumed to be causally related to vaccination, and are compensated. Time limitations may not be applicable in many other circumstances, either because exposures did not occur at discrete or known times, or because some conditions (e.g., some cancers) may arise decades after exposure, but still be causally related to an exposure. When a program does not stipulate time limitations, there is nonetheless often the requirement that a claimant provide evidence that the onset of the condition did not precede the relevant exposure or incident.", "Burdens to demonstrate or refute the eligibility of individuals, or causality for health conditions, vary among programs. Disease presumptions help shift the burden of proof from the claimant to the program administrator, in what is an intrinsically adversarial system. Disease presumptions ideally flow from scientific evidence showing a causal relationship between an exposure and a subsequent disease. But there is no bright line in medical science beyond which a causal relationship has been demonstrated, and a presumption should be provided. Further, it is not generally possible to know, for a specific individual, whether a condition is causally related to the exposure of interest, or arose for some other reason. Rather, when evidence suggests that exposed populations face an increased risk of developing certain conditions, the presumption of causality may be extended to all individuals in that population, in accordance with the compassionate intent that underpins many of these programs.", "This report describes a number of federal programs that Congress established to compensate or assist individuals who have suffered physical or psychological harm as a consequence of specific events (including the actions of others), or who have suffered specific types of physical or psychological harm.

Others restrict, up front, the types of providers that may be reimbursed, in an effort to improve the quality of services provided, among other factors. Restricting provider eligibility can improve the quality of care by ensuring that providers have experience in treating rare conditions. For example, Congress required, in the Black Lung Program, the establishment of a network of black lung clinics, to provide specialized care in areas where miners typically live. (This program is discussed further in a subsequent section of this report.) Some state workers' compensation programs also establish specialized provider networks, staffed by occupational medicine physicians and other specialists. A recent study found that use of a specialized provider network by the Louisiana workers' compensation system reduced lost work time, and was less costly, compared with traditional case management.", "Provider restrictions may also improve program accountability, when eligible providers are trained, for the purposes of the program, to accurately identify eligible disease conditions, and exclude other conditions from coverage. Specialized provider networks can serve as centers for clinical research, and sources of outreach and training to general practitioners, who may see these conditions very rarely.
