The Supreme Court held in 2007 that the Clean Air Act (CAA) authorizes the agency to address GHG emissions. The key to using this CAA authority was for the EPA Administrator to find that GHG emissions endanger public health or welfare, a step taken in December 2009.", "Under the Trump Administration, it is unclear whether this authority will be put to further use. Other questions concern what steps EPA and Congress may take with regard to already promulgated\u2014but not yet implemented\u2014standards for GHG emissions from cars and trucks. In principle, the auto manufacturing and trucking industries have been supportive of EPA's GHG regulations, in part because of concerns that states would implement a patchwork of standards in the absence of federal action. As the standards have been implemented, however, industry concerns have arisen regarding a lack of harmonization between EPA's GHG standards, fuel efficiency (CAFE) standards administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and related California GHG and fuel efficiency programs.", "One issue concerns the Model Year (MY) 2017-2025 light-duty vehicle regulations. Under these standards, GHG emissions from new light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, and most pickup trucks) will be reduced about 50% compared to 2010 levels, and average fuel economy will rise to nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2025. When EPA and NHTSA promulgated the standards in 2012, EPA committed to a Midterm Evaluation (MTE) of the 2022-2025 portion of the GHG standards. This evaluation was completed on January 12, 2017, with EPA deciding to maintain the standards as promulgated. Given industry concerns about the standards, there is speculation as to whether the Administration will reconsider the MTE decision.", "A second issue concerns GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. EPA and NHTSA promulgated a second phase of these standards on October 25, 2016, covering trucks and engines beginning with the 2021 model year and truck trailers beginning in 2018. These standards could be reconsidered by the two agencies, or Congress could review them under the Congressional Review Act. GHG emissions are directly related to fuel combustion. In order to reduce GHG emissions, EPA expects the standards to increase fuel efficiency, lowering oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of 2018-2029 trucks and saving vehicle owners about $170 billion in fuel costs as a result. In general, the truck standards \u2013 with the exception of the portion dealing with trailers\u2014have been well-received, leaving in question whether general opposition to GHG rules will shape Congress's and the new Administration's reaction to the rules more than the views of the affected industries.", "A third potential issue concerns GHG emission standards for aircraft. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed on international carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards for aircraft, beginning in 2020, and on a system for offsetting future CO2 emissions from aviation. The emission standards would be implemented in the United States by EPA regulations issued under the CAA. U.S. airlines and aircraft manufacturers participated in the ICAO negotiations and have been supportive of the resulting agreements; whether EPA actions to implement them would run contrary to the President's and the Administration's broader views on regulation and climate change is unclear.", "In addition to a discussion of these three issues, this report provides background on GHG emissions from other mobile sources, including ships, nonroad vehicles and engines, locomotives, and fuels."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report discusses the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from mobile sources of pollution.

", "Mobile sources account for close to 30% of the total U.S. emissions of GHGs. As shown in Figure 1 , more than three-quarters of the mobile source total comes from cars and trucks. ", "Over the last eight years, the Obama Administration has worked with major stakeholders in the auto and truck industries and with states and other interested parties to develop and implement GHG standards. Because carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from fuel combustion is the major GHG produced by cars and trucks, the White House directed EPA to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to harmonize the GHG standards with fuel economy standards under development by NHTSA. In addition, under the Clean Air Act, the state of California enjoys unique status to issue motor vehicle emission standards provided that they are at least as stringent as federal standards and are necessary to meet \"compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" California had already promulgated GHG emission standards prior to 2009, for which it had requested an EPA waiver. EPA granted California a waiver in June 2009, and President Obama directed EPA and NHTSA to harmonize the federal GHG and fuel efficiency standards with those developed by California.", "The mobile source GHG standards moved forward even as Congress and the Obama Administration reached an impasse over climate issues. EPA supported economy-wide GHG legislation that passed the House in 2009, but the legislation died in the Senate. Lacking what new authority might have been provided by congressional action, EPA moved ahead with sectoral GHG emission standards using the authority of the existing Clean Air Act (CAA). In Massachusetts v. EPA , the Supreme Court had held in 2007 that the existing CAA authorized the agency to address GHG emissions. ", "The key to using this authority was for the EPA Administrator to find that GHG emissions are air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare, and that motor vehicles cause or contribute to that pollution. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson issued these \"endangerment and cause-or-contribute findings\" in December 2009. ", "Following the issuance of the findings, EPA promulgated four sets of standards for motor vehicles: ", "1. standards for Model Year (MY) 2012-2016 light-duty motor vehicles (cars, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, and most pickups), May 7, 2010; 2. standards for MY2017-MY2025 light-duty vehicles, October 15, 2012; 3. standards for MY 2014-2018 medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines, September 15, 2011; and 4. standards for MY2021-MY2027 medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines and MY2018-MY2027 trailers, October 25, 2016.", "Under the Trump Administration, it is unclear whether this authority will be put to further use, and whether some of the standards already promulgated but not yet implemented might be rolled back or modified. Much may depend on the views of the affected industries: auto, truck, and truck engine manufacturers; and their customers, especially those in the trucking industry. In general, the auto manufacturing and trucking industries have been supportive of EPA's GHG regulations, partly because of concerns that states would implement a patchwork of standards in the absence of federal action. As the standards have been implemented, however, industry concerns have arisen regarding a lack of harmonization between EPA, NHTSA, and related California GHG and fuel efficiency programs. ", "The 2017-2025 light-duty vehicle regulations provided for a Midterm Evaluation of the 2022-2025 standards for these vehicles, which offered an opportunity to modify the standards. As discussed at greater length below, on January 12, 2017, EPA announced a final decision that the MY2022-MY2025 standards remained appropriate and that a rulemaking to change them was not warranted. Congress may take an interest in that final determination.", "Congress may also take an interest in the Phase 2 medium- and heavy-duty truck standards. These standards, which were promulgated in October 2016, would reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles sold under the program, saving vehicle owners fuel costs of about $170 billion according to EPA. The standards will increase the cost of a long haul tractor-trailer, but the buyer would recoup the investment in fuel-efficient technology in less than two years through fuel savings, according to the agency. In general, the truck standards have been well-received by the affected industries, but given the new Administration's general opposition to GHG regulations and the opposition to GHG rules among many in the leadership of the 115 th Congress, there could be efforts to review or modify the regulations.", "Another looming issue in the mobile source arena concerns GHG emission standards for aircraft. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed on international CO 2 emission standards for aircraft, beginning in 2020. ICAO also agreed on a system for offsetting future carbon emissions from aviation. The emission standards and the offset system would be implemented in the United States by EPA regulations issued under the CAA.

In 1998, during the Clinton Administration, EPA General Counsel Jonathan Cannon concluded in a memorandum to the agency's Administrator that greenhouse gases were air pollutants within the CAA's definition of the term, and therefore could be regulated under the act. Relying on the Cannon memorandum as well as the statute itself, on October 20, 1999, a group of 19 organizations petitioned EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under Section 202 of the act. Section 202 gives the EPA Administrator broad authority to set \"standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles\" if in the Administrator's judgment they cause or contribute to air pollution which \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\"", "Under the Bush Administration, EPA denied the petition August 28, 2003, on the basis of a new General Counsel memorandum the same day. The new memorandum concluded that the CAA does not grant EPA authority to regulate carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other GHG emissions based on their climate change impacts. Denial of the petition was challenged by Massachusetts, 11 other states, and various other petitioners in a case that ultimately reached the Supreme Court. In an April 2, 2007, decision ( Massachusetts v. EPA ), the Court found by 5-4 that EPA does have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, since the emissions are clearly air pollutants under the CAA's definition of that term. The Court's majority concluded that EPA must, therefore, decide whether emissions of these pollutants from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or provide a reasonable explanation why it cannot or will not make that decision, such as that there is insufficient information to make the decision. If it makes a finding of endangerment, the act requires the agency to establish standards for emissions of the pollutants.", "In nearly two years following the Court's decision, the Bush Administration's EPA did not respond to the original petition or make a finding regarding endangerment. Its only formal action following the Court decision was to issue a detailed information request, called an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), on July 30, 2008.

Most of the emissions were (and are) in the form of CO 2 (see Figure 2 ), which is the product of combusting any fuel containing carbon. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the chemicals used as coolants in vehicle air conditioning systems, are the second-most important motor vehicle GHG; but, as the figure shows, they are a distant second.

As announced by President Obama, May 19, 2009, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (which administers fuel economy standards for cars and trucks under authorities that began with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975) would integrate corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for new cars and light trucks (collectively known as \"light-duty motor vehicles\") with national greenhouse gas emission standards to be issued by EPA. The objective of the joint standards was to achieve \"One National Program,\" with GHG reduction levels similar to those adopted by California, which harmonized its own standards with EPA's as part of the agreement. ", "As has happened on many previous occasions when EPA set emission standards for conventional pollutants from motor vehicles, the GHG standards have forced the development or implementation of new technology. In adopting technology-forcing regulations, EPA has generally followed the lead of California. Because of its more severe air pollution and its pioneering role in establishing motor vehicle emission control requirements in the 1960s, California is allowed to adopt standards more stringent than federal requirements. The state must apply for a waiver of federal preemption under CAA Section 209(b) in order to enforce its more stringent standards, which EPA is to grant if the state meets certain criteria, primarily a showing that the standards are needed to meet \"compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" If California is granted a waiver, other states with air quality problems may adopt identical requirements, thus reinforcing the potential impact of California's standards.

The result would be a 21% reduction in fleet-wide emissions by 2030 compared to the level that would occur in the absence of the regulations, according to EPA. NHTSA set corresponding fuel economy standards, achieving a combined estimated fuel economy of 34.1 miles per gallon for cars and light trucks in 2016. In both cases, the standards were gradually phased in; the first reduction targets affected model year 2012. ", "In setting the GHG standards, EPA used the concept of a vehicle's \"footprint\" to set differing standards for different size vehicles.

Generally, the larger the vehicle footprint, the higher the corresponding vehicle CO 2 emissions target. As a result, the burden of compliance is distributed across all vehicles and all manufacturers. Manufacturers are not compelled to build light vehicles of any particular size or type, and each manufacturer will have its own standard which reflects the vehicles it chooses it [sic] produce.", "(For a further discussion of vehicle footprints and fuel economy standards, see CRS Report R42721, Automobile and Truck Fuel Economy (CAFE) and Greenhouse Gas Standards .)", "In general, manufacturers have reduced CO 2 emissions by improving the vehicles' fuel economy, but they can also take advantage of options to generate CO 2 -equivalent credits by reducing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and CO 2 through improvements in their air conditioner systems or by the use of idle reduction technologies, among other strategies.

Among the potential revisions suggested by critics have been better harmonization of the existing EPA/NHTSA/CARB standards, easing the MY2022-MY2025 standards, or eliminating them entirely. ", "It is unclear whether the Trump Administration will reconsider EPA's Mid-Term Evaluation, and if so, how quickly. The standards were promulgated in 2012 and were not modified by the MTE, so the deadlines for judicial review and for the fast-track review authority in the Congressional Review Act would appear to have lapsed. The promulgated standards could be changed through a new rulemaking, a process that normally would take a year or more and would itself be subject to judicial and congressional review upon completion. A rulemaking would probably need to be justified by new or additional data or a reasonable justification to avoid being considered arbitrary and capricious if challenged in court. With options for continued review uncertain, the role of Congress may be one of oversight, at least for now.

Several inconsistencies to the One National Program have been noted in stakeholder petitions to the rulemaking, and include the accounting for off-cycle technologies, air conditioning efficiencies, Lifetime Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) values, and credit transfer and adjustment factors.

The car and light truck fleets turn over slowly: in 2015, the average age of U.S. cars and light trucks was 11.5 years. Given this durability, the impact of GHG standards on the total emissions of the motor vehicle fleet will take a long time to be felt.

The regulations are to take effect \"after such period as the Administrator finds necessary ... to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance.\" ", "Compared to other mobile sources, EPA's CAA authority vis-\u00e0-vis aircraft and aircraft engines contains an important difference: the Administrator must consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of Transportation in developing emission standards, and is not allowed to impose new standards if doing so would significantly increase noise and adversely affect safety. The President may also disapprove any such standards if the Secretary of Transportation finds that they would create a hazard to aircraft safety.", "EPA has rarely regulated emissions from aircraft without first negotiating international agreements through ICAO. ICAO's agreements on standards for conventional pollutants from aircraft, unlike EPA's regulation of the same pollutants from motor vehicles, has consistently avoided forcing technology. The most recent standards for nitrogen oxides, for example, essentially ratified what the principal aircraft manufacturers had already achieved. ", "Besides petitioning EPA for action on aviation emissions, environmental groups brought suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to force EPA to respond to their petitions on aircraft (as well as their petitions on marine vessels, and nonroad engines and vehicles). On July 5, 2011, the court found that EPA has a mandatory duty to determine whether aircraft emissions endanger public health or welfare, and may be sued for unreasonable delay in doing so. In March 2012, however, the court ruled that plaintiffs had not shown that EPA had unreasonably delayed such a decision. ", "By issuing an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from commercial aircraft, EPA has now taken the first step toward setting aircraft GHG emission standards. The endangerment finding itself, although it does not impose standards, is a final rule. As explained earlier, final rules promulgated on or after June 13, 2016, are eligible for fast-track procedures in the Senate under the Congressional Review Act; a CRA resolution of disapproval overturning the rule could be approved by a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes generally needed to invoke cloture. Even more than the truck standards discussed earlier, however, the endangerment finding was welcomed by the affected industries, who participated in the ICAO process that has led to EPA's action. In response to EPA's issuance of the finding, an Airlines for America representative was reported as saying:", "As aviation is a global industry, with airlines operating internationally and manufacturers selling their aircraft in international markets, it is critical that aircraft emissions standards be set at the international level and not imposed unilaterally by one country or set of countries. ... Thus, we commend EPA's action, which will enable the ICAO [carbon dioxide] certification standard for future aircraft to be adopted into U.S. law consistent with the Clean Air Act, U.S. treaty obligations and in harmony with the international community.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Mobile Sources", "paragraphs": ["Following the Massachusetts v.

With that in mind, we look at other mobile source categories, the authorities provided under Title II for each, and what EPA's use of these authorities for conventional pollutants emitted by these sources indicates with regard to its ability to regulate greenhouse gases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ships", "paragraphs": ["Three of the petitions to EPA asking the agency to control greenhouse gas emissions concern ocean-going ships (also referred to as marine engines and vessels) and (in two of the petitions) their fuel.

Including domestic shipping and the CO 2 -equivalent of other GHGs emitted by ships, the amount would increase to 961 million metric tons, 2.5% of global emissions. At these levels, only five countries (the United States, China, Russia, India, and Japan) individually account for a higher percentage of the world total of CO 2 emissions.", "In addition to the CO 2 emissions, the low-quality bunker fuel that ships use and the general absence of pollution controls result in significant emissions of black carbon, which also contributes to climate change. Thus, the total impact of ships on climate may be greater than the 2.5% estimate above.", "The authority to control pollution from ships is found in Section 213(a)(4) of the CAA, which provides general authority to the Administrator to promulgate standards for emissions other than carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and volatile organic compounds from \"nonroad engines and vehicles.\" Fuels are regulated separately under Section 211 of the act. ", "The language of Section 213 is similar to that for new motor vehicles in Section 202, except that in place of the words \"cause, or contribute,\" Section 213 uses the phrase \"significantly contribute\": if the Administrator determines that emissions of GHGs from ships significantly contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, he may promulgate such regulations as he deems \"appropriate.\" Except for the specific conventional pollutants mentioned in Section 213(a)(2), there is no level of stringency (such as best available control technology) specified for prospective regulations. The Administrator may establish classes or categories of ships for the purposes of regulation. There is no deadline for the promulgation of standards, and in setting them, the Administrator may take into account costs, noise, safety, and energy factors associated with the application of technology.", "If the Administrator were to conclude that GHG emissions from ships significantly contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, a wide variety of measures might be undertaken to reduce emissions from shipping, ranging from simple operational measures, such as reducing speed or using cleaner fuels, to various hull and propeller design features that would increase fuel economy. Reducing speed can save substantial amounts of fuel. A.P. Moller-Maersk, which operates the world's largest fleet of containerships, has reported that \"reducing speed 5-10% does increase the number of days at sea, but reduces fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by more than 15%.\" Over the period 2007-2015, Maersk reduced its CO 2 emissions per container shipped by 42%. The company has set a target of 60% reduction per container as compared to 2007 emissions by 2020. In addition to reducing speed, the company has reduced emissions through \"operational optimization,\" newer (more efficient) vessels, and reductions of energy use in ports. ", "The petitions to EPA mentioned improved fleet deployment planning, use of shore-side power while in port, heat recovery systems, the use of sails as supplemental propulsion sources, and NOx controls, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or exhaust gas recirculation, as potential emission control measures. ", "A complicating factor in the regulation of emissions from ocean-going vessels would be that, for the most part, their GHG emissions occur in international waters, and the sources (the ships) are not registered in the United States: according to California's petition, 95% of the fleet calling on U.S. ports is foreign-flagged. The petitioners asserted that these factors are not a bar to EPA regulation, however, citing as precedent a Supreme Court case that held that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) could be applied to foreign-flagged cruise ships so long as the ADA-required accommodations did not interfere with the ships' internal affairs or require major, permanent modifications to the ships.", "The shipping industry has generally opposed international regulation of ships' GHG emissions, but following the United Nations' climate agreement reached in Paris in December 2015, the International Chamber of Shipping urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to adopt a sector-wide pledge to reduce international shipping emissions. The IMO's Environment Protection Committee met in April and October 2016, but took no action on GHGs other than to require large ships (ships of greater than 5,000 gross tons) to report their annual CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption.", "In addition to petitioning for regulation of emissions from ships, the petitions submitted by California and Oceana et al., stated that EPA should regulate the composition of marine shipping vessel fuel to control global-climate-change-related emissions, or should require use of marine diesel fuel oil instead of bunker fuel. The purpose would be to limit the sulfur content of marine fuels and reduce NOx emissions. We discuss EPA's authority to regulate fuels in a separate section below, but note here that EPA, the state of California, and the International Maritime Organization have all moved forward with regulations to limit the sulfur content of bunker fuel for the purpose of reducing conventional pollutants. California's low sulfur fuel requirements went into effect July 1, 2009. In addition, on March 26, 2010, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved an EPA proposal that the entire U.S. coastline except portions of Alaska be designated as an Emission Control Area, subject to lower sulfur limits in bunker fuel. On July 15, 2011, the IMO officially added the waters around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as Emission Control Areas.", "Sulfur emissions form fine particles of sulfate in the atmosphere, with significant impacts on public health and welfare. (For a further discussion of these impacts, see CRS Report RL34548, Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships .) Although harmful as a conventional pollutant, the impact of sulfur emissions on climate is more complicated. Sulfate particles are thought by most experts to have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, since they tend to reflect solar radiation back into space rather than absorbing it. On the other hand, removing sulfur might be necessary to prevent the fouling of pollution control equipment that reduces other pollutants that do lead to warming.

Many of these engines had few emission control requirements for as many as 25 years after the regulation of automobiles. In the last decade, however, often following the lead of California, EPA has promulgated standards for many nonroad categories. Some of these standards, particularly for diesel-powered equipment and for lawn and garden equipment, have been technology-forcing. Others, such as for snowmobiles, have been less so. ", "In general, given the wide variety of engine types and sizes and the configurations of the equipment itself, the agency has based its standards on a review of individual subcategories and the technologies available to reduce emissions from specific types of machinery or equipment, rather than applying one across the board standard.

In addition, locomotives emit substantial amounts of black carbon, which is thought to have significant global warming potential through its ability to absorb solar radiation and to reduce the reflectivity of snow and ice. According to a report from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies cited in the locomotive petition, \"\u2026 black soot may be responsible for 25 percent of observed global warming over the past century.\" As a result, in addition to requesting that EPA set GHG emission standards for locomotives, the petition asked EPA to set standards for locomotives' black carbon emissions.", "The CAA requires EPA to set emission standards for new locomotives (and new engines used in locomotives) in Section 213(a)(5).

On April 15, 2010, California's Office of Administrative Law approved regulations to implement the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which had been under development since 2007. The standard's goal is to reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels per unit of energy 10% by 2020. The regulations address emissions from the production, transportation, and consumption of gasoline, diesel fuel, and their alternatives, including biofuels. They envision compliance both through the use of lower carbon fuels and through the development of more efficient, advanced-technology vehicles, such as plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cells. ", "As has been the case with motor vehicles, California has often led the way in the development of cleaner fuels through technology-forcing regulation, with U.S. EPA later adopting similar standards. Thus, many have viewed the Low Carbon Fuel Standard as the prototype of another possible use of existing CAA authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions nationally. On July 29, 2009, the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU Law School petitioned EPA to establish a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fuels used in motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, and aircraft.", "Regulation of fuels would be a way for California or U.S. EPA to obtain reductions from existing vehicles and engines. As noted earlier, the slow turnover of the vehicle fleet means that emission reductions from new vehicles will only gradually affect emission levels from the fleet as a whole. By requiring low carbon fuels, California and EPA could obtain GHG reductions from the entire fleet more quickly.", "On the other hand, measuring the carbon content of fuels is more complicated than it may seem, particularly if one considers the life-cycle emissions, including indirect impacts of production. EPA has been embroiled in a controversy over this issue already, as it attempted to develop a methodology for measuring greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ). For regulations implementing that provision, EPA developed and later modified a methodology to measure the GHG effects of indirect land-use changes, such as the switching of land from forest to cropland.

", "By issuing endangerment findings similar to the one it issued for motor vehicles, EPA could move forward to control GHG emissions from other categories of mobile sources and/or their fuels. As discussed, the agency took a step along this path by issuing an endangerment finding for aircraft on August 15, 2016. This action was not particularly controversial, and was not challenged by aircraft manufacturers or airlines. The aircraft manufacturing and aviation industries have participated in international negotiations that have produced agreement on emission standards for new aircraft and a voluntary system to offset what might otherwise be a growth in emissions from air travel. As shown in Table 4 , aircraft are the largest source of mobile source GHG emissions after cars and trucks. ", "Although a framework for regulating GHG emissions from the largest categories of mobile sources is now in place, Congress and the Trump Administration face a number of questions regarding GHG emissions from mobile sources in the first months of 2017. In campaigning for election, President Trump promised to overturn EPA regulations, including those addressing GHGs. Congressional Republicans have also been critical of Obama Administration actions addressing climate change. The early months of the new Congress present the opportunity under the Congressional Review Act to rescind EPA regulations promulgated since June 2016, which could include the Phase 2 emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and the endangerment finding for aircraft.", "These rules are not particularly controversial with the regulated industries. Somewhat more controversial is the Mid-Term Evaluation of the light-duty vehicle GHG emissions standards for MY2022-MY2025. It is unclear whether that determination, which left the already promulgated GHG standards in place, could be subject to the Congressional Review Act.", "As shown in Table 4 , after motor vehicles and aircraft, other mobile source categories are less significant: most of them accounted for less than 1% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014. Thus, rather than develop standards for additional mobile sources, EPA has expanded its focus to stationary sources. Stationary sources account for about 70% of the nation's GHG emissions; within that group electric power plants account for about 30% of all U.S. GHG emissions, a higher percentage of the nation's total than all mobile sources combined. To address power plant emissions, EPA promulgated the Clean Power Plan (CPP) on October 23, 2015. Although the CPP is currently stayed by the Supreme Court pending the outcome of judicial proceedings, resolving its future arguably poses a higher priority for the Trump Administration and many in Congress than the pending decisions regarding mobile sources.
