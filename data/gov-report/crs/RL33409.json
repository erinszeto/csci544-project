Benefits to veterans range from disability compensation and pensions to hospital and medical care. VA provides these benefits to veterans through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through an integrated health care system.", "The President's FY2007 budget proposal to Congress requested $32.7 billion for VHA, an 11.3% increase over the FY2006 enacted amount of $29.3 billion, and a 10% increase over the FY2005 enacted amount of $29.7 billion. As in previous budget proposals, the President's FY2007 budget request also includes a set of legislative proposals. The Administration is requesting authorization from Congress to assess an annual enrollment fee of $250 for all Priority 7 and 8 veterans, increase veterans' share of pharmaceutical copayments from $8 to $15 (for each 30-day prescription) for all enrolled veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8, and bill veterans receiving treatment for nonservice-connected conditions for the entire copayment amount.", "On May 19, 2006, the House passed the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007 (H.R. 5385, H.Rept. 109-464).

Concerned about the incidence of traumatic and other brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan resulting from Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks, Congress increased DOD's funding request for this program in FY2006, and commissioned an extensive report that was due on October 6, 2006. In FY2007, the final funding level for this program will be set in the conference version of the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies bill ( H.R. 5385 ).

VA carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for health care services and medical research programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible, among other things, for providing compensations, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries, providing grants to states for establishing, expanding or improving state veterans cemeteries, and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons, among other things.", "VA's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance, among other benefits and services. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services, including medical care. In FY2006, discretionary budget authority accounted for about 48% of the total VA budget authority, with most of this discretionary funding going toward supporting VA health care.", "VHA operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). While policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters to be applied throughout the VA health care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which generally bases funding on patient workload. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities primarily on the basis of their historical expenditures. Unlike other federally funded health insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which finance medical care provided through the private sector, VHA provides care directly to veterans.", "In FY2005, VHA operated 156 hospitals, 135 nursing homes, 43 residential rehabilitation treatment centers, and 711 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). VHA also pays for care provided to veterans by independent providers and practitioners on a fee basis under certain circumstances. Inpatient and outpatient care is provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). In addition, VHA provides grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities, and collaborates with DOD in sharing health care resources and services.", "During FY2005, VHA provided medical care to about 4.9 million unique veteran patients, a caseload that is estimated to increase by about 108,000, or 2.2% in FY2006 (see Table 3 ). According to VHA estimates, the number of unique veteran patients is estimated to increase by approximately 45,000 in FY2007. As shown in Table 3 , there would be a 3.6% increase in the total number of unique patients (both veterans and non-veterans), from 5.3 million in FY2005 to 5.5 million in FY2007.", "The total number of outpatient visits reached 52.3 million during FY2005 and is projected to increase to 55.5 million in FY2006 and 58.5 million in FY2007. In FY2005, VHA spent approximately 61.7% of its medical care obligations on outpatient care.", "Since 1946, VHA has been associated with training physicians and other health care professionals and has become an essential component of health care higher education in the United States. Veterans' health care facilities are affiliated with 107 of the nation's 126 medical schools, and participate in graduate medical education (GME) through integrated residency programs administered through medical schools and academic health centers. VHA is also affiliated with over 1,200 other schools offering students allied and associated education degrees and certificates in 40 health profession disciplines. In FY2005, about 31,000 physician residents and fellows\u201417,000 medical students, 24,000 nursing students, and 18,000 allied health residents and fellows\u2014received some or all of their training in VA medical centers.", "The rest of this report tracks VHA's FY2007 appropriations and provides a brief summary of funding levels for VHA for FY2006, including a discussion on supplemental appropriations for FY2005 and FY2006.

Unlike Medicare or Medicaid, VA health care is not a entitlement program. Contrary to numerous claims made concerning \"promises\" to military personnel and veterans with regard to \"free health care for life,\" not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from VA. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, all veterans were technically eligible for some care, however, the actual provision of care was based on available resources.", "The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262 , established two eligibility categories and required VHA to manage the provision of hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system based on a system of priorities. P.L. 104-262 authorized VA to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards such as Agent Orange, veterans whose attributable income and net worth are not greater than an established \"means test\", and veterans of World War I. These veterans are generally known as \"higher priority\" or \"core\" veterans. The other category of veterans are those with no service-connected disabilities and with attributable incomes above an established \"means test.\"", "P.L. 104-262 also authorized VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. As stated in the report language accompanying P.L. 104-262 , \"the Act would direct the Secretary, in providing for the care of 'core' veterans, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in a manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities. At the same time, it would vest discretion in the Secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate.\"", "Furthermore, P.L. 104-262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources. The Committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262 states that the provision of hospital care and medical services would be provided to \"the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts for these purposes. Such language is intended to clarify that these services would continue to depend upon discretionary appropriations.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VHA Health Care Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["As stated previously, P.L. 104-262 required the establishment of a national enrollment system to manage the delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care. The new eligibility standard was created by Congress to \"ensure that medical judgment rather than legal criteria will determine when care will be provided and the level at which care will be furnished.\"", "For most veterans, entry into the veterans' health care system begins by completing the application for enrollment. Some veterans are exempt from the enrollment requirement if they meet special eligibility requirements. A veteran may apply for enrollment by completing the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any time during the year and submitting the form online or in person at any VA medical center or clinic, or mailing or faxing the completed form to the medical center or clinic of the veteran's choosing. Once a veteran is enrolled in the VA health care system the veteran remains in the system and does not have to re-apply for enrollment annually. However, those veterans who have been enrolled in Priority Group 5 based on income must submit a new VA Form 10-10EZ annually with updated financial information demonstrating inability to defray the expenses of necessary care.", "Eligibility for VA health care is primarily based on \"veteran's status\" resulting from military service. Veteran's status is established by active-duty status in the military, naval, or air service and a honorable discharge or release from active military service. Generally, persons enlisting in one of the armed forces after September 7, 1980, and officers commissioned after October 16, 1981, must have completed two years of active duty or the full period of their initial service obligation to be eligible for VA health care benefits. Veterans discharged at any time because of service-connected disabilities are not held to this requirement. Furthermore, reservists who were called to active duty and who completed the term for which they were called, and who were granted an other than dishonorable discharge, or were National Guard members who were called to active duty by federal executive order, and who completed the term for which they were called, and who were granted an other than dishonorable discharge are also exempt from the 24 continuous months of active duty requirement.", "When not activated to full-time federal service, members of the reserve components and National Guard have limited eligibility for VA health care services. Members of the reserve components may be granted service-connection for any injury they incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while attending inactive duty training assemblies, annual training, active duty for training, or while going directly to or returning directly from such duty. Additionally, reserve component servicemembers may be granted service-connection for a heart attack or stoke if such an event occurs during these same periods. The granting of service-connection makes them eligible to receive care from VA for those conditions. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for any injury, heart attack, or stroke that occurs while performing duty ordered by a governor for state emergencies or activities.", "After veteran's status has been established ,VA next places applicants into one of two categories. The first group is composed of veterans with service-connected disabilities or with incomes below a established means test. These veterans are regarded by VA as \"high priority\" veterans, and they are enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 (see Appendix A ). Veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 include:", "veterans in need of care for a service-connected disability; veterans who have a compensable service-connected condition; veterans whose discharge or release from active military, naval or air service was for a compensable disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs); veterans awarded the purple heart; veterans who have been determined by VA to be catastrophically disabled; veterans of World War I; veterans who were exposed to hazardous agents (such as Agent Orange in Vietnam) while on active duty; and veterans who have an annual income and net worth below a VA-established means test threshold.", "VA also looks at applicants' income and net worth to determine their specific priority category and whether they have to pay copayments for nonservice-connected care. In addition, veterans are asked to provide VA with information on any health insurance coverage they have, including coverage through employment or through a spouse. VA may bill these payers for treatment of conditions that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service. Appendix B provides information on what categories of veterans pay for which services.", "The second group is composed of veterans who do not fall into one of the first six priority groups. These veterans are primarily those with nonservice-connected medical conditions and with incomes and net worth above the VA established means test threshold. These veterans are enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8.

Instead of returning the funds to the Treasury, VA can use them for medical services for veterans without fiscal year limitations. To increase VA's third-party collections, P.L. 105-33 also gave VA the authority to change its basis of billing insurers from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges.\" This change in billing was intended to enhance VA collections to the extent that reasonable charges result in higher payments than reasonable costs.
