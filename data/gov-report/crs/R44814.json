Traditionally NASS estimates have focused on state and national data, but in recent years county-level estimates have gained in importance. NASS crop production estimates are crucial to people in the U.S. agricultural sector involved in making marketing and investment decisions, policymakers who design farm support programs, USDA agents who implement those programs, and producers who benefit from those programs.", "NASS conducts hundreds of surveys every year and prepares reports covering many aspects of U.S. agriculture. For example, NASS survey data are used to produce forecasts of area, yield, production, value, and stocks for major crop and livestock products, as well as for estimates of the historical number of farms and land in farms, land rental rates and values, farm labor usage, fertilizer and chemical usage, computer usage and ownership on farms, and farm production expenditures. NASS also undertakes a National Census of Agriculture every five years that provides comprehensive information about the nation's agriculture down to the county level. The census includes data on the number of farms, land use, production expenses, value of land and buildings, farm size and characteristics of farm operators, market value of agricultural production sold, acreage of major crops, inventory of livestock and poultry, and farm irrigation practices.", "NASS spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts. In FY2016, Congress appropriated $177 million for NASS operations, including $126.2 million (75% of its budget) for annual agricultural estimates and $42.2 million (25%) for the Census of Agriculture.", "The critical role that NASS data plays in promoting a smooth and efficient marketing process for U.S. agriculture makes NASS's successful function a concern of Congress. In particular, three issues related to NASS's survey methodology and crop estimates are of potential concern to Congress. First, a trend has emerged since the early 1990s of declining NASS survey response by farmer participants. For most crops, NASS production estimates are based on data collected from farm operations via grower survey responses. The quality of NASS crop acreage and production estimates depends on a high level of participation by agricultural producers. As the number of respondents falls, the statistical reliability of estimates and forecasts declines and the value of NASS estimates for a host of other purposes declines as well.", "The second issue derives primarily from the first in that the declining survey response impacts more localized or regional estimates first, particularly county-level estimates and those programs that are based on county-level data. In particular, insufficient response rates in some counties have led to unexpectedly wide discrepancies across counties in farm program payment rates under the county-based revenue support program\u2014Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC-CO)\u2014established under the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79). These discrepancies have generated concern about whether the new revenue program is working as intended or whether this is simply a data problem that needs to be addressed. Barring any near-term fix by USDA, lawmakers may elect to address county-to-county payment disparities in the context of the next farm bill.", "Third, market participants and policymakers alike are concerned that NASS estimates be unbiased and objective so as not to influence market prices or volatility.

As a result, every piece of land (or segment, as described below) has a known chance to be selected. Constructing the area frame was a major undertaking that included a combination of aerial photography and satellite remote sensing imagery verified by onsite visits. The advantage of an area frame is that, once established, it does not change rapidly over time, although it can become less efficient as the characteristics of the farming population change. A frame is generally used for 15 to 20 years, and when it becomes outdated, a new frame is constructed to replace it.

Another procedure is to draw a sample of the nonrespondents and make a special effort to obtain the required information from them. Then nonresponse bias can be measured, and the overall estimate can be adjusted accordingly.

Some states conduct two surveys, one in late summer for the early harvested crops (small grains) and another in late fall for row crops, hay, and livestock. Most states conduct only one late fall survey.", "The target population is all farms and ranches in each state. Operations already participating in other NASS acreage and livestock surveys are excused from the CAPS. However, their responses to these other surveys are merged into the county summaries. Special sampling considerations are employed to ensure that all counties and rarer commodities are adequately represented. Also, farms that have not responded to a survey for several years may be added to the sample for the purpose of refreshing sampling information.", "Each state develops its own data collection strategy. Most states conduct a mail survey with second mailings or a telephone follow-up to ensure adequate coverage for each county. Response targets are set for each county and the follow-up strategy is defined accordingly. The number of reports returned is monitored, and a nonresponse follow-up strategy is mapped out to achieve response targets. Summaries compute the measures needed to allocate previously released state totals to regions and counties. State estimates for commodities are made from acreage and livestock surveys conducted under more rigid controls.

This problem was particularly acute (but not unique) for county-level ARC-CO corn payments in North Dakota. Farmers in two counties, LaMoure and Logan, received no payments, while farmers in neighboring counties received payments ranging from $20 to $60 per acre. Similar county-wide disparities appeared again for the 2015 crop year ARC-CO payments.", "The ARC-CO program is a revenue guarantee triggered by crop revenue losses at the county level. Payments are made whenever the actual county revenue drops below an ARC county revenue guarantee. The ARC revenue guarantee is calculated as 86% of the product of the recent historical five-year Olympic average (removing the high and low observations) county yield and the five-year Olympic average national farm price. The actual county revenue is calculated as the product of the national season average farm price for a crop and its county average yield. ", "The cause of the discrepancies in ARC-CO payments among counties appears to be related directly to FSA's use of a \"cascading policy\" for determining what county yield estimate is used in the payment calculation. Under its current policy, FSA requires that the NASS yield estimate be used. However, NASS can only publish a county yield estimate if at least 30 producer yield surveys are returned for that county or at least three responses are received from producers representing a minimum of 25% of the total county acreage. ", "If NASS does not get enough responses to publish an estimate, then it uses the county's yield estimate from RMA's crop insurance data base. RMA uses actual reported yield data from producers that participate in crop insurance to calculate a county yield estimate. However, RMA yields may differ from NASS estimates since not all farms may participate in crop insurance. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, RMA yield data tend to be higher than NASS yield data. Whatever the reason for the difference, the substitution of RMA yield data in lieu of NASS yield data tends to inflate the calculated \"actual\" county revenue for the crop year and, thus, produce a lower ARC-CO payment. ", "In the event that neither NASS nor RMA yield data are available, then the FSA state committee will determine the county yield using \"best available data.\" This may involve NASS or RMA yield data for a neighboring county or a higher aggregated level, such as the NASS district yield or 70% of the crop insurance transitional yield. As yield estimates become increasingly disconnected from the target county, the odds tend to increase that an ARC-CO payment will not be triggered when the county would otherwise qualify for payments. ", "Even a relatively small change in the yield estimate for a county can have a substantial effect on the payment rate. For example, a 5% decline in the current county yield estimate can result in a tripling of the payment rate, whereas a 5% increase results in zero payments ( Table 4 ). ", "Commodity groups have argued that FSA is under no legal requirement to use RMA yield data when NASS data are unavailable. These groups have proposed several alternatives, including using NASS data from neighboring counties instead of own-county RMA yields or using RMA data exclusively for all counties nationwide as a \"fairness\" gesture, since crop insurance data are more widely available at the county level. Similarly, during the 114 th Congress, Senator Hoeven of North Dakota proposed an amendment (\u00a7751) to the 2017 agriculture appropriations bill ( S. 2956 ) to create a new $5 million nationwide pilot program to address county yield discrepancies. Specifically, under the proposed pilot program, if an FSA office finds a disparity between yield calculations in comparable counties, it will have an opportunity to remedy the inaccuracy by using an alternate calculation method. ", "USDA appears to be under no legislative requirement or guidance for this cascade policy. Regarding the choice of county yield data used in calculating the farm year's actual crop revenue, the 2014 farm bill conveys implementation authority to the Secretary of Agriculture in Section 1117(b)(A), where the formula is to use \"the actual average county yield per planted acre for the covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary.\"", "According to the American Soybean Association (ASA), FSA decided not to change its policy for the current farm bill period (2014-2018) because it thought that such a change could create winners and losers or possibly increase the cost of the program. Moreover, ASA asserts that FSA has expressed concern that making a change in the middle of the current farm bill could bring unwanted attention to both NASS and RMA. This issue may be part of the debate surrounding the ARC-CO program in particular\u2014and farm revenue support programs in general\u2014during the next farm bill debate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objective, Unbiased USDA Crop Forecasts", "paragraphs": ["The farm community has frequently expressed concerns that large grain and commercial food companies and hedge funds have inordinate market power and access to the hallways of Congress and thus can potentially influence USDA reports in such a manner as to profit from them at the expense of the \"small farmer.\" As a result, USDA and NASS expressly operate in a very public fashion to discourage such criticisms. ", "Every March, NASS publishes Price Reactions After USDA Crop Reports , which evaluates market reactions to NASS crop production forecasts by measuring the market price changes for corn, soybeans, wheat, and upland cotton both one day and one week after the NASS reports are released. The price reactions are done for those NASS reports that occur during the critical growing and harvesting months. This includes the months when crop production estimates are first made and then again when they are finalized (in the Crop Production Annual Summary released in January following the harvest) by USDA.

Thus, substantial market information concerning both supply and demand for major commodity markets is made available at the same time as NASS estimates of U.S. crop production. This implies that NASS reports are not necessarily solely responsible for any changes to the price level for commodities in the short term following the data release.

The authors concluded that the objectivity and consistency of NASS forecasting procedures and methodology was confirmed by the data. There appeared to be no trend in the size or direction of forecast errors over time, except that NASS production forecast errors were largest in August (when the greatest amount of yield uncertainty was at play) and smaller in subsequent forecasts as the yield uncertainty was reduced until the final harvest.", "Appendix A. Historical Origins of NASS", "President Lincoln established the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1862. The precursor of NASS\u2014the Division of Statistics\u2014was established within USDA a year later in 1863. One of the key missions of the Division of Statistics was to provide information on commodity and agricultural markets to improve their operating efficiency and provide a fair and equitable environment for price discovery in the marketplace. The Administration argued that without federal provision of objective, transparent data on U.S. and world markets to all participants on an equal basis, powerful interests with deep resources could get access to this critical information and either manipulate these markets or simply profit from it at the cost of individual farmers and ranchers. An initial duty of the Division of Statistics was to prepare monthly reports on the condition of U.S. crops. In 1866, it began to publish annual statistics on production of major crops, livestock numbers, and annual farm prices. In 1882, state statistical agents were hired on a part-time basis. In 1898 additional state agents were hired to provide better coordination and greater coverage. By 1905, USDA had state-level statistical agents in 43 states. ", "A scandal involving advance knowledge of USDA's crop forecasts by a New York cotton speculator occurred in 1905 and led to the establishment of the Crop Reporting Board (now called the Agricultural Statistics Board [ASB]). The Crop Reporting Board consisted of several statisticians who provided an independent review of the survey data forwarded from NASS's regional offices. ", "In addition, a secure system of data collection and release\u2014referred to as the \"lockup\" system\u2014was established to prevent early release or advance knowledge of USDA's crop forecasts. Field offices forward their estimates to NASS headquarters, where they are combined under the secure lockup system and released at preannounced scheduled times to the press and public by the ASB.", "In 1961, under a USDA-wide reorganization, NASS's immediate precursor\u2014the Statistical Reporting Service (SRS)\u2014was established. In 1986, the SRS was renamed as NASS and the Crop Reporting Board was renamed as the ASB. Over the years NASS's reporting program of agricultural estimates has responded to an increased demand for agricultural production and market information with more frequent and detailed reports, including weekly reports on crop progress during the growing season, monthly reports on farm prices received and cattle on feed, and quarterly reports of hogs.

First, all land in each state is classified into land use categories by intensity of cultivation\u2014referred to as stratification\u2014using a variety of map products, satellite imagery, and computer software packages. These land use classifications range from intensively cultivated areas to marginally cultivated grazing areas to urban areas. Most states use six general land-use strata: intensive agriculture, extensive agriculture, cities and towns, rangeland, non-agriculture, and water. Then, the land in each land use category is divided into smaller segments ranging from about 1 square mile in cultivated areas to 0.1 square mile in urban areas. This segmentation allows intensively cultivated land segments to be selected with a greater frequency than those in less intensively cultivated areas. Segments representing cultivated areas are selected at a rate of about 1 out of 125. Sample segments in land use classifications with decreasing amounts of cultivated land are selected into the survey sample at rates ranging from 1 out of 250 to 1 out of 500.", "Sampling from the List Frame", "Before sampling from the list frame, each farm is classified by various characteristics such as the number of acres by crop. Large farms, as determined by the relevant control data, are sampled at high rates. For example, Illinois farms on the list with over 5,500 acres of cropland, or grain storage capacity exceeding 500,000 bushels, are selected with certainty, as are Iowa farms with over 5,000 acres of cropland. Smaller farms are selected at rates of 1 out of 25 to 50. Table B-1 provides a comparison of samples from the list and area frames used for NASS crop reports on corn and soybean production during 2016.", "Appendix C. Planted and Harvested Area Surveys", "Every year NASS conducts three major acreage surveys that correspond with the crop reporting schedule briefly outlined above and shown in Table 2 . In late March, the Planting Intentions report gives a first look at the crops that farmers intend to plant in the spring. This is followed in late June by the Acreage report, which includes both estimates of spring-planted acreages and forecasts of harvested acreages. An end-of-year acreage and production survey conducted in early December, after most of the field crops have been harvested, contributes to final year-end estimates for planted and harvested acres. ", "March Prospective Plantings Survey ", "The spring planting intentions contained in the Prospective Plantings report are based primarily on a survey\u2014conducted during the first two weeks of March\u2014of the current field crop planting intentions for about 83,000 randomly selected farm operators. The acreage estimates are intended to reflect grower planting intentions as of the survey period and give the first indication of potential crop plantings for the year. Each state NASS field office reviews the survey data for \"reasonableness and consistency\" with historical estimates, and the results are submitted to the statisticians of NASS's ASB for an independent review. The published acreage estimates are based on survey data, but some judgment may be used based on the historical relationship of official estimates to the survey data. Actual spring plantings may vary from intentions in accordance with changes in weather or market conditions between early March and the actual planting period of April to June.", "June Acreage Survey", "The largest single survey NASS conducts each year is the June Agricultural Survey. During the first two weeks in June, about 2,400 interviewers contact over 125,000 farmers, either by telephone or in person, to obtain information on crop acreages, grain stocks, and livestock inventories. This pool of sampled farmers is drawn from two sources\u2014about 70,000 farms from the list frame and every farm with land inside of one of the approximately 11,000 area segments that are selected nationwide from the area frame. Data from the two surveys (list and area frame) are combined in such a way as to account for all acreage but to avoid double-counting of acreage. The sample of farm operators surveyed as part of the area frame varies from year to year as the segments selected vary, but it may represent as many as 50,000 farm operators that are additional to the list frame sample. ", "NASS interviewers use maps and aerial photos showing the exact location and boundaries of each sample area segment to locate and interview every operator with land inside the segment boundaries to identify crops planted in each field and obtain livestock inventory information and quantities of grain in storage. Telephone interviewers collect most of the data from this pooled sample, asking producers to report the acreage, by crop, that has either been planted or that they intend to plant and the acreage they expect to harvest as grain. The ASB reviews survey data at the state and national level in the same way described for the March survey data.", "Data from this survey are used to estimate, among other things, total acres planted to corn, soybeans, and other crops regardless of the intended uses. Also, preliminary projections of acres to be harvested for grain or soybeans, including seed, are made using these data. The winter wheat planted and harvested acreage released in earlier NASS reports is subject to revisions in the June Acreage report. ", "Midyear estimates of harvested acreage for the earliest harvested crops, such as the small grains, are based on reported area for harvest from the June survey. For the later harvested crops, such as corn and soybeans, initial projections make normal allowances for abandonment and acres used for other purposes to derive a harvested area projection from the planted area estimate.

", "Final December Survey for Acreage and Yields", "A final survey\u2014drawn from the current field crop planting intentions for about 83,000 randomly selected farm operators\u2014is conducted during the first two weeks of December. These data provide season final estimates for planted and harvested area, yield per harvested acre, and production for summer crops and an initial estimate of winter wheat acres planted that fall. The December survey results for winter wheat plantings are reported in the Winter Wheat Seedings report, released in early January of the following year. The final estimates for area and yield for all other crops are reported in the Crop Production Annual Summary that is also released in early January of the following year.", "Appendix D. Crop Yield Methodology", "NASS uses two basic methods to forecast crop yield:", "1. Grower-reported yields ask growers what their yields were for each crop as part of the monthly agricultural yield survey, and 2. O bjective-yield measurement s take scientific field measurements of fruit count and weight to estimate yield. ", "Yield data from these two sources flows in to NASS headquarters as part of the monthly surveys. At NASS, the statisticians of the ASB convene to review regional yield indicators and determine an official yield forecast. Each member reviews all the data and brings his or her perspective to the collective review where the ASB reaches a consensus on the national yield forecast.", "Grower-Reported Yields", "A subsample of farmers who respond to the list portion of the June Agricultural Survey is selected to provide monthly crop yield projections through the remainder of the growing season. This provides a way to screen farmers so that only those currently growing the commodities of interest are contacted during the monthly surveys. This subsample may be supplemented with other known growers randomly selected from the list frame when monthly district level production forecasts are required for some states.", "The sampled farmers are asked what they expect their crops to yield before harvest, and in a later survey they are asked what their actual yields were after harvest. All yield data for an individual report are weighted by the farm's crop acres for harvest.", "Objective-Yield Surveys", "Under this second method, specially trained enumerators conduct direct field observations during the principal growing season for major crops. Objective yield surveys are conducted for five crops\u2014corn, soybean, cotton, winter wheat, and potatoes. Sample fields are selected from those farm operations identified in the area-frame sample portion of the June Agricultural Survey but focus on each commodity's major producing states\u2014that is, those states that contribute most heavily to total U.S. production ( Figure 2 ).", "These surveys provide information for making forecasts and estimates of crop yields based on counts, measurements, and weights obtained from small plots in a random sample of fields. Observations within each selected field are made in two randomly located plots. Plots include two or three adjacent rows of predetermined length. Measurements are made to determine row spacing so that conversions to yield per acre can be made. ", "The enumerators objectively measure yields by counting the crop's fruit in the field and assessing the fruit's weight and yield. Plant characteristics used as gross-yield prediction variables change as the crop maturity progresses. Figure D-1 shows the forecast variables used to predict the two gross yield components for each crop\u2014the fruit count and the weight per fruit. While the plant is in its early growth stages, plant counts may be the only data available for forecasting the number of mature fruit, and they are supplemented with historical averages of weight per fruit. Later, as the crop matures, actual fruit samples can be taken and lab measurements used to estimate the fruit's weight and yield per acre. The same sample plots are revisited each month during the growing season until the crop is mature and can be harvested. At harvest the final fruit counts and weights are obtained.", "The potential accuracy of each month's forecast for the major field crops is dependent on both the crop maturity at the time of the forecast and future weather. When maturity lags normal patterns, for example, the numbers of pods and ears are based on the numbers of plants and fruiting positions rather than actual number of fruit. Thus, when maturity lags, the forecasts become more variable because the expected number of fruit can differ from the final. However, the primary source of forecast error occurs when final end of season fruit weights differ from the historical average, because fruit weight cannot be fully determined until the crop matures.", "After the entire field has been harvested, the sample field is revisited and two more plots are laid out. These sample plots are gleaned to estimate the harvest loss. Also, once the harvest is complete, the farmers who operate the sample fields are recontacted to obtain final harvested acres and yields for all of the sample fields. ", "Harvested yield can be thought of as the gross yield minus harvest loss. Counts, measurements, and other observations from each sample plot are put into statistical models based on historical data to predict the final number of fruit and final weight per fruit. A forecast of gross yield is calculated by multiplying these two components together and dividing by land area. ", "Gross yield overstates the production that is actually harvested and marketed. Harvesting loss must be deducted to compute net yield. Initially, an adjustment is made for expected harvest losses based on past averages. Once the harvest is complete, the grain left on the ground in the sample plots is picked up (gleaned) and weighed to provide an estimate of the harvest loss.", "Appendix E.
