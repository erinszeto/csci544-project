The FY2004 request assumed $5 million in savings due to program offsets;and, for new activities, it included $13 million for the Youth Crime Gun InterdictionInitiative and $10 million to implement the Safe Explosives Act (Title XI, SubtitleC, of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ; 116 STAT. 2280)). ", "In addition, the ATF salaries and expenses language was amended in House full committee markup to include several limitations on the expenditure of ATF fundingprovided for FY2004. This language would have limited the ATF's authority toacquire certain firearm transfer records from licensed dealers pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 923(g)(5), unless such a request was part of a criminal investigation. In theConsolidated Appropriations Act, this language was modified to limit the ATF'sauthority generally to disclose certain information contained in firearm transferrecords and would prevent ATF from requiring licensed dealers to conduct physicalinventories of their businesses. As included in the House-passed bill, anotherprovision in the conference agreement would require the \"next-day\" destruction ofapproved firearm transfer records. ", "Federal Prison System. The Federal Prison System maintains 106 penal institutions nationwide, and contractswith state, local, and private concerns for additional detention space. TheAdministration projected that this system would house an average daily populationof 143,197 sentenced offenders in federal institutions, and another 28,043 in contractfacilities, in FY2003. For FY2004, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L.108-199 ) provides $4.862 billion for the Federal Prison System, an increase of nearly$418 million over the FY2003 enacted budget. The Senate-reported bill would haveprovided $4.222 billion in funding, while the House-passed bill would have provided$4.668 billion. The Administration requested $4.493 billion for the Federal PrisonSystem, an increase of nearly $48 million over the FY2003 enacted budget and $369million less than the Consolidated Appropriations Act. ", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $398 million for the construction, modernization, and repair of prison facilities in FY2004. TheSenate-reported bill would have provided $346 million, and the House-passed bill$203 million, for these purposes. For new activities in FY2004, the Administration'srequest included $252 million to activate new facilities, $23 million for acounterterrorism project, $13 million for contract confinement, and $427 thousandfor a transitional drug treatment program. The Administration intended to offsetthese budget increases with savings from $17 million in crosscutting efficiencies, $28million in no longer needed criminal alien detention, and $188 million rescindedfrom new construction funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act does notinclude this requested rescission.", "Office of Justice Programs. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the National Institute ofJustice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention, Office of Victims of Crimes, Bureau of Justice Assistance, and relatedgrant programs. For the Office of Justice Programs and related offices, bureaus andprograms, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ) provides$3.095 billion. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $2.631 billion, theHouse-passed bill would have provided $3.491 billion, as compared to theAdministration's revised FY2004 request of $2.331 billion. For FY2003, Congressappropriated $3.594 billion for OJP programs. ", "Several factors account for the difference in funding for FY2003, compared to the FY2004 Appropriations Act, the Senate and House bills, and the Administration'srequest. First, the Office of Domestic Preparedness was transferred from DOJ toDHS ($1 billion in FY2003 funding). Second, the Administration's FY2004 requestincluded no funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), forwhich Congress appropriated $248 million for FY2003. For FY2004, theConsolidated Appropriations Act provides $300 million for this program. TheSenate bill would have provided $250 million and the House bill, $400 million, forSCAAP. Third, the FY2004 request included no funding for COPS hiring andovertime ($200 million in FY2003 funding). The Consolidated Appropriations Actprovides $120 million, while the Senate-reported bill would have provided $200million, and the House-passed bill would have provided no funding for hiring andovertime. Fourth, the FY2004 request included a proposal to consolidate the LocalLaw Enforcement and Byrne grants, replacing them with a Justice Assistance Grantprogram, and reducing funding by about $437 million, compared to amountsappropriated for FY2003. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, the House, and theSenate bills do not reflect this proposal.", "The OJP budget has traditionally included the following accounts: (1) Justice Assistance, (2) State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, (3) Weed and Seedcrime prevention efforts, (4) Community Oriented Policing Services, (5) JuvenileJustice programs, and (6) Public Safety Officers Benefits. The ConsolidatedAppropriations Act breaks out Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grantprograms as an account separate from the State and Local Law EnforcementAssistance, however, the Senate-reported bill did not reflect this proposal.", "For FY2004, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $190 million for Justice Assistance, $1.298 billion for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance,$59 million for Weed and Seed, $756 million for Community Oriented PolicingServices, $388 million for VAWA programs, $353 million for Juvenile JusticeAssistance, and $52 million for Public Safety Officer Benefits.

The Justice Assistance account funds the operations of OJP bureaus and offices. Besides fundingOJP management and administration, this account also funds the National Instituteof Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, cooperative efforts that address missingchildren, and regional criminal intelligence. Congress appropriated nearly $200million for this account for FY2003. For FY2004, the Administration's request was$2.125 billion for this account, reflecting a proposed \"performance-based\"realignment of the bulk of OJP grant programs in the Justice Assistance accountunder the following program categories: ", "Counterterrorism Research and Development, ", "Improving the Criminal Justice System, ", "Research, Development, Evaluation and Statistics,", "Technology for Crime Identification, ", "Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System,", "Substance Abuse: Demand Reduction, and", "Services for Victims of Crime. ", "Under the Administration's proposal, COPS would be maintained as an account separate from Justice Assistance, but only 7 programs would continue to be fundedin the COPS account. Other COPS programs would be replaced or eliminated, whileat least seven other OJP administered COPS programs would be funded under theJustice Assistance account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, theSenate-reported bill and the House-passed bill do not reflect the Administration'sproposed budget realignment of OJP programs, however. ", "State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance. Under State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance ,the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $1.298 billion in funding. TheSenate-reported bill would have provided $1.461 billion, and the House-passed billwould have provided $1.641 billion. For various programs included in this account,the Administration's FY2004 request included about $748 million. For FY2003,Congress appropriated $2.031 billion. Two factors account for the lesser amountrequested by the Administration for FY2004. First, the Administration requested nofunding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program-- a program for whichCongress appropriated $250 million for FY2003. Second, the Administrationproposed consolidating the Byrne and Local Law Enforcement Assistance grantprograms in a new Justice Assistance Grant program, and requested $437 millionless in funding for FY2004 than previously appropriated for these programs forFY2003. For FY2004, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $300 millionfor SCAAP. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $250 million, while theHouse-passed bill would have provided $400 million for this program. For LocalLaw Enforcement Block Grants, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $225million. The Senate bill would have provided $150 million and the House bill, $400million. For Byrne grants, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $659million in funding. The Senate bill would have provided $589 million, the Housebill, $615 million. For Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants, theConsolidated Appropriations Act provides $388 million. The Senate-reported billwould have provided $406 million, the House-passed bill, $389 million.

For FY2004, theConsolidated Appropriations Act provides nearly $59 million, the same as theSenate-reported bill. The House-passed bill would have provided nearly $52 million. While Congress appropriated nearly $59 million for this program for FY2003, theAdministration requested no funding for the Weed and Seed program for FY2004.", "Community Oriented Policing Services. To enhance public safety, the Community OrientedPolicing Services (COPS) program provides grants to state, local, and tribalgovernments to expand community policing and cooperation between lawenforcement agencies and members of the community. The authority for the COPSgrant program lapsed at the end of FY2000. Congress, however, has continued tofund this program. For COPS, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $756.3million in funding, including $120 million for hiring. The Senate-reported bill wouldhave provided nearly $657 million for FY2004, including $200 million for COPShiring and overtime, as part of a school safety officer initiative. The House-passedbill would have provide $683 million for COPS. Unlike the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act and Senate bill, the House bill included no funding for COPShiring and overtime, nor did the Administration's request include funding for thisprogram. The Administration asserts that the program has served its purpose byassisting state and local law enforcement agencies in hiring or redeploying 117,000police officers from FY1994 through FY2002 at an expense of $7 billion. TheConsolidated Appropriations Act provides $30 million for the National CriminalHistory Improvement Program (NCHIP), The House-passed bill would have provided$57 million, the same amount requested by the Administration. The Senate billincluded no funding for this program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides$110 million for the DNA/Crime Lab Improvement program, of which $10 millionwould be for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science grant program. TheSenate-reported bill would have provided $19 million to the DNA initiative and $15million for the grant program.

The Consolidated AppropriationsAct provides nearly $353 million for Juvenile Justice Assistance programs. TheSenate-reported bill would have provided $232 million for these programs, theHouse-passed bill, $462 million. The Administration's revised request was $214million-- previously it was $235 million-- for FY2004.

", "At March 27, 2003, hearings before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on CJS, a Judiciary spokesman said that nearly two-thirds of the requested increasewas required to maintain current operations with pay and benefit adjustments,inflationary adjustments, increases in General Services Administration space rentalcosts, an increase in filled Article III judgeships, and continued security measures. The remaining one-third, he said, was primarily to provide for programmatic andworkload- related needs such as high-profile terrorist trials, an unprecedented numberof bankruptcy filings, and significant increases in the workload for probation andpretrial services officers. ", "In October 2003, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote to the chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees asking for a higher total appropriationfor the Judiciary than provided for in the CJS appropriations bills pending in theHouse and Senate. His letter focused on the Judiciary's Salaries and Expensesaccount, which, as noted above, received $3.79 billion in direct appropriations inFY2003.

Theplan, according to Judiciary officials, left many court units with no alternative butto cut staffing and curtail services. Formulated by the Executive Committee of theJudicial Conference, the plan was based upon a 4.7% increase over FY2003 fundingfor the Salaries and Expenses account, and on a 5.0% increase over FY2003 fundingfor the federal Judiciary as a whole.

In a \"Budget Facts and Figures\"synopsis on its internet web site (at http://www.uscourts.gov ), the Judiciarysaid thatthe 4.7% increase provided $4 billion for the Salaries and Expenses account, which,the Judiciary said, was $129 million below the amount needed to maintain courtstaffing levels. Also, it said, funding to make payments to private \"panel attorneys\"representing indigent defendants in federal criminal cases (appropriated in the Judiciary's Defender Services account), was inadequate and would run out threeweeks before the end of FY2004.

The institute is a private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts andconducts activities to further the development of judicial administration in statecourts throughout the United States. Under the terms of its enabling legislation, SJIis authorized to present its request directly to Congress, apart from the President'sbudget. For FY2004, the SJI requested $8 million, compared with $3 millionappropriated to it for FY2003. For its part, the President's FY2004 budget proposednothing for SJI. Subsequently, the House, in passing its FY2004 CJS appropriationsbill, provided $3 million for SJI. The Senate Appropriations Committeerecommended a $5 million appropriation. However, in its report, the Senatecommittee (at S. Rept. 108-144 , p. 178) earmarked all of the $5 million for specifiedstate projects, reserving no funds for salaries of SJI staff or for discretionary grantsby the Institute. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ),signed into law by the President on January 23, 2004, provides $2.25 million for theInstitute, with none of the funding earmarked. ", "In the FY2002 annual appropriations cycle, Congress had scaled back the Institute's funding significantly, approving $3.0 million, instead of $6.835 millionand $6.2 million approved earlier by the House and Senate respectively. The actionto reduce SJI funding occurred at the conference committee stage. In their report, theFY2002 conferees stated that the $3.0 million appropriated for the SJI was \"availablefor fiscal year 2002 only\" and that the conferees did not recommend continuedfederal support for the institute beyond FY2002. \"The termination of funding for thisprogram,\" the report explained, \"does not necessarily mean the dissolution of theInstitute.\" The conferees encouraged the institute to solicit private donations andresources from state and local agencies. Conferees for the FY2003 omnibus fundingbill, however, noted (in H.Rept. 108-10 ) that SJI had \"not been successful in itsefforts to obtain non-Federal funds\"; the conferees, therefore, had included $3 million\"to keep SJI operating.\" At the same time, the conferees encouraged SJI to continueto solicit donations from state, local, and national bar associations. ", "In its recommendations for FY2004, the House Appropriations Committee (at H. Rept. 108-221 , p. 156), said it understood that the Institute had continued tocontact bar associations and State court organizations. While \"these organizationssupport SJI, and enjoy grant funding and services from SJI,\" the committee said,\"they are not inclined to contribute to operations of the SJI beyond matching grantfunding for individual projects.\" The House committee encouraged SJI to apply forfunding from the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) in the Department of Justice,noting that a variety of grant programs to assist State courts exist within OJP. In asimilar vein, conferees for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (at H.Rept. 108-401 , at p. 642) encouraged SJI \"to work with the Office of JusticePrograms on issues involving State courts\" and \"to apply for funding under OJP grantprograms that support State court programs.\"", "Earlier, in November 2002, the Attorney General, as mandated by P.L. 107-179 , transmitted to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees a report on theeffectiveness of the institute in carrying out its statutory duties. The report concludedby stating, among other things, that SJI appeared \"to have been effective in awardinggrants to improve the quality of justice in the state courts, facilitating bettercoordination and information sharing between state and federal courts, and fosteringsolutions to common problems faced by all courts.\" ( See Report [of the AttorneyGeneral] on the State Justice Institute Pursuant to Public Law 107-179 , transmittedNovember 2002 to the Committee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, and Committee on theJudiciary, U.S. House of Representatives, available at: http://www.statejustice.org/attorney_general_evaluation.htm .)", "Commission on Civil Rights.
