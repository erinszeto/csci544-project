Officers receive training on how to identify an overdose and administer naloxone, and they carry the drug so they can respond immediately and effectively to an overdose. As of December 2016, over 1,200 police departments in 38 states had officers that carry naloxone. In addition, most states that have expanded access to naloxone have also provided immunity to those who possess, dispense, or administer the drug. Generally, immunity entails legal protections (for civilians) from arrest or prosecution and/or civil lawsuits for those who prescribe or dispense naloxone in good faith. ", "Another criminal justice adaptation is the enactment of what are known as \"Good Samaritan\" laws to encourage individuals to seek medical attention (for themselves or others) related to an overdose without fear of arrest or prosecution. In general, these laws prevent criminal prosecution for illegal possession of a controlled substance under specified circumstances. While these laws vary by state as to what offenses and violations are covered, as of June 2017, 40 states and the District of Columbia have some form of Good Samaritan overdose immunity law.", "Most states have drug diversion or drug court programs for criminal defendants and offenders with substance abuse issues, including opioid abuse. Some states view drug courts as a tool to address rising opioid abuse and have moved to further expand drug court options in the wake of the opioid epidemic. In August 2016, representatives from several states that have been confronted with high opioid overdose death rates convened for the Regional Judicial Opioid Summit. Part of these states' action plans to address opioid abuse was to expand drug courts and other court diversion and sentencing options that provide substance-abuse treatment and alternatives to incarceration. Further, in April 2017 NGA announced that eight states would participate in a \"learning lab\" to develop best practices for dealing with opioid abuse treatment for justice-involved populations\u2014including the expansion of opioid addiction treatment in drug courts.", "In recent years, several states have also enacted legislation increasing access to medication-assisted treatment for drug-addicted offenders who are incarcerated or have recently been released."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
