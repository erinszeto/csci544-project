{"id": "RL33146", "title": "Federal Voluntary Voting System Guidelines: Summary and Analysis of Issues", "released_date": "2005-11-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252 ) gave the federal ElectionAssistance Commission (EAC) the responsibility to develop a set of Voluntary Voting SystemGuidelines ( VVSG ) to replace the current voluntary Voting Systems Standards ( VSS ). The VVSG areto provide a set of specifications and requirements to be used in the certification of computer-assistedvoting systems, both paper-based and fully electronic. That was also the purpose of the VSS, whichwere developed in response to concerns raised about voting systems in the 1970s and 1980s. Moststates have adopted the VSS in whole or in part, and most are expected to adopt the VVSG, which arescheduled to go into effect two years after approval.", "The draft VVSG, a partial revision of the VSS, was released in June 2005 for a 90-daycomment period. Volume I provides performance guidelines for voting systems and is intended fora broad audience. It includes descriptions of functional requirements and performance standards,and requirements for vendors. The most extensive revisions are to the section on usability andaccessibility and the section on security of voting systems. Standards are also included for the useof voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT), a recent security measure developed in response toconcerns that electronic voting machines are vulnerable to tampering that might otherwise bedifficult to detect. Volume II provides details of the testing process for certification of votingsystems and has few revisions.", "Some issues associated with the VVSG have been controversial. Among them is the questionof timing. Some vendors claim that there needs to be more time for technology development beforethe new guidelines become effective; some activists argue that problems with voting systems, andHAVA provisions, demand more rapid implementation of the VVSG . In any event, it is generallyconsidered unlikely that the guidelines will have much direct impact on voting systems used in 2006,when HAVA requirements for voting systems go into effect. One exception may be the VVPATprovisions, since the VSS, under which most current voting systems are certified, have no provisionsrelating to this innovation. The VVSG will be voluntary, but some observers believe that a regulatoryapproach would be more appropriate given the importance of elections to the democratic process. However, since many states require that voting systems be certified, vendors are expected to treatthe VVSG in the same way they have treated the VSS -- as effectively mandatory.", "Among the other issues being debated about the guidelines are whether they should beexpanded to include voter registration systems, whether they impede innovation by focusing onintegrated systems rather than components, how to treat commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) productsthat are incorporated in voting systems, and whether a graded certification would be more effectivethan the current pass/fail approach. Several bills introduced in the 109th Congress could affect thescope or other aspects of the VVSG by requiring VVPAT or other security provisions, addressingconcerns about conflict of interest, and other measures. None have received committee or flooraction in either chamber during the first session. This report will be updated in response to majordevelopments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Context of the Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["The VSS were developed in response to concerns raised in the 1970s and 1980s about thethen largely unregulated voting technology industry. In 1977, an FEC advisory panel recommendedthe development of voluntary standards, following an FEC-requested study released in 1975 by theNational Bureau of Standards (renamed the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,in 1988). Two years later, Congress enacted legislation directing the FEC to perform a study on thematter in cooperation with the National Bureau of Standards. The study, submitted to Congress in1984, reaffirmed the advisory panel's recommendation, and the FEC received federal funding overthe next several years to develop the VSS; however, Congress did not establish the VSS specificallyby statute (see CRS Report RS21156 , Federal Voting Systems Standards and Guidelines:Congressional Deliberations , by by [author name scrubbed] for more detail about congressionaldeliberations). ", "The VSS were first released in 1990. They applied to computer-based voting systems --namely, punchcard, marksense (optical scan), and direct recording electronic (DRE) systems. Theywere developed for both hardware and software and included functional and documentationrequirements, performance characteristics, and testing procedures. No standards were developed forlever-machine or hand-counted paper ballot systems. ", "The FEC developed a plan to implement the VSS through cooperative action by the FEC,NIST, a set of laboratories that would be called the independent test authorities (ITAs), state andlocal governments, and voting system vendors. Under the plan, states would adopt the standards andthe ITAs would test voting systems to determine whether they met the standards. NIST's intendedrole was to assist in accreditation of the ITAs. However, the plan did not materialize as originallyconceived. Instead, the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), which wasestablished in 1989, appointed a voting systems board (1) to choose ITAs and administer a process for qualifying votingsystems under the VSS . The testing program began in 1994. NASED chose The Election Center,a professional organization of election officials, to serve as the secretariat for voting systemqualification. ", "States began adopting the VSS, with some requiring that voting systems be qualified underthe standards before being used in the state, and others adopting elements of the VSS into staterequirements. As implementation proceeded and technology continued to evolve, calls increased forrevising and updating the VSS . The FEC began a project to update the standards in 1997. Thesecond version was approved by the FEC in May 2002. The revision took a broader approach thanthe original version, focusing on the voting medium -- paper-based versus electronic -- rather thanspecific kinds of voting systems. It also included or expanded coverage of functions andrequirements not in the original version -- such as accessibility and some aspects of usability,telecommunications, and audit trails. ", "While this update was underway, Congress was considering legislation to respond to theproblems that arose in the November 2000 presidential election. The enacted version, HAVA, theHelp America Vote Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-252 ), was signed into law in October 2002. It includesvoting system requirements and an administrative structure for promulgating standards and certifyingsystems. The act established the EAC and assigned it responsibility for developing the VVSG. Italso created three bodies -- a Standards Board, a Board of Advisors, and a Technical GuidelinesDevelopment Committee (TGDC) -- to provide advice on standards and other matters; and it gaveNIST a substantial role. For example, it made the director of NIST the chair of the TGDC. Sec. 222of HAVA effectively renamed the VSS as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines ( VVSG ), (2) to be developed by the EACpursuant to recommendations by the TGDC and with support from NIST. Thus, HAVA provideda statutory basis for the VSS . HAVA does not direct the EAC to include any specific issues in theguidelines. However, in the debate on the House floor before passage of the HAVA conferenceagreement on October 10, 2002, a colloquy ( Congressional Record, daily ed., 148: H7842) stipulatedan interpretation that the guidelines specifically address the usability, accuracy, security,accessibility, and integrity of voting systems. Also, Sec. 221(e) requires NIST to provide supportto the TGDC for development of guidelines relating to security, voter privacy, human factors, remotevoting, and fraud detection and prevention. ", "The current VSS will serve as the guidelines until new ones are completed. Work ondevelopment of the first version of the VVSG, a partial revision of the VSS, began in 2004 with theappointment of the TGDC. That committee transmitted its recommendations, in the form of aproposed version 1 of the VVSG, to the EAC on May 12, 2005. After reviewing the recommendedguidelines and making some revisions, mostly but not entirely of an organizational nature, (3) the EAC released the draft VVSG on June 27, 2005, for a 90-day public comment period, with adoption initially anticipated inOctober 2005. (4) They willgo into effect two years after being adopted. (5) ", "HAVA also requires the EAC to provide for testing and certification of voting systems (\u00c2\u00a7231)by laboratories it has accredited, with support from NIST, thereby transferring that responsibilityfrom NASED. The act stipulates that the current system of NASED certification will continue untilthe EAC adopts its replacement. HAVA does not specify whether the guidelines it establishes areto be used as the standard against which voting systems are tested and certified, but that is how the VSS have been used, and it is how the EAC intends to use the VVSG . (6) ", "NIST began the process of soliciting applications for accreditation in June 2005, under itsNational Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). (7) It will make recommendationsthrough this program on accreditation of individual laboratories. Because of the length of theaccreditation process, in August the EAC adopted a resolution to provide temporary accreditationto the laboratories (ITAs) accredited by NASED.

Volume I provides performanceguidelines for voting systems and is intended for a broad audience. It includes descriptions offunctional requirements and performance standards, as well as requirements for vendors in qualityassurance and in configuration management, a complex discipline that involves ensuring that asystem and its components function in the ways they are specified to function under variousmodifications and throughout their life cycles. It includes an extensive glossary and references,suggested practices for election officials in some areas covered by the guidelines, and discussion ofverification concepts for future design of voting systems.

However, the discussion is not limited to issues raisedin the comments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technical Guidelines versus Regulatory Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The VVSG, like the VSS before them, are voluntary technical standards, not regulatoryrequirements. Such standards are usually developed through a consensus process. They are commonin industry, and federal law encourages their use by federal agencies. (13) Some observers believethat making standards voluntary at the federal level cannot ensure sufficient quality of voting systemsand that adherence should be mandatory or at least a condition of receiving any federal grants forvoting equipment. (14) Others state that mandatory standards would give too large a role to the federal government andreduce the flexibility of state and local governments to respond to their specific needs. They alsopoint out that most states have adopted the VSS in whole or in part -- many require that any newvoting systems purchased adhere to the VSS or VVSG . The practical effect of such state requirementsis that voting system vendors can successfully market systems only if they are certified under the VSS or VVSG . In this sense, the provisions have acquired some of the force of regulation, in that they aretreated by manufacturers as requirements. Comments by vendors often reflect that perception.", "HAVA addresses this controversy by establishing some specific requirements for votingsystems (Sec. 301), but leaving the method of implementation to the states (Sec. 305). The act islargely silent on the relationship between the VVSG and the Sec. 301 requirements. (15) The EAC is required toprovide guidance for implementing the requirements (Sec. 311--312), but the guidance is not atechnical standard and its use is also voluntary. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Standards Can and Cannot Do", "paragraphs": ["There are many different kinds of standards. They may be classified according topurpose -- e.g., product, process, testing, or interface standards. They can also be classifiedaccording to their focus -- commonly, a distinction is made between performance standards,which focus on function, and design standards, which specify features, dimensions, or othersuch characteristics. (16) A third classification is based on how standards aredeveloped and implemented. They may be developed through consensus or some otherprocess. They may be implemented voluntarily, or they may also be imposed, for example bylaw, and therefore mandatory. Standards may also be open or proprietary, but differentobservers define \"open standard\" somewhat differently. Some form of open standards is theapproach used typically by major standards organizations such as the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI). (17) ", "The VVSG and the VSS before them do not fall neatly into any one of the abovecategories. They combine product, process, and testing requirements. They are intended tobe performance-based, but in some cases they provide fairly specific design details. That hasbeen criticized by some observers as not providing sufficient flexibility for innovation, butit has been praised by others as providing more precise requirements. The VVSG have alsobeen criticized, on the one hand, for being too precise and detailed, and on the other, for beingtoo vague and ambiguous. (18) Also, they are voluntary at the federal level but mandatoryin a number of states. Finally, the process of development of the VSS might best be describedas having been only partially open. With the involvement of NIST and the various EACboards and committees, the development of the VVSG is arguably more closely akin to atypical consensus process for standards development. ", "Properly designed standards can provide a clear baseline of expected performance. In conjunction with a well-implemented certification program, they can provide assurancesto all parties that voting systems will operate according to specifications. The VSS and theNASED certification program are widely credited with having greatly improved theperformance of voting systems in several areas, such as reliability and accuracy. ", "However, standards can address only those issues that were considered by thedevelopers, and the way that the standards are developed and implemented can also affect theway issues are addressed. Those factors can lead to at least two kinds of problems. First,specifications and testing might not reflect real-world conditions. That has been a criticismof the VSS and especially certification testing, which was done in a laboratory testingenvironment rather than realistically simulated election conditions. Thus, consideration oferror rates in the 1990 VSS was limited to machine error and did not take into account the kindof voter error that became such a central issue in the 2000 presidential election. ", "Second, standards may not be able to anticipate changed conditions. This is especiallytrue for rapidly evolving information technology. For example, the security weaknesses foundover the past few years in some DREs (19) were discovered in systems that had been certified underthe VSS . (20) Those 1990 standards could not anticipate the rapid evolution of information technology andthe kinds of security threats to which it would be subjected. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Development Process for the VVSG", "paragraphs": ["HAVA created a relatively complex process for the development of the VVSG . Proposed guidelines are developed by a technical committee chaired by the director of NIST. Those are then considered by two EAC boards -- the Standards Board, consisting of state andlocal election officials from all the states, and the Board of Advisors, consisting ofrepresentatives of various groups specified in the act -- and finally, by the EACcommissioners, after a public comment period. ", "Even without that complexity, the development of standards can involve lengthydeliberations. That is especially true for consensus standards, (21) but even the twoversions of the VSS took years to develop. International standards are often updated on athree- to five-year cycle. HAVA does not specify an updating cycle for the VVSG, althoughSec. 215(a)(2) requires the Standards Board and the Board of Advisors to meet at least oncea year \"for purposes of voting on the voluntary voting system guidelines referred to it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6,\" andSec. 301(c) requires that guidance for the implementation of requirements be updated everyfour years. The first version of the VVSG, currently under EAC consideration, is notanticipated to go into effect until two years after adoption. (22) That implies aninitial revision cycle of at least two years, although the TGDC has already begun work on thesecond version. ", "Some observers believe that a four-year development cycle is desirable, to permitsystems to be used for two federal election cycles without requiring recertification. Othershave criticized the process for development of the VVSG as being too slow and cumbersome,given the rapid development of information technology and associated issues. Others pointout that rapid development and frequent revision could create serious financial and logisticaldifficulties for both vendors and election officials in trying to conform to the guidelines, aswell as having a potentially negative impact on the quality of any revisions. This issue hasbeen raised not only with respect to the release and effective date of the current VVSG draft,but also subsequent revisions. There appears to be an inherent conflict in responsiveness ofthe guidelines to, on the one hand, evolving needs and technology and, on the other, time andcost constraints inherent in responding appropriately to such changes. Achieving the rightbalance between them is likely to be difficult.", "The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a professional group involved in theevolution of Internet architecture, has addressed the challenge of rapid development andchange by creating a system for developing standards that is performed largely online. Interested parties form a working group that is completely open to anyone interested. Thereis no active attempt by the IETF to guarantee a balance among different interests. The groupidentifies the scope of a standard and begins developing it. Drafts are posted online andcomments incorporated. Once the group reaches a rough consensus, the draft is sent to theInternet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for independent review, after which the draft maybecome a standard through some additional steps. (23) According to some observers, the use of such a fully open,online process, rough consensus, and independent review results in \"cleaner\" standards anda more rapid process than the more traditional approach. Whether the method could beadapted for the VVSG is not clear, especially given the complexities inherent in both the goalsof the guidelines and much voting technology. An attempt to use such an approach has beendeveloped for the purpose of creating performance ratings for voting systems but has not yetled to any public results. (24) ", "Another issue has to do with how other accepted standards are used and incorporatedin the VVSG . For example, the draft guidelines reference many NIST standards publicationsthat are generally designed for use by federal agencies under the Federal Information SecurityManagement Act (FISMA). (25) Some observers argue that product standards such as theCommon Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408), which provides a set of evaluation criteria for the securityof information technology, (26) would be more appropriate. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certification Process", "paragraphs": ["The development of plans for certification testing is also an issue. Volume II of the VVSG specifies that testing laboratories are to develop explicit plans for the certificationtesting. Some observers believe that those plans, like the VVSG itself, should be public andthat opportunities for public comment should be given before they are finalized. However,since the plans are to be designed for each submitted system and based on the data providedby the vendor, it is not clear that public disclosure would be possible without releasingproprietary information. Similar concerns have been raised with respect to the call from someobservers that the results of the certification testing be made publicly available. Some arguethat making such information public would be a disincentive to investment and innovationby industry. Others disagree and state further that, given the important role that votingsystems play in the democratic process, the public trust is best served by full disclosure.", "Some observers have also raised questions about the methods for determining howtesting laboratories are chosen. Under the NASED process, there has been little to nocompetition among different laboratories. Critics have expressed concern that the result hasbeen higher costs for certification testing and barriers to the timely certification of systemsfrom smaller, innovative manufacturers. The NVLAP accreditation process being developedunder EAC auspices is expected to address such concerns by increasing the number oflaboratories involved. However, this approach has also been criticized: \"[W]hen testingauthorities compete against each other for business, a vendor can select the authorities mostfavorable to its products or negotiate for advantageous testing procedures.\" (27) Those critics arguethat government or nonprofit testing centers would be a better approach. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Scope and Features of Revisions in the VVSG", "paragraphs": ["The VSS were criticized for inadequately addressing usability, security, administrativeprocedures and practices, performance in actual use, voter registration systems, and otheraspects of election administration. Those criticisms have been partially addressed in the VVSG . As described in the section above summarizing the guidelines, the TGDC decided toproduce only a partial revision of the VSS as the first version of the VVSG . Except for newsections on human factors (usability and accessibility) and security, and the addition of somenew appendices, the VVSG is largely unchanged from the 2002 version of the VSS . ", "The two major areas of revision are arguably the most important for immediate action,since usability and accessibility are major focuses of HAVA voting system requirements, andsecurity concerns have been prominent in recent public debate about voting systems,especially DREs. Some observers welcome this restricted focus, believing that limitedchanges are more likely to be implementable in the short term. Others, however, believe thatbroader changes to the VSS are more urgently needed and that the draft VVSG should havebeen more thoroughly revised with more stringent requirements. Some believe that an\"end-to-end\" or \"life cycle\" approach is needed, and that standards or guidelines should bedeveloped for technology, procedures, and personnel across all entities involved in electionadministration, ranging from developers and manufacturers of voting systems to pollworkers. It is not yet clear to what extent future versions of the VVSG may take such an approach. Stillother observers have expressed concerns that the first version of the VVSG has created morenew requirements for certification than is prudent for an interim document, which is intendedto be followed by a more complete revision. (28) Those observers propose delaying adoption of the VVSG until it can be thoroughly revised. (29) ", "Yet others believe that the added provisions are inadequate to meet accessibility,alternative language, and security needs and that broader and more stringent requirements areneeded. For example, some of the provisions in the sections on human factors and securityhave been criticized for being recommendations rather than requirements, the concern beingthat they do not therefore ensure full compliance with HAVA's accessibilityrequirements. (30) There is also concern among some that the VVSG do not adequately cover the full range ofdisabilities as required by HAVA. Disabilities that are specifically addressed relate to vision,dexterity, mobility, hearing, speech, and cognitive function, although little to no detail isprovided for the last two. There are several different ways to categorize disabilities, and the VVSG provide neither a source for the list used nor any indication of how exhaustive it isintended to be. The guidelines also state, \"As a practical matter, there may be a small numberof voters whose disabilities are so severe that they will need personal assistance.\" (31) ", "The revised security provisions have also raised questions among some observers. Forexample, some state-sponsored studies used penetration testing -- deliberate attempts to breakinto voting systems -- in attempting to address security issues associated with votingsystems. (32) Thisis a fairly common technique in security testing, and some observers believe that it should berequired by the guidelines. Other observers have expressed concern that some of the differentrequirements may be conflicting -- that meeting one will require violating another. ", "Some have also pointed to concerns about specific elements of the VSS that were notexamined by the TGDC. One particularly contentious provision is the requirement thatfailures occur no more often than every 163 hours of use. (33) Some observersargue that this is far too low, permitting 10% of precinct-based electronic systems to failduring an election. (34) Others argue that the more relevant standard is availability-- which stipulates that the time it takes to repair a system must be short enough that it isavailable 99% of the time it is needed. However, availability is tested under laboratoryconditions, and in practice may depend on factors such as whether someone is present at thepolling place who can effect any needed repairs. Therefore, a system that achieves anavailability score greater than 99% in testing might not achieve that level in actual use. ", "Whether the VVSG should include management guidelines for election administratorsis also a matter of some dispute. In the current draft, best practice recommendations havebeen placed in an appendix, whereas they were in the numbered sections in the TGDCrecommendation document. Their removal to an appendix eliminates any ambiguity withrespect to their role, or lack of it, in the certification process. However, the development ofa set of administration or management sections in future versions of the VVSG could raise thequestion of whether certification protocols should be developed for election administration. That possibility may be worthy of consideration, but it could require an additional certificationmechanism for election jurisdictions as well as vendors, depending on the focus of themanagement requirements.

(37) Inaddition, the VVSG are not scheduled to go into effect until two years after adoption -- thatis, no sooner than fall 2007. Until that time, federal certification of voting systems willpresumably continue to be based on the 2002 VSS, although state or local jurisdictions maychoose to require vendors to meet some or all of the VVSG requirements sooner, and the EACplans to issue guidelines to assist states in implementation. (38) That may beespecially important for those jurisdictions that require a voter-verifiable paper audit trail foruse with DREs, since that option is not covered by the VSS but is covered by the VVSG . ", "Some observers have expressed concern that uncertainties about the VVSG development and implementation have resulted in delays by states in procuring new votingsystems to meet HAVA requirements. Among the reasons are worries about acquiring newsystems in time for the January 2006 deadline that might later be deemed not to be incompliance with the requirements, or not obtaining systems of as high a level of quality aswould be possible once the VVSG go into effect. Similarly, some observers are concerned thatsystems in use that were certified under the VSS but not the VVSG could be effectivelydecertified once certification under the VVSG begins. Those concerns are amplified byuncertainties with respect to federal funding for future acquisitions. One proposed solutionis for the EAC to advise jurisdictions that systems conforming to the 2002 VSS will satisfyHAVA requirements. However, that version of the VSS was released before HAVA wasenacted, and since the EAC has no regulatory authority, it is not clear what effect such advicewould have. Other observers believe that delaying the implementation of the VVSG meansthat the 2006 federal election will need to be conducted with voting systems that are notdesigned to conform to HAVA requirements.

Some observers argue that this restriction stifles innovation by requiring that thosevendors who wish to market devices that can be used with existing voting systems negotiateagreements with voting-system vendors before certification of their components. However,such agreements may be difficult to obtain before a component is certified or may entailrestriction on the use of the component to only one brand of voting system.

In addition, some commercial software,such as Microsoft Windows, has become standard, with computer hardware developedspecifically to work with it. However, vendors have no control over how the COTS softwareis coded, and the code may be very complex. Code examination is not required under the VVSG for unmodified COTS software, and general-purpose software such as operatingsystems may be exempt from detailed examination. Some observers object to this exemption,arguing that it creates unacceptable security risks. Others believe that the guidelines shouldprohibit the use of COTS software altogether (although presumably they are referring to itsuse in a voting or counting machine, not in back-office computers used in such tasks as ballotpreparation).

Still others believe that the VVSG should provide more stringentrequirements with respect to what kinds of data should be recorded by voting systems foraudit purposes. In any case, the trend at the state level toward requiring the use of VVPATto address security issues is raising significant questions about whether such requirements canbe reconciled with HAVA accessibility requirements under the constraints imposed by currenttechnology.
