Pipelines may also be vulnerable to \"cyber-attacks\" on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems or attacks on electricity grids and communications networks. Oil and gas pipelines, globally, have been a favored target of terrorists, militant groups, and organized crime. In Colombia, for example, rebels have bombed the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n oil pipeline and other pipelines over 950 times since 1993. In 1996, London police foiled a plot by the Irish Republican Army to bomb gas pipelines and other utilities across the city. Militants in Nigeria have repeatedly attacked pipelines and related facilities, including the simultaneous bombing of three oil pipelines in May 2007. A Mexican rebel group similarly detonated bombs along Mexican oil and natural gas pipelines in July and September 2007. In June 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested members of a terrorist group planning to attack jet fuel pipelines and storage tanks at the John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport in New York. Natural gas pipelines in British Columbia, Canada, were bombed six times between October 2008 and July 2009 by unknown perpetrators. In 2009, the Washington Post reported that over $1 billion of crude oil had been stolen directly from Mexican pipelines by organized criminals and drug cartels.", "Since September 11, 2001, federal warnings about Al Qaeda have mentioned pipelines specifically as potential terror targets in the United States. One U.S. pipeline of particular concern, and with a history of terrorist and vandal activity, is the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), which transports crude oil from Alaska's North Slope oil fields to the marine terminal in Valdez. TAPS runs some 800 miles and delivered approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day in 2011 (over 10% of U.S. domestic oil production). In 1999, Vancouver police arrested a man planning to blow up TAPS for personal profit in oil futures. In 2001, a vandal's attack on TAPS with a high-powered rifle forced a two-day shutdown and caused extensive economic and ecological damage. In January 2006, federal authorities acknowledged the discovery of a detailed posting on a website purportedly linked to Al Qaeda that reportedly encouraged attacks on U.S. pipelines, especially TAPS, using weapons or hidden explosives. In November 2007 a U.S. citizen was convicted of trying to conspire with Al Qaeda to attack TAPS and a major natural gas pipeline in the eastern United States.

[with] no specific or credible threat information indicating that violent transnational extremist groups or domestic extremists are actively plotting to conduct attacks on the U.S. pipeline industry.\" Terrorist activities are in constant flux, however, and difficult to predict, so terrorist attacks remain a possibility in the future. Although Al Qaeda attacks on U.S. pipelines may be perceived as unlikely, attacks by individuals not associated with organized or terrorist groups may be a growing concern. For example, in August 2011, federal agents arrested a U.S. citizen\u2014acting alone\u2014who confessed to planting an improvised explosive device (which failed to detonate) under a natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma.

According to the agency, various pipeline companies described targeted spear-phishing attempts and intrusions into multiple natural gas pipeline sector organizations \"positively identified \u2026 as related to a single campaign. \" In 2011, computer security company McAfee reported similar \"coordinated covert and targeted\" cyberattacks originating primarily in China against global energy companies. The attacks began in 2009 and involved spear-phishing, exploitation of Microsoft software vulnerabilities, and the use of remote administration tools to collect sensitive competitive information about oil and gas fields. In 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm was first identified as a threat to industrial control systems. Although the Stuxnet software initially spreads indiscriminately, the software includes a highly specialized industrial process component targeting specific Siemens industrial SCADA systems. Computer security specialists claim that malicious software developers have already created new software programs tailored to target the kinds of SCADA system weaknesses revealed by Stuxnet.

Under both statutes, the Transportation Secretary is given primary authority to regulate key aspects of interstate pipeline safety: design, construction, operation and maintenance, and spill response planning. Pipeline safety regulations are covered in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations . The DOT administers pipeline regulations through the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) within the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). At the end of FY2012, PHMSA employed 203 total staff, including 135 inspection and enforcement staff. In addition to its own staff, PHMSA's enabling legislation allows the agency to delegate authority to intra state pipeline safety offices, and allows state offices to act as \"agents\" administering inter state pipeline safety programs (excluding enforcement) for those sections of inter state pipelines within their boundaries. Approximately 350 state pipeline safety inspectors were available in 2012.", "PHMSA's pipeline safety program is funded primarily by user fees assessed on a per-mile basis on each regulated pipeline operator. P.L. 109-468 authorized annual pipeline safety program expenditures of $79.0 million in FY2007, $86.2 million in FY2008, $91.5 million in FY2009, and $96.5 million in FY2010. P.L. 112-90 authorizes expenditures of $109.3 million annually for each of FY2012 through FY2015, and $1.5 million annually through FY2015 for state pipeline damage prevention programs. The President's FY2013 budget requested $177 million.", "PHMSA uses a variety of strategies to promote compliance with its safety standards. The agency conducts programmatic inspections of management systems, procedures, and processes; conducts physical inspections of facilities and construction projects; investigates safety incidents; and maintains a dialogue with pipeline operators. The agency clarifies its regulatory expectations through published protocols and regulatory orders, guidance manuals, and public meetings. PHMSA relies upon a range of enforcement actions, including administrative actions such as corrective action orders (CAOs) and civil penalties, to ensure that operators correct safety violations and take measures to preclude future safety problems. Between January 1 and November 8, 2012, PHMSA initiated 244 enforcement actions against pipeline operators. Civil penalties proposed by PHMSA for safety violations during this period totaled approximately $8.3 million. PHMSA also conducts accident investigations and system-wide reviews focusing on high-risk operational or procedural problems and areas of the pipeline near sensitive environmental areas, high-density populations, or navigable waters.", "Since 1997, PHMSA has increasingly required industry's implementation of \"integrity management\" programs on pipeline segments near \"high consequence areas.\" Integrity management provides for continual evaluation of pipeline condition; assessment of risks to the pipeline; inspection or testing; data analysis; and follow-up repair; as well as preventive or mitigative actions. High consequence areas include population centers, commercially navigable waters, and environmentally sensitive areas, such as drinking water supplies or ecological reserves. The integrity management approach directs priority resources to locations of highest consequence rather than applying uniform treatment to the entire pipeline network. PHMSA made integrity management programs mandatory for most oil pipeline operators with 500 or more miles of regulated pipeline as of March 31, 2001 (49 C.F.R. \u00a7195)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOT Pipeline Security Activities", "paragraphs": ["Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), issued during the Clinton Administration, assigned lead responsibility for pipeline security to the DOT.

In 2002, the OPS conducted a vulnerability assessment to identify critical pipeline facilities and worked with industry groups and state pipeline safety organizations \"to assess the industry's readiness to prepare for, withstand and respond to a terrorist attack.\" Together with the Department of Energy and state pipeline agencies, the OPS promoted the development of consensus standards for security measures tiered to correspond with the five levels of threat warnings issued by the Office of Homeland Security. The OPS also developed protocols for inspections of critical facilities to ensure that operators implemented appropriate security practices. To convey emergency information and warnings, the OPS established communication links to key staff at the most critical pipeline facilities throughout the country. The OPS also began identifying near-term technology to enhance deterrence, detection, response, and recovery, and began seeking to advance public and private sector planning for response and recovery.", "On September 5, 2002, the OPS circulated guidance developed in cooperation with the pipeline industry defining the agency's security program recommendations and implementation expectations. This guidance recommended that operators identify critical facilities, develop security plans consistent with prior trade association security guidance, implement these plans, and review them annually. Although the guidance was voluntary, the OPS expected compliance and informed operators of its intent to begin reviewing security programs within 12 months, potentially as part of more comprehensive safety inspections.

Among other provisions, the act transferred to DHS the Transportation Security Administration from the DOT (\u00a7403). On December 17, 2003, President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), clarifying executive agency responsibilities for identifying, prioritizing, and protecting critical infrastructure. HSPD-7 maintains DHS as the lead agency for pipeline security (par. 15), and instructs the DOT to \"collaborate in regulating the transportation of hazardous materials by all modes (including pipelines)\" (par. 22h). The order requires that DHS and other federal agencies collaborate with \"appropriate private sector entities\" in sharing information and protecting critical infrastructure (par. 25).

During the reviews, TSA evaluates whether each company is following the intent of the OPS security guidance, and seeks to collect the list of assets each company had identified meeting the criteria established for critical facilities. In 2004, the DOT reported that the plans reviewed to date (approximately 25) had been \"judged responsive to the OPS guidance.\" TSA has completed CSRs covering the largest 100 pipeline systems (84% of total U.S. energy pipeline throughput) and is in the process of conducting second CSRs of these systems. According to TSA, CSR results indicate that the majority of U.S. pipeline systems \"do a good job with pipeline security\" although there are areas in which pipeline security can be improved. Past CSR reviews have identified inadequacies in some company security programs such as not updating security plans, lack of management support, poor employee involvement, inadequate threat intelligence, and employee apathy or error. In 2008, the TSA initiated its Critical Facility Inspection Program (CFI), under which the agency conducted in-depth inspections of all the critical facilities of the 125 largest pipeline systems in the United States.

Canadian officials and other stakeholders have rejected these arguments, however, citing factual inaccuracies and a flawed methodology in the NRDC analysis, which compares pipeline spill rates in Canada to those in the United States.", "Some in Congress have called for a review of PHMSA regulations to determine whether new regulations for Canadian heavy crudes are needed to account for any unique properties they may have. Accordingly, P.L. 112-90 requires PHMSA to review whether current regulations are sufficient to regulate pipelines transmitting \"diluted bitumen,\" and analyze whether such oil presents an increased risk of release (\u00a716). This study, which is being performed by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences, has not yet been completed.

By initiating this voluntary approach, PHMSA sought to speed adoption of security measures by industry and avoid the publication of sensitive security information (e.g., critical asset lists) that would normally be required in public rulemaking. Provisions in P.L. 109-468 require the DOT Inspector General to \"address the adequacy of security standards for gas and oil pipelines\" (\u00a723(b)(4)). P.L. 110-53 similarly directs TSA to promulgate pipeline security regulations and carry out necessary inspection and enforcement\u2014if the agency determines that regulations are appropriate (\u00a71557(d)). Addressing this issue, the 2008 IG report states that", "TSA's current security guidance is not mandatory and remains unenforceable unless a regulation is issued to require industry compliance.... PHMSA and TSA will need to conduct covert tests of pipeline systems' vulnerabilities to assess the current guidance as well as the operators' compliance.", "Although TSA's FY2005 budget justification stated that the agency would \"issue regulations where appropriate to improve the security of the [non-aviation transportation] modes,\" the agency has not done so for pipelines, and it is not currently working on such regulations. The pipeline industry has long expressed concern that new security regulations and related requirements may be \"redundant\" and \"may not be necessary to increase pipeline security.\" The PHMSA Administrator, in 2007, similarly testified that enhancing security \"does not necessarily mean that we must impose regulatory requirements.\" TSA officials have questioned the IG assertions regarding pipeline security regulations, particularly the IG's call for covert testing of pipeline operator security measures. They have argued that the agency is complying with the letter of P.L. 110-53 and that its pipeline operator security reviews are more than paper reviews. In accordance with P.L. 110-53 (\u00a71557 (b)), TSA has been implementing a multi-year program of pipeline system inspections, including documentation of findings and follow up reviews. Because the TSA believes the most critical U.S. pipeline systems generally meet or exceed industry security guidance, the agency believes it achieves better security with voluntary guidelines, and maintains a more cooperative and collaborative relationship with its industry partners as well.", "Although the TSA believes its voluntary approach to pipeline security is adequate, Canadian pipeline regulators have come to a different conclusion. In 2010 the National Energy Board of Canada mandated security regulations for jurisdictional Canadian petroleum and natural gas pipelines, some of which are cross-border pipelines serving export markets in the United States. A number of companies operate pipelines in both countries. In announcing these new regulations, the board stated that it had considered adopting the existing security standards \"as guidance\" rather than an enforceable standard, but \"taking into consideration the critical importance of energy infrastructure protection,\" the board decided to adopt the standard into the regulations. Establishing pipeline security regulations in Canada is not completely analogous to doing so in the United States, as the Canadian pipeline system is much smaller and operated by far fewer companies than the U.S. system. Nonetheless, Canada's choice to regulate pipeline security may raise questions as to why the United States has not. In its oversight of potential pipeline security regulations, Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of the current voluntary pipeline security standards based on findings from the TSA's CSR reviews, pipeline inspections, DHS cybersecurity alerts, and any future DOT Inspector General reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Issues", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the issues mentioned above, Congress may consider several issues related to proposed legislation or otherwise raised by pipeline stakeholders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accuracy and Completeness of Pipeline System Records", "paragraphs": ["On January 3, 2011, as a response to its initial investigation of the San Bruno pipeline accident, the NTSB issued urgent new safety recommendations \"to address record-keeping problems that could create conditions in which a pipeline is operated at a higher pressure than the pipe was built to withstand.\" The NTSB issued these recommendations after it had concluded that there were significant errors in the records characterizing the San Bruno pipeline, and that \"other pipeline operators may have discrepancies in their records that could potentially compromise the safe operation of pipelines throughout the United States.\" PHMSA officials have also testified that some operators may not be collecting all the pipeline system data necessary to fully evaluate safety and compliance with federal regulations. In 2006, questions were raised about the accuracy of pipeline location data provided by operators and maintained by PHMSA in the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). At the time, agency officials reportedly acknowledged limitations in NPMS accuracy, but did not publicly discuss plans to address them. P.L. 112-90 authorizes PHMSA to collect additional geospatial and technical data from pipeline operators to achieve the purposes of the NPMS (\u00a711(a) and \u00a712).

In its San Bruno accident investigation report, the NTSB has recommended that all natural gas transmission pipelines be configured to accommodate such internal inspection tools. However, experts note that there are different pipeline inspection techniques with overlapping capabilities and different strengths. While an effective technology for detecting corrosion in many applications, smart pigs have limitations as a general tool for assessing the integrity of pipelines. For example, although smart pigs may be good corrosion detectors, they are still a developing technology and may be somewhat less effective in detecting other types of pipeline anomalies (e.g., cracks). Operators also maintain that smart pigging may be less useful for predicting future problems with pipeline integrity than other federally approved maintenance techniques like \"direct assessment\" (49 C.F.R. 192.903) wherein pipelines are examined externally based on risk data and other factors. Furthermore, because many older pipelines contain sharp turns and other obstructions due to historical construction techniques, they cannot accommodate smart pig devices without significant and costly pipeline modifications to make them more \"piggable.\" Consequently, some industry stakeholders caution against unrealistic expectations for the capabilities of smart pigs as a stand-alone pipeline inspection tool. ", "As an alternative to internal inspection where such inspection cannot currently be performed, some policy makers have called for mandatory hydrostatic testing of pipelines to verify their integrity. Hydrostatic testing involves filling a pipeline with water under pressure greater than the anticipated operating pressure to determine if it is structurally sound and does not leak. Such testing is common for new pipelines that have not yet entered service. Because it uses only water, hydrostatic testing poses relatively little direct risk to the public or the environment, but when used for operating pipelines it necessarily interrupts pipeline service. Injecting water into pipelines is also costly, and may create safety problems since water is corrosive and may be difficult to remove completely from a pipeline once testing is completed. Nonetheless, as noted above, the NTSB has recommended that all natural gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 be subjected to hydrostatic pressure tests. P.L. 112-90 requires verification of maximum allowable operating pressure for all natural gas transmission pipelines \"as expeditiously as economically feasible\" (\u00a723(a)). The act also authorizes regulations for pressure verification that \"shall consider \u2026 pressure testing; and ... other alternative methods, including in-line inspections\" (\u00a723(a)).

Operators reportedly have resisted such disclosures on the grounds that their emergency response plans contain confidential customer and employee information. They also raise concerns that the plans contain security-sensitive information about pipeline vulnerabilities and spill scenarios which could be useful to terrorists. P.L. 112-90 requires PHMSA to collect and maintain copies of pipeline emergency plans for public availability excluding any proprietary or security-sensitive information (\u00a76(a)).

Because the four-foot requirement appears to have been insufficient to prevent riverbed pipeline exposure in this case, some policy makers have called for a review of pipeline river crossings and associated safety requirements nationwide. P.L. 112-90 mandates a review of the adequacy of PHMSA regulations with respect to pipelines that cross inland bodies of water at least 100 feet wide and, based on the review's findings, requires PHMSA to develop legislative recommendations for changing existing regulations (\u00a728(a)).

Likewise, the threat of physical and cyberattack on U.S. pipeline infrastructure remains a concern. The NTSB has identified improvement of federal pipeline safety oversight as a \"top ten\" priority for 2013. The leading pipeline industry associations have concurred. The American Gas Association has expressed support for these NTSB recommendations, stating that \"pipeline safety and integrity is the top priority for the natural gas industry.\" The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) has stated that \"INGAA members are addressing all of the issues that the NTSB has outlined ... and more.\" The Association of Oil Pipe Lines has also welcomed the NTSB's focus on pipeline safety, stating that \"operators are hard at work on safety improvements suggested by NTSB, PHMSA and their own initiatives.\" Whether the renewed efforts by industry, combined with additional oversight by federal agencies, will further enhance the safety and security of U.S. pipelines remains to be seen.", "As Congress oversees the federal pipeline safety program and the federal role in pipeline security, key issues of focus may be pipeline agency staff resources, automatic pipeline shutoff valves, penalties for safety violations, safety regulations for oil sands crudes, and the possible need for pipeline security regulations, among other concerns. In addition to these specific issues, Congress may assess how the various elements of U.S. pipeline safety and security activity fit together in the nation's overall strategy to protect transportation infrastructure. Pipeline safety and security necessarily involve many groups: federal agencies, oil and gas pipeline associations, large and small pipeline operators, and local communities. Reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
