If the President does not report that Iraq has achieved the goals, the bill directs the Secretary of Defense to begin redeploying troops out of Iraq by July 1, 2007, with a goal of completing the redeployment within 180 days (i.e., by the end of December, 2007). If the President determines that Iraq has met the benchmarks, the bill requires redeployment to begin by October 1, 2007, with a goal of completing the redeployment within 180 days from then (i.e., by the end of March, 2008). The end-dates for withdrawal are not binding. After redeployment, the bill permits U.S. troops to be deployed in Iraq only to protect U.S. citizens and facilities; for customary diplomatic purposes; for targeted, limited-duration missions against global terrorist organizations; and to train and equip Iraqi security forces. Military readiness standards: The bill includes House-passed provisions requiring that the President either certify that military units have achieved goals for unit readiness and time between deployments before being deployed or waive the requirement. Conditions on economic aid to Iraq : The agreement prohibits obligation of half the aid provided to Iraq by the bill in the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) accounts until Iraq meets political benchmarks and commits $10 billion to reconstruction. The final version of H.R. 2206 expands on these benchmarks. Closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center : The House bill prohibited closure of Walter Reed, while the Senate bill permitted closure only after the Secretary of Defense certified that alternative facilities in Bethesda and elsewhere were operational. The conference agreement prohibits closure until alternatives are available and also requires funding in the interim sufficient to maintain provide an undiminished quality of care, including funding for facility renovation and maintenance. Minimum wage increase and offsetting tax cuts: The agreement also provided an increase in the minimum wage and a package of $4.8 billion over 10 years of offsetting tax cuts for small businesses.", "On defense spending, highlights of the conference agreement included:", "Amounts provided: The bill provided a total of $100.3 billion for the Department of Defense, of which $95.5 billion is for programs in the regular defense appropriations bill and $4.8 billion is for programs in the military construction appropriations bill. In all, the bill adds about $7 billion to the Administration request, of which almost $4 billion is in the regular bill and $3.1 billion, for base closure, is in military construction. Major additions: The bill adds $2.1 billion for defense health programs, $2 billion for a readiness reserve fund, include $1 billion for the National Guard, $1.1 billion for housing allowances, and $1.2 billion (in addition to $1.8 billion requested) for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. Initial information on the conference agreement provided initially by the House Appropriations Committee did not identify offsetting reductions compared to the request. Funding for Iraq contractors: The bill does not include a House provision to reduce funding for payments to contractors by $815 million. Base Realignment and Closure Funds: The military construction funding includes $3.1 billion for Base Realignment and Closure, which restores funds that Congress deleted from the FY2007 continuing resolution as an offset for increased non-defense spending. Transfers of defense funds: The Administration requested two provisions to increase the amount of money the Defense Department can transfer between appropriations accounts. In the FY2007 defense appropriations act, Congress provided $4.5 billion of general transfer authority in the base bill and $3.0 billion of additional \"special transfer authority\" in the Title IX bridge fund for war costs. The $4.5 billion of general transfer authority allows shifts of funds between all defense accounts (subject to non-statutory advance approval of congressional defense committees), which the $3 billion of special transfer authority allowed shifts to other accounts of the amounts provided in Title IX. One requested provision would increase general transfer authority from $4.5 billion to $6 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. A second requested provision would allow the Defense Department to transfer up $3.5 billion of the defense funds provided in the supplemental. The conference agreement does not provide the increase in general transfer authority but does allow transfer of $3.5 billion of the new defense money in the supplemental. The agreement also provides that amounts shifted to restore funds transferred to the \"Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund\" and to the \"Iraqi Security Forces Fund\" shall not count against general transfer authority. In effect, this increases general transfer authority by $1.625 billion\u2014$825 million for the JIEDDF transfer and $800 million for the ISFF transfer. If the Defense Department were to assume that this these provisions will eventually become law before the very end of the fiscal year, this authority might allow the Defense Department to shift more funds temporarily to the Army to avoid the planned slowdown in operations (see below).", "For domestic programs, the agreement includes\u2014", "Gulf Coast hurricane relief: The conference agreement provides $6.9 billion for Gulf Coast hurricane relief.

That approach was reflected in the initial version of H.R. 2206 , which the House approved on May 10.", "As passed by the House on May 10, H.R. 2206 made $42.8 billion for military operations available immediately and without conditions. It also required the President to report to Congress by July 13, on the progress the government of Iraq had made in achieving progress on specific benchmarks, including allowing U.S. forces to pursue militias, providing Iraqi security forces in Baghdad, eliminating militia control of local security, disarming militias, reducing violence, ensuring minority rights, adopting a law sharing oil revenues equitably, reforming de-Baathification laws, and allocating $10 billion of Iraqi funds for reconstruction. The bill provided an additional $52.8 billion for military operations but prohibited its release until the President submitted the required report and Congress passed a joint resolution of approval releasing the funds.", "The Administration objected to this approach, however, complaining that funding on an \"installment plan\" would not allow the armed forces sufficient certainty to plan operations and that no good would be served by requiring a second vote. The White House said that the President would veto a bill if it were similar to H.R. 2206 as passed by the House. There was little sentiment in the Senate, therefore, to follow the House approach.", "Subsequently, senior congressional leaders of both parties expressed support for a measure that include benchmarks for performance by the Iraqi government. A key issue, however, appeared to be whether and how to enforce progress toward the benchmarks by linking steps to the availability of funds. On May 16, Senator Warner proposed an Iraq policy amendment to the Water Resources Development Act that linked reconstruction assistance to Iraq to the achievement of benchmarks similar to those in H.R. 2206 . That approach appeared to have some, though not overwhelming, support in the Senate. The Senate voted 52-44 on a motion to close debate on the amendment, which failed because it required 60 votes for approval. Most Democrats opposed the measure, so it appeared for a time that majority still wanted somewhat stronger enforcement of benchmarks as part of any funding compromise. In the end, however, Congress approved a proposal with benchmarks very similar to those in the Warner amendment and, as in the amendment, with economic assistance to Iraq conditional on Iraq achieving progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iraq Policy Provisions in the Final Enacted Version of FY2007 Supplemental Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["The final version of H.R. 2206 , as passed by the House and Senate on May 24, establishes 18 benchmarks for performance by the Iraqi government and permits $1.6 billion of economic assistance to Iraq to be provided only if the President reports that Iraq has made sufficient progress on the benchmarks to warrant not change in U.S. policy or waives the requirement.

The Army also adopted a temporary slowdown in spending for non-war-related operational activities to conserve funds. With bridge funds, the transfer, and the slowdown, Army estimates showed that the service could temporarily finance its war-related O&M activities through the end of June\u2014covering nine months of the fiscal year\u2014without supplemental funding.", "This year's experience suggests that the Army can temporarily finance war costs well into the fiscal year before passage of a supplemental by using several tools:", "tapping bridge funds for war provided in DOD's regular appropriation; transferring funds from other areas less taxed by war expenses; using funds slated for end-of-year expenses in its baseline program;; slowing O&M spending; and invoking the Feed and Forage Act as a last resort.", "How long the Army can last depends on the amounts that are provided in the bridge fund, transferred from other accounts, available from its baseline programs, or saved temporarily through slowdowns, and the current rate of spending.", "DOD pressed Congress to pass the supplemental because of concerns that as funds ran low the Army would have to slow spending which officials claimed could affect operations and because of reluctance to use transfer authority to finance Army O&M spending temporarily.

To minimize the impact of transfers, DOD could have tapped some $30.1 billion in procurement and $8.3 billion in Research, Development, Test & Evaluation budget authority from previous years that DOD anticipates will not be obligated in FY2007 and that could be restored in FY2008. For the earlier transfer, DOD tapped military personnel funds from the Navy and Air Force, which needed to be restored quickly to cover end-of-year salaries and benefits.", "Presumably to offset DOD concerns about tapping transfer authority to finance war costs, Congress essentially restored $1.4 billion in reprogramming authority in the FY2007 Supplemental, close to the $1.6 billion used by the Army and similar to action taken in the FY2005 supplemental.

In a press statement on March 23, President Bush warned that if funding were delayed beyond April 15, \"our men and women in uniform will face significant disruptions, and so will their families.\"", "On March 29, Army Chief of Staff, General Peter Schoomaker, and Acting Secretary of the Army, Peter Geren, wrote to Senator McConnnell to warn that \"Without approval of the supplemental funds in April, we will be forced to take increasingly draconian measures which will impact Army readiness and impose hardships on our Soldiers and their families.\" On April 2, all four military Service Chiefs signed a similar letter to congressional leaders. On April 11, in a letter to Senator Byrd and Representative Murtha, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates provided a time line of steps the Army would take to limit its activities.", "In mid-April, the Army issued a press release and guidance to unit and facility commanders listing the types of actions that were to be used to rein in funding for the next three months. In that guidance, the Army excluded any restrictive actions that would affect war operations, \"result immediately in the degradation of readiness standards for a deployed unit, deploying unit or next-to-deploy unit,\" affect reset (the repair and replacement of war-worn equipment), or endanger health or safety. Instead, restrictions were focused on a wide variety of activities from travel to non-essential purchases or supply and maintenance contracts.", "Activities restricted by the Army included:", "postponing or cancelling all non-essential travel, training and conferences; temporarily suspending shipments of goods not associated with support of deployed forces; restricting the use of government purchase cards to essential items; freezing hiring of civilians from outside the Army except for interns, Senior Executive Service, directed hires or those that could affect war-related deployments; processing but delaying the award of contracts for repair and upgrade of facilities, logistics support contracts, or environmental restoration contracts unless there would be a substantial increase in cost or safety concern; not ordering non-critical spare parts or supplies; deferring repair of equipment to be prepositioned overseas unless needed by next-to-deploy units or those converting to modular status; and deferring home station unit training for reserve units that incur active-duty O&M costs.", "Although these restrictions could disrupt day-to-day activities, it is unlikely that unit readiness was affected. Readiness is defined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as \"the ability to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to execute their assigned missions\" and is measured by an elaborate system that rates individual units. By excluding war-related activities, savings were focused on state-side facilities and units that are currently not scheduled to deploy.", "The Army has indicated that much of the temporary savings came from delaying contracts for repair of stateside facilities. Another significant source of savings\u2014delaying the re-order of supplies\u2014required the services to temporarily tap current inventory, which could be replenished with higher orders in later months. The Army did not anticipate any savings from the civilian hiring freeze, where savings take time to accrue, or travel restrictions where savings are small.", "In its original guidance, the Army had also requested information from its components about potential savings and effects on readiness from cancelling training exercises, identifying depot workload that may not be accomplished within the fiscal year or delaying shipments to bases in case a further slowdown was necessary. With passage of the supplemental, a further slowdown is no longer needed.", "In testimony to the Senate Appropriations Committee in early May, Secretary of Defense Gates stated that \"if we pulled out all the stops, used everything possible available to us, we could probably fund the war into July,\" but noted that the \"disruption to the department and programs here at home, in order to fully sustain the troops abroad, and particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, has a growing impact here at home in terms of contracts not let, civilians not hired, programs where the spending has slowed or stopped ... including month-to-month service contracts for services and supplies and things like that on the bases.\"", "As a last resort, the Defense Department could also have invoked the Feed and Forage Act, 41 U.S.C. 11, which permits the Defense Department to make purchases for some purposes in advance of appropriations.

To protect readiness, the Army's slowdown did not restrict activities supporting deployed, deploying or about to deploy troops or that would immediately degrade readiness, relying instead on restrictions of non-essential expenditures including holding off on contracts for facility maintenance and repairs, supply contracts, limiting travel and meetings and day-to-day purchases using government credit cards, and, slowing equipment maintenance.", "In this year's bridge fund, Congress provided $28.4 billion to meet the Army's operational needs, some $7 billion higher than last year's bridge fund. These additional funds provided the Army with additional funds to finance its operating costs. Using new Army data, CRS estimated, like the Army, that Army O&M costs could be covered until the end of June 2007 with the current slowdown and the $1.6 billion transfer. If necessary, the Army could also have requested additional transfers from the $4.6 billion in transfer authority that was available at that time in order to finance operations through three weeks of July though the Army argued this would considerably disrupt ongoing activities.", "This would have required, however, that the Army use all Army Operation and Maintenance funds in its regular FY2007 budget, all O&M war funds in the FY2007 bridge fund, and exhaust its transfer authority by moving funds from military personnel, procurement, RDT&E or other areas to Army operations. Using much or all DOD's transfer authority could reduce or eliminate DOD flexibility to move funds between accounts after enactment for other higher priority needs making it difficult to make other program adjustments during the year. The FY2007 supplemental restored some of the transfer authority used to extend Army operations by exempting certain transfers already approved Congress, an approach that was used in the FY2005 Supplemental."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FY2007 International Affairs Supplemental", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, supplemental appropriations have become a significant source of additional funds for international affairs (150 account) programs at a time when regular appropriations have been constrained by budget pressures.

The Administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen contingencies, it is necessary to make supplemental requests for unexpected and non-recurring expenses. Since FY1999, after the bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa in August 1998, Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations exceeding $1 billion each year. The Bush Administration's supplemental request for international affairs totaled $6.3 billion in FY2005 and $4.2 billion in FY2006, amounting to about 13% and 21%, respectively, of the regularly-enacted foreign affairs budgets.", "The FY2007 supplemental request of $5.993 billion for international affairs represents about 20% of the FY2007 enacted international affairs funding. Of the nearly $6 billion for international affairs spending, $4.8 billion was proposed for foreign assistance programs, while $1.18 billion would fund State Department operations, public diplomacy, and broadcasting programs. Within the foreign assistance part of the supplemental request, security and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan dominate, with $2.3 billion for Iraq and $721 million for Afghanistan. The supplemental request for Iraq is in addition to $749 million requested in the FY2007 regular budget, for a total of $3 billion.", "Other significant bilateral assistance funding was requested for Kosovo, Lebanon, and Sudan. Additional supplemental funds for humanitarian assistance, migration assistance, peacekeeping operations, and food aid were also sought for a number of countries. The supplemental request also included $161 million to address the potential for a global avian influenza pandemic.", "For State Department operations, the Administration's FY2007 supplemental request of $1.17 billion would be largely for activities and the U.S. Mission in Iraq. Another $10 million for the Broadcasting Board of Governors would be for expanded broadcasting in Arabic on the U.S.-established Alhurra Television into 22 Middle East countries.", "The second conference agreement (to H.R. 2206 / P.L. 110-28 ) provided $6.146 billion for international affairs spending.

A DOD plan to rehabilitate more than 140 of the nearly 200 state-owned enterprises that composed a large portion of the Iraqi economy prior to the U.S. occupation would be supported by $100 million from the Iraq Freedom Fund account. Soon after the occupation began, the Coalition Provisional Authority, hoping to create a free-market economy, attempted to privatize these enterprises, but gave up when the turnover to sovereignty was accelerated. The Department of Defense expects that the revitalized factories will generate employment for as many as 150,000 Iraqis. U.S. assistance would provide necessary machines, tools and generators.", "The remaining $2.3 billion was requested under six foreign operations (150) accounts meeting a variety of economic reconstruction and humanitarian objectives.

As announced in early January, the reconstruction component of that strategy would double the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) from 10 to 20 and increase the number of U.S. civilian staff for them from 250 to at least 400. The PRTs, composed of State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Department of Defense (DOD), and other agency staff, work with the Iraqi provincial governments to identify projects that can be implemented with U.S. funding, and, at the same time, they seek to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi officials to meet local needs. In essence, the new strategy envisions that, as U.S. and Iraqi military forces clear an area of Baghdad or Anbar province, PRT staff would immediately work with local Iraqis to further stabilize the area by drawing on all available spigots of U.S. and Iraqi government funding to create jobs and meet other basic needs.", "The President's plan would increase PRTs in Baghdad from one to six and in Anbar province from one to three. To enhance U.S. civilian staff security and improve program effectiveness, greater effort would be made to integrate U.S. civilian teams with U.S. military battalions. The military's CERP, and USAID's Community Stabilization Program (CSP) and Community Action Program (CAP) funded by the FY2007 Supplemental would help support activities identified by the PRTs, as would the infusion of $10 billion in promised funds from the Iraqi government. The FY2007 supplemental would provide funds to the PRTs for the kinds of grassroots activities they have supported elsewhere, such as improvements to community infrastructure, job training, vocational education, and micro-loans.", "Security and staffing problems encountered by already existing PRTs, however, could possibly hinder the effectiveness of an expanded PRT program. In October 2006, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) asserted that, due to security constraints on travel outside their compounds, many PRT staff could not regularly meet with local government officials to carry out their capacity-building chores, and a former PRT staff member claims that local Iraqis are too intimidated by insurgent threats to meet with U.S. staff. The State Department's Coordinator for Iraq, David Satterfield, asserts that the SIGIR views on this issue do not reflect current reality. Most observers, however, would not dispute that the ability of U.S. and Iraqi troops to secure and hold new areas of operation is key to the success of expanded civilian PRT efforts.", "A second issue that might affect the success of the PRT expansion is the availability of U.S. civilian staff. In the past, DOD military civil affairs personnel filled slots for which U.S. civilians could not be recruited. However, the SIGIR has suggested that the need for required specialized skills for such posts as local government, economic, and agricultural advisers is still not being fully met with this approach. Although Secretary Rice has asserted that most positions are filled, it has been reported that about 129 of the new PRT posts are going to be occupied temporarily by military personnel until State is able to recruit sufficient numbers of civilian contract personnel. As many as 269 such personnel are expected to be needed eventually.", "Associated with the reconstruction assistance program was an additional funding request (not included in the table) within the State Department account to cover the operational costs of both the PRTs ($414.1 million) and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) ($35 million). Under the DOD Iraq Freedom Fund, $150 million was requested also in support of PRT operational costs, including providing transportation, force protection, and body armor to all PRT personnel co-located with U.S. military as well as special pay and benefits for the 129 DOD-sponsored PRT temporary personnel noted above."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["The conference report on H.R. 2206 provides a total of $6.3 billion in Iraq reconstruction assistance, $316 million less than the Administration request (see Table 5 ).", "With regard to 050 security assistance provisions, the bill matches the Administration request for both the ISFF ($3.8 billion) and the CERP ($350 million), but cuts by half, to $50 million, the request for DOD support of Iraqi state-owned enterprises.", "Perhaps the most significant difference between the request and the final legislation is a cut of roughly $248 million from proposed political, social, and economic assistance programs that would be funded in the Administration proposal under ESF at $2.1 billion. H.R. 2206 addresses these types of activities under two accounts\u2014ESF at $1.6 billion and the Democracy Fund at $250 million.
