Reports suggest that human trafficking is a global phenomenon, victimizing millions of people each year and contributing to a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. Common forms of human trafficking include trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, and debt bondage. Other forms of human trafficking include trafficking for domestic servitude and the use of children in armed conflict (e.g., child soldiers).", "Human trafficking is a centuries-old problem that, despite international and U.S. efforts to eliminate it, continues to occur in virtually every country in the world. The modern manifestation of the human trafficking problem is driven by gaps in the enforcement of anti-trafficking laws and regulations and the willingness of some labor and service providers to violate such laws in order to fulfill international demand. Such demand is particularly concentrated among industries and economic sectors that are low-skill and labor-intensive. Human trafficking is an international and cross-cutting policy problem that affects a range of major national security, human rights, criminal justice, social, economic, migration, gender, public health, and labor issues.", "The U.S. government and successive Congresses have long played a leading role in international efforts to combat human trafficking. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386, as amended) and its reauthorizations are the cornerstone legislative vehicles for current U.S. policy to combat international human trafficking. Since enactment of the TVPA in 2000, Congress has remained active on international human trafficking issues, particularly with appropriations identified for anti-trafficking assistance purposes, proposed legislation related to the TVPA, and other anti-trafficking initiatives. Periodic oversight hearings have focused in particular on the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, a detailed country-by-country ranking and analysis of government efforts to achieve congressionally established minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking.", "Although there is widespread support among policy makers for U.S. anti-trafficking goals, ongoing reports of continued trafficking worldwide raise questions regarding whether sufficient progress has been made to deter and ultimately eliminate the problem. This report provides an overview of recent global trends and U.S. foreign policy responses to address human trafficking. The report focuses in particular on efforts conducted by the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP) and the President's Interagency Task Force (PITF) on human trafficking, as well as discussion of the 2016 TIP Report. An Appendix includes the status of legislation introduced in the 114th Congress on international dimensions of human trafficking.", "Drawing on CRS Report R42497, Trafficking in Persons: International Dimensions and Foreign Policy Issues for Congress, this report reflects policy activity in the 114th Congress and will be updated to reflect international trafficking developments through the end of the second session.", "."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Global Trends", "paragraphs": ["Trafficking in persons, or human trafficking, refers to the subjection of men, women, and children to compelled service for the purposes of exploitation.

Reports suggest that human trafficking is a global phenomenon, victimizing millions of people and contributing to a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. It is a centuries-old problem that, despite international efforts, continues to occur in virtually every country in the world. ", "On June 30, 2016, the State Department released its latest edition of the flagship annual U.S. publication on international human trafficking, the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report , discussed further in the \" State Department Reporting Requirements \" section below. Briefly, the TIP Report categorized 185 countries, including the United States, into four tiers, based on their respective governments' level of effort to address human trafficking: Tier 1 (best), Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, and Tier 3 (worst). An additional three countries were designated as \"Special Cases\" without a tier ranking because of political instability and the inability to obtain relevant government information. ", "Only Tier 1 countries, approximately 19.5% of the countries assessed, were fully compliant with U.S.-established minimum standards to eliminate severe forms of human trafficking; the rest were considered noncompliant and varied in terms of their level of effort to improve. Among the least compliant were the 27 countries identified as Tier 3 in the 2016 TIP Report , including 8 that had previously been Tier 2 Watch List: Burma, Djibouti, Haiti, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Suriname, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. As required by law, Tier 3 countries are subjected to selected foreign assistance restrictions, unless the President determines that continuing to provide aid is in the U.S. national interest. ", "The nongovernmental organization Walk Free Foundation also provided a global evaluation of human trafficking trends in its 2016 Global Slavery Index report. The 2016 Global Slavery Index report estimated that some 45.8 million (up from 35.8 million estimated in 2014) individuals worldwide were exploited through human trafficking, forced labor, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage, or commercial sexual exploitation. In contrast to the TIP Report , which categorizes countries solely on the basis of government efforts, the Global Slavery Index also seeks to provide country-by-country estimates of people experiencing conditions tantamount to modern slavery. For example, the 2016 Global Slavery Index reported the following:", "Countries with the greatest prevalence of their population subjected to \"modern slavery\" included North Korea (for comparison, the State Department listed North Korea as Tier 3 in the 2016 TIP Report ), Uzbekistan (Tier 3), Cambodia (Tier 2), India (Tier 2), and Qatar (Tier 2 Watch List). Countries with the highest absolute numbers of people subjected to modern slavery, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index , included India (Tier 2 in the 2016 TIP Report ), China (Tier 2 Watch List), Pakistan (Tier 2 Watch List), Bangladesh (Tier 2), and Uzbekistan (Tier 3). Countries taking the least action to address human trafficking included North Korea (Tier 3 in the 2016 TIP Report ), Iran (Tier 3), Eritrea (Tier 3), Equatorial Guinea (Tier 3), Papua New Guinea (Tier 3), Guinea (Tier 2 Watch List), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, Tier 2 Watch List), and South Sudan (Tier 3). ", "Several other older, but nevertheless widely referenced global reports on human trafficking include a 2014 report prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and two reports prepared by the International Labor Organization (ILO). Surveying U.N. member countries, UNODC reported in 2014 that, between 2010 and 2012, 124 countries had identified trafficking victims representing 152 nationalities. The UNODC report cautioned that its estimates were minimum figures, as it is generally recognized that the actual scope and prevalence of human trafficking is far higher than officially reported. The UNODC report also revealed that trafficking operations were seemingly as diverse as they were widespread, ranging from individuals exploiting their partners or employees to highly sophisticated transnational criminal syndicates involving a large number of victims.", "In 2012, the ILO estimated that some 20.9 million men, women, and children were subjected to forced labor, including trafficking, debt bondage, and slavery-like conditions. In 2014, the ILO followed up with an analysis of the financial value of forced labor and related trafficking on the international economy, estimating that it generated $150 billion in illegal profits annually. According to the ILO, two-thirds of this total amount stemmed from commercial sexual exploitation, while the rest resulted from forced labor. Key forced labor sectors included the construction, manufacturing, and utilities industries (generating some $34 billion in annual illicit income), followed by agriculture ($9 billion) and domestic work ($8 billion)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government, including Congress, has played a leading role in international efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly through the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386 ) and its subsequent amendments and reauthorizations (TVPRAs of 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2013).

According to a 2012 report on J/TIP by the State Department Inspectors General (OIG), the TIP Report is unusual for the central role that Washington plays in the drafting of the report. As described by the State Department's OIG, the typical report drafting cycle is as follows: J/TIP sends a request to all U.S. overseas posts each December for information to use in the TIP Report . At the same time, J/TIP staff contact nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to request similar information. Between mid-February and the end of March, J/TIP drafts the country summaries and proposed tier rankings for the TIP Report .

After four consecutive years on the Tier 2 Watch List from 2010 through 2013, it was downgraded, as required by law, to Tier 3 for lack of significant progress to combat human trafficking. In 2015 and 2016, however, the State Department ranked Malaysia as a Tier 2 Watch List country. The timing of the State Department's upgrade in 2015 was criticized by outside advocacy groups and many Members of Congress as politically motivated, despite Administration denials, to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal negotiations.

Others cited Malaysia's ranking to claim that the State Department's rankings remained swayed by political considerations. ", "On the whole, however, many observers recognized the State Department's attempts to mend its reputation, following last year's groundswell of criticism over Malaysia's rating in the TIP Report . The State Department was widely praised by observers for what they viewed as an accurate portrayal of human trafficking problems in Burma and Uzbekistan, both rated Tier 3 in the 2016 TIP Report . In congressional testimony on the 2016 TIP Report , a civil society organization witness additionally praised the State Department for keeping Qatar on the Tier 2 Watch List.

In the case of Thailand, many acknowledged the military regime's efforts to prioritize anti-human trafficking in the past year; however, others viewed the upgrade as premature. Some also raised suspicions that Thailand's Tier 2 Watch List rating could help the Obama Administration achieve other political objectives, including support from Southeast Asia on disputes with China over its territorial claims in the South China Sea as well as prospects for potentially joining the TPP. Some noted the possibility that the State Department's decision to upgrade Thailand could also affect the European Union's ongoing review of Thailand's illegal fishing and labor practices as well as improve Thai fish exports. In the case of other countries, such as Cuba, China, and India, some have challenged the State Department's assessments and called for reform of the ranking system.

Although the list grew in 2016 to include two additions (Iraq and Rwanda) to the 10-country list, Afghanistan was not among them. Although the State Department acknowledged reports that the Afghanistan Local Police (ALP) is a government security force and that media outlets reported on their recruiting and sexually abusing children under the age of 18, the TIP Report noted that the ALP \"falls outside of the armed forces of the country as defined by the CSPA [Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008].\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Funding and Assistance Issues", "paragraphs": ["As Congress continues to evaluate U.S. efforts to address human trafficking internationally, foreign assistance funding will remain a central focus.
