Beginning in FY1998, Congress enacted annual limits (i.e., \"caps\") on funding FWS for its listing function($6.3 million in FY2001). (11) This language limitsFWS discretion to transfer fundsto finance additional listings: if courts mandate agency action on listing certainspecies, other listings may not be able to be funded. FWS supported these limits toassure that funding for other agency programs could not be diverted to financeadditional ESA listing activities. However, courts have held that budget constraintsdo not excuse an agency from compliance in some circumstances.", "For FY2002, the Administration proposed a new version of this cap, stressing that (a) current court orders alone meant that the listing function was expected to runout of funds before the end of the fiscal year, and (b) if it were to make listingdeterminations on merely its own estimated backlog, the cost would be roughly $120million. Under the proposed new version, spending for the listing program wouldhave been subject to a proviso that:", "... notwithstanding the specific time frames and deadlines of section 4(a) and (b) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973,as amended, not to exceed $8,476,000 shall be used for implementing subsections(a), (b), (c)(1), (c)(2)(B)(iii), and (e) of section 4 for species that are indigenous to theUnited States, to be expended solely for (1) complying with court orders orsettlements in effect as of the date of the passage of this law, and (2) undertakingsuch other actions as determined by the Secretary to be consistent with the prioritiesestablished by a listing priority system to implement these subsections and subjectto the requirements of this appropriation....", "This proposal proved to be one of the most controversial in the FWS budget. On the one hand, FWS claimed it would allow the agency to regain control of the listingprocess and to list species on the basis of biological need, rather than on the basis ofcontinuing lawsuits, which FWS says that, without exception, it had lost. FWSdecried a \"race to the courthouse\" as impeding listings founded, in its view, on abiological basis. The agency's critics (calling the proposed amendment an\"extinction rider\") responded that (1) few listings would have taken place in the lastseveral years without the law suits; (2) the FWS claimed of conscientious attentionto the law are contradicted by its initial failure to seek more funding to remove thebacklog of listing and its continuing failure to do so in light of its assertion of a $120million need; (3) the restriction was one-sided since de-listings and down listingswould have no such cap; and (4) the restriction would have been a fundamentalchange in the ESA, since the agency could chose the species to be protectedselectively, rather than protecting all species meeting the criteria specified under\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4(b) of the ESA.", "The House approved $8.48 million for the listing program, rejected the Administration's proposed change, and retained the current cap on spending forlisting. It also accepted a \"subcap\" of $6 million (out of the $8.48 million) ondesignation of new critical habitat. In effect, if the agency is ordered to designateeven a few areas of critical habitat, funding for new listings would be restricted to$2.48 million. Additional conflicts between court orders and funding restrictionscould occur. The Senate passed a $9 million cap on listing, but did not include a\"subcap\" on critical habitat, nor did it accept the Administration's proposed change.

Two listed species of suckers (a kind of fish),a coho salmon run, and bald eagles have become centerpieces of a conflict that alsoinvolves farmers, commercial and sport fishermen, and Indian tribes. After twobiological opinions issued under ESA by FWS and the National Marine FisheriesService, the Bureau of Reclamation restricted irrigation water to protect fish. Whilethe decision was supported by fishermen, tribes, and environmentalists, desperatefarmers initially tried to open irrigation canals and sought a reprieve from theBureau's decision. A Senate amendment to prohibit the use of funds to carry out theBureau's decision was tabled on July 12 (52-48).

(12) The House passed $16.4million, while the Senate passed $14.4 million. The FY2002 law provides $14.4million. Payment amounts are based on formulas authorized in law. The paymentlevels have been controversial, since the small additions of land to the NationalWildlife Refuge System over the last several years mean that dollars (already reducedby inflation) must be spread still further. The situation has produced calls forCongress to increase the appropriation, especially since local governments often viewthe payments as entitlements, even though they technically are not, since they aresubject to annual appropriations.

Land acquisition presents anunusually complex picture for analysis in FY2002. The complexity arises not onlyfrom the distribution of the previously-mentioned Title VIII funds but also fromrevisions that place some programs under Land Acquisition that had been elsewherein the budget. Title VIII, as enacted in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act,derived its funding from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. However, P.L.106-554 (the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2001, Division B, Title I, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd121)amended Title VIII to direct that LWCF would be the source of funding.

For the former, the USGS would actively consult with theprogram's stakeholders to develop more collaborative partnerships based onreimbursable funding. For the latter, the USGS would pursue cost-sharing from theprogram's stakeholders to maintain its current scope and schedule of data collectionand interpretation activities.

The FY2002 law contains $205.8 million forWater Resources Investigations, $46.3 million above the request and $2.3 millionover FY2001. With the $5.0 million restoration in Conservation Category Spendingfor streamgauges, House and Senate actions on the conference agreement indicatethat the Federal streamgaging program in FY2002 would be about equal to theFY2001 level, $15.95 million, with an increase of some $100,000 for cost-of-livingadjustments (pay raises, rent increases, etc.), bringing that FY2002 total to $16.0million. In the joint explanatory statement, the conferees stipulated their concurrencewith the House direction to contract with the National Academy of Sciences toexamine water resources research funded by all Federal agencies and by significantnon-Federal organizations.

Separating out the costs associated with modernizing theinfrastructure for management and dissemination of scientific information and thecosts for maintenance and repair of facilities allows for a clearer view of the moneyallocated directly for science. Science Support was the one budget activity thatshowed an increase in the FY2002 request: $7.5 million above the FY2001 level of$73.7 million, but only because the request reflected a transfer of funding for theUSGS library and other support service costs from the Facilities activity to theScience Support activity. That transfer outweighed requested funding decreases inUSGS network efforts to deliver scientific information over the Internet, therebyyielding the activity a net increase.

In the past, royalties were paidby the oil industry to the federal government amidst controversy over the industry'svaluation of the oil. Under royalty-in-kind programs, the government receives theroyalty in the form of crude oil, not money. The amendment assures that any RIK isno less valuable than the calculation of the royalty under guidelines forroyalty-in-value. The amendment was not controversial, but seen as codifying thecurrent program. However, the conference report dropped the House languageconcerning the value of RIK oil, and retained less stringent Senate language.

Greater tribal control over federal Indian programs has been the goal of Indian policy since the 1970s. Inthe BIA this policy has taken three forms: tribal contracting to run individual BIAprograms under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education AssistanceAct ( P.L. 93-638 , as amended); tribal compacting with the BIA to manage all or mostof a tribe's BIA programs, under the Self-Governance program (Title IV of P.L.93-638 , as added by P.L. 103-413 ); and shifting programs into a portion of the BIAbudget called Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA), in which tribes have more influencein BIA budget planning and within which each tribe has authority to reprogram allits TPA funds.

The FY2002 enacted amount forTPA is 41.8% of the recommendation for operation of Indian programs and 33.8%of recommended total BIA appropriations.", "Contract support costs, authorized under the Indian Self-determination Act, fund the non-operational and overhead costs incurred by tribes in administering programsunder self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, and are calculatedusing a negotiated tribal cost rate (a percentage of the funding base covered by atribe's contracts or compact). Issues raised by contract support costs include theconsistent shortfall in contract support cost appropriations, tribes' claim ofentitlement to full support cost funding, identity of programs included in tribes'funding base, and rate-setting methods.", "To allow the BIA and tribes to address the contract support costs problem and to allow GAO to study the issue, Congress for FY1999 imposed a one-yearmoratorium on BIA self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts.

ForFY2000 and FY2001, Congress debated continuing the moratorium but did not retainit. Congress has not directed the BIA to put any of these GAO recommendations intoeffect, nor have the BIA and IHS developed a standard policy on contract supportcosts. Both the House and the conference committee urge the OMB to coordinateBIA-IHS solutions to their disparate handling of contract support costs. The BIAestimates that appropriations for contract support costs met 88% of reported tribalneed in FY2000 and 89% in FY2001 and will meet 88% of the need in FY2002.", "Funding Distribution. The issue of the equitable distribution of BIA funding--often referred to as \"means-testing\"--has twoaspects, one relating to how funds are distributed, the other relating to whether atribe's other financial resources are taken into account. First, much if not most BIAfunding, even while serving tribal needs, is not required to be distributed on anationwide per capita or other formula basis. Second, tribes' own non-BIAresources, especially business revenues, are not always required to be taken intoaccount. A 1998 GAO study of TPA distribution found that two-thirds of FY1998TPA funds were distributed based on historical levels and one-third was distributedbased on formulas, that TPA distribution per capita varied widely across BIA areas,and that tribal governments' reporting of their revenues were inconsistent inincluding or excluding non-federal revenues.", "Supporters of TPA funding redistribution based on \"means-testing\" of tribes claim that BIA funding is inequitably distributed, that poorer tribes do not receiveadequate funding, that tribal TPA funds received per capita do not correspond withindicators of tribal need, that only 30 percent of TPA funding is based on formulas,and that some rich tribes got more TPA funds in FY1998 than tribes with no outsiderevenues. Opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty, that BIA fundingis insufficient to meet tribal needs, and that means-testing TPA funding wouldpenalize tribes who still have severe needs, would violate the federal trustresponsibility to tribes, and would be unfair since it is not required of state or localgovernments receiving federal assistance.", "Congress debated several proposals for reallocating TPA funding during its consideration of the FY1998-FY2001 appropriation bills. For FY1998-FY1999,Congress authorized a tribal-federal workgroup on TPA allocations and tribal needsassessment, required that each tribe receive a certain minimum amount of funding,and directed the BIA to develop TPA reallocation proposals. The BIA/tribalworkgroup's report, in July 1999, concluded that variation in tribes' circumstancesmade formula distribution problematic; that TPA funding resulted from history,geography, and policies; that current funding did not meet identified needs; and thatmeasures of tribal need and revenue were not fully available. The workgrouprecommended that base TPA funding should not be redistributed. ", "For FY2000, Congress decided to include a provision that authorized-but did not direct-the Secretary of the Interior to redistribute TPA funds to alleviate tribalfunding inequities, but without reducing any tribe's TPA share more than 10% exceptin certain situations. Congress also directed the BIA to distribute funds to its twopost-secondary institutions based on a formula. Both of these provisions wereretained by Congress for FY2001 and FY2002. In addition, for FY2001 Congressapproved a new provision prohibiting Alaska Native tribes with fewer than 25members from receiving TPA funds; the funds were to be transferred to each tribe'sregional Native non-profit corporation. There is no similar provision in the FY2002Interior appropriations law.", "Trust Asset Management. The BIA has, historically, mismanaged Indian trust funds and trust assets. Reform of trustfund management is now the responsibility of the Office of the Special Trustee forAmerican Indians (see below). The BIA and the Office of Special Trustee togetherare implementing the Secretary of the Interior's High Level Implementation Plan forthe Trust Management Improvement Project. The project includes improvements intrust asset systems, policies, and procedures, reduction of backlogs, and maintenanceof the improved system. Trust asset management includes real estate services,processing of transaction (sales, leases, etc.), surveys, appraisals, probate functions,land title records, and other functions. The BIA contracted with a private developerfor a new computerized trust asset and accounting management system (TAAMS). Critics, including tribes, the GAO, and a court-appointed special master, have raiseddoubts about whether the computerized TAAMS system is working successfully. Inthe FY2000 Interior appropriations law, Congress prohibited the Secretary fromdeploying TAAMS, except at a test site, until the Secretary certifies that the systemmeets contract requirements and users' needs. The test site is the BIA's Billingsregion. Congress did not include the TAAMS prohibition in the FY2001 or FY2002Interior appropriations laws. Congress increased funding for BIA trust assetmanagement functions, such as real estate services, appraisals, and probate, forFY2001and FY2002.", "Law Enforcement. Because of reports of greatly increased crime rates and inadequate law enforcement in Indian country,the Clinton Administration proposed for FY1999 an initiative on law enforcementin Indian country. Under this initiative, funds for Indian country flow through boththe BIA and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The funds provide additional lawofficers, police facilities and equipment, jails and detention centers, drug testing andtreatment, tribal youth programs, and tribal court assistance. BIA funding goeschiefly to ongoing operation and improvement of reservation law enforcementfunctions, while the DOJ funds go to improvement grants, tribal courts, juvenilejustice, and construction of detention facilities. For FY2002, the Administrationproposed an increase of $9 million (to a total of $158.3 million) for BIA lawenforcement. The House, Senate, and conference committee agreed with the request,and this level was enacted. (Proposed FY2002 DOJ spending for Indian-country lawenforcement programs under this initiative, in the Commerce-Justice-Stateappropriations bill, totals $91.9 million.)", "School Construction. The BIA funds or operates 185 elementary and secondary schools with over 2,000 educationfacilities. Many school facilities are old and dilapidated, with health and safetydeficiencies. BIA education construction covers both construction of new schoolfacilities to replace facilities that cannot be repaired, and improvement and repair ofexisting facilities. The BIA currently estimates the backlog in education facilityrepairs at $942 million. Education construction funding was historically low andCongress had not accepted various proposals for alternate funding mechanisms. ForFY2000, Congress funded a 74% increase in education facility construction (beforeinternal transfers). For FY2001, Congress funded an even higher increase, 119%, to$292.3 million. In addition, the FY2001 conference report ( H.Rept. 106-914 ) recommended funding of $7 million for a new tribal school constructiondemonstration project, under which a tribe and the BIA each pay 50% of the cost ofreplacing the tribe's tribally-controlled school. For FY2002 the Administrationproposed a decrease of $13.4 million in funding for construction of replacementschools (to $127.8 million) and an increase of $13.1 million for facilitiesimprovement and repair (to $161.6 million), for a total (with other programs) of$292.5 million. No separate funding was proposed for the school constructiondemonstration project. The House approved the levels proposed by theAdministration. The Senate approved the same amount for facilities improvementand repair but provided an additional $3 million under new school construction tocontinue funding for the tribal school construction demonstration project (theSenate's total for FY2002 BIA education construction funding is $295.5 million). The FY2002 appropriations law dropped separate funding for the school constructiondemonstration project but left total education construction at $295.5 million.", "Other Issues. Congress has addressed several Indian land and gaming issues in recent Interior appropriations acts, inKansas and California. The FY2002 appropriations law continues a provision fromprevious appropriations laws that restricts the uses of the \"Huron Cemetery\" inKansas City, KS, to religious and cultural purposes (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd119). The provision preventsthe Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma, which claims trust ownership of the cemetery,from using it for economic development, including gaming. The Wyandottes havepursued use of the Cemetery or contiguous lands for gaming at the InteriorDepartment and in the courts. The FY2002 appropriations law includes a provision(\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd134) clarifying that, while the Secretary of the Interior has authority to designatewhat is a reservation for gaming purposes, gaming still may not occur on the HuronCemetery or on contiguous lands that have not been taken into trust. In theCalifornia case, the Senate version of the FY2002 appropriations bill (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd126) repealed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd819 of P.L. 106-568 ; that section had authorized the Secretary of the Interior to takecertain land into trust for the benefit of the Lytton Rancheria and had made the landeligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA) as ifit had been held in trust on the date of IGRA's enactment. One effect of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd819 was topreempt a possible assertion by the governor of California that under IGRA hisapproval was needed before any gaming could occur on the lands in question. TheFY2002 appropriations law has dropped the Senate provision and substituted a newprovision (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd128) that does not repeal \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd819 but instead makes any gaming on thelands subject to IGRA requirements for state-tribal compacts for casinos.

The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians,in the Secretary of the Interior's office, was authorized by Title III of the AmericanIndian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-412 ). The Office ofSpecial Trustee (OST) is responsible for general oversight of Interior Departmentmanagement of Indian trust assets, the direct management of Indian trust funds,establishment of an adequate trust fund management system, and support ofdepartment claims settlement activities related to the trust funds. Indian trust fundsformerly were managed by the BIA, but numerous federal, tribal, and congressionalreports had shown severely inadequate management, with probable losses to Indiantribal and individual beneficiaries. In 1996, at Congress' direction and as authorizedby P.L. 103-412 , the Secretary of the Interior transferred trust fund management fromthe BIA to the OST.", "FY2001 funding for the Office of Special Trustee was $119.0 million, which included $110.0 million for federal trust programs -- trust systems improvements,settlement and litigation support, and trust funds management -- and $9.0 millionfor the Indian land consolidation pilot project. (The purpose of the landconsolidation project is to purchase and consolidate fractionated ownerships ofallotted Indian trust lands, thereby reducing the costs of managing millions of acresbroken up into tiny fractional interests.) Included in the $110.0 million for federaltrust programs was an FY2001 emergency appropriation of $27.5 million. ThePresident proposed an FY2002 budget of $110.2 million for the OST, a decrease of7.4% from the total enacted funding for FY2001, but an increase of 20.5% over theinitial FY2001 appropriation. Included in the FY2002 request were $99.2 million forfederal trust programs and $10.98 million for the Indian land consolidation pilotproject. The House and Senate agreed with the Administration's request, as did the FY2002 Interior appropriations law.", "Indian trust funds comprise two sets of funds: (1) tribal funds owned by about 315 tribes in approximately 1,400 accounts, with a total asset value of about $2.6billion; and (2) individual Indians' funds, known as Individual Indian Money (IIM)accounts, in about 287,000 accounts with a total asset value of about $480 million. (Figures are from the OST FY2001 budget justifications.) The funds include moniesreceived both from claims awards, land or water rights settlements, and otherone-time payments, and from income from physical trust assets (e.g., land, timber,minerals), as well as investment income.", "While a congressionally-required outside audit was made of non-investment transactions--deposits and withdrawals--in tribal trust fund accounts (for the20-year period 1973-1992), Congress did not require that the outside auditorsexamine transactions in the IIM accounts, so their reconciliation status has been indoubt. On June 11, 1996, a class-action suit was filed in federal court against thefederal government on behalf of all IIM account owners. The suit sought anaccounting of the IIM funds, establishment of adequate management systems, andfull restitution of any money lost from the IIM accounts. The case was certified asa class action in February 1997. The part of the IIM suit dealing with the failures ofthe trust-fund system went to trial in June 1999 in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia, and the judge on December 21, 1999, found that thegovernment mismanaged the IIM accounts and ordered that the system be fixed andthat the government provide quarterly reports on system improvements. TheDepartment of Justice appealed this ruling in January 2000 but lost the appeal inFebruary 2001. ", "The next stage of the trial relates to an historical accounting for IIM funds, to determine the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs. The FY2001 conferencereport directed DOI to develop a sampling methodology for IIM accounting, as DOIhad intended to do, but required submission of the plan, with a cost-benefit analysis,to Congress prior to implementation. Both the FY2002 House committee report andjoint explanatory statement of the conference repeat the prohibition on allocatingfunds for an historical accounting before submission of the plan and report. Bothreports also state that a legislative remedy may be needed if a cost-effectiveaccounting methodology cannot be agreed upon. The plaintiffs in the case object toan historical accounting methodology and, using a different methodology based onfederal and state leasing returns, estimate that they are owed at least $10 billion.", "As directed by P.L. 103-412 , the OST in April 1997 submitted a Strategic Plan for improving the management of Indian trust funds and trust assets. The planrecommended creation of a new federally-chartered agency, to which trust funds andassets would be transferred, and management and investment of the funds and assetsto assist Indian economic growth. While considering FY1998 Interiorappropriations, Congress noted departmental and some tribal opposition to thisStrategic Plan, especially to the proposed new agency. Congress directed the OSTnot to implement the proposed new agency but to pursue trust funds systemsimprovements and OST responsibilities relating to the settlement of financial claimsmade by tribal and individual beneficiaries, before Congress and in court, because ofBIA trust-funds mismanagement. In August 1997 the Secretary of the Interior agreedto implement aspects of the Strategic Plan dealing with trust management systems,data cleanup, and trust asset processing backlogs, and in July 1998 he issued a\"High-Level Implementation Plan\" for this Trust Management Improvement Project.", "In January 1999, the Secretary ordered a reorganization of the OST, creating a principal deputy special trustee who would carry out policy and budget execution,budget formulation, and day-to-day operations, and to whom would report the trustfunds management office and the new office for trust litigation support and trustrecords management created by the same order. The then-Special Trustee resignedin protest. While Congress did not then enact proposed legislation prohibiting theimplementation of the Secretary's reorganization of the OST, the FY1999supplemental appropriations bill's conference report ( H.Rept. 106-143 ) expressedconcern about the Secretary's order and the department's implementation of the trustfund reform act and the High Level Implementation Plan.

The Senate amount was the same as the President'sFY2002 request and the FY2001 appropriation. Conference report languagerecommends that the additional funds for contract health services be distributed usinga methodology developed with tribes that took into account both needs and fundingdisparities.

Congress has triedin the past to ensure that the direct contract support funds are distributed fairly.", "For FY2002, Congress enacted the House recommendation of $268 million for contract support costs and costs for self-governance, 8% over FY2001 ($248million). The Senate had increased this funding by $40 million to $288 million inresponse to the Administration's request. The increased funding for contract supportcosts reflects the fact that more tribes and tribal organizations are participating in newand expanded self-determination contracts and self-governing compacts. However,the House was concerned that, while both the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) andIHS have similar programs, the IHS in FY2002 will pay $55 million in direct contractsupport operating costs while the BIA will pay nothing. In consequence the Houseinserted bill language that would have prevented IHS's funding of any new and/orexpanded contracts or compacts. The conference committee removed that billlanguage but agreed with House report language asking IHS to justify the need forthese funds in FY2003, and asking the Office of Management and Budget to establisha single, consistent policy for payment of contract support costs between the BIA andIHS.

The House recommended$369.8 million and the Senate $363 million ($6.9 million less than the House, andslightly less, $250,000, than the FY2001 level).

The Houserecommended that hospitals in Winnebago, NE, and Fort Defiance, AZ, receivefunding and that clinics in Pinon, AZ, Pawnee, OK, and Sisseton, SD, receiveappropriated funds. In addition, the House recommended supporting staff quarters(in Bethel, AK, and Zuni, NM), dental units, small ambulatory care facilities, andjoint ventures.

The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation(ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301 . The 1974 relocationlegislation ( P.L. 93-531 , as amended) was the end result of a dispute between theHopi and Navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal governmentfor a reservation in 1882. Pursuant to the 1974 act, lands were partitioned betweenthe two tribes. Members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribe's land were tobe relocated. ONHIR classifies families as relocated when they occupy theirreplacement home. Most relocatees are Navajo. A large majority of the estimated3,477 Navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the Hopi have alreadyrelocated under the Act, but the House Appropriations Committee estimates thatabout 300 families (almost all Navajo) have yet to complete relocation, includingabout 33 Navajo families still on Hopi partitioned land (some of whom refuse torelocate). The remaining families are not on Hopi partitioned land but are in variousstages of acquiring replacement housing.", "For FY2001, ONHIR received appropriations of $15.0 million. For FY2002, the Administration proposed $15.1 million, an increase of 1%. The FY2002appropriations law contained the same amount.

In 1995, the United States and the Hopi Tribe reached a proposedsettlement agreement on Hopi claims. Attached to the settlement agreement was aseparate accommodation agreement between the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo families,which provided for 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. TheNavajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-301 ) approved thesettlement agreement between the United States and the Hopi Tribe. Not all issueshave been resolved by these agreements, however, and opposition to the agreementsand the leases is strong among some of the Navajo families. Navajo families withhomesites on Hopi partitioned land faced a March 31, 1997, deadline for signing theleases (accommodation agreements). According to ONHIR, 70 of the 73 families onHopi-partitioned land had signed accommodation agreements by the end ofSeptember 1999.", "The Hopi Tribe called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases. Like the FY1997-FY2001 Interior appropriations acts, the FY2002law forbids ONHIR from evicting any Navajo family from Hopi partitioned landsunless a replacement home is provided. This language appears to prevent ONHIRfrom forcibly relocating Navajo families, since ONHIR has a large backlog of otherfamilies that need homes. The settlement agreement approved by P.L. 104-301 ,however, allows the Hopi Tribe under certain circumstances to beginquiet-possession actions against the United States after Feb. 1, 2000, if Navajofamilies on Hopi partitioned land have not either relocated or entered into leases withthe Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Tribe has agreed to let the federal government pursue thematter in court, but feels evictions should have started already.", "In the past, Congress has been concerned by the slow pace of relocation, and by relocatees' apparent low level of interest in moving to the \"new lands\" acquired forthe Navajo reservation for relocatee use. Appropriations committees from time totime have considered termination of the relocation program, but committee reportshave not discussed this option since FY1999.", "Other Related Agencies. One of the perennial issues addressed by Congress concerning the programs and agenciesdelineated below is whether federal government support for the arts and culture is anappropriate federal role, and if it is, what should be the shape of that support. If thecontinued federal role is not appropriate, might the federal commitment be scaledback such that greater private support or state support would be encouraged? Eachprogram has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue.", "Smithsonian.

Today,in addition to receiving federal appropriations, the Smithsonian has private trustfunds, which include contributions from private sources, grants and contracts, netinvestment income and business revenues from what the Smithsonian identifies as\"Business Ventures\" operations (including the Smithsonian magazine, retail shops,restaurants, concessions, catalogs, and entertainment initiatives, i.e. ResidentAssociates and other entertainment programs.) In FY1999, contributions fromprivate sources for designated projects totaled $123.6 million. The largest singlecontribution to the Smithsonian from a private donor (Steven F.

For the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), $30 million wasrequested for FY2002 to complete construction of the Mall museum. Initially, theNMAI was controversial; opponents argued that the current Smithsonian museumsneeded renovation, repair, and maintenance of the collection with an estimated 141million items, more than the public needed another museum on the Mall. Proponentsargued, however, that there had been too long a delay in providing a museum \"inWashington\" to house the Indian collection. Private donations to the Smithsonianand a fund-raising campaign focusing on individuals, foundations, and corporationstotaled $36.7 million, representing one-third of the original cost, and the amountrequired to meet the non-appropriated portion of project funding. Of this amount, anestimated $15 million came from the Indian community directly. Based on a newcost estimate of $186 million for the Indian museum, the Smithsonian identified ashortfall of $76 million and plans to ask for an additional $10 million in FY 2003.The groundbreaking ceremony for the NMAI took place September 28, 1999.

The Smithsonian contends that funding for repair and renewal of SI'sfacilities has not kept pace with need, resulting in increased deterioration of thephysical plant. In fact, the report of the Commission on the Future of theSmithsonian concluded that a total of $50 million each year for the next decadewould be necessary to \"assure that present facilities are restored to the point of beingsafe for people and collections;\" and considering the National Zoo separately, itwould need $10 million a year for the next 5 years. The FY2002 budget request ($67.9 million) included renovation for the Patent Office Building, the National Zoo,the National Museum of Natural History, and the Arts and Industries Building, androutine repair in all Smithsonian facilities.

TheSCMRE was established in 1963 to develop information to assist in the preservationof museum objects. The CRC facility was established 26 years ago on 3,150 acres inFront Royal to support endangered species propagation, conservation, training andresearch. The Smithsonian contended that although its effort to breed endangeredspecies for reintroduction into the wild has been important for internationalconservation and research efforts, it does not have sufficient funds to continue tokeep this property as a \"world class\" facility. Funds were to be redirected to publicprogram activity at the Zoo's Rock Creek location. A number of biologists whoworked with the CRC objected, stating that the kind of work done at the CRC isdependent on the natural habitat in Front Royal, Virginia. The FY2002 budgetoutlined a policy that the Smithsonian \"cannot continue to be the scientific, artistic,and historic smorgasbord of past decades\" and is \"prepared to pare back certainactivities and programs that do not fall with the Institution's sphere of excellence.\" On May 6, 2001, after the initial submission of the FY2002 budget, the Smithsonian,in response to scientists, reversed its policy with regard to the CRC and will continueto maintain it.

Someopponents of arts support argue that NEA and NEH should be abolished altogether,contending that the federal government should not be in the business of supportingarts and humanities. Other opponents argue that culture can and does flourish on itsown through private support. Proponents of federal support for arts and humanitiesargue that the federal government has a long tradition of support for culture,beginning as early as 1817, with congressional appropriations for works of art toadorn the U.S. Capitol. Some spokesmen for the private sector say that they areunable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts. Some argue that abolishing NEA and NEH would curtail or eliminate the programsthat have national significance and purpose (such as touring theater and dancecompanies, radio and television shows, traveling museum exhibitions, etc.) ThePresident's [Clinton] Committee on the Arts released a publication in 1997, CreativeAmerica, that recommended that federal funding be restored for NEA, NEH andIMLS to levels \"adequate to fulfill their national roles.\" The goal expressed was thatappropriations should have equaled $2.00 per person for arts and cultural funding bythe year 2000.", "NEA's direct grant program currently supports approximately 1,600 grants. State arts agencies are now receiving over 40% of grant funds, with 1,000communities participating nationwide, particularly those from under-representedareas.

Some controversy over previous questionable NEA grants seems to reappear when congressionalappropriations are considered, in spite of attempts to resolve these problems throughstatutory provisions. To date, no NEA projects have been judged obscene by thecourts. On November 5, 1996, a federal appeals court upheld an earlier decision, NEAv. Finley , ruling that applying the \"general standards of decency\" clause to NEAgrants was \"unconstitutional.\" However, in anticipation of congressional reaction toNEA's individual grants, NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline,except to maintain Literature fellowships, Jazz masters and National Heritagefellowships in the Folk and Traditional Arts. On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Courtreversed the federal appeals court decision for NEA v. Finley (CA9,100F.3d 671) bya vote of 8 to 1, stating that the NEA \"can consider general standards of decency\"when judging grants for artistic merit, and that the decency provision does not\"inherently interfere with First amendment rights nor violate constitutional vaguenessprinciples.\"", "Congress enacted NEA reform measures in past appropriations. Among them were increases in funding allocations from 35% to 40% to states for basic state artsgrants and for grants to under served populations. In addition, language emphasizingarts education was included. A 15% cap was placed on NEA funds allocated to eachstate, exempting only those grants with a national impact.

More recently, Congress has responded positively to numerous interests seekingmore funds for a wide variety of resource protection activities as this budgetconstraint has gradually disappeared. Also, the 106th Congress considered twoalternative approaches to provide more funding and more certain funding for resourceprotection activities, including federal land acquisition. One approach wasfree-standing legislation, known as CARA (Conservation and Reinvestment Act)( H.R. 701 ), that would have fully funded the LWCF for federal (andstate) land acquisition for 15 years. Versions of CARA would have addressed therole of the annual appropriations process in funding federal acquisitions in differentways. Some versions would have made LWCF funding mandatory, while otherversions would have continued the current requirement of making LWCF fundingsubject to annual appropriations. In the 106th Congress, H.R. 701 passedthe House and was reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and NaturalResources. In the 107th Congress, the House Resources Committee marked up andordered reported H.R. 701 on July 25, 2001. ", "The second approach was in the Clinton Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative, which consisted of requests for substantial increases in appropriations tomore than 2 dozen programs, including the Fund. While the 106th Congress did notenact CARA, it did provide increased funding for land acquisition as part of separatetitles for the Lands Legacy Initiative in appropriations legislation in both FY2000 andFY2001. It also provided a framework for funding these programs for each of thesubsequent 5 years, subject to appropriations. The House and Senate AppropriationsCommittees included these programs in a separate category called the ConservationSpending Category, in both Interior and Commerce appropriations laws, starting in FY2001. For FY2002, both chambers provided $1.32 billion for FY2002 in Interiorappropriations, an increase from $1.23 billion in FY2001, but allocated the funds insomewhat different ways, as shown in Table 12 . ", "In some recent years, Congress appropriated funds from the LWCF for purposes in addition to land acquisition. This first occurred when Congress provided $72million for other purposes in the FY1998 appropriations. Funding in FY1999 wasentirely for land acquisition; funding in FY2000 included $15 million for otherpurposes; and funding in FY2001 included $456 million for other purposes,according to the DOI. The amounts listed in Table 9 include these funds for otherpurposes. The appropriations for other purposes were primarily applied to otherprograms funded as a part of the Lands Legacy Initiative during FY2000 andFY2001. In FY2000, for example, included were $10 million for the Elwha Riverecosystem restoration and $5 million to address maintenance backlogs; this entireamount was credited to the NPS. These additional uses of the Fund are importantbecause it means that funding levels for the LWCF are becoming less synonymouswith funding for land acquisition. (See discussion of Fish and Wildlife Serviceappropriations for more detail on many of these proposals for FY2001 and FY2002.)", "The Bush Administration proposed to fully fund the LWCF at $900 million in FY2002. Fund experts at the DOI believe that this is the first time any President hascalled for full funding. The request sought to divide funding equally between federalagencies ($450 million) and the state grant program ($450 million), which may beused by the states and localities for acquisition and development. The federal portionfor land acquisition ($390 million) would be divided among the agencies as shownin Table 9 .", "Only $390 million would be used for federal land acquisition, because the FWS requested that $60 million of its portion be earmarked for FWS's incentive grantprogram. Of the $60 million, $50 million would provide technical and financialassistance to landowners as incentives \"to help them protect and manage habitat,while continuing to engage in traditional land use practices.\" The remaining $10million would provide stewardship grants to support individuals and groups engagedin voluntary land and wildlife conservation efforts. This is the first time that anadministration requested in its budget submission that a portion of the LWCFfunding be used for purposes other than land acquisition; previously, non-acquisitionuses of LWCF originated in Congress or by the Administration after theappropriations process had started. ", "For grants to states, the Administration proposed a distribution formula that makes 35% of the total available equally, and the remainder based 30% on land areaand 70% on population. By contrast, in recent years, the administration's decisionsfor allocating the funds among states has not been fully known, even by the end ofthe appropriations process. The proposed allocations would range from more than$29 million for California to $4.5 million for 4 states. Neither the House nor theSenate addressed how these funds should be distributed. ", "The total funding for LWCF in the House bill was $709 million, and in the Senate bill was $730 million; both are less than the President's $900 million request. The House supported the $390 million that the Bush Administration requested forfederal land acquisition, with no changes to the amounts for each agency, while theSenate bill increased the total by $16 million (to $406 million), primarily for theNational Park Service. However, both chambers reduced the \"stateside\" grantsrequest from $450 million (and in addition $60 million for certain FWS activities). The House reduced the amount to $319 million for \"state and other grants,\" whichwould include $154 million for NPS stateside grants, $100 million for state wildlifegrants, $5 million for competitive grants for Indian Tribes for wildlife programs, and$60 million to the FWS for activities other than land acquisition, under the proposedIncentive Grant Program, discussed in the Fish and Wildlife Service section. ", "The Senate concurred except that it provided an additional $10 million for stateside grants and did not fund grants for Indian tribes. It also added, as part of anen bloc Senate amendment, detailed instructions on how state wildlife grants are tobe distributed. In the same amendment, the Senate adopted a \"Sense of Congress\"provision which states the intent to provide a \"significant portion\" of federalrevenues from offshore oil and gas to those states that have supported those activities,but does not identify any specific program, such as the LWCF, which is funded byoffshore oil and gas revenues. ", "The FY2002 appropriations law contains a total of $708 million for LWCF, significantly less than the President's request and somewhat less than the House andSenate levels. That figure includes $429 million for federal land acquisition--morethan the President's request and the House and Senate levels, and $279 million forstate and other grants--less than the President's request and the House and Senatelevels. The law retains the distribution formula for state wildlife grants that wasincluded by the Senate, rather than the formula proposed by the House. The lawdrops the Senate language expressing the Sense of Congress regarding coastalimpact assistance.
