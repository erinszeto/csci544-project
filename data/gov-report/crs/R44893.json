This amount included a $379.0 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund to the Violence Against Women Programs account.

Total funding includes $492.0 million that is to be transferred from the Crime Victims Fund to the Office on Violence Against Women. In general, most DOJ grant programs were funded at or above the FY2017 level. Many of the programs that received the largest increases in funding are related to combatting opioid abuse.
