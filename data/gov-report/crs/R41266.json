A responsible party's liability under OPA is confined to specific categories of damages. Pursuant to OPA, the total liability for damages in connection with an oil spill is limited based on the type of vessel or facility involved, and the amount of oil discharged.

In general, claims for removal costs must be presented first to a responsible party. If the party to whom the claim is presented denies all liability for the claim, or if the claim is not settled by payment within 90 days after the claim was presented, the claimant may elect either to initiate an action in court against the responsible party or to present the claim directly to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.", "In limited situations, however, certain claims for removal costs may be presented initially to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. For example, if the President (acting through the Director of the National Pollution Funds Center) advertises or otherwise notifies claimants in writing, then such claimants may bypass the responsible party and present claims for removal costs directly to the Fund. A responsible party may also present claims for removal costs directly to the Fund.

", "For example, the Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, and sank two days later, is classified as a mobile offshore drilling unit. Initially, a mobile offshore drilling unit is deemed to be a tank vessel for the purposes of determining the responsible party's liability. In the event that damages exceed the liability limits for discharges from tank vessels, the mobile offshore drilling unit is deemed to be an offshore facility. Thus, if damages in the Gulf of Mexico exceed the liability limit established for tank vessels under OPA, the Deepwater Horizon would be deemed an offshore facility, and the liability for the \"responsible party\" could be limited to removal costs plus $75 million.", "The limitations on liability mentioned above, however, are subject to several exceptions. Specifically, if the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident is determined to be the result of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of federal safety, construction, or operating regulations by a responsible party, then the relevant liability limitation is not applicable.
