Various nutrients are also applied differently by farmers, based on knowledge about nutrient mobility in soils.

The nutrient content of manure can vary greatly depending on animal type, diet, bedding, moisture content, and storage method. ", "Prior to the development of inorganic fertilizers, organic \"wastes\" were a major source of nutrients for crop production. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 15.8 million acres, or about 5% of all U.S. cropland, use manure as fertilizer ( Table 1 ). A number of factors prevent a wider use of manure fertilization. Primarily, the cost of transporting manure can be prohibitive. The nutrient content of the manure, the type of crop grown and nutrients required (i.e., the nutrient needs of plants being grown may not match nutrients in readily available manure), compaction from manure application equipment, and the relative cost and availability of inorganic fertilizers, among other factors, also affect the use of organic wastes as fertilizers.", "From a livestock perspective, animal waste is a by-product of production that must be managed to avoid environmental harms and for the health of the animals themselves if raised in captivity. For a confined production system, manure must be utilized\u2014typically by being collected, stored, and distributed elsewhere, likely on available crop- or pastureland. In the case of grazing livestock, the animals deposit manure directly onto pastureland, thus fertilizing the associated grassland. High stocking rates, however, may lead to an imbalance, which in turn could create an excess supply of nutrients. If not properly managed, manure can adversely impact water quality through surface runoff and erosion, direct discharges to surface waters, spills and other dry-weather discharges, and leaching into soil and groundwater. It can also result in emission to the air of particles and gases such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic chemicals.", "Theoretically, of the total manure produced, more could be utilized on additional cropland than what is currently utilized in order to potentially reduce the risk of environmental harms from excessive concentrations. Regions with a higher capacity for manure are largely due to the type of soils and crops grown in the area. For example, the soils (mollisols) and crops (corn) grown in the Midwest are able to utilize additional nitrogen from manure ( Figure 3 ), whereas the soils (ultisols) and crops (cotton and rice) in the Southeast are able to handle more phosphorus from manure ( Figure 4 ). In some cases the ability to utilize additional manure application corresponds to areas with large livestock populations. In other cases, livestock production occurs in areas with ", "low or modest capacity to assimilate additional manure, thereby increasing the risk of excessive concentrations. When the amount of manure produced by an operation is more than the assimilative capacity of the land, an excess of manure is created ( Figure 5 and Figure 6 ).

For those waters, states must establish a total maximum daily load (TMDL) to ensure that water quality standards can be attained. A TMDL is essentially a pollution budget, a quantitative estimate of what it takes to achieve standards, setting the maximum amount of pollution that a waterbody can receive without violating standards. If a state fails to do this, EPA is required by the CWA to make its own TMDL determination for the state. Throughout the United States, more than 20,000 waterways are known to be violating applicable water quality standards and require a TMDL. Lawsuits have been brought with the intention of pressuring EPA and states to develop TMDLs because the waters have been identified as being impaired (that is, not meeting applicable water quality standards). The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is the largest single TMDL developed to date.", "Since 1995, EPA and states have developed a total of 69,205 TMDLs, addressing 72,653 causes of water quality impairment in U.S. waters.

According to EPA, 42,368 waterbodies remain impaired in the United States, due to 71,602 causes of impairment (i.e., a waterbody may be impaired by more than one pollutant). TMDLs are to be established for these waterbodies. Of the total known causes of current impairment, 7,166 (10%) are known to be caused by nutrients, and 5,993 (8.4%) are known to be caused by sediment.

As policymakers consider these issues, additional questions may be asked.", "Regulatory-Voluntary Balance : Currently, few environmental regulations govern nutrients from agriculture; instead, a more voluntary incentive-based approach is used. What benefits are achieved through the voluntary approach, and how could they be strengthened? Could additional benefits be achieved through regulation, and at what cost? What is an acceptable balance between the two? Federal-State-Local Balance : In many cases, the enforcement of federal laws that address environmental pollution is delegated to the states. Does this model work? Should more or less oversight or action occur, and at what level? How can regional and watershed planning impact the overall effectiveness of the current environmental laws? Use of Current Resources : Congress authorizes and appropriates billions of dollars for federal conservation efforts each year. Demand for these resources continues to outpace supply. How are current federal resources for conservation being utilized? How effective are they, and how can they be improved? Are federal leveraging programs\u2014such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, which leverages federal funds with private funds\u2014an effective way to extend the federal dollar? Agencies and stakeholders have suggested \"targeting\" limited resources to areas of greatest need. To what extent is targeting effective, and what barriers to targeting exist? The Source of the Problem : The exact sources and causes of nutrient pollution can vary greatly by location. Case study analysis and modeling can assist with identifying sources at the local level but provide little in the way of nationwide conclusions. What additional research or monitoring efforts are required to identify sources of nutrient pollution? At what level should these efforts occur\u2013\u2013field level, state level, nationally? Effectiveness of the Solution : Conservation BMPs are frequently held up as being the solution to agricultural nutrient pollution. What scientific evidence supports the use of these BMPs? Can additional research and innovation provide other \"tools\" in the response \"toolbox\"? Value Versus Cost of Conservation : Agricultural producers seek to maximize profit, while simultaneously minimizing cost. Does the value of conservation BMPs outweigh the cost? Are savings and efficiencies (if any) adequately communicated to producers to increase adoption? Consequences of Actions : Nutrient pollution may or may not directly impact the polluters themselves. According to ERS, the cost of removing nitrates from U.S. drinking water supplies is over $4.8 billion per year. The bulk of this cost is borne by large water utilities and then passed on to consumers. It is estimated that if the agricultural industry were required to pay based on its contribution to nitrate loading, agriculture's share would be about $1.7 billion per year. Who should bear the cost of nutrient loading? Can education and outreach connect on-farm actions to potential off-farm results?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Increased demand to feed a growing population is frequently cited as the reason for additional agricultural output.

The exact source of water impairments is frequently not identified until major ecological events prompt additional research. Even then, the nature of how nutrients move through the environment can make their origin difficult to track. It is agriculture's use of nutrients and large land-use presence across the United States that have brought attention to how the industry utilizes and manages nutrients. And while best management practices exist to eliminate or reduce nutrients from entering waterways, they are not required, they may not be effective or affordable in all locations, and the success will depend on how and where they are applied.", "Some advocate for the additional regulation of agricultural nutrient activities, while others seek to expand incentive-based resources. The track record of success and failure for both options varies, making the likely solution a balance of the two.
