The offenses, along with attempts or conspiracies to commit them, carry a term of imprisonment of up to 30 years in some cases, followed by a term of supervised release. Offenders also face the prospect of fines, orders to make restitution, and forfeiture of their property.", "The mail and wire fraud statutes overlap with a surprising number of other federal criminal statutes. Conduct that supports a prosecution under the mail or wire fraud statutes will often support prosecution under one or more other criminal provision(s). These companion offenses include (1) those that use mail or wire fraud as an element of a separate offense, like racketeering or money laundering; (2) those that condemn fraud on some jurisdictional basis other than use of the mail or wire communications, like those that outlaw defrauding the federal government or federally insured banks; and (3) those that proscribe other deprivations of honest services (i.e., bribery and kickbacks), like the statutes that ban bribery of federal officials or in connection with federal programs.", "Among the crimes for which mail or wire fraud may serve as an element, RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) outlaws employing the patterned commission of predicate offenses to conduct the affairs of an enterprise that impacts commerce. Money laundering consists of transactions involving the proceeds of a predicate offense in order to launder them or to promote further predicate offenses.", "The statutes that prohibit fraud in some form or another are the most diverse of the mail and wire fraud companions. Congress modeled some after the mail and wire fraud statutes, incorporating elements of a scheme to defraud or obtain property by false pretenses into statutes that outlaw bank fraud, health care fraud, securities fraud, and foreign labor contracting fraud. Congress designed others to protect the public fisc by proscribing false claims against the United States, conspiracies to defraud the United States by obstructing its functions, and false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of the United States and its departments and agencies.", "Federal bribery and kickback statutes populate the third class of wire and mail fraud companions.

From the beginning, Congress intended to reach a wide range of schemes to defraud, and has expanded the concept whenever doubts arose. It added the second prong\u2014obtaining money or property by false pretenses, representations, or promises\u2014after defendants had suggested that the term \"scheme to defraud\" covered false pretenses concerning present conditions but not representations or promises of future conditions. More recently, it added 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 to make it clear the term \"scheme to defraud\" encompassed schemes to defraud another of the right to honest services. Even before that adornment, the words were understood to \"refer 'to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes,' and 'usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.'\" ", "As a general rule, the crime is done when the scheme is hatched and an attendant mailing or interstate phone call or email has occurred. Thus, the statutes are said to condemn a scheme to defraud regardless of its success. It is not uncommon for the courts to declare that to demonstrate a scheme to defraud the government needs to show that the defendant's \"communications were reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\" Even a casual reading, however, might suggest that the statutes also cover a scheme specifically designed to deceive a na\u00efve victim. Nevertheless, the courts have long acknowledged the possibility of a \"puffing\" defense, and there may be some question whether the statutes reach those schemes designed to deceive the gullible though they could not ensnare the reasonably prudent.

United States limited its application to cases of bribery or kickbacks. The Court in Skilling supplied only a general description of the bribery and kickbacks condemned in the honest-services statute. Subsequent lower federal courts have often looked to the general federal law relating to bribery and kickbacks for the substantive elements of honest services bribery. In this context, bribery requires \"a quid pro quo\u2014a specific intent to give \u2026 something of value in exchange for an official act.\" And an \"official act\" means no more than an officer's formal exercise of governmental power in the form of a \"decision or action on a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy'\" before him.", "The definition of the word \"kickback\" quoted by the Court in Skilling has since been reassigned, and the courts have cited the dictionary definition on occasion.

A defendant with the same offense level 15 but with a criminal record placing him in criminal history category VI, would face imprisonment from between 41 and 51 months.

The Guidelines, however, recommend \"pure\" probation, that is, probation without any term of incarceration, only with respect to defendants with an offense level of 8 or below, i.e., levels where the sentencing range is between zero and six months. ", "Once a court has calculated the Guidelines' recommendations, it must weigh the other statutory factors found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before imposing a sentence. Appellate courts will uphold a sentence if the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable.
