Motorized recreation on NPS lands sometimes brings the two parts of this mission into conflict. Off-highway vehicles (OHVs) have been particularly controversial, with calls for greater recreational access intersecting with concerns about environmental impacts and disturbance of quieter pursuits. NPS's laws, regulations, and policies generally emphasize the conservation of park resources in conservation/use conflicts, and NPS has fewer lands open to OHV use than do other federal land management agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The 113th Congress has addressed motorized recreation through legislation and oversight, concerning broad issues such as recreational access to federal lands as well as individual conflicts at specific NPS units.", "ATVs and Oversand Vehicles. Only 13 of the 401 park units are open to public recreational use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), four-wheel drive vehicles, and/or dune, sand, and swamp buggies. The extent of unauthorized use of such vehicles is in dispute. Several units have developed pilot education and deterrence programs to address unauthorized use. Legislative measures in the 113th Congress (H.R. 819, H.R. 2954, S. 486) seek to regulate OHV use at one NPS site, Cape Hatteras National Seashore.", "Snowmobiles. Regulatory and judicial actions to allow or restrict snowmobile use have focused primarily on three Yellowstone-area park units. Winter use plans developed by NPS to establish numerical limits on snowmobile and snowcoach entries have been the subject of repeated, and often conflicting, court challenges. Most recently, NPS issued a final rule governing snowmobile use at Yellowstone for the 2014-2015 winter season and beyond. The rule allows up to 110 \"transportation events\" per day (defined as the use of either a multipassenger snowcoach or a group of snowmobiles).", "Aircraft Overflights. Grand Canyon National Park is at the center of a conflict over whether or how to limit air tours over national park units to reduce noise. NPS and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continue to work to implement a 1987 law (P.L. 100-91) that sought to reduce noise at Grand Canyon, and a 2000 law (P.L. 106-181) that regulates overflights at other park units. P.L. 112-141, enacted in 2012, contains provisions on air tour management at Grand Canyon, including some less-stringent standards for natural quiet than NPS had recommended in planning efforts. P.L. 112-95 contains provisions to expedite and streamline agency planning actions for commercial air tours over parks generally.", "Personal Watercraft (PWC). Since 2003, NPS has completed regulations to open designated PWC areas at 13 units. In 2010, a federal judge ordered NPS to re-examine environmental assessments justifying PWC use at two of those units but did not overturn existing regulations.", "Mountain Bicycles. This mechanized though nonmotorized activity also raises issues of the sufficiency of access to park lands as well as potential resource damage and disturbance of quieter recreational pursuits. Currently, more than 40 NPS units allow mountain biking on dirt trails and/or dirt roads. Mountain biking advocates have worked with NPS to explore opportunities to increase this activity in park units.

OHV supporters contend that the vehicles allow visitors access to hard-to-reach natural areas; bring economic benefits to communities serving riders; provide outdoor recreation opportunities for the disabled, senior citizens, and others with mobility limitations; and, in the case of snowmobiles, allow increased access to sites during winter. They assert that technological advances will continue to limit noise and pollution. ", "By contrast, opponents of OHVs in the National Park System assert that these vehicles damage the environment and cultural artifacts, pose safety concerns, and conflict with other forms of recreation. NPS staffing levels, they contend, are inadequate to effectively monitor motorized use and its impact on park resources. Opponents also cite the availability of other federal lands, such as BLM and FS lands, where OHV use may be permitted. Among environmental concerns raised by OHV critics are potential damage to wildlife habitat and land and water ecosystems; the impact of dust on winter snow melts and water supply; noise, air, and water pollution; and a diminished experience for recreationists seeking quiet and solitude and/or hunting and fishing opportunities. Critics also point to the beneficial economic impact of nonmotorized recreation on local communities.", "The 113 th Congress has addressed motorized recreation in the National Park System through legislation and oversight. Bills concerning motorized recreation at NPS units include H.R. 819 , H.R. 2954 , and S. 486 , all of which would change regulations for OHVs at Cape Hatteras National Seashore; and H.R. 3590 , as amended ( H.Amdt. 538 ), which would prohibit NPS from altering regulations that allow the use of motorized vessels for fishing at Ozark National Scenic Riverways. In its oversight role, the House Natural Resources Committee has held hearings on outdoor recreation, including motorized and nonmotorized uses, on federal lands. A May 2013 hearing addressed outdoor recreation issues such as insurance and permitting problems for outfitters and guides.

The regulations also require special rulemaking, with environmental impact analysis and public comment, to designate routes and areas for OHVs in these park units. NPS's management policies provide additional guidance, stating that OHV use \"may be allowed only in locations where there will be no adverse impacts on the area's natural, cultural, scenic, and esthetic values, and in consideration of other existing or proposed recreational uses.\" In general, the management policies emphasize the conservation of park resources in conservation/use conflicts.

Instead, snowmobile use in the National Park System is governed by separate regulations that limit such vehicles to designated routes and water surfaces that are used by motor vehicles or motorboats during other seasons. The regulations prohibit snowmobiles except \"when their use is consistent with the park's natural, cultural, scenic and aesthetic values, safety considerations, [and] park management objectives, and will not disturb wildlife or damage park resources.\" NPS management policies further state that snowmobile use can be authorized only where it will not result in unacceptable impacts.", "The enabling legislation for individual NPS units may establish specific activities as an appropriate use (e.g., water-oriented recreation, snowmobiling for subsistence or recreational purposes, or OHV travel to reach hunting or fishing areas).

Bush Administration took a different approach, replacing the Clinton rules with regulations in December 2003 that eliminated the snowmobile ban in favor of daily entry limits, use of trained guides, snowmobile emission standards, and monitoring by park managers for impacts from air and noise pollution. The Clinton plan would not have allowed any snowmobiles at Yellowstone; the Bush plan would have allowed 950 per day. Both plans, as well as most subsequent revisions, were vacated by different federal courts. Conflicting rulings in subsequent legal challenges created confusion for park visitors, local communities, and businesses, with many unsure what winter use rules were in effect at Yellowstone.

Starting with the 2014-2015 seasons, Yellowstone will measure winter use in a new way, through \"transportation events\" instead of vehicle limits. The regulations allow up to 110 transportation events per day, defined as the use of one snowcoach or one group of an average of seven snowmobiles. Most but not all of the vehicles are to be commercially guided, with tour operators allocating the \"events\" among snowmobiles and snowcoaches. No later than the 2016-2017 winter season, vehicles will have to meet \"new best available technology\" requirements.", "The governor of Wyoming and the Wyoming congressional delegation have supported the plan's balance between economic and conservation priorities. For example, the regulations increase the maximum number of snowmobiles per day (from the current 318 to potentially up to 480, depending on the distribution of snowcoach and snowmobile use), but also anticipate reductions in noise and pollution because snowmobile trips will be packaged together and guides have incentives to achieve environmental performance standards. Some snowmobile user groups, as well as some environmental groups, have also expressed support for the plan. However, conservation groups have also challenged claims by snowmobile advocates that vehicle technology is evolving to produce a \"cleaner, quieter\" experience for park visitors.

The plan seeks in part to identify sources of sound, develop soundscape standards and ensure that standards are being met, eliminate or mitigate sounds incompatible with park purposes, and restore degraded soundscapes.

The provisions seek to expedite and streamline agency actions, in part because of the slow progress in completing ATMPs. They provide that, in lieu of an ATMP, the NPS director and FAA administrator may enter into a voluntary agreement with a commercial air tour operator that would govern commercial air tours over a park unit. Before implementing a voluntary agreement, the agencies must provide for an opportunity for public review and consult with Indian tribes on affected tribal lands; agreements may be implemented \"without further administrative or environmental process\" beyond that described in the law. Voluntary agreements may contain provisions to establish conditions for the conduct of commercial air tours, ensure compliance, provide for fees for commercial air tours, and provide incentives for the adoption of quiet aircraft technology by commercial tour operators. Park units with 50 or fewer annual air tour flights are exempt from the requirement for an ATMP or voluntary agreement. However, the NPS director can withdraw an exemption in order to protect park resources and values or visitor use and enjoyment. ", "The law also allows agencies to modify interim operating authority, which could provide for additional authority because interim conditions have prevailed for longer than had been anticipated. It also establishes reporting requirements for commercial air tour operators on the number of air tours over each national park unit. ", "Another provision of P.L. 112-95 pertains only to Crater Lake National Park. It allows the NPS director to deny an application to begin commercial air tours at the park before the establishment of an air tour management plan. Subsequently, P.L. 112-141 extended the provision to Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and to applications to expand operations at both park units.

Adding to the conflict are economic considerations, with some asserting that restrictions on motorized recreation harm local industries that serve vehicle users, while others contend that growth in motorized recreation damages valuable natural resources that also draw visitors to the parks and support gateway communities. NPS's laws, regulations, and policies generally emphasize the conservation of park resources in conservation/use conflicts, and NPS has fewer lands open to off-highway vehicles than do other federal land management agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service.
