This report answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about E.O. 13813 and subsequent rulemaking and provides background information about AHPs, STLDI, and HRAs.", "Association health plan is an umbrella term that represents a spectrum of arrangements that provide health coverage to a collective body of employers or individuals (e.g., self-employed persons). AHP coverage may be provided through different types of organizations, including but not limited to trade associations, professional societies, and chambers of commerce. Given the absence of a federal definition for either association health plan or association coverage, applicable federal agencies have indicated that a given AHP should be regulated according to the characteristics of the organization offering the AHP coverage and plan enrollees. Generally, association coverage is addressed through sub-regulatory guidance. The vast majority of AHPs provide either individual or small-group coverage, as determined by federal regulatory agencies. On January 5, 2018, the Department of Labor issued a proposed regulation that would amend the federal definition of employer. The proposed amendment potentially could allow certain AHPs that currently are regulated as individual or small-group coverage to be regulated as large-group coverage instead, and it could encourage the formation of new AHPs. Such a change would reduce the overall scope of federal requirements applicable to those AHPs. AHP proponents argue that the proposed changes would expand coverage options and reduce premiums for certain consumers. AHP opponents argue that those changes would raise premiums for consumers with greater health care needs, particularly in the individual market.", "Short-term, limited-duration insurance is a type of health insurance that generally is designed to fill gaps in health insurance coverage, particularly for individuals transitioning from one type of coverage to another. STLDI is defined in regulations as health insurance coverage with a maximum duration of three months (including any extensions a consumer may request) that is marketed and issued with disclaimer language about the coverage not being considered minimum essential coverage for purposes of avoiding the individual mandate penalty. Beyond this definition, STLDI is not subject to federal requirements applicable to health coverage. On February 21, 2018, the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, and the Treasury jointly issued proposed regulations that would increase the maximum duration of STLDI from 3 months to 12 months, make policy extensions easier, and modify the required disclaimer language. Proponents of expanding access to STLDI argue that these changes would provide more insurance options for consumers; opponents of the proposed changes have emphasized the potential negative impacts on the risk pool for the individual market for comprehensive coverage.", "Health reimbursement arrangements are employer-established arrangements that pay or reimburse employees for substantiated medical care expenses up to a maximum dollar amount. HRAs are funded solely by employers; employees cannot contribute to HRAs. Payments and reimbursements from an HRA for an employee's substantiated medical care expenses (and those of the employee's spouse and dependents) are excluded from the employee's income and employment taxes. In general, employers may offer to employees only HRAs that are integrated with another group health plan (that is not an HRA).

Like other viable industries, the private health insurance market evolves as stakeholders make decisions in response to or anticipation of conditions outside of their immediate control (such as economic conditions) or decisions made by other stakeholders. For instance, regulators may affect the regulatory environment through legislation. Depending on the scope of the legislative changes, insurers may change their behavior in terms of the geographic areas in which they operate, the types of insurance products they sell, how much they charge in premiums, etc. In turn, consumers, employers, and other purchasers of insurance may adjust their behavior in response to both legislative and market changes. In more recent years, the health insurance market has undergone significant change due to the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended), particularly in the individual and small-group segments of that market. While the total number of persons with health coverage in those market segments has increased overall, compared to enrollment prior to ACA enactment, the costs of coverage have continued to increase.

For instance, the order's AHP directive addresses definitions in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that align with the executive order's intention of \"allowing [small businesses] to group together to self-insure or purchase large group health insurance.\" In contrast, STLDI is private insurance that is designed for individuals. Unlike AHPs or STLDI, through which individuals receive coverage, an HRA is an account authorized under the tax code that pays for or reimburses employees' medical expenses. Given the substantive differences among these three health options, applicable policy issues, current federal requirements, and possible changes identified under the executive order differ. Moreover, the scope of applicable regulations and guidance varies across the three coverage options, contributing to the different changes identified in the executive order (and related proposed rules). ", "Although the focus of this report is E.O. 13813 and federal regulation of private health insurance coverage, it should be noted that states are the primary regulators of insurance and state laws apply to most types of private coverage. In some cases, however, state laws do not apply, as with self-insured arrangements (with exceptions) and tax-advantaged health accounts (such as HRAs) that are authorized under the federal tax code.

Although discussions about AHPs often focus on small businesses, large businesses also may participate in the collective purchasing of health insurance through AHPs.

Moreover, AHPs may encompass arrangements beyond what is implied by the term association. Although individuals and employers may join associations through which they receive membership benefits, such as health coverage, there are other relevant arrangements. For example, instead of joining a trade association, some employers may participate in a purchasi ng pool or purchasing alliance : an organization explicitly established for the purpose of providing health coverage. These and other arrangements were acknowledged in guidance concerning association coverage; association coverage is coverage offered through \"entities that may be called associations, trusts, multiple employer welfare arrangements ('MEWAs'), purchasing alliances, or purchasing cooperatives.\" The lack of uniformity across AHPs also contributes to the paucity of data regarding the count of such plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Do AHPs Operate Within the Private Health Insurance Market?", "paragraphs": ["AHPs play a unique role in that individuals or employers obtain coverage as a collective body instead of as separate individuals or employers. ", "The practice of individuals or employers joining together to obtain coverage has a long history, well preceding the ACA. The intention behind these efforts is to replicate the natural advantages larger groups have in the private health insurance market. A larger group means more individuals over which the group can spread insurance risk. The larger the group, the less likely that serious medical experiences of one or a few persons will result in catastrophic financial loss for the entire group. Also, the administrative costs associated with managing health benefits are lower (as a share of premiums collected) for larger groups compared with small groups and individuals. In the case of a very large group, the group may be able to exert greater market power in negotiations with issuers. In addition to these market advantages, there are fewer federal requirements imposed on the large-group market compared with the small-group or individual market (such as fewer benefit mandates and restrictions on rate setting), which may act as an incentive to establish a large-group AHP.

Instead, relevant federal agencies have indicated that a given AHP should be regulated according to the characteristics of the organization offering the AHP coverage and plan enrollees. For example, AHP coverage provided by a hypothetical association of freelance photographers generally would be regulated as individual coverage at the federal level. Similarly, coverage provided through an association consisting of employers would be regulated according to the features of that association, such as size of employers (small or large) and funding arrangement (fully insured or self-funded). Overall, the vast majority of AHPs provide either individual or small-group coverage, as determined by federal regulatory agencies (see the following discussion about regulatory activities at the Department of Labor [DOL] and the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]).", "AHP coverage that is provided through an association of employers is regulated under ERISA, under the jurisdiction of DOL. ERISA-regulated plans are subject to a variety of requirements, including fiduciary standards and reporting and disclosure requirements. The coverage itself is subject to multiple requirements related to benefits, premiums, cost-sharing requirements, and other consumer protections. Generally, DOL regulates AHPs as a type of multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA): an arrangement through which two or more employers, not subject to collective bargaining, provide health and other benefits to employees (and their dependents). DOL's regulation of AHPs has relied on sub-regulatory guidance, typically in the form of advisory opinions. Among the factors reviewed by DOL in these opinions, the agency considers whether there is a genuine relationship between the association and the employer members of that association, whether the association acts in the interest of those members, and whether the employers exercise control over the plan ( commonality of interest standard). It is through these advisory opinions that DOL has concluded that in most instances an association is not considered an employer for purposes of regulating the association coverage. Instead, the employers who comprise the association membership constitute individual employers who are the sponsors of distinct employer plans. The determination of which entity constitutes the employer significantly affects the application of federal requirements, given that the size for one large association may greatly differ from the sizes of each member employer. ", "In addition to ERISA, AHPs are subject to requirements under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Similar to ERISA, regulation of AHPs under the PHSA depends on the characteristics of the AHP sponsor and coverage. Whether an AHP is considered coverage for individuals, small groups, or large groups or a self-funded plan substantively affects the scope of requirements under the PHSA. HHS guidance has concluded that \"in most situations involving employment-based association coverage, the group health plan exists at the individual employer level and not at the association-of-employers level.\" Consequently, the size of each association member (i.e., employer) determines whether the coverage is regulated as small-group or large-group coverage. Also, association coverage that is not provided in connection with a group health plan is not group coverage for PHSA purposes; such coverage would be subject to individual insurance requirements. For example, coverage provided through an association consisting only of self-employed persons with no employees of their own would not be considered a group health plan at the federal level. Therefore, it would be regulated as individual insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Has Federal Regulation of AHPs Changed in Recent Years?", "paragraphs": ["The ACA included only a couple of narrowly drafted provisions related to the regulation of AHPs. Nonetheless, the ACA modified and added multiple requirements applicable to health issuers and the insurance products they sell. Consequently, association coverage is subject to federal requirements added or amended by the ACA. For example, prior to the ACA, there were few federal requirements regarding coverage for specific benefits. The ACA substantively expanded benefit mandates by requiring issuers in the small-group and individual insurance markets to offer the essential health benefits (EHB), 10 broad categories of health services and items (e.g., maternity and newborn care). Large-group issuers and self-funded plans are exempt from the EHB requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Changes to AHPs Have Been Proposed in Response to E.O. 13813?", "paragraphs": ["On January 5, 2018, DOL issued a proposed regulation concerning AHPs. In keeping with the directives stated in E.O. 13813 (see Table 1 ), the rule proposes to expand the definition of employer for the purpose of sponsoring group coverage and relaxing the commonality of interest standard (see \" How Are AHPs Currently Regulated? \"). The rule proposes, among other things, that an association formed primarily or solely for the purpose of sponsoring a group health plan, and whose membership is comprised of employers either in the same industry or operating in the same geographic area, would meet the definition of employer under ERISA. The rule also would treat working owner s simultaneously as employers and employees, essentially allowing self-employed persons and sole proprietors who meet specified requirements to sponsor AHP coverage and receive such coverage. In addition, the rule includes certain nondiscrimination provisions to prohibit an association from basing membership, eligibility for health benefits, and premiums on health factors . ", "DOL sought comments on a number of issues addressed in the proposed rule, including the commonality of interest standard, the definition of working owner, and nondiscrimination requirements. The rule did not explicitly provide a definition for association health plan , nor did it amend the applicability of \"existing generally applicable federal regulatory standards governing ERISA plans.\" Collectively, the changes proposed in the rule would allow AHPs currently regulated as small-group or individual coverage at the federal level to be regulated as large-group coverage instead, as long as the group meets the size definition of a large group. Consequently, AHPs could be subject to fewer federal requirements overall if the proposed changes were finalized, such as the EHB example described previously and certain provisions concerning the determination of premiums. The reduced regulatory burden could affect the regulation of current AHPs and encourage the formation of new AHPs. (For additional background and discussion about key legal considerations related to the AHP proposed rule, see CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10078, Association Health Plans: Some Key Aspects of the Labor Department's Proposed Rule .)", "In the preamble to the proposed AHP rule, DOL states that allowing associations to \"offer health coverage to their members' employees under a single plan may ... offer many small businesses more affordable alternatives than are currently available to them in the individual or small-group markets.\" DOL also states that these regulatory changes may prompt businesses that currently do not offer coverage and uninsured individuals to form associations. The agency notes that concerns about risk selection (specifically, healthy individuals being drawn out of the existing private market into AHPs) prompt the inclusion of the provisions prohibiting discrimination based on health factors. ", "There are differing opinions about the potential impact of the proposed changes. AHP proponents argue that the proposal will not only lead to an expansion of coverage options but also lower premiums for those options. However, AHP opponents argue that the offer of such coverage will have adverse effects on certain consumer groups and the private market. For example, large-group AHPs would be allowed to offer coverage that is less comprehensive than EHBs, potentially rendering such coverage less valuable to consumers with high health care needs. Moreover, the option of less comprehensive coverage for a lower premium may draw out healthy consumers from the individual and small-group markets. This shift in enrollment to AHPs may potentially lead to higher premiums for consumers outside of AHPs, particularly in the individual market. AHP proponents counter that inclusion of nondiscrimination provisions in the proposed rule, and the continued applicability of federal requirements not modified by the rule, provides adequate protections for consumers.

An AHP is not a state-licensed issuer. ", "A point of confusion with these two concepts\u2014AHPs and selling insurance across state lines\u2014is related to the current treatment of self-funded health plans. Under ERISA, self-funded plans generally are exempt from state laws that relate to employment-based benefits. For example, a large employer with employees in a number of states may ignore state-specific benefit mandates and instead offer the same set of health benefits in multiple states if the employer self-funds those benefits. The practice of self-funding health coverage in multiple states mirrors the concept of an issuer selling insurance across state lines, even though a self-funded plan technically is not insurance and the plan sponsor (employer, association, or other group) is not a state-licensed issuer.

In addition, reimbursements can be limited to amounts previously contributed. Unused balances may be carried over indefinitely, though employers may limit the aggregate carryovers.
