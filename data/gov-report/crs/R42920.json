Motorized recreation on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) has been controversial, with issues centering on access and environmental impacts. Congress, as well as the Administration, has addressed motorized recreation on these federal lands.", "The use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs) on FS and BLM land is governed by a number of authorities, including law, executive orders, agency regulations and policies, land management plans, and area-specific decisions. Both agencies decide the extent of allowed OHV use in particular areas through their planning processes. Under BLM regulations, the agency has been designating public lands as open, limited, or closed to OHV use. Similarly, under FS regulations governing OHVs, the FS is designating roads, trails, and areas open for OHV use and prohibiting OHV use outside the designated system. The designations for some BLM and FS lands have been contentious.", "BLM also has been addressing motorized recreation as part of a broader effort to manage all modes of travel and public access, including through the issuance of a 2011 manual and a 2012 handbook on travel and transportation management. The goal of BLM's Comprehensive Travel and Transportation Management program is to provide varied transportation routes for access to BLM lands and provide areas for a variety of motorized and non-motorized forms of recreation, while protecting sensitive areas. Travel and transportation management plans are developed for particular areas. Also, in response to recommendations of the Government Accountability Office regarding OHV use on federal lands, BLM has taken actions in areas including planning, law enforcement, and communication with the public.", "The FS continues to develop motor vehicle use maps showing where motor vehicle use is allowed, based on its 2005 travel management regulations. These regulations continue to be under debate, with some asserting that they do not sufficiently protect national forest lands from damage resulting from OHVs, and others contending that motorized access is too restricted. Similarly, some of the agency's travel management plans have been challenged for either being too restrictive or not restrictive enough.", "One bill with provisions on motorized recreation on FS lands (H.R. 145) has been introduced in the 113th Congress to date. In the 112th Congress, no general legislation on OHV activities on BLM and FS lands was introduced. However, a variety of legislative measures sought to regulate OHV use on particular lands administered by the BLM, the FS, or both agencies. For instance, some measures relating to BLM lands sought to establish recreation areas in general, or OHV areas in particular. Other bills provided for conveyance of BLM land for recreation purposes, including motorized recreation. Measures pertaining to FS lands addressed motorized recreation in areas with special designations, including wilderness. Other FS bills sought to designate other types of areas, such as special management areas and recreation management areas, and govern the use of motorized vehicles in those areas.

The Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture owns the second-largest amount\u2014193.0 million acres. The BLM manages the public lands and the FS manages the national forests for varied purposes relating to the preservation, development, and use of the lands and natural resources. These purposes include livestock grazing, wild horses and burros, recreation, timber, fish and wildlife, cultural resources, conservation, and mineral exploration and development.", "The preservation/use dichotomy is a focal point for debate over recreation on BLM and FS lands. Increased recreation, and allegations of overuse in some areas, contribute to disagreement on issues of access, regulation, integrity of natural and cultural resources, and extent of motorized versus nonmotorized recreational activities. Recreation debates also may arise in areas managed by other federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, and in the context of lands within cross-cutting systems, such as the National Trails System, administered by the FS, NPS, and BLM, often in cooperation with state and local authorities.", "The population growth and development in western states, the proximity of many urban areas to public lands, and the growing popularity of outdoor recreation have translated into high demand for a variety of recreational opportunities on federal lands and waters. BLM, for example, reported that over 55 million people live within 25 miles of its National System of Public Lands and that two-thirds of BLM-administered lands are within 50 miles of an urban area. Agency figures indicate an overall increase in recreational visits to federal lands in recent decades. The FY2013 DOI budget documents cited approximately 478 million annual recreational visits to DOI managed lands, including 57.8 million visits to BLM lands. The FS reported approximately 201.6 million annual recreational visits to National Forest System lands (including wilderness). ", "Access to BLM, FS, and other federal lands for a variety of recreational purposes is generally viewed as important for fostering public health, public support for land management, and a stable economic base for communities that depend on recreation and tourism. Some recreational advocates have expressed support for increased access to BLM and FS lands on the grounds that in some areas lands are inaccessible or access is limited. Recreational access also has enhanced interest in protecting the ecological integrity of federal lands from environmental harm as a result of recreational use. ", "This report concentrates on motorized recreation on BLM and FS lands. Over the last half century or so, forms of motorized recreation\u2014snowmobiles, personal watercraft, other off-highway vehicles\u2014and a variety of newer recreational activities, such as mountain biking, snow biking, heli-skiing, kite skiing, and hang gliding, have evolved and gained in popularity. These new forms intersect with the many popular traditional forms of recreation, including water-based activities (fishing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, boating, etc.) and a variety of land-based pursuits (birdwatching, camping, hiking, hunting, horseback riding, rock climbing, etc.). ", "The use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs) on federal lands and waters has been particularly contentious, and lawsuits have challenged their management. OHV supporters contend that these vehicles provide outdoor recreation opportunities for the disabled, senior citizens, and others with mobility limitations; allow visitor access to hard-to-reach natural areas; bring economic benefits to communities serving riders; and, for snowmobiles, allow increased access to sites during the winter season. They assert that technological advances do and will continue to limit noise and pollution. Critics of OHVs point to the beneficial economic impact of nonmotorized recreation on local communities. They also raise environmental concerns, including potential damage to wildlife habitat and land and water ecosystems, such as the impact of dust on winter snow melts and water supply; noise, air, and water pollution; and a diminished experience for recreationists seeking quiet and solitude and/or hunting and fishing opportunities. ", "Clashes over off-road use could be intensifying in some areas for riders, law enforcement officers, and property owners as OHV ridership increases and the amount of land available to OHVs diminishes. For example, BLM and FS are identifying lands for OHV use and limiting or prohibiting OHV use in other areas. A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report examined OHV use and impacts on federal lands, and documented agency OHV enforcement, planning, and management challenges. Further, development has reduced availability of private lands to OHVs. As limitations on land management agency staffs and budgets, and the remoteness of many public lands, exacerbate enforcement challenges, some interest groups have worked together to identify successful enforcement strategies or to develop educational guidance for shared trail use and safety.", "Federal OHV challenges and approaches to their management also are reflected in individual state legislative efforts to address OHV management and law enforcement. State measures focus on a range of actions\u2014safety, wildlife habitat and private property protection, registration requirements and fees, and collaborative approaches to enforcement. Some measures have been challenged.

It was issued to \"establish policies and provide for procedures that will ensure that the use of off-road vehicles on public lands will be controlled and directed so as to protect the resources of those lands, to promote the safety of all users of those lands, and to minimize conflicts among the various uses of those lands.\" The order directed each agency to develop and issue regulations to carry out this purpose and to provide for the designation of areas and trails on which OHVs may be permitted, and areas in which such vehicles would not be permitted. Agencies were to monitor the effects of OHV use and amend or rescind area designations or other actions taken pursuant to the order as needed to further the policy of the executive order.", "A subsequent executive order (E.O. 11989, May 24, 1977) amended the 1972 order to exclude military, emergency, and law enforcement vehicles from the definition of off-road vehicles (to which restrictions would apply). It provided authority to immediately close areas or trails if OHVs were causing or would cause considerable damage to the soil, vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitat, or cultural or historic resources of particular areas or trails. Areas could remain closed until the manager determined that \"the adverse effects have been eliminated and that measures have been implemented to prevent future recurrence.\" Also, each agency was authorized to adopt the policy that areas could be closed to OHV use except for those areas or trails that are specifically designated as open to such use. This meant that only open areas would have to be marked, a lesser burden on the agencies.", "BLM and FS managers formulate guidance on the nature and extent of land uses, including OHV use, through regulations, national policies, land and resource management plans, and area-specific decisions. Guidance for each agency, the planning process for designating OHV use, and related agency actions are discussed in the respective BLM and FS \"Administrative Actions\" sections below. In addition, in some cases, the BLM and FS jointly address OHV use on their lands. For instance, an interagency plan governs OHV use on lands in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Also, in central Oregon, one BLM district (Pineville) and two national forests (Deschutes and Ochoco) jointly manage OHV operations on their lands. Joint management approaches, where federal lands are intermingled, can promote consistency and public understanding of OHV guidance. However, BLM and FS lands are different, and they are governed by separate authorities, making complete consistency on vehicular travel management difficult to achieve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": ["Congress has addressed motorized recreation on both BLM and FS lands (as well as other federal lands) through legislation and oversight hearings.

BLM lands are used for diverse forms of recreation, including hunting, fishing, visiting cultural and natural sites, birdwatching, hiking, picnicking, camping, boating, mountain biking, and off-road vehicle driving. The growing and diverse nature of recreation on BLM lands has increased the challenge of managing different types of recreation, such as low impact (e.g., hiking) and high impact (e.g., OHV) uses. It also has increased the challenge of managing recreation and other land uses. For instance, in some areas recreation and energy development have come in conflict, with hunters, fishermen, outfitters and guides, and other recreationists at odds with energy producing interests seeking to maintain or increase energy development on public lands. ", "Motorized OHV use, including use of dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles, is a major recreational use of BLM lands that has been controversial. Controversy exists in various areas throughout the West, such as the Canyonlands areas in Utah, and the Western Mojave Desert in California. While motorized user groups often have opposed restrictions on OHV use, many environmentalists have been concerned about harm to natural and cultural resources. In some areas, OHV use may conflict with those engaged in other types of recreation, such as hiking, who seek quiet and solitude on agency lands. There are also differing views on how effectively OHV authorities are being enforced. While BLM employs a variety of means of enforcement, including monitoring, law enforcement, signing and mapping, and emergency closures of routes, enforcement may be impeded in some locations due to their remoteness, insufficient signs, inadequate staff and resources, and other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Actions", "paragraphs": ["BLM manages about 247.5 million acres of land. Guidance on OHV use on BLM lands is provided in law, executive orders, and agency regulations and policies. Under agency regulations (43 C.F.R. \u00a78340), BLM has been designating public lands as open, limited, or closed to OHV use. As of November 30, 2012, the following designations had been made: closed, where OHV use is prohibited, 13.1 million acres (6% of designated area); limited, where OHV use is in some way restricted, 146.6 million acres (65%); and open, where OHV use is permitted anywhere, 66.0 million acres (29%). The remaining acres of BLM land (mostly in Alaska) are not currently designated. Because BLM management plans do not address motorized use in these undesignated areas, there are no restrictions. Other regulations govern OHV use in particular areas. For instance, BLM has supplementary rules for its lands in Oregon and Washington, which include guidance on OHV use. On August 18, 2010, the agency issued revisions to these rules (effective September 17, 2010), in part to address OHV use in the Juniper Dunes OHV/ATV area in Washington.", "Over the past decade, BLM has issued other types of guidance dealing with transportation on its lands. For instance, in 2001 the agency issued the National Management Strategy for Motorized Off-Highway Vehicle Use on Public Lands . The strategy has multiple purposes, including to guide land managers in resolving OHV issues; to promote consistency of OHV decision-making; to highlight needed staff and funding for OHV management; to reduce conflicts among land users; to promote responsible OHV use and reduce habitat degradation; and to lead to an update of OHV regulations (which has not occurred to date). More recently, in 2011, BLM issued a manual on travel and transportation management, and in 2012 the agency released a related handbook, to cover planning and management of all modes of travel and public access needs. The documents are intended to serve as a guide for BLM field offices to improve travel planning, signing, mapping, and travel information. Further, the BLM's National Training Center has initiated a training program on travel and transportation planning and management for BLM field units. Seven training sessions were conducted in FY2012 and 13 are planned for FY2013. ", "BLM manages transportation on its lands through a process described as Comprehensive Travel and Transportation Management. Goals include providing varied transportation routes for access to BLM lands and providing areas for a variety of motorized and non-motorized forms of recreation, while protecting sensitive areas. Travel and transportation management plans are developed for particular areas. As of September 30, 2011, 142 BLM areas have completed travel management plans. These plans average roughly 250,000 acres, and together cover about 32.5 million acres. BLM expects to complete a total of 554 plans covering 231 million acres, with two-thirds of BLM lands expected to have plans in place by 2020. Implementation of travel management plans involves issuing maps; posting signs; educating land users; constructing, reconstructing, and maintaining roads and trails; monitoring impacts; rehabilitating damaged areas; and enforcing restrictions.", "BLM makes OHV designations during the planning process, on an area-by-area basis, and such designations often have been contentious and complex. The agency is in the midst of a multi-year effort to develop and update land use plans, because many plans do not currently address OHV use and other relatively recent issues. For instance, in November 2008, 6 of the 11 BLM field offices in Utah released resource management plans (RMPs) governing land uses in those areas. Together the plans cover about 10 million acres in the eastern half of Utah. OHVs were a major issue addressed during the process, as part of travel management planning for the areas. The plans nearly eliminate areas open to cross-country OHV travel. Specifically, only 0.2% of the total acreage is open to cross-country travel, according to BLM. Instead, the plans largely limit OHV use to designated routes, although they close additional areas to OHV use. The plans also call for the establishment of 31 new Special Recreation Management Areas, where the combination of a high level of specific recreational activity and valuable natural resources would require more intensive management. In addition, OHV use has been a consideration in many on-going plan revisions efforts across the West, for instance in the Carson City District in Nevada and the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area in California, and in recently completed plan revisions, such as for lands administered by the Taos field office in northern New Mexico.", "On November 19, 2010, BLM released a report on its review of procedures for issuing special use permits for OHV racing on its lands. The report, together with recommendations and changes in guidance, stemmed from a review following a deadly accident in August 2010 in the Johnson Valley OHV open area in Southern California, in which a truck driver is alleged to have exceeded the authorized speed, veered off course, and killed and injured spectators. Agency actions included an investigation of the accident, an examination of options to increase safety for spectators, a review of then pending and approved requests to race on BLM lands, an evaluation of the special recreation permit program, and an increase in the onsite presence of BLM staff at motorized races. Issues for Congress include the adequacy of safety provisions in special use permits and their enforcement by BLM; the extent of penalties for permittees who violate the terms of their permits; and the role of BLM staff at racing events. ", "BLM developed a summary of planned actions in response to the GAO recommendations in its 2009 report on OHV use on federal lands, and has undertaken related actions. One of the GAO recommendations was for the establishment of performance measures and time frames for carrying out OHV goals. In response, BLM sought to develop goals and strategies that are results-driven and developed a travel management action plan with an implementation schedule to guide and accelerate the completion of all travel management plans. On August 25, 2011, for instance, BLM issued an instruction memorandum requiring all state directors to update schedules for travel and transportation management planning and implementation and to report on accomplishments. In response to the GAO recommendation to improve communication with the public about OHV use, BLM developed a travel and transportation management manual and a related handbook, as discussed above. In response to the GAO recommendation to enhance law enforcement of OHV use, BLM examined fines for OHV related violations and expressed an intent to seek changes where fines are inconsistent or insufficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": ["No legislation pertaining to motorized recreation on BLM lands has been introduced in the 113 th Congress as of January 16, 2013.

Subpart A of the regulations requires the agency to identify the minimum road system needed for safe and efficient travel and for the protection, management, and use of national forest system lands. Subpart B of the regulations requires the FS to designate those roads, trails, and areas where motor vehicle use is allowed and to identify them on a motor vehicle use map (MVUM).

Legal action continues, with a lawsuit filed against the Forest Service in federal court in November, 2012. Others counter that the regulations penalize the majority of OHV users that obey the rules and restrict off-highway uses at a time when other landowners and other federal and state agencies are reducing similar recreational access to their lands. The conflicts between interests continue to persist and may be escalating, in part because of the lack of past efforts to regulate OHV use.

Other FS bills sought to designate new types of areas, such as Special Management Areas, and specify the extent to which motorized vehicles could be used in these areas. The 112 th Congress also held broad oversight hearings on motorized recreation on BLM and FS lands, encompassing issues including the extent to which lands are open, agency planning processes, balance among land uses, economic effects, and sources of funding. ", "The 113 th Congress might consider a variety of issues related to motorized recreation on federal lands. One issue is whether legislation is desirable to address motorized recreation on particular BLM and FS lands, or whether any bills providing for additional special designations would set parameters on OHV use. A related issue could be whether there is a need for broader, programmatic legislation focused on motorized recreation on federal lands generally or on most or all BLM or FS lands. Provisions of any such legislation could cover an array of issues, such as access and impacts. Congress also may continue to assess agency management of motorized recreation through oversight hearings. The appropriate level of funding for motorized recreation on agency lands is likely to be addressed as part of the annual appropriations process, and Congress also could evaluate how funds for OHV management are used and whether there is a need for other sources of funding.
