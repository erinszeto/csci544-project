Senate committees, guided mainly by their chairmen, have broad discretion in how they conduct a hearing, in part because the committees adopt their own rules of procedure. These rules may supplement Senate rules, but they can not contravene them. Committee customs and leadership style not embodied in rules also vary considerably among committees and influence hearing procedures.", "Committee members and staff usually plan extensively for hearings. Early planning activities commonly include collecting background information; preparing a preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair and members; discussing the scope of the hearing and the expected outcome; scheduling and providing public notice of a hearing; selecting witnesses; determining the order and format of their testimony; and preparing questions or talking points for committee members to use in questioning witnesses. Other considerations include preparing briefing books, determining whether the hearing will be broadcast and alerting the media, and attending to the many administrative arrangements, such as reserving a hearing room, scheduling a hearing reporter, and arranging for there to be a video or audio recording of the proceeding or a written transcript that will be available to the public soon after the event.", "On the day of the hearing, a committee needs a quorum to proceed with testimony. While the vast majority of hearings are open to the public, a committee can vote to close a hearing for specific reasons stated in Senate rules. Senators typically make opening statements at the beginning of a hearing, then witnesses are introduced and may be sworn by the chair. Witnesses present oral testimony in accordance with an arranged format; this testimony generally is a summary of a written statement submitted in advance. The question and answer period that follows is an opportunity for a committee to expand upon a witness's statement and gather information to support future actions.", "Following a day of hearings, committee staff may prepare a summary of testimony, draft additional questions for the day's witnesses, and begin initial preparation of the transcript for printing. While not required, hearing transcripts commonly are printed, along with additional materials approved by the committee.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coverage and Organization of This Report", "paragraphs": ["Under Senate rules, each committee is authorized to hold hearings whether the Senate is in session, has recessed, or has adjourned (Rule XXVI, paragraph 1).

This report emphasizes these shared elements.", "Senate Rule XXVI, in particular, details hearing procedures. Each committee is required to adopt and publish written rules of procedure consistent with Senate rules. A committee can expand upon Rule XXVI. A committee's rules also generally apply to its subcommittees, and may also contain procedures that apply specifically to subcommittees.", "The rules of many committees contain provisions for hearings, and this report gives examples from the 109 th Congress. These examples are illustrative, intending to show variations in particular areas. In some cases, several committees have similar provisions, but only one committee is presented as an example. This report does not attempt to list comprehensively all provisions of committee rules that apply to hearings.", "Further, the summaries of both Senate and committee rules are not intended to capture every nuance and detail of the rules.

They inform Senators, staff, and the public about issues and legislative proposals, and orchestrate public support and attract visibility for an issue. They also serve to monitor government programs and activities, and expose problems Congress may seek to remedy. Finally, hearings give citizens an opportunity to participate in the policy process and help build a public record.", "Senate committees hold hearings on measures or matters referred to them. Committees can also hold a hearing absent any specific legislation, as oversight, an investigation, or simply to inform.", "For a number of reasons, Senate committees act on a relatively small portion of the measures introduced and referred to them. For instance, a committee often receives many proposals in the major policy areas within its jurisdiction, but ultimately chooses, if it decides to act, on only a limited number of measures in a policy area. When a committee does act, it can send a bill to subcommittee for initial consideration, although this is not required by Senate rules.", "A committee may decide to send a bill to subcommittee for initial scrutiny because of the technical nature of the issue, the history of prior referrals, and political factors, among other reasons. When a committee or a subcommittee considers a measure, it generally may take four actions, as described below. Where a subcommittee initiates some of the four actions, the extent to which the full committee repeats these steps varies among committees, from issue to issue, and according to time and workload pressures. The sequence of actions assumes the committee favors a measure, but that can change and at any time the committee may discontinue action.", "First, a committee may seek agency comment by sending a copy of the measure to the executive departments or agencies having relevant expertise, soliciting their written evaluation of the proposal. The executive agency typically sends the measure and draft comments to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine if it is consistent with the President's budget and legislative program.", "Second, a committee may decide to hold one or more hearings. Further committee action without hearings is the exception, although committee hearings have sometimes been bypassed in order to move legislation more expeditiously, or because of action on a related bill in previous Congresses. The importance of the hearings stage is stated by congressional scholar [author name scrubbed]:", "The decision to hold a hearing is often a critical point in the life of a bill. Measures brought to the floor without first undergoing the scrutiny of hearings will likely receive sharp criticism.... The importance of the committee stage is based on the assumption that the experts\u2014the committee members\u2014carefully scrutinize a proposal, and hearings provide a demonstrable record of that scrutiny.", "Third, a committee may meet to \"mark up,\" or recommend amendments to the legislation, in part based on information received at hearings. Markup is the critical stage where a committee decides how the language of the bill should appear when it is presented to the Senate for consideration. While committee amendments must be ratified by the full Senate, committees have the important prerogative of shaping legislation prior to Senate floor consideration.", "Fourth, the full committee may report the legislation to the Senate floor. When a committee reports a measure, it is common, but not required, to issue a written report that describes and explains a measure's purposes and provisions and presents the committee's case for the measure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Hearings", "paragraphs": ["All hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct. Some of these are governed by Senate rules, particularly Senate Rule XXVI. At the same time, procedures and practices among committees may differ for a number of reasons.", "First, each committee must adopt its own rules of procedure each Congress (Rule XXVI, paragraph 2). These must be consistent with Senate rules but may also expand or elaborate on them. Committee rules often contain provisions regulating hearings.", "Second, customs not necessarily reflected in committee rules vary among committees. For example, committees differ in how they recognize Senators and accord them opportunities for questioning witnesses.", "Third, hearings are held for different purposes. Depending on the purpose, hearings can be grouped into four broad classes: legislative, oversight, investigative, and confirmation. (Sometimes one may serve multiple purposes, e.g., both legislative and oversight).", "Committees hold legislative hearings on policy issues that may lead to legislation. Sometimes a committee holds hearings on multiple measures before ultimately choosing one or more vehicles for further committee and chamber action. Hearings provide a forum where facts and opinions can be presented from witnesses with varied backgrounds, including Members of Congress and other government officials, interest groups, and academics, as well as citizens likely to be directly or indirectly affected by the proposal.", "Oversight hearings review or study a law, issue, or an activity, often focusing on the quality of federal programs and the performance of government officials. Such hearings may also help ensure that the execution of laws by the executive branch complies with legislative intent, and that administrative policies reflect the public interest. Oversight hearings often seek to improve the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of government operations. A significant part of a committee's hearing workload is dedicated to oversight. For example, on a single day, September 30, 2004, a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held an oversight hearing on Internet domain names; the Committee on Governmental Affairs held a subcommittee oversight hearing on college savings plans; and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held an oversight hearing on issues related to low-level radioactive waste. Many committees oversee existing programs in the context of hearings on related legislation, or routinely perform oversight when it is time to reauthorize a program, so oversight hearings may be combined with legislative hearings.", "Investigative hearings share some of the characteristics of legislative and oversight hearings. The difference lies in Congress's stated determination to investigate, usually when there is a suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials acting in their official capacity, or private citizens whose activities suggest the need for a legislative remedy. Congress's authority to investigate is broad, and it has exercised this authority since the earliest days of the republic. Its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in American history: Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, Army-McCarthy, Watergate, and Iran-Contra. Investigative hearings often lead to legislation to address the problems uncovered. Judicial activities in the same area of Congress's investigation may precede, run simultaneously with, or follow such inquiries.", "Confirmation hearings on presidential nominations are held in fulfillment of the Senate's constitutional \"advice and consent\" responsibilities. Senate standing committees hold confirmation hearings on presidential nominations to executive and judicial positions within their jurisdiction. These hearings often present an opportunity for oversight into the activities of the nominee's department or agency. Although the vast majority of confirmation hearings are routine, some are controversial.", "Similarly, the Senate, as required by the Constitution, must consent to the ratification of treaties negotiated by the executive branch with foreign governments. On June 17, 2004, for example, the Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on a series of law enforcement treaties. On March 23, 2004, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Although not as numerous as confirmation hearings, these hearings also allow the Senate to meet its constitutional responsibilities in an important area of public policy.", "Field hearings are congressional hearings held outside Washington. The formal authority for field hearings is found implicitly in the chamber rules. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 1 states that a committee \"is authorized to hold hearings ... at such times and places during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate\" as it sees fit. In the 109 th Congress, on May 2, 2005, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing at the North Dakota state capitol on youth suicide prevention. Field hearings are often held in a geographic area where the subject matter of the hearing is particularly relevant. For example, on July 5, 2005, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a field hearing in Anchorage, Alaska on Alaska Aviation.", "While field hearings may involve some matters different from Washington hearings, most of the procedural requirements are the same.

A hearing agenda is influenced by several factors, including the salience of issues to the nation, the committee chair's agenda and goals, the importance of policies to interest groups, and matters of significance to the President, Senate leaders, and other Senators. Programs under a committee's jurisdiction that need to be reauthorized generally receive committee scrutiny, as do instances of reported waste, fraud, or abuse.", "Each committee receives dozens, sometimes hundreds, of proposals for possible examination, and may study matters not embodied in specific legislation. Given the context of its overall workload, a committee must decide whether holding a hearing is the best use of its resources. A committee must also consider whether and how a hearing would fit into its overall agenda. Committees with broad jurisdictions often struggle to allocate limited resources and balance the political and policy demands of its membership.", "In order to obtain approval for a hearing, committee staff often prepare a preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair that includes information such as the scope and purpose of the hearing, the expected outcome, possible witnesses, how many hearing days are planned, and perhaps, the views of the minority party.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) can assist in", "framing the agenda for hearings; preparing background and policy studies; evaluating legislative proposals and discussing alternative approaches; making its experts available on a nonpartisan basis as witnesses; suggesting witnesses and drafting questions for Members to ask them; preparing studies or documentation for inclusion in the hearing record; analyzing testimony; supplying information on program accomplishments; providing information on positions of interest groups and other key players; and conducting database searches.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides assistance to committees principally by reviewing executive branch programs through independent audits, investigations, and evaluations. These reviews measure the effectiveness of government programs. GAO's reports contribute to the background study and examination necessary for oversight hearings. For instance, reports on investigations of waste, fraud, and abuse in federal entities may be used at investigative hearings probing government programs, or at hearings to craft legislation to correct problems exposed. In addition to its routine, periodic reviews, GAO may be asked for studies specific to a committee hearing. GAO experts frequently appear as witnesses.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) furnishes Congress with key information relating to the U.S. economy, the federal budget, and federal programs. It assists committees by preparing cost estimates of legislation. Its assistance to Congress in carrying out the Congressional Budget Act provides a framework and useful background and analysis for hearings. Its responsibilities include", "estimating the five-year budgetary costs of legislation; tracking congressional budget actions against targets established in budget resolutions (scorekeeping); estimating costs to state, local, and tribal governments of carrying out mandates to be imposed by legislation; making periodic forecasts of economic trends and baseline projections of spending and revenue levels against which proposed changes in taxing and spending policies can be measured; conducting studies of programmatic or policy issues that affect the federal budget; and preparing an annual report on spending and revenue options for reducing the federal deficit.", "Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide a wealth of resources for committees. Knowledgeable individuals in universities, policy research institutes, law and consulting firms, and trade and other nonprofit associations often are willing to assist committees with data, analysis, and testimony. Interest groups with public policy concerns often become involved at the hearing stage in an attempt to frame the issues early in the legislative process. Studies indicate that lobbyists believe testifying at congressional hearings is an important and effective technique for influencing legislation. In addition to policy experts and special interest groups, committees often seek information and assistance from ordinary citizens who have direct experience with a proposed policy or agency, or whose lives will bear the impact of Congress's eventual decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Staffing", "paragraphs": ["Committees may find it useful on occasion to supplement their staff to assist with hearings.

A consultant must be selected jointly by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee needing such service. This committee then sends information on the qualifications of the consultant to the Committee on Rules and Administration. It is the responsibility of the Rules Committee to make certain that the consultant has unique qualifications for which the committee could not directly hire an employee, and the individual is not a current federal employee.", "A committee seeking to have an employee detailed from a department or agency of the federal government must submit a letter to the Committee on Rules and Administration for approval. The committee also must submit a letter showing the concurrence of the agency or department in the detail, and information on the title and salary of the prospective detailee. The Rules Committee's review of this information includes a cost-benefit assessment. Committees may hire detailees on a reimbursable or a non-reimbursable basis.", "Staff also may be available from the many fellowship, internship, and volunteer programs that place individuals with committee and Member offices. These programs provide staff ranging in expertise from high school and college students with little or no experience, to trained professionals and subject specialists.

Joint hearings bring together expertise and differing perspectives. They may reduce the difficulties and delays that arise from contradictory actions and proposals.

In addition to a committee's press list, press releases also can be distributed to committee and personal offices and the Senate press galleries. The Radio and Television Gallery requests 25 copies of news releases, notices of committee meetings and hearings, and notices of press conferences. The Senate Daily Press Gallery suggests 50 copies of press releases. The Periodical Press Gallery requests 10-15 copies of press releases. Language from press releases can be used to draft \"Dear Colleague\" letters and statements for use in committee and on the Senate floor.", "Committee staff often prepare media packets prior to hearings.

Many committees prefer that journalists' discussions with staff be \"on background\" and not for attribution. Speaking for attribution usually is limited to committee members.", "Press conferences are a common technique for personally informing journalists of issues in an upcoming hearing, and for clarifying issues immediately following a hearing. Some Senators prefer to meet informally with reporters, others prefer a more structured environment. Formal press conferences may be held in the multi-media studio in room S-325 in the Capitol. Press secretaries are advised to contact the Radio and Television Gallery staff in advance to ensure that the desired studio time is available. According to the 2006 edition of the U.S. Senate Handbook , only members of the press can reserve studio time, and press secretaries should contact an accredited member of any congressional media gallery to secure an invitation to the studio. Ordinarily, only Members of Congress may be interviewed in the studio. Exceptions must be authorized by the executive committees of the congressional galleries.", "When a studio appearance is scheduled, a notice is posted through the Senate electronic bulletin board and displayed in all of the congressional media galleries.
