Pervez Musharraf made a swift decision to end his government's support for theTaliban regime in Afghanistan and join the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. The United States andPakistan now share pressing interests in the region.

Islamabad subsequently has asked the UnitedStates for military equipment, aid, and other forms of security cooperation to both assist in theanti-terror campaign and in an effort to maintain balance with India's conventional forces. WithinPakistan, however, a negative political reaction is fueling anti-government and anti-Americansentiment that may jeopardize longer-term U.S. interests in the region.", "A further complication is that the massive U.S. bombardment of Afghanistan's Tora Boraregion in late-2001 and Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan's eastern Shah-i-Kot mountains inMarch 2002 apparently prompted two waves of up to 5,000 Al Qaeda fighters fleeing intoPakistan.
