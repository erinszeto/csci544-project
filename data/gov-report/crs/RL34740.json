The entities charged with preparation of these reports include both new entities established by the act (e.g., the Financial Stability Oversight Board and the Congressional Oversight Panel) as well as agencies and officials who existed before the enactment of EESA (e.g., the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General of the United States). The recipients of these reports also vary, as well as their timing, frequency, and factors that trigger their development. These differences notwithstanding, all of the EESA reports appear to share a common purpose\u00e2\u0080\u0094to provide information to Congress and other entities on the implementation of the act's provisions.", "No single entity receives all of the EESA-required reports. It is not readily apparent why some of the reports are to be sent to a particular set of eight \"appropriate committees,\" some to a subset of those committees, and some to Congress as a whole. Although one of the purposes of the legislation is to provide \"public accountability\" for the use of EESA authorities, only one of the reports is required to be made to the public. Some of the reports are required to be submitted very quickly, but other reports are not required for years. Some of the reporting requirements are recurring (e.g., every 30 days, or quarterly), while others are one-time requirements. Most of the requirements include clear starting points for the submission of the reports, but in some cases, the starting points are unclear.", "Many of the act's reporting requirements seem to address the same or similar issues. The number and variety of the required reports may have been intended to provide a variety of perspectives on the implementation of EESA, but the lack of integration of those requirements may make understanding the implementation of the act difficult. Also, given the nature of the \"troubled assets\" currently being purchased under the act (i.e., bank stock instead of mortgages or other instruments related to mortgages), it is unclear whether some of the specific requirements are still relevant. Other information that is not specifically required by the act (e.g., how the federal funds are being used by the recipients) may be more helpful to Congress and others as they conduct oversight of the program. Finally, some of the reporting requirements expire on the date that the last troubled asset is sold or transferred, or the date that the last insurance contract expires. Without some kind of a lag period for these requirements, a complete history of the transactions may not be provided.", "This report will be updated when new information becomes available."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA, Division A of H.R. 1424 , which was enacted on October 3, 2008, as P.L. 110-343 ) established numerous reporting requirements regarding a variety of issues.

Also, it is not readily apparent why some of the reports are filed with the set of \"appropriate committees,\" some to a subset of those committees, and some to Congress as a whole. When reports are required to be submitted to \"the Congress,\" the parliamentarian in each house of Congress (on behalf of the Speaker of the House and the presiding officer of the Senate) decides which officers and committees ultimately receive the reports.", "Many of the act's reporting requirements seem to address the same or similar issues. For example, Section 105(a) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the \"appropriate committees\" within 60 days and every 30 days afterward on all \"actions taken by the Secretary,\" including all agreements, transactions, and insurance contracts. Section 105(b) requires the Secretary to report to the same committees on the same transactions within seven days of each $50 billion in commitments to purchase troubled assets. Section 116 requires the Comptroller General to oversee the activities of the TARP and report on his findings at least every 60 days, which would presumably include TARP-related agreements, transactions, and insurance contracts. Section 121 requires the Special Inspector General to report every quarter on its audits of (among other things) all \"troubled assets\" purchased or sold under Section 101, and the management of any insurance program under Section 102.", "Also, Section 105(c) of the act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system and submit a written report to the appropriate committees of Congress not later than April 30, 2009. That report is also required to provide recommendations regarding whether any participants in the financial markets that are currently outside the regulatory system should become subject to the regulatory system. Similarly, Section 125(b)(2) requires the COP to submit a \"special report on regulatory reform\" by January 20, 2009, \"analyzing the current state of the regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers.\" The report is also required to provide \"recommendations for improvement, including recommendations regarding whether any participants in the financial markets that are currently outside the regulatory system should become subject to the regulatory system.\"", "The number and variety of the required reports may have been intended to provide a variety of perspectives on the implementation of EESA, but the lack of integration of those requirements may make understanding the implementation of the act difficult. Also, given the nature of the \"troubled assets\" being purchased under the TARP (i.e., bank stock instead of mortgages or other instruments related to mortgages), it is unclear whether some of the reporting requirements are still relevant to the activities being carried out. For example, Section 105(a)(3) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide", "a detailed financial statement with respect to the exercise of authority under this Act, including (A) all agreements made or renewed; (B) all insurance contracts entered into pursuant to section 102; (C) all transactions occurring during such period, including the types of parties involved; (D) the nature of the assets purchased; (E) all projected costs and liabilities; (F) operating expenses, including compensation for financial agents; (G) the valuation or pricing method used for each transaction; and (H) a description of the vehicles established to exercise such authority.", "The Secretary of the Treasury announced on November 12 that the Department of the Treasury no longer plans to buy mortgage-based \"troubled assets,\" and will instead \"aid banks and other firms that issue student, auto, and credit card loans in part by jump-starting the market that provides financing for these companies.\" Therefore, some of these particular reporting requirements may no longer be relevant or helpful. As a result, some have called for Congress to revisit EESA's reporting requirements.", "Other information that is not specifically required by the act may be more useful to Congress and others as they oversee the implementation of the program. For example, several Members of Congress have expressed concerns that the funds being invested in banks are being used to pay dividends to stockholders, purchase smaller banks, or finance bonuses and other types of compensation for bank executives\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to increase lending. Although some of the reporting requirements appear to be general enough to allow the reporting entities to include how the funds were used, no individual or organization is currently required to do so. As the COP's January 9, 2009, report stated:", "EESA does not require recipients of TARP funds to make reports on the use of funds. However, it is within Treasury's authority to make such reports a condition of receiving funding, to establish benchmarks for TARP recipient conduct, or to have formal procedures for voluntary reporting by TARP recipient institutions or formal guidelines on the use of funds. The adoption of any one of these options would further the purposes of helping build and restore the confidence of taxpayers, investors, and policy makers.", "Also, although Section 2(2)(D) of EESA says one of the purposes of the legislation is to provide \"public accountability\" for the use of the act's authorities, only one of the reports is required by EESA to be made to the public. Most, if not all, of the required reports have been made public so far, but it is currently unclear whether, and if so, how, the practice will continue. One of the recommendations from a conference on public accountability under EESA is that \"Congress should make clear that any reports required to be made to Congress under the EESA should also be made public, unless specifically made confidential in the Act or some portion is specifically designated by the reporting entity as being exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\"", "Some of the reports are required to be submitted to the recipients relatively quickly, and some of the reporting deadlines have already occurred. On the other hand, some of the reports are not required for years. For example, Section 134 of the act requires OMB to \"submit a report to the Congress on the net amount within the Troubled Asset Relief Program under this Act\" five years after the date that EESA was enacted (i.e., on October 3, 2013). Some of the reporting requirements are recurring (e.g., in Section 125(b)(1), which requires the COP to submit its regular reports every 30 days). Other reports, however, are only required to be submitted one time (e.g., in Section 125(b)(2), which requires the COP to submit a special report to Congress by January 20, 2009).", "Most of the reporting requirements include clear starting or ending points for the submission of the reports (e.g., those that are required within 30 days after the date that EESA was enacted, or those that require a report by a certain date). In some cases, however, the starting points for the reporting deadlines are unclear. For example, Section 104(g) requires the Financial Stability Oversight Board to submit reports \"not less frequently than quarterly,\" but the act does not indicate when these reports are to begin. Similarly, Section 116(a)(3) requires the Comptroller General to report \"no less frequently than once every 60 days,\" but does not indicate when those reports are to begin.", "Finally, some of the reporting requirements (e.g., those placed on the Secretary by Section 105) expire on the date that the last troubled asset is sold or transferred, or the date that the last insurance contract expires. Without some kind of a lag period for the expiration of these reporting requirements (e.g., 30 or 60 days after the last sale or transfer of troubled assets), a complete history of these transactions may not be provided to Congress or the public."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
