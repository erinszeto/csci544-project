Because all Members of the House stand for election every two years, the Members-elect constitute a new House that must adopt rules at the convening of each Congress. Although a new House largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous Congress, it also adopts changes to those rules. Institutional and political developments during the preceding Congress inform rules changes that a party continuing in the majority might make. Those same developments, perhaps over the whole time that a party was in the minority, inform rules changes when the minority party wins enough seats to become the majority party and organize the House.", "This report analyzes rules changes made on only the opening day of the 110th, 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses (the Congresses convening in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, respectively), with references in footnotes to other selected legislation and actions during these Congresses that also affected House rules. Freestanding legislation such as the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act or a budget resolution can change House rules in consequential ways.", "Changes made by Democrats after they took majority control in the 110th Congress and by Republicans after they took majority control in the 112th Congress reflected critiques of the other party's management of the House. Democrats emphasized changes to ethics rules and laws in their new majority beginning in the 110th Congress, and Republicans emphasized changes to legislative procedures in their new majority beginning in the 112th Congress. Both parties also addressed budget policymaking, in both rules changes and separate orders.", "Most standing rules, however, did not change, at all or substantially, under either party because the rules reflect decades of experience with majority control of the House. Most of the changes that were made in each of the six Congresses covered in this report were incremental and, largely, grounded in experience. Changes, nonetheless, have touched the committee system and its procedures, the floor of the House, budgetary legislation, the administration of the House, and ethical norms of conduct. Rules facilitate the majority's organization and operation of the House; they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the House\u2014their policy goals or procedural and political strategy\u2014or determine what outcomes can be achieved.", "This report is the second in a series on House rules changes at the beginning of a Congress.

By practice, the majority party organizes the House. The majority elects the House's Speaker, chairs its committees, holds majorities on its committees, selects its officers, and manages its legislative agenda. One of the majority's prerogatives is writing the House's rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber's rules on the day the new House convenes. Although each new House largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous Congress, each new House also adopts changes to those rules. It is a feature of the House, but not of the Senate, that it adopts rules at the convening of each Congress.", "The first report in this series, A Retrospective of House Rules Changes from the 104 th Congress through the 109 th Congress , examined the sources of the extensive rules changes made when Republicans won the majority in the House after 40 years of Democratic control and presented the Republicans' critique of Democratic management of the House. It then grouped the changes made in rules resolutions from the six Congresses in which the Republicans organized the House into five broad areas\u2014committees, chamber and floor, budget legislation, administration of the House, and ethics standards. These five broad areas were further subdivided, with the changes grouped by subject or by Congress and explained. The Democratic critique of Republican management of the House during these six Congresses was covered in that report.", "This second report in the series picks up with the new Democratic majority in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses and the Republican majority in the 112 th , 113 th , 114 th and 115 th Congresses (the Congresses convening in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, respectively). It first presents the Democratic critique of Republican management of the House during the 104 th through the 109 th Congresses; the Republican critique of Democratic management of the House during the 110 th and 111 th Congresses; and Democratic amendments proposed to Republican rules packages in the 112 th , 113 th , 114 th , and 115 th Congresses. The report then groups changes made in rules resolutions from the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses into five broad subject areas\u2014committees, chamber and floor, budgetary legislation, administration of the House, and ethics standards. These five broad areas are again further subdivided, with the changes grouped by subject or Congress, and explained.", "The two principal parts of this report reflect its two principal purposes. The first part analyzes the critique by Democrats of Republican management of the House through the 109 th Congress, the critique by Republicans of Democratic management of the House in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses, and Democratic policy differences with the Republican majority presented during rules debates in the 112 th , 113 th , 114 th , and 115 th Congresses. In drafting House rules when Democrats took the majority in the 110 th Congress and Republicans in the 112 th Congress, each party drew on its critique. The purpose of this part of the report is to examine these sources of House rules changes.", "The second part of the report organizes changes made in the six rules resolutions, and briefly explains the changes in language more readily understood than the language of the rules resolutions. These changes were included in the rules resolutions adopted at the beginning of the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses, separate orders adopted in conjunction with the rules resolutions, and Speakers' policy announcements made at the convening of each of these Congresses. The major topical headings for this part of the report are as follows:", "\" Rules Changes Affecting Committees \" \" Rules Changes Affecting the Chamber and Floor \" \" Rules Changes Affecting Budgetary Legislation \" \" Rules Changes Affecting the Administration of\u00a0the\u00a0House \" \" Rules Changes Affecting Ethics Standards \"", "Each of these major headings is further subdivided by topic or by Congress. The purpose of this part of the report is to catalogue and briefly explain by topic\u2014regardless of the location of a topic in one or more rules\u2014specific changes to House rules affecting committees or the House floor in the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses. Changes affecting budget legislation, House administration, and ethics are arranged by Congress. ", "This report supplements the official cumulation of rules changes, the House Rules and Manual . This volume, printed in each Congress to reflect adoption of a rules resolution, contains the provisions of House rules. For each rule, it also contains the House parliamentarian's notes describing changes to the rule (or to specific clauses within a rule) and decisions of presiding officers and the House based upon the rule. Rules in the House Rules and Manual are arranged by rule number.", "Citations in this report are generally only to the clause of a rule at the time a change was made; rules numbers are stable from Congress to Congress and clause numbers are also generally stable. Changes to the numbering of clauses, paragraphs, and subparagraphs may be found in the parliamentarian's notes.", "This report does not describe all of the actions taken during each Congress that effected permanent and temporary organizational, procedural, administrative, and other changes in the operation of the House. Because the report's purpose is to catalogue the changes made at the convening of a new House, it examines all rules changes and separate orders in the biennial rules resolutions and in the Speaker's biennial announcement of the Speaker's policies interpreting or implementing the rules where the Speaker has discretion. ", "In addition to changes made through rules resolutions, changes to rules and procedures are also made through orders and freestanding legislation, as provisions of bills or resolutions, and in report language on legislation and in joint explanatory statements accompanying conference reports. Legislative branch appropriations bills and budgetary legislation contain organizational, procedural, and other changes that are temporary or permanent. (References to selected freestanding bills and resolutions are provided in footnotes in this report.) So-called fast-track or expedited House procedures are included in legislation that otherwise addresses a policy matter. Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference rules and decisions have also had an impact on how specific House rules (such as rules on suspension of the rules and on committee assignment limits) are implemented. In a few instances in this report, changes made by means other than a House rules resolution are described, where necessary to understand changes made in one or more rules resolutions. ", "In the course of its daily proceedings, the House also adopts special rules and unanimous consent agreements that can adapt its rules for the consideration of one or more measures, proceedings on one or more days, or in another way affect the House's conduct of its affairs.", "Between the 110 th and 115 th Congresses, some committees' names were changed.

The first\u2014ethics\u2014was a theme throughout the time Republicans held the majority, and Democrats moved quickly when they took majority control in the 110 th Congress to change ethics rules and pass new ethics laws. The second\u2014legislative management of the House\u2014was most fully expressed in the 109 th Congress, although Democrats made incremental rather than extensive rules changes when they held the majority in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ethics11", "paragraphs": ["In the 104 th Congress (1995-1997), Democrats offered rules changes that included a new gift rule and regulated and limited Members' copyright royalty income. In the 105 th Congress (1997-1999), a principal issue in debate over the House rules package was the time allowed for the Standards of Official Conduct Committee (now the Ethics Committee) to complete its deliberations on ethics violations admissions by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Republican rules package provided an end date of January 21, 1997; a Democratic proposal would have removed the time limit.", "In the 106 th Congress (1999-2001), Democrats proposed adding a new clause to the Code of Ethics to disallow a Member from intervening in the hiring or dismissal of individuals by lobbying firms or other entities, based on an individual's political affiliation, and another new clause to prohibit a member of the leadership from threatening lobbying firms or other entities on the scheduling of legislation based on an entity's political contributions. These changes were directed in part at perceptions about the so-called K Street Project.", "A Democratic motion related to the rules resolution for the 107 th Congress did not address ethics issues.", "In the 108 th Congress, the Republican rules package incorporated into House rules the provisions of H.Res. 168 (105 th Congress), a bipartisan agreement on the operation of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee under which the committee had operated in the 105 th , 106 th , and 107 th Congresses. However, the rules package also made three changes to ethics rules that the Democratic motion to commit sought to eliminate. These changes allowed limited income from the practice of medicine by Members who were doctors or dentists, permitted gifts of perishable food to House offices, and exempted so-called charity travel from the gift rule under certain conditions.", "The Republican rules package for the 109 th Congress (2005-2007) made changes to procedures of the Standards of Official Conduct Committee, which Democrats attacked as \"gutting the ethical standards\" of the House. While Republicans defended these changes as guaranteeing a right to counsel as a Member would have in a court and as presuming the innocence of a Member, Democrats countered that the changes would reduce the ethics committee to a \"paper tiger.\" Democrats also criticized rules changes that were dropped from the Republican rules package shortly before its submission to the House, for example, allowing a Member under indictment to continue to serve in a leadership position. Democrats sought to strike a provision that dismissed ethics complaints after 45 days if neither the chair nor ranking minority member of the Standards Committee placed on the agenda the issue of establishing an investigative subcommittee, and also sought to prohibit a Member from engaging in employment negotiations with a person who had legislative interests in the current or previous Congress before committees on which the Member served. Democratic and public criticism of changes adopted in the rules package continued, and the House in April 2005 reinstated the ethics rules as they previously existed.", "Democrats in the course of the 109 th Congress also put forward several programs for changes to ethics standards and practices. In June 2006, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the Democrats' \"New Direction for America,\" which contained a section titled \"Honest Leadership and Open Government.\" The items in this section included\u2014", "banning gifts and travel from lobbyists, and prohibiting travel on corporate jets; doubling the \"cooling-off period\" for lobbying to two years for Members, congressional staff, and executive branch officials, and eliminating floor privileges for former Members who are lobbyists; requiring lobbyists to disclose campaign contributions and client fees, increasing the frequency of filings and allowing only electronic filing, requiring certification that no ethics rules violation occurred, and imposing criminal penalties; prohibiting Members from pressing lobbying firms over hiring decisions; requiring Members to disclose outside employment negotiations; and allowing only open conference committee meetings; allowing conferees to vote on all agreements made in a conference; requiring disclosure of all earmarks; and ensuring the posting of conference reports in electronic format for 24 hours before House consideration. ", "In addition, Democratic Representatives David Obey, Barney Frank, David Price, and Tom Allen unveiled a House rules reform package in December 2005, which they introduced as H.Res. 659 in January 2006 with more than 125 Democratic co-sponsors, including Democratic Leader Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer. Provisions of this resolution related to ethics standards and practices included\u2014", "disallowing a Member or congressional staff member from accepting travel unless the individual obtained from the sponsor declarations stating that no lobbyists would participate in the travel or meetings, the sponsor did not engage in lobbying, the sponsor did not employ lobbyists, and the travel was not financed by a corporation unless through contributions deductible under the Internal Revenue Code and disclosed in the declaration; requiring a former Member seeking to be present on the House floor to file a written declaration that the former Member had no financial interest in the legislation under consideration and that the former Member would not advocate while on the floor on any matter before the House; prohibiting a Member from conditioning an earmark request from another Member based on that Member's vote; and disallowing a Member from seeking an earmark unless the Member declared the existence or lack of existence of a financial interest or of control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Management28", "paragraphs": ["Democrats on three occasions from the 104 th through the 109 th Congresses, in proposed amendments or motions to commit related to rules resolutions with the commencement of new Congresses, sought a rule requiring party ratios for each committee and subcommittee to reflect the party ratio of the House.

In the 104 th Congress, a motion to commit included a proposal to allow individual votes on Budget Act waivers to be included in special rules. A proposed amendment in the 105 th Congress (1997-1999) would have struck from the rules resolution a provision requiring a \"dynamic estimate\" of major tax legislation, another provision restricting the content of appropriations bills and amendments to them, and a third provision strengthening the right of the majority leader to move that the Committee of the Whole rise and report at the end of the amendment process for an appropriation bill.", "In the 106 th Congress (1999-2001), the Democratic motion to commit the rules resolution proposed a pay-as-you-go rule applicable to revenue and direct spending.

In the 105 th Congress, their amendment would have struck from the resolution provisions allowing oversight reports in committee to be considered as read if they were available to committee members for 24 hours, requiring nongovernmental witnesses to disclose federal contracts or grants they or their employer received in the current and two previous fiscal years, allowing committees to adopt a rule on extended questioning time for hearings, and reducing to two days from three the time allowed to file views for inclusion in committee reports.", "The Democrats' proposed amendment in the 106 th Congress (1999-2001) would have granted voting rights in the Committee of the Whole to the Delegate from the District of Columbia and have reformulated how legislation was drafted so that changes to existing law would be more readily discernible.", "The Democratic motion to commit in the 108 th Congress (2003-2005) sought to strike changes to House rules in the Republicans' rules resolution: allowing committees to adopt a rule to postpone certain votes; permitting a motion to instruct conferees during a conference after both 20 calendar days and, as added by the rules resolution, 10 legislative days had tolled; and temporarily extending to Wednesdays the days on which motions to suspend the rules would be in order. The motion to commit also for the first time (in the timeframe covered by this report and the preceding rules changes report) tackled some of the procedures that have come to be identified in recent years by both Democrats and Republicans as transparency issues in the legislative process: honoring the House rule on the availability of conference reports, reducing the number of waivers in special rules, decreasing the number of measures to be considered under the suspension of the rules procedure, allowing more amendments and alternatives to measures considered pursuant to special rules, granting a larger number of open special rules, and allowing more minority-party amendments under structured rules.", "In the 109 th Congress (2005-2007), Democrats included just one transparency issue in their motion to commit: proposing the requirement of a two-thirds vote on a special rule that proposed to waive the three-day layover of a measure or conference report.", "The House in the 109 th Congress also moved to address the issue of how to continue legislative activities in the event of \"catastrophic circumstances\" where many Members of the House might be dead or disabled, a concern heightened in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the delivery of anthrax-laced mail to congressional offices in October 2001. The majority's rules resolution included procedures and conditions for establishing a quorum based on a \"provisional number of the House.\" A Democratic Member raised a constitutional point of order against the rules resolution when it was called up for consideration, objecting to the inclusion of the provisional quorum rules on the grounds that it violated Article 1, Section 2, Clause 4 of the Constitution (related to filling House vacancies by election). The House decided on a question of consideration to go forward with the rules resolution.", "In the course of the 109 th Congress, Democrats criticized Republican's legislative management of the House and made several wide-ranging proposals for change. In May 2006, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the House Democrats' \"New House Principles: A Congress for All Americans.\" In June, Leader Pelosi released the Democrats' \"New Direction for America.\" Both documents contained proposals related to the legislative management of the House:", "\"There should be regular consultations among the elected leaders of both parties to discuss scheduling, administration and operations of the House.\" \"The House should have a predictable, professional, family-friendly schedule that allows the legislative process to proceed in a manner that ensures timely and deliberate dispensation [sic] of the work of the Congress.\" \"Regular meetings between Chairs and Ranking Members of committees and staffs should be held.\" \"The Minority should control at least one-third of committee budgets and office space.\"", "Democratic Members began speaking often in the 109 th Congress about the need for \"regular order\" and \"transparency\" in the House's consideration of legislation, and introduced resolutions to change House rules to that effect. In both \"A New Direction for America\" and \"New House Principles,\" there were proposals or principles regarding the legislative management of the House, which had implications for regular order and transparency:", "\"Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups, with appropriate referrals to other committees. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level.\" \"Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.\" \"Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.\" \"Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, with the customary 2-minute extension to accommodate Members' ability to reach the House Chamber to cast their votes. No vote shall be held open in order to manipulate the outcome.\" \"House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings (at least weekly) of all conference committee Members. All duly-appointed conferees should be informed of the schedule of conference committee activities in a timely manner and given ample opportunity for input and debate as decisions are made toward final bill language.\" \"The Suspension Calendar [sic] should be restricted to non-controversial legislation, with minority-authored legislation scheduled in relation to the party ratio in the House.\" \"Our New Direction is committed to 'Pay As You Go' budgeting\u2014no more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.\"", "Earlier in the 109 th Congress, in \"Broken Promises: The Death of Deliberative Democracy,\" a document prepared by the House Rules Committee minority staff, committee Ranking Member Louise M. Slaughter presented a number of recommendations, stating:", "Adopting these modest recommendations would in no way diminish the majority's ability to move their agenda through the House in a timely way. But they would represent a good first step in restoring to the U.S. House of Representatives, the \"People's House,\" the deliberative process that House Republicans used to support, that is, \"the full and free airing of conflicting opinions through hearings, debates, and amendments for the purpose of developing and improving legislation deserving of the respect and support of the people.\" (Emphasis in original, quoting a Republican statement from 1994.)", "The bulk of the \"Broken Promises\" report criticized the types of special rules that had been employed (e.g., the number of minority amendments made in order and the number of closed rules) and the conditions under which special rules had been reported from the Rules Committee (e.g., frequent use of emergency meetings that were allowed by the Rules Committee's rules). The report concluded with five recommendations:", "\"Open up the process by allowing more serious amendments\"\u2014\" ...

Regular order should be the rule, not the exception.... \" \"Give Members three days to read conference reports\"\u2014\"The Rules Committee and Republican leadership should end its practice of granting 'blanket waivers' to conference reports.... \"", "Representative Slaughter and the other Democratic members of the Rules Committee\u2014Representatives James McGovern, Alcee Hastings, and Doris Matsui\u2014also introduced a resolution ( H.Res. 686 ) to \"restore transparency, accountability, and oversight.\" The resolution proposed to change House rules in a number of ways:", "requiring disclosure of scope violations in a conference report, prohibiting special rules from waiving points of order against such violations, and providing for disposition of scope violations by a question of consideration; prohibiting a special rule that waives the three-day layover rule applicable to conference reports, and allowing disposition of a point of order against such a waiver by a question of consideration; prohibiting the consideration of a conference report if certain procedures were violated, with disposition of a point of order by a question of consideration; requiring a roll-call vote on final agreement of conferees to a conference report, and publication of that vote in the joint explanatory statement; changing to 24 hours from one day the layover rule applicable to House special rules; requiring publication in the Congressional Record of the names of Members voting or changing votes after a roll-call vote has proceeded for more than 30 minutes; prohibiting consideration under the suspension of the rules procedure of a measure authorizing or appropriating more than $100 million, and exhorting the Speaker to schedule an equal number of measures under this procedure sponsored by majority and minority Members; repealing the Gephardt rule for changing the statutory debt limit; allowing a minority amendment to a special rule when offered on the House floor; and requiring 24-hour notice of a unanimous consent agreement to alter a special rule adopted by the House.", "As also already noted, Democratic Representatives David Obey, Barney Frank, David Price, and Tom Allen unveiled a House rules reform package in December 2005, which they introduced as H.Res. 659 in January 2006.

First, they proposed an amendment to the special rule, which was not in order once the previous question was moved. The amendment proposed to write into House rules the legislative components of the Democrats' New House Principles, as explained above. Second, Republicans offered a motion to commit the rules resolution in order to add three prohibitions on special rules that were intended to protect changes Republicans had made during their majority. These prohibitions would have disallowed special rules from waiving the automatic yeas and nays on appropriations measures, measures increasing federal income tax rates, and concurrent resolutions on the budget; the requirement for a three-fifths vote on a measure increasing federal income tax rates; and the disallowance of retroactive federal income tax rate increases.", "In the 111 th Congress (2009-2011), Republicans again sought to preserve in House rules some of the changes they had made in House rules during their majority. They offered a motion to commit the rules resolution ( H.Res. 5 ) to retain term limits on committee chairs, which the Democratic rules resolution proposed to eliminate. The Republicans' motion would also have struck changes to the House rule concerning the motion to recommit proposed in the Democratic rules resolution.", "Republicans' principal critique during the 110 th and 111 th Congresses concerned the majority leadership's limiting of opportunities for Member input in the manner in which Democratic leaders managed the House floor, a criticism Democrats had also made of Republican legislative management of the House during the Republican majority. Republicans criticized the number of bills (or legislative texts) that were brought to the floor without committee consideration, the limited number of amendments allowed under structured rules, the number of closed rules, use of procedures that obviated the opportunity to offer the motion to recommit, and the replacement of conference consideration by amendments between the houses.", "Republicans also criticized the Rules Committee's Democratic majority for their procedural implementation of the majority leadership's legislative strategy: ", "They have rewritten much of the major legislation passed by this Congress, sometimes in the middle of the night. They engineered the exclusion of opposing viewpoints. They steered around the regular legislative process to support a majority driven by partisan concerns.", "When the Democratic leadership in 2009 moved to end the consideration of general appropriation bills under open special rules or the open amendment process allowed by House rules, the event triggered additional Republican criticism of Democrats' legislative management of the House. They argued that a \"central tenet of the [appropriations process] was that every member would have the opportunity to bring their issue before the House\u2026.\"", "Republicans also complained regularly on the House floor of receiving legislative proposals at the last minute.

Both parties addressed budget policymaking, in both rules changes and separate orders.", "The Jack Abramoff scandal in particular put on public trial the interactions between lobbyists on the one hand and Members and congressional staff on the other. The new majority in the 110 th Congress responded with many changes to House ethics rules and with new law. Calls during the 111 th Congress for more transparency generally and for more time to review legislation to be brought to the floor led to changes in the House's rules in the 112 th Congress, such as posting in electronic format the legislative text to be considered on the House floor, and to changes in the House's legislative management, such as some open or modified open rules and some structured rules that allowed more amendments and a new schedule that included some five-day work weeks with regular week-long district work periods.", "Most standing rules, however, did not change, at all or substantially, when Democrats or Republicans became the majority, because the rules reflected decades of experience with majority control of the House. Rules facilitate the majority's organization and operation of the House; they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the House\u2014their policy goals or procedural and political strategy\u2014or determine what outcomes can be achieved. Rules changes do not necessarily enable a majority to pass legislation, to keep all the party's Members together, to work smoothly with the minority, to achieve the same outcomes as the other body, or to either deliver on or counteract voter sentiments. ", "In managing the House in the new millennium, each party's majority needed to accommodate an assertive range of perspectives among its Members, and to balance the need to govern with the demand of an emboldened minority to be heard. Consequently, the number of open\u2014and modified open\u2014special rules decreased and the number of structured rules increased, a third day for the consideration of legislation by suspension of the rules was added, fewer days were spent in session, more competition over jurisdiction between committees occurred, a number of measures passed by the House could not pass the Senate, and convening conferences between the chambers declined in favor of resolving differences through amendments between the houses. The motion to recommit was used to broadcast a message as much as to offer an alternative.", "The majority leadership's influence over committee agendas and its role in drafting or redrafting of major legislation to be considered on the floor continued to increase. On the one hand, party leadership has increased its control of committees and committee agendas, for example, by leadership's control of the selection of chairs and ranking minority members. On the other hand, there has been less political overlap between the parties so that leaders may need to look exclusively within their own caucus or conference to build a majority on key votes, and leaders are better positioned than committee chairs to know what legislative provisions will create those majorities.", "The churning in the House's membership has also contributed to leadership's influence over legislation. Turnover brings new energy and ideas to the House, and reflects \"an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people\" that \"frequent elections ... [secure],\" as Madison explained about the nature of the House of Representatives in The Federalist Papers (no. 52). So much turnover in such a large body as the House, however, favors the centralizing efforts of leadership. During the 109 th Congress and in the 2006 election, 60 new Members were elected. During the 110 th Congress and in the 2008 election, 67 new Members were elected. During the 111 th Congress and in the 2010 election, 105 new Members were elected. During the 112 th Congress and in the 2012 election, 75 new Members were elected. High turnover continued in the elections for and during the 113 th , 114 th , and 115 th Congresses so that, midway through the first session of the 115 th Congress, the median length of service in the House was just over three terms completed\u2014more than half of all Representatives were sworn in in the current decade, in 2011 or later. ", "The work of a Representative has also continued to evolve, which, in turn, has meant Members of the House have favored efficiency and decisionmaking in floor proceedings so that they have time for their committee work, campaign fund raising, and representational work. The latter has expanded with the ubiquity of information technology, whereby most Members now participate in several social media platforms and must respond rapidly to developments within a relentlessly continuous news cycle. Members also want to maximize the representational time they spend in their districts meeting with constituents, participating in district events, and attending to their political interests, which will include home-state redistricting in conjunction with the 2020 census. The Washington-district schedule put in place in the 112 th , 113 th , 114 th , and 115 th Congresses has allowed Members time to visit schools, work sites, local government offices, and other places in their districts during those places' regular business hours.", "Regardless of the cumulative rules changes in the House since the 104 th Congress, the House remains one of the two independent political institutions of Congress, designed to be so by the Framers. Interest balances interest, as noted in The Federalist Papers (no. 10), and unless there is majority political will\u2014not necessarily a party majority but a majority of Members of each house\u2014to take an action, such as make a specific law, that action will not happen. One role of Congress is to make law, but its larger role is to winnow the proposals about what should be law\u2014because some proposals are bad ideas or lack public support or offend a constituency or cost too much or are impractical or are for some other reason unable to generate the needed majorities. Chamber rules allow opportunities for all Members to participate at all stages of the legislative process, in both chambers, building on the Framers' system.", "Looking ahead to the 116 th Congress and beyond, rules changes are likely to be incremental rather than extensive with either a Democratic or Republican majority. A package of rules changes presented by the majority party would take into consideration the size and composition of the party majority. The changes would need to balance that fact, and protect minority prerogatives, against the need to govern. A House majority party would also need to consider majority control of the Senate as it contemplates a rules package. ", "The House majority party might also contemplate the party arrangements and the effectiveness of the President and Congress over the past 30 years. President Reagan began with a Republican Senate and Democratic House and ended with a Democratic Congress. President George H.W. Bush held office with a Democratic Congress. President Clinton entered office with a Democratic Congress and served most of his two terms with a Republican Congress. President George W. Bush served through 2006 with only a Republican Congress, except for a portion of the 107 th Congress when Democrats controlled the Senate. President Obama enjoyed Democratic control of both houses of Congress for two years, but faced a Republican House and narrower Democratic Senate majority in the next years, before Republicans controlled both chambers in the 114 th Congress. President Trump began his presidency with Republican control of both chambers. Presidents have succeeded and failed with their major policy initiatives under each arrangement.", "Both parties in the House gave attention to their party rules in the 114 th and 115 th Congresses, which were intended to open the parties to more voices and perspectives in party decisionmaking. Many Members in the Democratic Caucus are organizing under the \"progressive\" banner and many Members in the Republican Conference are organizing under the \"very conservative\" banner, but there are other groups and many viewpoints within both parties. For Members and Congress watchers alike seeking to understand the congressional environment, being attentive to the parties' organization and decisionmaking is vital.", "The rules of the House do not exist to achieve a specific legislative result. They are available to all Members and to any majority or minority. Many factors besides party control, and the party's use of rules, affect the congressional environment. To look back in history, Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed could be said to have created the modern, majority-minority House with his rulings, but he could not have contemplated how a very strong Speaker like Joseph Cannon would use the Speakership to dominate the House. The Corrections Calendar was announced with great fanfare when it was created in 1995; it had long been moribund when it was terminated in the rules package for the 109 th Congress.
