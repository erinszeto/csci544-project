International donors and domestic civil society organizations continue to encourage the Ukrainian government to implement necessary measures, including with regard to fighting corruption.

It supports the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, including with respect to Crimea, as well as implementation of the Minsk agreements that would establish a cease-fire and conflict settlement in eastern Ukraine.

Historically, Ukrainians trace their lineage to the medieval Kievan Rus, an early Orthodox Christian state that Russians also consider to be a core part of their heritage. Most of Ukraine's territory was incorporated over time into the USSR's predecessor, the Russian Empire, although several western regions of Ukraine were first annexed by the Soviet Union only during World War II. In December 1991, Ukraine's leaders joined those of neighboring Russia and Belarus to dissolve the USSR. ", "In over a quarter-century of independence, Ukraine has had periodic swings toward greater and lesser democracy. Throughout this time, many observers have considered Ukraine's government to be a \"hybrid\" regime with both democratic and nondemocratic elements. The U.S. government-funded nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House gives Ukraine a \"freedom rating\" of \"partly free.\" According to Freedom House, Ukraine's democratic credentials have improved since the ouster of former President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, following the so-called Euromaidan protests. In Ukraine, these events came to be known as the Revolution of Dignity. ", "The government that replaced Yanukovych in 2014 pledged to embrace pro-Western reforms, and an energized civil society supported its efforts. Within weeks, however, the new government had to confront Russian armed interventions in southern and eastern Ukraine. These culminated in Russia's occupation of Ukraine's \"autonomous\" (quasi-federal) republic of Crimea in March 2014 and a protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine, where observers consider that the Russian government has fostered and supported pro-Russian separatists (see \" Russia-Ukraine Conflict \" below). As a result, the Ukrainian government's readiness to implement reforms had to be balanced with the need to move to a war footing with an underdeveloped military and to grapple with the economic consequences of conflict. ", "Ukraine's post-Euromaidan government took shape after presidential and parliamentary elections in May and October 2014, respectively. Ukraine has a mixed system of governance in which the president shares power with a prime minister nominated by parliament. The winner of the presidential election was Petro Poroshenko (aged 51), a former official, businessman, and supporter of the Euromaidan protests, who received 55% of the vote. As a candidate, Poroshenko pledged to move Ukraine closer to the West, fight corruption, and address the conflict that had emerged in the eastern part of the country. In October 2014, Ukraine held elections to its 450-seat parliament (Verkhovna Rada), elected equally through party lists and single-mandate races. The main victors were the Petro Poroshenko Bloc (21.8% of the vote and 31% of single-mandate seats) and the People's Front (22.1% of the vote and 8% of single-mandate seats), led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a former government official turned protest leader, who became prime minister. ", "The Petro Poroshenko Bloc and the People's Front together headed a pro-Western reform coalition that included the Samopomich (Self-Reliance) Party, the populist Radical Party, and the Fatherland Party of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. This coalition gave the incoming government a clear majority in parliament. Due to various disagreements, however, the latter three parties left the coalition by early 2016, leaving the Poroshenko Bloc, the People's Front, and a handful of independent deputies with a slim majority. In April 2016, an increasingly unpopular Yatsenyuk was replaced as prime minister by parliamentary chairman Volodymyr Groysman (aged 39), a former mayor and Poroshenko's ally. ", "Other parties represent different parts of the political spectrum. The Opposition Bloc, a successor to Yanukovych's former ruling Party of Regions, won 9% of the popular vote in 2014 and currently has around 10% of seats in parliament. Far-right nationalist groups, which Russian officials and media often sought to characterize as key drivers of the Euromaidan, won a handful of seats. ", "Many observers believe the Poroshenko/Groysman government has made impressive strides in its reform agenda. Others consider that Ukraine's reforms remain fragile and that the government has progressed too slowly in certain areas. In April 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which supports Ukraine with a $17.5 billion loan package, called on the government to accelerate the pace of its reforms, noting that \"progress in advancing structural reforms has been mixed,\" with \"important achievements in the energy and financial sectors\" but \"limited progress in reforming and privatizing state-owned enterprises, land and pension reforms, and effectively tackling corruption.\" ", "International donors and domestic civil society organizations continue to encourage the government to implement necessary reforms. In October 2017, the government moved forward on some key measures: supporting the establishment of an anticorruption court and passing legislation on pension and health care reform. Some observers expressed concern that new reforms did not go far enough or could be coupled with other measures that may limit their effectiveness. ", "Some observers also have noted that a particular challenge to reform efforts stems from the influence of so-called \"oligarchs,\" many of whom became wealthy in Ukraine's free-wheeling economic environment prior to 2014, particularly in areas like energy, metals, and mining. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, \"the continuing influence of their networks remains the most serious domestic impediment to the judicial and economic reforms needed to strengthen Ukraine's political and economic outlook.\"", "In June 2016, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt suggested that \"the single area that still requires the greatest sustained focus and the greatest sustained pressure and engagement from civil society [is the] rule of law\u2014building a judiciary, a prosecutorial service, a court system in which the Ukrainian people have confidence.\"", "In opinion polls, Ukrainian respondents express relatively low levels of support for the country's political leaders. In a June-July 2017 poll, 15%-17% of respondents expressed approval of the government. Among likely voters, eight parties from across the political spectrum had between 4% and 12% support. The next round of elections in Ukraine is scheduled for 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Russia-Ukraine Conflict", "paragraphs": ["Many observers consider that of all the post-Soviet states, Ukraine has been the most difficult for Russians to accept as fully independent. Many Russians traditionally have considered much of Ukraine to be a historical province of Russia and Ukrainians to be their close ethnic brethren. Most Ukrainians can speak Russian, whether as a secondary or primary language. Ethnic Russians are estimated to make up 15%-20% of the population, mostly concentrated in the south (Crimea) and east (Donbas), where ties to Russia are stronger. In Soviet times, eastern Ukraine became home to a heavy industrial sector (including defense-related manufacturing) that retained close economic ties to Russia after independence. ", "Even before 2014, however, the Russia-Ukraine relationship suffered turbulence, with disputes over Ukraine's ties to NATO and the EU, the status of Russia's Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet, and the transit of Russian natural gas via Ukraine to Europe. Under ex-president Yanukovych, such disputes were largely papered over. By the end of 2013, Yanukovych appeared to make a decisive move toward Russia, postponing the conclusion of an Association Agreement that would establish closer political and economic ties with the EU and agreeing instead to substantial financial assistance from Moscow. This decision provoked the Euromaidan protests and, ultimately, Yanukovych's removal from power. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Crimea", "paragraphs": ["Ukraine's conflict with Russia arose soon after Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014. Moscow covertly deployed forces to Crimea and, after what many observers consider to have been an illegal referendum on secession in March 2014, declared that it was incorporating the region directly into the Russian Federation. In explaining these actions, Russian government officials characterized the change in power in Kyiv as a Western-backed \"coup\" that, among other things, could threaten the security of the Russian population in Crimea, eject Russia's Black Sea Fleet from the region, and potentially even bring Ukraine into NATO, something that Moscow firmly opposed.", "Russia has since significantly increased its military presence in Crimea. Observers estimate that up to 30,000 Russian troops are stationed in the region. In addition, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has documented \"multiple and grave\" human rights violations in Crimea and stated that minority Crimean Tatars, who are generally opposed to Russia's occupation, have been \"particularly targeted.\"", "To connect Crimea to Russia, a 12-mile bridge is being constructed across the Kerch Strait connecting the Azov Sea, northeast of Crimea, to the Black Sea. Observers have noted that the bridge, scheduled to open by the end of 2018, includes a single passage for ships to traverse and could limit access to and from ports in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government is seeking to uphold its maritime rights in international arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.", "Much of the international community does not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. In March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly voted 100 to 11, with 58 countries abstaining, to affirm Ukraine's territorial integrity. In December 2016, the General Assembly voted 70 to 26, with 77 countries abstaining, for a resolution that \"condemn[ed] the temporary occupation\" of Crimea and reaffirmed nonrecognition of its annexation.

In 2014, militants forcibly took power in regional centers; asserted the establishment of two new political entities, the \"Donetsk People's Republic\" (DNR) and the \"Luhansk People's Republic\" (LNR); and gradually expanded their control over Ukrainian territory (although government counteroffensives restored state control over some areas). For Moscow, such developments may have served multiple purposes: to \"protect\" relatively pro-Russian populations in the region, complicate Ukraine's domestic development and foreign policy, and increase Russian leverage in potential negotiations over Ukraine's future trajectory. ", "Moscow officially denies Russia's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Most observers agree, however, that the Russian government has unofficially deployed troops to fight, helped recruit other \"volunteers,\" and supplied Donbas separatists with weapons and equipment. Estimates of the number of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine have declined since peaking in 2015. In March 2017 testimony to a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Pavlo Klimkin said that there were now about 4,200 Russian troops in the region (and around 40,000 militants in all, presumably a combination of local and Russian fighters). ", "Efforts at conflict resolution are structured around a set of documents known as the Minsk agreements (named after the city in Belarus where they were reached). In September 2014, the leaders of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine, together with separatist representatives in eastern Ukraine, negotiated a cease-fire agreement, the Minsk Protocol. However, the protocol failed to end fighting or prompt a political resolution to the conflict. The parties met again in February 2015 and reached a more detailed cease-fire agreement known as Minsk-2. This agreement mandated a total cease-fire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and foreign troops and fighters, and full Ukrainian control over its border with Russia, among other provisions (see \"Summary of Minsk-2 Provisions\" box).", "To date, most observers perceive that little has been achieved in implementing the provisions of Minsk-2, despite the commitments made by all sides. Although the conflict's intensity has subsided, the fighting continues. As of mid-August 2017, OHCHR estimated that the conflict had led to at least 10,225 combat and civilian fatalities. As of May 2017, the Ukrainian government also reported 1.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). ", "Until recently, the Ukrainian government still permitted a certain amount of trade with the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, especially in coal used in domestic power plants and sold abroad. Specifically, energy companies in the separatist regions owned by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov recognized Ukrainian authority and paid taxes. After some Ukrainians launched an unofficial blockade against this trade in January 2017, however, separatist officials reportedly took control of the energy companies. In response, the Ukrainian government officially suspended cargo traffic in March 2017, until the separatists return control to their proper owners."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economy", "paragraphs": ["As part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was responsible for a large share of the country's agricultural and industrial production.

Ukraine's economy recovered for much of the 2000s, but Ukraine was hit hard by the 2008-2009 global recession, with GDP declining by almost 15% in 2009.

In April 2017, the IMF positively cited key reforms, including reduction of the fiscal deficit, an increase in gas prices, reform of the banking system, and reduction in inflation (which had risen to over 60% in April 2015).

Both also have noted the importance of privatizing state-owned enterprises and allowing land sales, on which a moratorium has been imposed since 2001.

Many observers argue that Russia has used price hikes, debt repayments, and energy cutoffs as leverage in various disputes with Ukrainian governments. Since 2015, however, Ukraine has reduced its dependence on Russian gas imports. In 2013, 92% of Ukraine's natural gas imports came directly from Russia (51% of Ukraine's total gas consumption). By 2015, just 37% of Ukraine's natural gas imports came from Russia (18% of consumption), and in 2016, Ukraine halted Russian gas imports entirely. In addition to reducing its gas consumption, Ukraine managed this reduction in Russian imports by importing gas from Slovakia, as well as from Poland and Hungary.", "Although observers have commended Ukraine for initial energy reforms, concerns have arisen among key stakeholders that energy reforms slowed in 2017. Four of five members of the supervisory board of Ukraine's state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, resigned in 2017, citing delays in further reform and government interference in Naftogaz operations. In September 2017, the EBRD, which provides loans to Naftogaz to purchase gas, said that further reforms will be necessary to conclude a new loan agreement in 2018.", "In recent years, Russia has sought to reduce the amount of its gas that flows through Ukraine to Europe by working with various countries to build pipelines that bypass Ukraine. Since the 2011 opening of the Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Russia directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea, around 40%-50% of Russian natural gas destined for Europe still transits Ukraine. This transit reportedly earns Ukraine around $2 billion or more a year. ", "Currently, Russia is seeking to construct a parallel pipeline, Nord Stream 2, with the financial support of several European energy companies. If the project moves forward, Ukrainian gas officials say that Nord Stream 2 will reduce Russian gas transit through Ukraine even further and potentially eliminate it entirely.
