In other instances, the tax filer may pay part (or all) of the premium.", "The credit amount is based on a comparison of two amounts that result from two different scenarios. The first scenario (and amount) is straightforward: the premium for the exchange plan in which the person/family enrolls. The second scenario is more complicated, involving a formula that considers the premium for a reference plan in the local area in which the person/family resides, and an amount that the person/family may be required to contribute toward the premium. Based on a comparison of the amounts resulting from each scenario, the premium credit will be the lesser amount. The following text box, \"Calculation of the Premium Credit Amount,\" discusses these two scenarios in more detail.", "Under Scenario B, the amount that a tax filer who receives a premium credit is required to contribute toward the premium (for the reference plan) is capped as a percentage of household income; that is, the maximum premium contribution is the product of the tax filer's household income and the \"applicable percentage,\" as specified in the ACA. In general, the applicable percentage is less for those with lower incomes compared with those with higher incomes; where income is measured relative to the federal poverty level. Under Scenario B, the amount that tax filers with income between 100% FPL and 133% FPL may be required to contribute toward the reference plan's premium is capped at 2.01% of household income for 2015. For tax filers with income 300%-400% FPL, their premium contribution is capped at 9.56% of income. The IRS further specifies the applicable percentages, for tax filers whose incomes are between those two income bands (see Figure 1 ). ", "The line graph shows the \"applicable percentage\" used to calculate the tax filer's required premium contribution at each income level, as measured relative to the federal poverty level. The ACA statute specifies the applicable percentage at certain incomes (income at 100% FPL, 133% FPL, 150% FPL, etc.) beginning in 2014 and indexed in later years. At each of those incomes, the line changes slope. Specifically, at and above 133% FPL up to 300% FPL, the applicable percentage increases incrementally as income increases. For example, a person with income at 150% FPL may be required to pay a maximum of 4.02% of household income toward exchange coverage in the reference plan. A 1% increase in income (i.e., person has income at 151% FPL) results in a maximum premium contribution equal to 4.07% of income. In contrast to this gradual change in the maximum premium contribution for incomes between 133% and 300% FPL, there is a \"cliff\" for a person/family with income below 133% FPL. Instead of the incremental change discussed above, the contribution amount jumps when you compare income just below 133% FPL with income at 133% FPL. This cliff reflects statutory requirements. ", "Given that calculation of the premium credit amount (under Scenario B) is the arithmetic difference after subtracting the tax filer's required premium contribution from the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan ( reference plan ), it is theoretically possible that a person's required premium contribution could be equal to or exceed the reference plan's premium. Such a scenario would leave that tax filer with a premium credit of zero. Moreover, while the credit amount under this scenario is based on the reference plan, the individual/family may enroll in any metal-tier plan and still be eligible for credits. However, when a premium credit recipient enrolls in a plan that is more expensive than the reference plan, that person must pay the additional premium amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Premium Credits in 2015", "paragraphs": ["For 2015, Table 2 displays selected annual income levels used in the calculation of premium credit amounts and required premium contributions, as discussed above. ", " Table 3 displays the maximum monthly premium contributions for individuals and families who receive premium tax credits, provided that they enroll in the applicable reference plan.", "Both Figure 1 and Table 3 illustrate the cliff effect that occurs at 133% FPL. For individuals with income below 133% FPL, the credit formula ensures that such individuals pay no more than 2.01% of their income for the second-lowest-cost silver plan. For incomes at 133% FPL, individuals and families may pay 3.02% of their income toward premiums for the reference plan. For example, an individual with income at 132.99% FPL (annual income of $15,520) may be required to pay $26 in monthly premiums for the second-lowest-cost plan in 2015 (see Table 3 ). With one additional dollar of income (annual income of $15,521, equivalent to 133% FPL), this person may be required to pay $39 in monthly premiums. Therefore, the additional $1 in annual income may lead to an additional $156 in premium contributions for this hypothetical person in 2015. Nevertheless, some might observe that prior to implementation of the ACA premium credits in 2014, there were no federal subsidies for health coverage for individuals with income at this level and above, except for some narrowly defined groups. Thus, more individuals overall may be eligible for subsidized private coverage under the ACA, than before enactment of the law.

As the 2015 premium data indicate, individuals at the same income level will face different (pre-credit) premiums based on age. This reflects the limited age rating allowed for health insurance policies, including those offered in the individual exchanges. The practical effect of the ACA's age rating requirements means that, for any given metal-tier plan in a specific geographic area, premiums vary for adults between 21 and 64+ years of age by a 3:1 ratio.

That is, hypothetical persons A and C (both of whom are 21 years of age) have a pre-credit premium of $168, compared to hypothetical persons B and D (both of whom are 64 years of age) who have a pre-credit premium of $506. ", "However, for premium credit recipients, age does not determine the amount that a given person contributes toward the premium. The formula for calculating premium contributions from enrollees is based on income (see Table 3 ), and such contributions are calculated prior to determining the credit amount. Therefore, the actual amount that tax credit recipients will pay toward exchange premiums may be the same for individuals with the same income levels, regardless of age. For example, persons A and B are very different in age but have the same income level; therefore, their required monthly contributions toward premiums are the same amount ($59). Person C is an example of the exception to this general rule. Persons C and D have the same income level, so you would expect their premium contributions to be the same amount ($325, see Table 3 ). However, person C's pre-credit premium ($168) is lower than the maximum premium contribution allowed for an enrollee at that income level ($325).

On the other hand, any excess amount that was overpaid in premium credits will have to be repaid to the federal government as a tax payment. However, the ACA imposes limits on the excess amounts to be repaid under certain conditions.

The current repayment limits vary by income band (see Table 5 ). For example, say a family received overpayments for the tax credits they should have received in a given tax year. They will have to repay the excess when they file federal income taxes for that year. However, if such a family has income below 200% FPL, the IRS may only require them to repay up to $600 (for tax credit overpayments during that tax year).

An individual who qualifies for the premium credit and is enrolled in a silver plan (actuarial value of 70%) through an exchange is also eligible for cost-sharing assistance. The assistance is provided in two forms, and both forms are based on income (see descriptions below). Individuals who receive cost-sharing subsidies may receive both types, as long as they meet the applicable eligibility requirements.", "The ACA requires each metal tier plan to limit the total amount an enrollee will be required to pay out of pocket for use of covered services in a year (referred to as an annual cost-sharing limit in this report), and establishes separate limits for self-only coverage and family coverage. For 2015, the annual cost-sharing limit for self-only coverage is $6,450; the corresponding limit for family coverage is $12,900. Given that tiered plans will already be required to comply with those annual cost-sharing limits, one form of cost-sharing assistance reduces such limits (see Table 6 ). The cost-sharing assistance reduces the annual limit faced by eligible individuals with income between 100% and 250% FPL; greater reductions are provided to those with lower incomes. In general, this cost-sharing assistance targets individuals and families who use a great deal of health care in a year and, therefore, have high cost-sharing expenses. Enrollees who use very little health care do not generate enough cost-sharing expenses to reach the annual limit. ", "The second form of cost-sharing assistance also applies to individuals with income between 100% and 250% FPL. For eligible individuals, the cost-sharing requirements (in the plans they have enrolled) have been reduced to ensure that the plan covers a certain percentage of allowed health care expenses, on average. The practical effect of this cost-sharing assistance is to increase the actuarial value (AV) of the exchange plan in which the person is enrolled ( Table 7 ), so enrollees face lower cost-sharing requirements than they would have without this assistance. Given that this form of cost-sharing assistance directly affects cost-sharing requirements (e.g., lower deductible), both enrollees who use minimal health care and those who use a great deal of services may potentially benefit from this assistance. ", "To be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies, an individual must be enrolled in a silver plan, so that coverage already has an AV of 70%. For an individual who receives the subsidy referred to in Table 7 , the health plan imposes a set of different cost-sharing requirements, so the \"silver\" plan will meet the new applicable AV. The ACA statute does not specify how a plan reduces cost-sharing requirements to increase the AV from 70% to one of the higher AVs. Through regulations, HHS requires each insurance company that offers a plan that is subject to these cost-sharing reductions to develop variations of its silver plan; these silver plan variations must comply with the higher levels of actuarial value (73%, 87%, and 94%). When an individual is determined by an exchange to be eligible for a cost-sharing subsidy, the person is enrolled in the plan variation that corresponds with that person's income (as indicated in Table 7 ). This approach allows an individual to benefit automatically from this type of assistance, as soon as he or she uses health care that is covered under the exchange plan.", "The HHS Secretary will provide full reimbursements to exchange plans that provide cost-sharing subsidies. A given health plan is required to submit to HHS estimates of the amount of cost-sharing assistance it will provide in a year. Such estimates must be submitted prior to that year to receive advance payments for the estimated amount of cost-sharing assistance. A plan also must submit to HHS actual amounts of cost-sharing assistance provided. The actual amounts will be periodically reconciled with the amounts received by the plan in advance payments.
