Although most Americans participate in the Social Security system, Social Security is likely to be only a part of income in retirement. A recent Gallup poll indicated that while 34% of working Americans expect Social Security to be a major source of retirement income, 45% of those polled expect private retirement savings accounts to be a major source of retirement income.", "Since the 1920s, Congress has provided tax incentives to employers to sponsor pension plans for their workers. Recognizing that workers for companies that did not offer pension plans did not benefit from the incentives, in 1974, Congress permitted workers without pension plans to establish Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). IRAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts to encourage workers to save for retirement. Since 1974, eligibility for IRAs and the tax treatment of contributions to IRAs have changed. Currently, workers without pensions and workers with pensions whose income is under certain limits may make tax-deductible contributions to IRAs. Other workers may make non-deductible contributions. Since 1998, some workers have been able to make non-deductible contributions to Roth IRAs. Lump-sums from employer-sponsored pensions may be rolled-over into either traditional or Roth IRAs. Most of the funds in IRAs consist of rollover balances rather than the accumulation of contributions and investment earnings.", "IRAs may be falling short of their goal of encouraging workers to save for retirement. While about one-half of working Americans participate in employer-sponsored pensions, only about one-third of working households in the United States owned an IRA in 2007. Although IRAs were originally intended for workers in employment without pension plans, IRA ownership rates are higher among households in which the head or spouse participates in a pension plan at work. Among households with pension coverage, 38.7% had an IRA in 2007. Among households without pension coverage, 25.5% had an IRA in 2007.", "Analysis of the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve indicates that households that own IRAs tend to be older, wealthier, more educated, and have higher propensities to save than households that do not own IRAs. Although one-third of working households owned an IRA in 2007, relatively few households made a tax-deductible IRA contribution in 2007. Statistics of Income data from the Internal Revenue Service indicate that 2.3% of tax returns reported a tax-deductible IRA contribution in 2007. The percentage of taxpayers reporting tax-deductible IRA contributions was lower in 2007 than in any year since 1978. Both the percentage of taxpayers reporting tax-deductible IRA contributions in 2007 and the average amount of that contribution increased as taxpayers' reported income increased.", "Although IRA ownership rates are lower among households without pension coverage, IRA ownership patterns are similar among households with and without pension coverage. For example, IRA ownership increases as households' income increases and IRA ownership rates are higher among households that own their homes compared with households than do not own their homes. Some policy proposals that supporters argue will increase IRA ownership rates and account balances include making the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit a refundable tax credit, adopting Automatic IRA proposals, increasing household financial literacy, and making the fees that financial institutions charge IRA owners more transparent."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Income in retirement comes from several sources. Most workers participate in the Social Security system, which pays retirement income as early as 62 years old.

About half of the U.S. workforce participates in one or both of two kinds of employer-sponsored pensions.", "The two kinds of employer-sponsored pensions are defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pensions. DB pensions provide retirees with monthly benefits in which the amount is calculated using a formula based on the number of years of employment and final salary. DC pensions, of which the 401(k) plan is the most common, provide participants individual accounts in which contributions from individual employees\u2014and often their employers\u2014are placed in tax-advantaged accounts that accrue investment returns. The accumulated contributions and investment earnings are then used for participants' retirement income. Although employers choose whether to offer DC plans, individual employees decide the contribution amounts (subject to an annual limit) and investment allocations of the contributions.", "Over the past 30 years, fewer employers have been providing DB plans and instead have offered DC plans. One consequence of this shift is that workers have had increasing responsibility for their retirement income security. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can play an important role by providing workers with tax-advantaged savings accounts in which to accumulate retirement savings.", "Although enrollment in a DC or DB plan is contingent on employer sponsorship of such a plan, most individuals (or married couples) who have taxable compensation can establish and contribute to an IRA. Similar to 401(k) plans, IRAs are tax-advantaged accounts in which contributions and investment earnings accumulate, which are then used for retirement income.

The total amount of IRA contributions was nearly twice as much in 1981 compared with 1975, although the average amount was more than 30% lower. The large increase in 1982 both in the number and percentage of returns reporting IRA contributions and the average amount of IRA contributions is a result of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-34 ), which extended eligibility for IRAs to workers with employer-sponsored pensions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) that limited the eligibility for tax-deductible contributions beginning in 1987 sharply curtailed both the number of returns reporting IRA contributions and the average IRA contribution.

Interestingly, there was not a corresponding rise in the number of returns reporting an IRA contribution nor a rise in the percentage of returns reporting a contribution.

Continuing the trend that began in 1990, both total and average IRA contributions were lower from 1998 to 2001, the first four years of the existence of Roth IRAs. While it is possible that the decline in traditional IRA contributions over this period is as a result of taxpayers making Roth IRA contributions instead, a more likely explanation is that decline in traditional IRA contributions is a result of the decreased real value of the IRA contribution limit.

IRS data indicates that 5.9 million households received the Saver's Credit in 2007 and that the average amount of the credit received was $167. Table 10 indicates that the credit may not be widely used: 5.9% of households with Adjusted Gross Incomes under $50,000 claimed the Saver's Credit in 2007.", "Several factors may limit the effectiveness of the Saver's Credit: (1) it is non-refundable, so households with little or no tax liability receive little or no benefit; (2) it is not available to individuals who file their taxes using form 1040EZ; and (3) the credit may be used by individuals who would have made retirement plan contributions in the absence of the credit. Thus, not all retirement plan contributions tied to the credit are \"new\" contributions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adopting Automatic IRAs", "paragraphs": ["Because current tax and other incentives have not substantially increased voluntary participation in the retirement savings system, some policymakers believe that IRA ownership rates could be raised through increased access to retirement accounts. One of the challenges is determining how to comprehensively provide retirement accounts to workers who do not have employer-sponsored pension plans. The success of automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans has prompted calls for an automatic enrollment program for IRAs.", "The Automatic IRA (Auto IRA) is a proposal for increasing workers' access to retirement accounts. Under such proposals, employers above a certain size that have been in business a certain number of years and that do not offer a pension plan would be required to establish IRAs for their employees. The employer would direct a specified percentage of each employee's pay into the IRA. Eligible employees would automatically be enrolled by their employers in the Auto IRA program, but could opt-out of participation or change the amount of their contribution. Employers could, but would not be required to, match their employees' contributions.", "Although approximately 39.1 million households work for employers that do not offer pension plans (about 50% of U.S. working households), not all of these households would be covered by Auto IRAs. Some households might work for employers that are small enough to be exempt from offering Auto IRAs or some households might not meet job tenure requirements.", "An Auto IRA program for most workers without pension coverage could be costly to implement and administer, as millions of individual accounts would likely need to be processed. One goal of Auto IRA proponents is to minimize employers' administrative burdens and fiduciary obligations. For example, there may be questions about which default investments are appropriate for workers that do not make active participation decisions. In addition, Auto IRAs would provide IRAs to some workers who already have traditional or Roth IRAs. Among households that do not have an employer-sponsored pension plan, and therefore would be potentially eligible for the Auto IRA, 25.3% already own IRAs. While individuals could opt out of the Auto IRA, the possibility exists that some individuals may inadvertently exceed the yearly IRA contribution limit. The tax penalty is 6% of amount of the excess contribution. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted that noncompliance with IRA contribution limits is an area of concern and that the IRS has inadequate procedures to ensure compliance. It is estimated that 146,976 taxpayers exceeded the contribution limit in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Financial Literacy", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to improve financial literacy may increase IRA contributions and ownership rates by increasing knowledge of the benefits of IRAs, the Saver's Credit, and the option to have federal income tax refunds deposited directly to IRAs. Many government agencies, non-profit groups, and for-profit companies have ongoing campaigns aimed at improving financial literacy (for example, increasing awareness of credit card fees). In particular, some of these efforts focus on the importance of saving for retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Fee Transparency", "paragraphs": ["Small differences in the amount of fees that financial institutions charge for managing IRAs can yield large differences in the account balances at retirement. Some policymakers have expressed concern regarding the fees that financial institutions charge 401(k) plan participants. Legislation has been introduced that would increase 401(k) plan sponsors' and participants' awareness of the fees that they pay. However, legislation to increase fee transparency for IRA owners has not been introduced. The Department of Labor recently issued an interim final rule that would require greater transparency of fees paid in 401(k) plans. The final rule specifically excludes IRAs, noting that IRA owners are solely responsible for managing their accounts and that IRA fee disclosure requirements could be quite costly. One difference between IRAs and 401(k) plans is that IRA owners have complete control over the choice of the financial institution and investments. However, individuals may find the decisions associated with opening and maintaining IRAs complicated and perhaps overwhelming. This suggests that opportunities may exist for financial institutions to charge higher fees than necessary. A direct comparison of IRA and 401(k) fees is not possible because of the different structures of the plans. IRAs are likely administratively costly, as each separate account requires separate record keeping, whereas 401(k) plan administrators can take advantage of economies of scale."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
