The act serves four basic purposes. First, it reformulates the federal standards for sex offender registration in state, territorial and tribal sexual offender registries, and does so in a manner designed to make the system more uniform, more inclusive, more informative, and more readily available to the public online. Second, it introduces a fairly extensive and diverse set of amendments to federal criminal law and procedure, featuring, among other things, a federal procedure for the civil commitment of convicted sex offenders upon their release from prison, a random search authority over sex offenders on probation or supervised release, and a number of new mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for various new and existing federal sex offenses. Third, it creates, amends, or revives several grant programs designed to reinforce private, state, local, tribal and territorial prevention; law enforcement; and treatment efforts in the case of crimes committed against children. Finally, it calls for a variety of administrative or regulatory initiatives in the interest of child safety, such as the creation of the National Child Abuse Registry.", "The act arrived on the President's desk as H.R. 4472 having been approved by the House on March 8, 2006 and by the Senate on July 20, 2006.

In the case of the House, the predecessor was H.R. 3132 which the House endorsed on September 15, 2005; in the case of the Senate, it was S. 1086 , which the Senate approved on May 4, 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sex Offender Registration", "paragraphs": ["One of the center pieces of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act is the revision of the nation-wide sex offender registration system. The earlier statute, the Jacob Wetterling Act, encouraged states to establish and maintain a registration system. Each of them has done so. The state systems had many common features, but were hardly uniform. The Walsh Act preserves the basis structure of the earlier law, expands upon it, and makes more specific matters that were previously left to individual state choice. It contemplates a publicly available, contemporaneously accurate, online system. Conscious of the legal and technical adjustments required, the Walsh Act anticipates that states and other jurisdictions may require three years or more to fully implement its modifications. As a consequence, for purposes of compliance by the states and other jurisdictions, the prior law remains in effect until the later of three years after enactment or one year after the necessary software for the new uniform, online system has become available.

For example, the Supreme Court recently upheld the random search of the person of a parolee in Sampson v. California .", "As the Court explained in that context, the hallmark of Fourth Amendment compliance is reasonableness, and the courts will \"examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a search is reasonable.\" More precisely, \"Whether a search is reasonable is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interest.\"", "The Court had previously upheld the suspicion-based, but warrantless, search of a probationer's apartment in United States v. Knights . There the Court had observed that in balancing an individual's privacy interest against the interests of the government the weight afforded the individual's interest varies according to the individual's justifiable expectation of privacy under the circumstances, and those subject to punishment by the government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like prisoners, parolees and probationers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 may claim only a reduced expectation of privacy. Among them, however, there is a range of expectations corresponding to the continuum of punishments that accompanies their status. \"On this continuum, parolees have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers\" and those on federal supervised release. Moreover, a parolee's acceptance of suspicionless searches as a condition of parole significantly diminishes the individual's expectation of privacy. Under these circumstances, the Sampson Court concluded Sampson had no legitimate expectation of privacy.", "On the other hand, the Court considered the government's interest substantial, \"a State's interest in reducing recidivism and thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the Fourth Amendment.\"", "In the absence of such an expectation, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the question of whether the search might be justified under the Fourth Amendment's special needs doctrine or under the Amendment's consent exception. Some may believe that Section 210 makes such an examination necessary, since it involves probationers and those on supervised released, individuals said to have a higher expectation of privacy than the parolee in Sampson .", "Application of the Court's special needs and consent jurisprudence, however, presents its own challenges. The special needs doctrine emerged from the Court's school and drug testing cases. Beginning there, the Court has identified circumstances under which the government's particularly weighty special interests, balanced against the nature of the intrusion upon an individual's privacy interests, justify a search without the usual protection of either probable cause or a warrant. Even here, however, the Court has been \"particularly reluctant to recognize exceptions to the general rule of individualized suspicion where the government authorities primarily pursue their general crime control ends.\" Yet there are circumstances under which the Court has been able to overcome its reluctance.", "As for consent, an individual could be said to have consented to a condition for parole and perhaps even probation where the alternative is incarceration, but supervised release is imposed in addition to, rather than in lieu of, imprisonment. Unlike parole or probation, it is imposed rather than accepted. Imposition of the condition, however, is discretionary, and a court might impose alternative, less desirable conditions to be applied should the individual fail to consent to random searches. Whether this would be considered sufficient to constitute a voluntary waiver of an individual's Fourth Amendment rights is unclear at best. Yet the question is unlikely to arise, since the case law in the lower federal courts on a comparable matter suggests that the changes worked by Section 210 would pass constitutional muster.", "Federal law requires consent to DNA sample collection as a mandatory condition of federal probation and of federal supervised release.

In Knights , the Court approved the warrantless search of a probationer by law enforcement officers with reasonable suspicion.

Faced with the argument that the statutes might be used to punish an individual simply because he was thought to pose a risk of committing some undefined crime in the future, the Court upheld a narrowly crafted Kansas statute in Kansas v. Hendricks :", "The challenged Act unambiguously requires as finding of dangerousness either to one's self or to others as a prerequisite to involuntary confinement. Commitment proceedings can be initiated only when a person has been convicted of a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence. The statute thus requires proof of more than mere predisposition to violence; rather, it requires evidence of past sexual violent behavior and a present mental condition that creates a likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not incapacitated. ... . A finding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment. We have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor, such as a mental illness or mental abnormality. These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond they control. The Kansas Act is plainly of a kind with these other civil commitment statutes: it requires a finding of future dangerousness, and then links that finding to the existence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it difficult, if not impossible for the person to control his dangerous behavior. The precommitment requirement of a mental abnormality or personality disorder is consistent with the requirements of these other statutes that we have upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness.", "Soon thereafter the Court seemed to withdraw somewhat from its pronouncements in Hendricks . The Kansas Supreme Court read Hendricks to mean that civil commitment of sex offenders under the statute required proof that they could not control their criminal urges; not so, said the United States Supreme Court in Kansas v. Crane .", "It is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior. And this, when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself, must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment form the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.", "The later courts have been of two minds when it comes to dealing with what standard of control will satisfy due process demands for sexual predator civil commitment statutes in light of Hendricks and Crane . Some assert that the government must show that the individual has \"serious difficulty controlling his potentially dangerous behavior.\" Others conclude that it is sufficient to establish that by virtue of some mental disorder the individual is more likely than not to engage in sexual violence in the future, because such proof \"implicitly includes proof that such persons's mental disorder involves serious difficulty in controlling his or her sexually dangerous behavior.\"", "Section 302 establishes a federal civil commitment procedure for sexual offenders in which it takes the more cautious approach.
