The two provisions, collectively referred to as conservation compliance, require that in exchange for certain U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program benefits, a producer agrees to maintain a minimum level of conservation on highly erodible land and not to convert wetlands to crop production.", "Conservation compliance affects most USDA benefits administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These benefits can include commodity support payments, disaster payments, farm loans, and conservation program payments, to name a few. If a producer is found to be in violation of conservation compliance, then a number of penalties could be enforced. These penalties range from temporary exemptions that allow the producer time to correct the violation, to a determination that the producer is ineligible for any USDA farm payment and must pay back current and prior years' benefits.", "A controversial issue in the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) debate was whether federal crop insurance subsidies should be included on the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands. Ultimately the 2014 farm bill did add federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of benefits that could be lost, but created separate considerations when addressing compliance violations and the loss of federal crop insurance premium subsidies compared with the loss of other farm program benefits.

Recent concerns about a growing backlog of wetland determinations in the Northern Plains and approaching compliance deadlines for crop insurance policyholders have been raised. Additionally, the reduction in soil erosion from highly erodible land conservation continues, but at a slower pace than following the enactment of the 1985 farm bill.

The second type is a conversion of wetland to production , which can result in a denial of all benefits. According to USDA, previous language was used by producers who converted a wetland to argue that USDA has discretion to issue a graduated penalty similar to that of production on converted wetlands rather than a full denial of benefits.

The final OIG report notes that NRCS state offices have developed inadequate guidance for consistently applying standards in conducting compliance reviews. Of particular concern is the treatment and control of gully erosion, which the report highlights as being inconsistently applied across states, therefore leading to inconsistent noncompliance determinations. The report also found that NRCS guidance on the role of a wetland compliance reviewer needed updating to reflect the review's role when wetland inventory maps are found to be inaccurate.

The bulk of this reduction occurred following the 1985 farm bill and the implementation of CRP and conservation compliance requirements. Reduction in soil erosion may also be attributed to other factors. Estimates indicate that compliance provisions could be responsible for approximately 295 million tons, or 25% of the 1.2 billion ton reduction in cropland soil erosion that occurred between 1982 and 1997 (most recent information available).

Conservation compliance, on the other hand, does not increase federal spending but continues to be unpopular among many producer groups. The compliance requirements have also made significant contributions to reducing soil erosion and maintaining wetlands since the 1980s.

The expansion of agricultural production in the 1970s to respond to growing world demand for farm products was accompanied by an increase in soil erosion. Much of this erosion was attributed to producers expanding their acreage into \"marginal\" land\u2014land that easily erodes and is often less productive. Intense production practices were supported by many of the federal farm policies in place at the time. ", "In 1977, Congress enacted the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act ( P.L. 95-192 , referred to as the RCA). The RCA required USDA to appraise the nation's natural resources on nonfederal land and provide Congress with an annual evaluation report. Many of the soil and water resource issues were highlighted in the 1980 RCA report and drew attention to the high societal cost of soil erosion and wetland conservation that resulted from intense production. As part of the National Program for Soil and Water Conservation, USDA presented the alternative of \"cross-compliance,\" in which farmers who receive USDA benefits would be required to meet minimum conservation standards.", "In the early 1980s, large-scale commodity surpluses of certain agricultural products developed from weak global demand and advances in agricultural productivity. In response, during the 1985 farm bill debate, Congress sought new farm policies to increase export markets and reduce domestic production, thereby reducing surpluses. The result was what some classified as a radical departure from the traditional conservation approach.", "1985 Farm Bill", "The Food Security Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-198 , 1985 farm bill) included a number of significant conservation provisions designed to reduce production and conserve soil and water resources.

The financial incentives of CRP far exceeded those of most early conservation programs, and CRP remains the largest conservation program (in terms of funding) to date.

Conservation provisions were expanded to include wetlands converted after enactment (November 28, 1990), where agricultural commodity production was made possible. This meant that crop production did not actually have to occur in order to be found out of compliance, only that production was made possible through activities such as draining, dredging, filling, or leveling the wetland. The 1990 farm bill added six more federal farm programs to the list of benefits that could be lost for non-compliance, including many of the conservation programs. A graduated penalty was added so that under some circumstances, producers could be subject to a loss in benefits of between $500 and $5,000. This graduated penalty may be applied only once every five years. The revisions protect tenant farmers who may be ruled out of compliance because of the actions of the landowner or previous tenants. Compliance exemptions were also expanded to include highly erodible land set aside, or taken out of production, under the commodity support programs.", "1996 Farm Bill", "Beginning in 1994, conservation policy discussions in Congress focused on identifying ways to make the compliance programs less intrusive on farmer activities. As a result, conservation compliance provisions were significantly amended in the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-127 , referred to as the 1996 farm bill). Many of the conservation compliance changes enacted in the 1996 farm bill were meant to provide producer flexibility and reduce the impact on farm operations. Some of the major amendments to highly erodible land conservation compliance in the 1996 farm bill include", "removing crop insurance from the list of benefits that could be lost if the farmer is found out of compliance; adding production flexibility contracts to the list of benefits that could be lost if found out of compliance; highly erodible land exiting CRP would not be held to a higher compliance standard than nearby cropland; providing violators with up to one year to meet compliance requirements; developing procedures to expedite variances for weather, pest, or disease problems; requiring an erosion measurement before the conservation system is implemented; allowing third parties to measure residue and require that residue measurements take into account the top two inches of soil; allowing producers to modify plans as long as the same level of treatment is maintained; allowing local county committees to permit relief if a conservation system causes a producer undue economic hardship; and establishing a wind erosion estimation pilot study to review and modify as necessary wind erosion factors used to administer conservation compliance.", "Several changes were made in the 1996 farm bill to the wetland conservation provisions as well. Similar to the provisions for highly erodible land, wetland conservation provisions were meant to provide greater program flexibility. Major changes included", "exempting swampbuster penalties when wetland values and functions are voluntarily restored following a specified procedure; providing that prior converted wetlands will not be considered \"abandoned\" as long as the land is only used for agriculture; giving the Secretary of Agriculture discretion to determine which program benefits violators are ineligible for and to provide good-faith exemptions; establishing a pilot mitigation banking program (using the CRP); repealing required consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and expanding the definition of agricultural lands used in a 1994 interagency Memorandum of Agreement.", "While the 1996 farm bill reduced the impact of the compliance requirements it also expanded the voluntary incentive-based programs for agricultural conservation.

Few changes were made to the conservation compliance provisions. The primary change was the requirement that USDA not delegate authority to other parties to make highly erodible land determinations.

The sodsaver provision would have made producers who planted crops (five or more acres) on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and the noninsured crop disaster assistance (NAP) program for the first five years of planting. The 2008 farm bill limited the provision to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area, but only if elected by the state. States included in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area are portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. Ultimately no governors opted to participate in the program and sodsaver was never activated.", "2014 Farm Bill", "When the farm bill debate began in 2012, the fiscal climate made reductions in the farm bill baseline all but certain. One of the largest programs on the chopping block was direct payments in the commodity title. Because conservation compliance is tied to farm program benefits the loss of such a large benefit would ultimately reduce the incentive to comply with conservation requirements. Conservation advocates cited the need for additional farm program benefits to be tied to conservation compliance in exchange for the loss of direct payments. Ultimately the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 , 2014 farm bill) added the federally funded portion of crop insurance premiums to the list of benefits that could possibly be lost if a producer were found out of compliance. The amendments, however, treat compliance violations and the loss of federal crop insurance premium subsidies separate from the loss of other farm program benefits.", "Additionally, the 2014 farm bill amended the sodsaver provision by removing the elective option, reducing crop insurance subsidies rather than eliminating them, and expanding the provision to six states.
