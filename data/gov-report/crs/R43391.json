Financial regulators conduct rulemaking and enforcement to implement law and supervise financial institutions. These agencies have been given certain characteristics that enhance their day-to-day independence from the President and Congress, which may make policymaking more technical and less \"political\" or \"partisan,\" for better or worse. Independence may also make regulators less accountable to elected officials and can reduce congressional influence, at least in the short term.", "Although independent agencies share many characteristics, there are notable differences.

Terms for Fed governors and NCUA board members are not renewable. grounds for removal: although not always specified in statute, it appears that the regulator heads can only be removed \"for cause\" (e.g., malfeasance or neglect of duty), with the exception of the Comptroller of the Currency. executive oversight: rulemaking, testimony, legislative proposals, and budget requests are not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. congressional oversight: agencies are statutorily required to submit periodic reports to Congress. Agency officials testify before Congress upon request; some are also statutorily required to do so periodically. Agencies are subject to Government Accountability Office (GAO) audits and investigations. Top leadership is subject to Senate confirmation. Agency rulemaking can be overturned under the Congressional Review Act. funding: the SEC's and CFTC's budgets are set through congressional authorization and appropriations, whereas other regulators set their own budgets. These budgets are funded through the collection of fees or other revenues, with the exception of the CFTC and CFPB.", "From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would alter the structure and design of some of the federal financial regulators, including changes to their leadership and funding structure, the Congressional Review Act, and cost-benefit analysis requirements."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report discusses institutional features that make federal financial regulators (and other independent agencies) relatively independent from the President and Congress.

", " Table 1 lists the federal financial regulators that are discussed in this report, together with their respective responsibilities. The financial regulators were created between 1863 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [OCC]) and 2010 (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [CFPB]). Financial regulators set policy, conduct rulemaking to implement law, and supervise financial institutions. Some of these agencies have other responsibilities in addition to their regulatory responsibilities, and some features influencing their independence may have been motivated by those other responsibilities. For example, the Federal Reserve System (Fed) is responsible for monetary policy and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provide deposit insurance.", "Recent Congresses have considered legislation that would alter the structure and design of some of the federal financial regulators. Congress has debated structural changes such as whether those agencies should be subject to appropriations and should be led by a single leader or a multi-member board. Congress also has debated oversight changes such as whether it should be easier for Congress to reverse agency rulemaking and whether to subject agencies to the same cost-benefit analysis requirements as executive agencies. The issues raised in this report highlight the importance of how those agencies would be structured.", "This report provides a history and overview of the rationale for making financial regulators independent and a discussion of what structural characteristics contribute toward independence and how those characteristics vary among regulators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Context", "paragraphs": ["Public administration scholars and observers of federal government functioning have long studied structural characteristics that endow certain agencies with greater independence from the President and Congress than is typical for such organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What is an Independent Agency?", "paragraphs": ["In a broad sense, the term independent agency refers to a freestanding executive branch organization that is not part of any department or other agency. However, the term is also used to denote a federal organization with greater autonomy from the President's leadership and insulation from partisan politics than is typical of executive branch agencies. These two uses of this term can sometimes lead to confusion. Some agencies within departments, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the Department of Energy, have considerable independence from the direction and control of the President. At the same time, some so-called independent agencies outside the departments, such as the Small Business Administration (SBA), generally adhere to the President's policies and priorities. Congress has sometimes given agencies greater autonomy from its own direction and influence, as well, thereby expanding the meaning of independence. In the context of this report, independence refers to greater autonomy from presidential or congressional direction and insulation from partisan politics, unless otherwise noted.", "Where agencies have been structured to have greater independence from presidential or congressional direction, their actions are typically constrained by a statutory framework, beginning with the terms of the statutes that empower them to take action. Such statutes vary in their specificity, and independent agencies consequently have varying levels of discretion when promulgating more specific rules and otherwise implementing the law. In a well-known example, the Federal Reserve's mandate to achieve full employment and stable prices is set in statute, but it independently determines which policies and tools will best achieve its mandate. Generally, such agencies also are constrained by the Administrative Procedure Act and administrative law; institutionalized oversight mechanisms, such as inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office (GAO); and judicial review. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Independence and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The basic policymaking relationship between Congress and the independent agencies is similar to the relationship between Congress and the other agencies. Goals, principles, missions, and mandates are laid out by Congress for independent agencies in statute, just as they are for other agencies. Furthermore, Congress has granted the independent agencies and other agencies some discretion over how best to implement and conduct these policies, including the limited ability to initiate new policies under broad authority in an area where Congress has not weighed in. Likewise, congressional oversight of policymaking at the independent agencies is similar to how it oversees the Administration\u2014it may require an agency to testify, prepare reports, and turn over records for investigatory purposes. In this sense, independent agencies are independent from the President because the President does not lead or directly influence the implementation and conduct of policy at independent agencies. This arrangement raises a normative question (which this report does not answer)\u2014does the removal of presidential direction from agency policymaking lead to better policy outcomes? ", "Although independent, the federal financial regulators often work together with the President when their policy priorities are aligned with the Administration's priorities, perhaps because the agency heads and the President share similar views or because the President still retains some influence over these agencies, for the reasons that will be discussed in subsequent sections. At other times, when a regulator's priorities are in opposition to the Administration, a regulator might advocate against the Administration's policy position.", "Agency independence is traditionally viewed relative to the Administration, but the structural features discussed in this report can also increase or decrease independence from Congress. Agencies that are more independent from the Administration can sometimes become more congressionally dependent for resources and power. In contrast, where Congress is successful in limiting the President's authority over an agency, this might indirectly reduce the influence of Members over that agency. Inasmuch as Members sometimes raise issues about agency actions through the Administration, a decrease in the President's ability to direct agency action could weaken this channel of congressional influence. ", "Some agency characteristics that more directly shield an agency from congressional control and presidential direction, such as funding the agency outside of the appropriations process, might further insulate the agency from partisan political influence. Although the agency would be constrained by a statutory framework and institutionalized oversight mechanisms, such insulation from partisan influence might lead to more limited accountability by the agency to, and less control of agency activities by, elected officials. In addition, other stakeholders, such as the parties regulated by the agency, might exert greater influence over the agency's activities than would otherwise be the case. Where accountability is a concern, curbing agency discretion is one solution. However, less responsiveness to constituents and other political actors may be inevitable\u2014or even desirable\u2014when the goal is to insulate an agency from political pressures. In short, decisions about the degree of independence to accord an agency involve tradeoffs among various values and goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Origin of the Independent Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The development of the independent agency model in American national government began in 1887 with the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), created to regulate the railroad industry. Although the ICC is generally viewed as the first independent regulatory commission at the national level, it was not initially created with the level of authority and independence that it later achieved. Rather, the ICC's creation in 1887 was the first of a series of congressional actions that aimed to regulate a complex industry fairly and with a minimum of political influence. The agency's regulatory authority initially included quasi-judicial functions, and later included quasi-legislative functions. These functions were seen to differ from the executive functions that were more characteristic of the work of the executive departments, within which composed nearly all national governmental activity at that time. ", "As first created, the ICC was located in the Department of the Interior (DOI). Many administrative matters of the commission required the Secretary of the Interior's approval. In 1889, the commission was moved out of the department and became a freestanding agency. ", "During its first two decades, the ICC was considered to be relatively weak and ineffective. Congress greatly enhanced its powers with the Hepburn Act of 1906. Thus strengthened, the ICC became a model for the collegial federal regulatory bodies established by Congress in the following decades. These included the Federal Reserve System (1913), Federal Trade Commission (1914), Federal Power Commission (1930), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), Federal Communications Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), United States Maritime Commission (1936), and Civil Aeronautics Board (1938), among others. Congress has continued to establish independent financial regulatory agencies into the 21 st century. For example, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was established in 2008, and the CFPB was established in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rationale for Independence", "paragraphs": ["Over the course of the development of the independent agency model, several different rationales for constructing federal organizations this way have emerged. ", "First, agencies have sometimes been given greater independence because they have been vested with quasi-legislative (rulemaking) or quasi-judicial (adjudicatory), as well as executive (supervisory), functions regulating some aspects of the national economy. Structural independence, together with the administrative law framework, can support the principle of separation of powers by insulating the exercise of quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers from executive direction . In most cases, the independence extends to all functions of the agency, even those that are executive in nature.", "Second, agencies have sometimes been given greater independence with the assumption that this will facilitate better decision-making . It is argued that an independent agency structure and the administrative law framework might provide a context within which subject matter experts could have more leeway to use their technical knowledge to address complex issues, because they would be partially insulated from political concerns. This could be desirable if there is a presumption that the agency's work is relatively more technical and less political in nature. ", "Such independence does not guarantee complete insulation from all political considerations, however. Research on bureaucratic functioning indicates that it is virtually impossible to remove all political considerations from administrative activity. This is due, in part, to the level of discretion that necessarily accompanies any activity delegated by Congress to another governmental entity. Independent regulatory commission members and agency administrators, such as the leaders of other federal organizations, exercise judgment and make decisions about how to proceed, and these discretionary judgments and decisions are likely to involve subjective, as well as objective, considerations. The independent regulatory agency model attempts to ensure that such subjective decision making draws on a range of views and is, in this sense, nonpartisan. Nevertheless, a specific appointee might choose to adhere closely to the President's wishes or to approach the job in a partisan manner for other political or policy reasons.", "Third, agencies have sometimes been given greater independence from the executive to provide \"[f]reedom from Presidential domination.\" This may be, as noted above, because regulatory agencies exercise primarily quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions that arguably should not be under the control and direction of the executive. Some proponents of this rationale have suggested that, at least with regard to the quasi-legislative functions, these agencies are arms of Congress. A reduction of presidential influence also constricts one path by which partisan politics might interfere with apolitical technical- and analytical-based decision making by experts, thus speaking to the second rationale noted above. ", "At times, however, the decision to give an agency greater independence from the President might be a reflection of interbranch rivalries over control of the federal bureaucracy and national policies. As one observer put it:", "Congressional attempts to deviate from the bureau model [where the agency is directly under the President] generally arise from disagreements between members of Congress and the president. Some of these disagreements naturally arise from the institutional differences in the two branches. ... The president and members of Congress view the administrative state from entirely different vantage points, and these vantage points, along with their policy preferences , lead to disagreements about how the administrative state should be organized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Independent Financial Regulators", "paragraphs": ["Existing typologies of independent federal agencies and their characteristics are idealized models that describe such organizations in general terms. In reality, although independent agencies share many characteristics, individual independent agencies often have features that might be considered atypical for the category. As one scholar observed with regard to governmental organization more generally:", "There are no general laws defining the structure, powers, and immunities of the various institutional types. Each possesses only those powers enumerated in its enabling act, or in the case of organizations created by executive action, set forth by Executive Order or in a contract. Whatever special attributes may have been acquired by the various organizational types are entirely the product of precedent, as reflected in successive enactments by the Congress; judicial interpretations; and public, agency, and congressional attitudes.", "According to one law review article, \"there is no general, all-purpose statutory or judicial definition of 'independent agency' ... notions of what constitutes independence expand easily.... \" A list of independent regulatory agencies is provided in the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), but only for purposes of that act; the act does not provide a definition of independent. However, the literature identifies a few key traits that distinguish independent agencies from executive agencies. Organizational features that might affect the functional independence of a federal agency include those related to agency location; selection, appointment, and tenure of its leadership; presidential oversight; the authority to issue rules and collect information; and congressional oversight and funding. ", "Leadership characteristics include leadership structure (collegial, e.g., board, or singular, e.g., director), the term of office, level of protection from at-will removal by the President, holdover provisions, and qualifications for office-holding. ", "P residential oversight characteristics include the organization's ability submit reports, testimony, and budget requests to relevant congressional committees independently and without the Administration's review. With regard to rulemaking and information collection, many rules developed by most agencies and departments are reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Rules developed by regulatory agencies specified as independent in the PRA, however, are not reviewed by OIRA and not subject to executive order requirements that their \"economically significant\" rules be subject to cost-benefit analysis. In contrast, the PRA requires that OIRA review the information collection activities of all agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. ", "Congressional oversight of independent agencies takes the form of statutory requirements to submit semi-annual or annual reports to Congress; testimony before Congress by agency officials (some are statutorily required to do so periodically); GAO audits and investigations, subject to some statutory limitations; and Senate confirmation of presidential nominees for top agency leadership. An agency's functional independence may also be influenced by whether it is funded through the appropriations process or through dedicated funding or fees.

With one exception (the OCC), financial regulators are not part of an executive department and do not report to a member of the President's Cabinet. This arrangement is not necessary or sufficient to ensure agency independence , in the sense used in this report, however. For example, some so-called independent agencies located outside the departments, such as the SBA, generally adhere to the President's policies and priorities and are sometimes accorded the status of Cabinet rank. ", "Conversely, the OCC is considered independent from the Administration despite being the only financial regulator located within a department (the Treasury). One might say that the OCC is the exception that proves the rule. Although it is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 31 U.S.C. 321(c) reads \"Duties and powers of officers and employees of the Department are vested in the Secretary except duties and powers-\u2026(2) of the Comptroller of the Currency.\" and 12 U.S.C.

The Secretary of the Treasury may not delay or prevent the issuance of any rule or the promulgation of any regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency, and may not intervene in any matter or proceeding before the Comptroller of the Currency (including agency enforcement actions), unless otherwise specifically provided by law. ", "As explained below, despite its location within Treasury, the OCC has many of the same characteristics as other independent regulators. For example, its budget is determined separately from the rest of the Treasury's budget.

These differences in agencies with similar missions have led to congressional proposals to make leadership structures more uniform across agencies. Vesting power in a board arguably encourages a diversity of views to be represented. In contrast, vesting power in one individual might arguably create stronger, more unified leadership and a single point of accountability. The collegial structure itself is thought to increase the independence of an agency from the President. Where an agency is headed by a single individual, the appointee's views are more likely to reflect the views of the appointing President and its party; the leadership is unitary and no consensus is necessary.

It could be argued that such requirements introduce partisan considerations into a selection process for a body that is intended to exercise expert judgment and be relatively independent of such political influences. As discussed below, however, public administration research suggests that it is virtually impossible to remove all political considerations from administrative activity. Arguably, political balance requirements attempt to ensure that, to the extent that such considerations influence agency decision making, a broader array of opinions will be introduced into the consensus-building process.

In fact, in many instances, fixed terms are accompanied by statutory limits on the President's ability to remove an incumbent during his or her term (see \" Grounds for Removal ,\" below.) The length of the term may also influence the independence of the appointee. An official serving a short term may be more susceptible to presidential direction, especially if he or she might be reappointed by that President. In contrast, an official whose term of office is longer than that of the President who appointed him or her may be less likely to feel a sense of allegiance or commitment to a new President. It might be questioned, however, if fixed terms that exceed the duration of one presidency meet that expectation in practice, because incumbents might not serve the full length of the term. For example, most Fed governors step down before their term has expired, sometimes after only a couple of years of service. One study found that Presidents were able to appoint a majority of commissioners on independent commissions 90% of the time, and were able to obtain a party majority (between new appointees and holdovers) in all but one case.", "A fixed term, even without a restriction on grounds for removal, might lead to longer than average tenure and, in the context of a single-headed agency, greater continuity in a position. Also, by itself, such a fixed term might inhibit, but not prevent, the removal of an incumbent by the President, because it establishes the given period of time as the normal or expected tenure of an appointee.

If such a provision allows for an indefinite holdover, it might be used by the President or other appointing authority to circumvent the need for a new appointment, particularly if Senate confirmation is required. Given this possibility, Congress sometimes places a time limit on a holdover provision. Some agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board, have organic acts with no holdover provision; when a term expires, the member must leave office. Others, such as the Fed, have statutory authorities that permit a member whose term has expired to continue to serve until a successor takes office. Still other agencies have holdover provisions where an incumbent member may remain in office for a specified period, and where the duration of the post-term period is linked to the date the term ends. A commissioner for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, for example, \"may continue to serve after the expiration of his term until his successor has taken office, except that he may not so continue to serve more than one year after the date on which his term would otherwise expire.\" A final type of holdover provision allows incumbent members to remain in office for a specified period, where the duration of the post-term period is linked to congressional sessions.

As a result, for cause does not have a precise meaning, but is understood to include factors such as malfeasance or neglect of duty.

Tradition may also influence a President to allow a full term where there is no statutory for cause protection, as seems to typically be the case for the OCC.", "Even where board members of financial regulators are subject to a for cause removal standard, however, it is possible for the chairman to serve in that capacity at the pleasure of the President, perhaps increasing presidential influence. In the case of the CFTC, for example, the President may replace the chairman at any time with another commissioner, with the advice and consent of the Senate, in which case the former chairman would remain a commissioner. For other collegially headed financial regulators, statute is silent on this issue.

It is required to regularly provide financial reports to Treasury and OMB, but according to statute, the reporting requirements \"may not be construed as implying any obligation on the part of the (FDIC) to obtain the consent or approval\" of Treasury or OMB, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rulemaking Authority59", "paragraphs": ["Federal rulemaking is one of the basic tools that federal agencies use to implement public policy. In enacting legislation, Congress often grants agencies rulemaking authority under which they are required or permitted to set standards and prescribe the details of certain federal policies and programs. When they issue those regulations, agencies are generally required to follow a certain set of procedures established by Congress. The most long-standing and broadly applicable federal rulemaking requirements are in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946, which applies to all executive agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. The APA contains rulemaking requirements and procedures for agency adjudications. The APA also provides for judicial review of rulemaking and agency actions, under which courts can \"set aside\" an agency action if it is found to be unreasonable. ", "In addition to these statutory and judicial constraints on agency rulemaking, an additional set of procedures has been added by Presidents in various executive orders. The requirements include, among other things, that agencies submit their rules to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for review. OIRA review of rules was established in 1981 by President Ronald W. Reagan in Executive Order (E.O.) 12291, and it was continued by President William J. Clinton under E.O. 12866. OIRA review of draft rules gives the President more input into, and control over, the content of rules promulgated by federal agencies during the implementation of federal statutes. ", "Notably, however, the requirement for OIRA review does not apply to the independent regulatory agencies\u2014Presidents have chosen to respect the independence of those agencies while imposing requirements on the executive agencies. This independence from presidential review of rulemaking is considered to be one of the hallmarks of agency independence. The independent regulatory agencies, as a group, are exempted from OIRA review under the terms of E.O. 12866 (as they were under E.O. 12291). E.O. 12866 specifically exempts agencies \"considered to be independent regulatory agencies,\" under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This list includes all of the agencies discussed in this report except for the NCUA. The OCC and CFPB (upon creation) were added to the statutory list of independent regulatory agencies by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. However, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a process by which FSOC may nullify CFPB regulations that they believe put the banking or financial system at risk. Under this process, another agency may request that a CFPB regulation be set aside. The Treasury Secretary then decides whether to issue a temporary stay delaying implementation of a CFPB regulation. After deliberation, the regulation may be set aside by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of FSOC.", "The PRA also contains special requirements for OIRA review of independent regulatory agencies' information collections. In general, if an agency is collecting information from 10 or more nonfederal persons, the agency must seek approval from OIRA before it can proceed with the information collection. The act requires independent regulatory agencies, like other agencies, to submit to OIRA their proposed information collections. Collegially headed independent regulatory agencies can, by majority vote, void any OIRA disapproval of a proposed information collection.

Recently, policymakers have debated the extent to which cost-benefit analysis should be mandated as part of the independent agency rulemaking process. Proponents of cost-benefit analysis consider it to be a reasonable check on arbitrary and capricious rulemaking; opponents of cost-benefit analysis requirements consider it to be too onerous, time-consuming, superfluous (when Congress has already required the agency to prescribe rules), and to make rules vulnerable to legal challenge. Of particular relevance to the issue of agency independence, cost-benefit requirements allow for greater executive influence (if OIRA review is required) or judiciary influence over the rulemaking process (for example, there have been recent court challenges to overturn certain rulemaking on cost-benefit grounds).", "A CRS analysis found that while six financial regulators currently provide some information about the costs or benefits of major rules, none provides quantitative estimates of monetized costs and benefits. Although not subject to E.O. 12866, requirements in current law related to cost-benefit analysis that apply to all the federal financial regulators include the PRA (described above) and a requirement to estimate the impact of proposed regulations on \"small entities,\" such as small businesses or small financial institutions. The banking regulators must also consider the benefits and administrative burdens of new regulations on banks and their customers, \"consistent with the principles of safety and soundness and the public interest.\" In addition, certain statutory provisions related to cost-benefit analysis apply to individual financial regulators. According to 7 U.S.C. Section 15(a), \"Before promulgating a regulation ... the (CFTC) shall consider the costs and benefits\" based on four considerations listed in statute. The SEC must consider \"in addition to the protection of investors, whether the [regulation] will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation\" and \"the impact any [regulation] would have on competition,\" forbidding rules \"which would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate.\" When prescribing a regulation, the CFPB \"shall consider the potential costs and benefits to consumers and (consumer credit providers),\" including the potential for reduced access to consumer financial products, and the impact on small depository institutions and rural consumers. ", "Some have proposed extending cost-benefit requirements to additional agencies. Variations on this proposal that would place a greater restriction on autonomy include enumerating the factors that must be considered in performing the analysis, allowing rules to be implemented only if an agency finds that the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs, \"monetizing\" (i.e., providing quantitative estimates of) costs and benefits, and subjecting the agency's cost-benefit analysis to OIRA review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Oversight and Influence", "paragraphs": ["Each of the federal financial regulators discussed in this report have statutorily established characteristics that give them a greater level of independence from the direction of the President compared with most executive branch agencies.

This power might afford Senators the opportunity to influence the selection of a nominee, evaluate his or her qualifications and experience, solicit a policy commitment from the nominee, and assess his or her view of the relationship between the agency and the President or Congress. Senate confirmation can provide an outside judgment on the suitability of a nominee, although that judgment is not necessarily limited to whether the nominee meets the statutory qualifications. Sometimes the President's nominee is not confirmed because of opposition by Senators from either party. A Senate confirmation process may require the President to choose candidates acceptable to the other party, especially when political party affiliations are required. For that reason, appointees confirmed by the Senate might be more likely to represent views that are acceptable to a broad range of policymakers.

", "GAO audits and investigations can be required by statute (on a one-time or repeated basis) or ad hoc at the request of a member or committee of Congress. Congress may request that GAO investigate a topic based on a desire to raise awareness of a regulator's decision or activity that Congress supports or opposes. Typically, statutes lay out the terms and conditions under which GAO may access the agency's records, report findings, and so on. Reflecting the sensitive nature of financial supervisory authorities, statutes are more restrictive for the auditing of the banking regulators to ensure that confidential information about the financial condition of private banks remains private.

Until 2010, GAO could not audit the Fed's monetary policy or lender of last resort functions.

Most, but not all, financial regulators are not subject to the regular congressional appropriation and authorization processes. The two financial regulators whose funding is primarily determined through the appropriations process and who require periodic reauthorization are the CFTC and the SEC. The CFTC's funding is provided directly from the Treasury's general fund. In contrast, the SEC is funded by fees it collects. The SEC's overall budget level, however, is largely set through the congressional appropriations process, with the SEC then setting the fees to approximately meet the funding level determined by Congress.", "This means that, for example, an amendment to an appropriations bill lowering the funding to the CFTC would be able to redirect this funding to another agency without changing the overall cost of the bill. Changing the funding for the SEC during the appropriations process, however, would not affect the resources available for other agencies. Thus, there may be slightly more pressure on the CFTC budget because it is effectively in competition for funding with the other agencies within an appropriations bill in a way that the SEC is not. ", "The appropriation and authorization process provides Congress a regular opportunity to evaluate an agency's performance. During this process, Congress also might influence the activities of these agencies by legislating provisions that reallocate resources or place limitations on the use of appropriated funds to better reflect congressional priorities. Through line-item funding, bill text, or accompanying committee report text, Congress can encourage, discourage, require, or forbid specific activities at the agency, including rulemaking. Alternatively, it can adjust an agency's overall funding level if it is supportive or unsupportive of the agency's mission or conduct. Thus, control over funding reduces independence from (and increases accountability to) Congress.", "Other financial regulators have more autonomy to determine their own budgets, typically subject to some general language regarding proportionality of budget and mission. For example, the OCC: \"may collect an assessment, fee, or other charge ... as the Comptroller determines is necessary or appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the Office,\" whereas the CFPB is allowed funding in \"the amount determined by the Director to be reasonably necessary to carry out the authorities of the Bureau under Federal consumer financial law.\" Even for such agencies, however, Congress may limit the size of the overall budget. The CFPB's funding is capped at a fixed amount (adjusted for inflation); if the CFPB wishes to further increase its budget, supplemental appropriations are authorized through 2014 (the CFPB has not yet requested such appropriations). ", "Most financial regulators generate income from various sources, particularly fees or assessments on entities that they oversee. For example, the OCC and FHFA primarily generate income from fees levied on regulated entities, whereas the FDIC and NCUA primarily generate income from deposit insurance premiums. The Federal Reserve is unique in that its income is primarily derived from securities (including Treasury securities) that it purchased in the conduct of monetary policy; it also earns interest on loans and charges market prices for market services it offers (e.g., check clearing). Even when an agency's funding comes primarily from fees or assessments, however, the spending of these fees may be subject to congressional approval, as is the case for the SEC discussed above. The two financial regulators that do not largely raise their own revenues are the CFTC and the CFPB. As noted, the CFTC's funding comes from Treasury's general revenues and CFPB funding is transferred from the Federal Reserve's revenues.", "Because of uncertainty about regulators' costs and income, an issue arises of what happens when a regulator collects more revenue than it spends. SEC revenues are added to Treasury's general revenues, except for revenues added to its reserve fund. The OCC, NCUA, FDIC, and FHFA are allowed to invest surpluses in Treasury bonds, available for use to cover any future budgetary shortfalls (caused by the resolution of failing financial institutions, for example). The Fed's investment income regularly generates surpluses an order of magnitude larger than its expenses, and so it periodically remits the vast majority of these surpluses to Treasury (where they are added to the general fund), adding the rest to its surplus account."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Thoughts", "paragraphs": ["In the late 19 th century, Congress began to establish certain federal agencies with organizational characteristics that gave them a greater degree of independence from presidential direction than would otherwise have been the case. Some of the earliest agencies structured in this way were those with financial regulatory responsibilities, including the Fed (1913), the FDIC (1933), and the SEC (1934). Over time, Congress has, in certain cases, given agencies organizational characteristics that resulted in a greater degree of independence from Congress, as well. Several rationales for doing so have been identified, and these include the perceived need to insulate officials carrying out quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions from the direction of the President; the perception that insulation from partisan politics might yield better decisionmaking and policymaking based on technical expertise; and institutional rivalries between Congress and the President over control of the federal bureaucracy.", "Congress has continued to establish independent financial regulatory agencies into the 21 st century. For example, FHFA was established in 2008, and CFPB was established in 2010. The continuing use of the independent regulatory agency model, in one form or another, suggests that Congress continues to find agency independence to be appropriate under certain circumstances. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses indicate that Congress is still deliberating over the right regulatory structure to balance independence and accountability.", "In view of the use of the independent regulatory model for the design of federal financial regulatory agencies, several questions might arise. First, what is the relative level of independence among these agencies? Second, what is the effect of independence on the functioning of these agencies? Relatedly, what are the positive and negative consequences, in practice, of giving these agencies greater independence from the President and from Congress?", "Congress has granted federal financial regulators independence in ways obvious (\"for cause\" removal, self-financing) and subtle (exemption of agency testimony and budget requests from OMB review). No two independent agencies have exactly the same structure. It might be impractical to assess the relative levels of independence among agencies on the basis of the number or type of characteristics of independence an agency has. As Congress has established additional agencies with these kinds of independence, it has used various combinations of organizational features to address a variety of policy contexts and preferences, and this makes comparisons difficult. These differences could reflect the differences in the roles and responsibilities of the various regulators, or simply reflect historical accident. Federal financial regulators that are relatively more independent in some areas are relatively less independent in others. For example, the OCC is located within the Department of the Treasury and the Comptroller does not have for cause protection, but has greater budgetary independence than the SEC or CFTC. That said, the Fed has been given the most independence of any financial regulator on all the measures considered in this report (where differences exist), presumably in deference to its monetary policy responsibilities. Besides structural characteristics, the culture and traditions of an agency and the relationships between its leadership and the President can also influence the relative independence of the agency during a particular period.", "Arguably, a more relevant assessment might evaluate the degree to which specific features of independence at particular agencies serve current policy contexts and preferences. Congress might, as part of its oversight of federal regulators, choose to investigate the impact of these features on the relationships between the agency and the President, the agency and Congress, and the agency and the regulated industry. It might also assess the character of the policymaking that such independence allows. Finally, Congress could elect to assess the degree to which the agency's operations are subject to governmental checks and balances.", "An assessment of a financial regulator, like that of any independent regulatory agency, might examine not only the level of independence accorded to that organization, but also the responsibilities and authorities that have been vested in its leadership. Arguably, the degree of autonomy and power together might have the greatest impact on the integrity of the policymaking process and policy outcomes, as well as the preservation of democratic accountability. ", "Agency independence is traditionally viewed relative to the President, but the structural features discussed in this report can also increase or decrease independence from Congress. Agencies that are more independent from the President can sometimes become more congressionally dependent for resources and power. In contrast, where Congress is successful in limiting the President's authority over an agency, this might indirectly reduce the influence of Members over that agency. Some agency characteristics that more directly shield an agency from congressional control and presidential direction, such as funding the agency outside of the appropriations process, might further insulate the agency from partisan political influence. Although the agency would be constrained by a statutory framework and institutionalized oversight mechanisms, such insulation from partisan influence might lead to more limited accountability by the agency to, as well as less control of agency activities by, elected officials. In short, decisions about the degree of independence to accord an agency might involve tradeoffs among various values and goals."], "subsections": []}]}}
