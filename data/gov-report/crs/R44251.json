The current rule is often called \"birthright citizenship.\"", "However, driven in part by concerns about unauthorized immigration, some have questioned this understanding of the Citizenship Clause, and in particular the meaning of \"subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States].\" Proponents of a narrower reinterpretation of that phrase argue that the term \"jurisdiction\" can have multiple meanings, and that in the Citizenship Clause, \"jurisdiction\" should be read to mean \"complete jurisdiction\" based on undivided allegiance and the mutual consent of the sovereign and the subject. This has been termed a \"consensual\" approach to citizenship. Conversely, proponents of the conventional view interpret the term \"jurisdiction\" to mean territorial jurisdiction, that is, the authority of a sovereign to enforce its laws within its boundaries. Under the conventional rule, citizenship is ascribed to a person at birth on the basis of the geographic location of that person's birth in the United States. This birthright citizenship rule has sometimes been termed an \"ascriptive\" approach to citizenship.", "Proponents of either side of this legal debate argue that a variety of sources and arguments support their respective positions. The two approaches differ in their interpretations of pre-Revolutionary English common law, pre-Civil War understandings of citizenship, the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and subsequent case law. Two key Supreme Court cases in particular, Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), interpreted the Citizenship Clause. Elk held that a member of a recognized Indian tribe was outside the scope of the Citizenship Clause because he was born owing allegiance to the tribe, rather than the United States, and the tribe was a political community not fully subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Wong Kim Ark held that a person born in the United States to resident aliens became a U.S. citizen at birth, even when the person's parents were barred from ever naturalizing. However, some argue that Wong Kim Ark's statements limiting the exceptions to birthright citizenship were not necessary to its holding, and that no Supreme Court case has ever squarely held that the Citizenship Clause requires a broad view of jurisdiction that extends birthright citizenship to children of unlawfully or temporarily present aliens. Twentieth and 21st century case law also can be seen to support the conventional interpretation of the Citizenship Clause, but again, not in direct case holdings.", "Bills have been introduced since the early1990s to deny birthright citizenship to persons born in the United States to aliens other than lawful permanent residents. While a few proposals have suggested constitutional amendments, most seek to change the birthright citizenship rule by statute. It would likely fall to federal courts to determine whether such a statute could be upheld as constitutional. The weight of the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, the analysis and discussion in Wong Kim Ark, the statements in various cases defining \"jurisdiction\" more often on the basis of territory rather than undivided allegiance, and the embrace of the prevailing birthright citizenship interpretation by more than a century of subsequent law, would probably factor against the constitutionality of a statute limiting birthright citizenship. Nevertheless, the scope of the guarantee of the Citizenship Clause remains a legal question of great interest and importance to many."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, some scholars, legislators, and others have proposed to reexamine and potentially reinterpret the U.S. Constitution's Citizenship Clause to change and limit the current rule of conferring U.S. citizenship at birth to any person born in the United States, or \"birthright citizenship.\" The Citizenship Clause is the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\u2026.\" The policy debates on the topic of birthright citizenship are far-ranging, driven by concerns regarding unauthorized immigration, global antiterrorism efforts, reports of \"birth tourism,\" and congressional redistricting, among other issues. The legal debates, however, center squarely on the six words in the middle of the Citizenship Clause: \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\"", "The Citizenship Clause has conventionally been taken to require U.S. citizenship generally to be accorded automatically to any child born within the United States, regardless of the citizenship or status of the child's parents. The \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" language has been interpreted to impose limited exceptions, such as for children of diplomats and foreign ministers (who are accorded immunity from U.S. law). This interpretation flows from the English common law doctrine of jus soli (\"right of soil\"), under which a person's nationality at birth is determined by the territory within which the person was born. The alternative doctrine of jus sanguinis (\"right of blood\"), which determines a person's nationality by descent, is now the more common general system outside of North and South America. However, each system's adherents have incorporated some elements of the other, with few purely adopting one or the other.", "The jus soli interpretation of the Citizenship Clause is recognized in a number of judicial decisions; however, arguably, no case has ever directly held whether the Citizenship Clause extends to children of aliens who are present in the United States unlawfully. The factual scenarios of the key cases interpreting the Citizenship Clause, Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), involved Native Americans and children of domiciled resident aliens, respectively. Elk found that members of Indian tribes were not granted U.S. citizenship by the Fourteenth Amendment (a situation which was eventually remedied by statute ), while Wong Kim Ark found that the child of Chinese citizens residing in San Francisco had become a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth and therefore was not subject to the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the time.", "Some scholarship in the past few decades has argued that the phrase \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" in the Citizenship Clause was in fact intended by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment to include only those children born to lawfully present or lawfully resident aliens, and not children of unauthorized or nonimmigrant aliens. These arguments have been embraced by some legislators, who have introduced bills since the early 1990s seeking to change the jus soli rule in various ways. Many of these bills target Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which tracks the language of the Citizenship Clause and states: \"The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth: (a) a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u2026.\"", "Any statute reinterpreting the Citizenship Clause to exclude children of certain aliens would face judicial review by federal courts. Because of the core constitutional principles involved, it seems probable that any case on such a statute could reach the Supreme Court. The Court could find such a statute constitutional if it interpreted the \"subject to the jurisdiction\" language of the Citizenship Clause to exclude the children of certain aliens from the scope of the Clause's protection. To uphold a statute limiting birthright citizenship, it would also appear that the Court would have to find either (1) that the discussion in Wong Kim Ark apparently supporting the conventional interpretation of birthright citizenship was mere dicta, not binding precedent, and the case's holding was limited to the facts of that case; or (2) that Wong Kim Ark incorrectly interpreted the Citizenship Clause, at least in some respects, and should be overruled. If a statute could not change the meaning of the Citizenship Clause, then a constitutional amendment, as some have proposed, would have the power to do so. Proponents and opponents of the current birthright citizenship rule have marshalled a variety of arguments and historical records on all of these points.", "This report first sets the stage for analyzing the modern debates by providing a brief historical review of U.S. citizenship from the time of the founding through the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of 1868. It then describes the primary Supreme Court decisions analyzing the scope of the Citizenship Clause, as well as subsequent decisions generally reflecting the conventional understanding of birthright citizenship. This report then presents an overview of the main legal arguments for and against reassessing the scope of the Citizenship Clause, building on the history and judicial precedent described in previous sections. In light of the various bills that have been proposed to modify birthright citizenship, this report closes by discussing the primary legal considerations that would determine whether any congressional action to restrict birthright citizenship of U.S.-born children of alien parents without constitutional amendment could be upheld.

The Constitution required that a person have been a citizen of the United States for seven years to be a Representative and for nine years to be a Senator, and that a person be a natural-born citizen or a citizen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in order to be eligible to be President. It also gave Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, but naturalization refers to the manner in which a non-citizen acquires citizenship, rather than citizenship by birth. Nor did the Naturalization Act of 1790 or subsequent acts until the Civil Rights Act of 1866 define citizenship by birth within the United States.", "In the absence of any statement in the Constitution or federal statutes that U.S. citizenship was acquired by right of birth in the United States, citizenship at birth generally was construed in the context of the English common law. As noted by the Supreme Court, \"[t]he interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history.\"", "For example, in an 1824 inheritance case, the Supreme Court proceeded on the assumption that three girls born in the United States were citizens, although their father was an Irish citizen who never naturalized. In 1830, the Supreme Court held that the law of England as to citizenship at birth was the law of the English colonies, and that a person born in New York after the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 was a citizen of the United States, unless he was born in British-occupied territory, left for England as a minor, and did not elect to affirm his U.S. citizenship within a reasonable time after attaining his majority. In another early case more directly on point, Lynch v. Clarke , a New York court held in 1844 that Julia Lynch, born to Irish aliens while they were temporarily sojourning in New York, was a U.S. citizen. In determining the appropriate national law to apply, the Lynch court looked to the traditional English common law doctrine of jus soli , holding that by the \"law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever were the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen.\" ", "These birthright citizenship principles were not extended to slaves, or generally to Native Americans. Moreover, in the infamous 1857 case of Dred S cott v. Sandford , Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that the Constitution \"point[ed] directly and specifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons, and show[ed] clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the Government then formed,\" and held that the Constitution precluded both Congress and states from granting citizenship to descendants of slaves or people of African descent generally. As such, the Dred Scott decision applied a rigid racial limitation on the jus soli doctrine.

The first section of that act repealed Dred Scott . It provided \"[t]hat all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States\u2026.\"", "Prior to passage of the act, Congress debated its effects on citizenship, particularly the language \"not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed.\" Senator Lyman Trumbull, a lead sponsor, introduced language similar to the above but omitting the exclusion for \"Indians not taxed\" on January 30, 1866. Senator Trumbull explained that \"[o]ur dealings with the Indians are with them as foreigners, as separate nations,\" and in response to an inquiry from Senator Edgar Cowen whether the provision would \"have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country,\" responded: \"Undoubtedly.\" Notably, Senator Trumbull and Senator Cowen agreed that \"the children of German parents\" were citizens under what was then the current law, and disagreed over the effects of race, rather than alien status of the parents. However, in other statements on the citizenship provision, Senator Trumbull discussed the requirements of citizenship to be enshrined by the provision in terms of \"owing allegiance\" to the United States, or similar conditions seemingly additional to geographic presence.

As passed in the House and introduced in the Senate, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment lacked a citizenship provision. Senator Benjamin Wade proposed an amendment that would remove the word \"citizen\" from what would become the \"privileges and immunities\" clause and replace it with \"person,\" saying that \"the word 'citizen' \u2026 is a term about which there has been a good deal of uncertainty in our Government.\" In the discussion that ensued, Senator Wade explained his understanding that the only instance in which \"a person may be born here and not be a citizen\" was \"in the case of children of foreign ministers\u2026.\" ", "The Citizenship Clause was initially introduced by Senator Jacob Howard to read: \"All persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the States wherein they reside.\" Senator Howard stated: ", "This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons.", "Once again, Senator Cowen objected and inquired, \"Is the child of the Chinese immigrant in California a citizen? \u2026 [I]s it proposed that the people of California are to remain quiescent while they are overrun by a flood of immigration\u2026?\" Senator John Conness, of California, responded: \"The proposition before us \u2026 relates simply to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens\u2026. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States\u2026.\" ", "Further debate proceeded largely on the topic of Native American status. In that context, Senator Trumbull stated: \"What do we mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States?' Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means. Can you sue a Navajoe [sic] Indian in court? Are they in any sense subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States? By no means. We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction.\"", "Despite the Citizenship Clause's expansion of birthright citizenship to \"all persons born \u2026 in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" regardless of race, naturalization remained racially restricted even after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868; the Naturalization Act of 1870 extended the naturalization process to \"aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent,\" but other aliens who were not \"free white persons\" remained excluded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Litigation Involving the Citizenship Clause", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Slaughter-House Cases and Elk v.

In the course of its decision, the majority stated that \"[t]he phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States, born within the United States.\" However, this statement is generally regarded as dicta, that is, a remark not controlling as precedent on later courts because it was made in reference to an issue not actually before the court.", "Elk v.

A local registrar refused to register Elk as a qualified voter, on the grounds that Elk \"was an Indian, and therefore not a citizen of the United States.\" The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Elk's case against the registrar, holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not make members of Indian tribes U.S. citizens at birth, largely because of the tribes' special status as independent political communities. It declared that a member of an Indian tribe was born owing allegiance to that tribe rather than to the United States, and tribes were not fully subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

When Wong Kim Ark returned to the United States from a several month visit to China in 1895, he was detained on his steamship when a customs agent (responsible for immigration enforcement at the time) declared that he was not a U.S. citizen and that he therefore was barred from entry by the Chinese Exclusion Acts. The government argued before the Supreme Court that \"subject to the jurisdiction\" referred to those born within the political, not territorial, jurisdiction of the United States.

The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.", "The Court declared that \"[e]very citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States,\" reading allegiance fairly broadly and indeed \"independently of any domiciliation \u2026 [or] renouncing any former allegiance\u2026.\" The enumerated exceptions to birthright citizenship, for children of foreign diplomats, foreign public ships, or hostile occupying enemies, and members of Indian tribes, were also reiterated on several occasions in the opinion. Moreover, the birthright citizenship guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause could not be abridged by the Chinese Exclusion Acts or any other legislation: \"The Fourteenth Amendment, while it leaves the power, where it was before, in Congress, to regulate naturalization, has conferred no authority upon Congress to restrict the effect of birth, declared by the Constitution to constitute a sufficient and complete right to citizenship.\" ", "The Court's ultimate holding, on the specific facts of the case, was phrased more narrowly than the foregoing general pronouncements on jus soli generally: ", "[A] child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States.", "Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Harlan dissented, objecting to the application of the English common law rule and urging a narrower view of allegiance and jurisdiction.

Texas had argued \"that the Equal Protection Clause directs a State to afford its protection to persons within its jurisdiction \" and that \"persons who have entered the United States illegally are not 'within the jurisdiction' of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws. \" The Court disagreed, holding that \"[t]o permit a State to employ the phrase 'within its jurisdiction' in order to identify subclasses of persons whom it would define as beyond its jurisdiction, thereby relieving itself of the obligation to assure that its laws are designed and applied equally to those persons, would undermine the principal purpose [of] the Equal Protection Clause \u2026.\"", "While the threshold inquiry in Plyler centered on the \"person within [a state's] jurisdiction\" language of the Equal Protection Clause, the Court also analogized that phrase to the use of \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause, in a footnote, stating: ", "Although we have not previously focused on the intended meaning of this phrase [\"within its jurisdiction\"], we have had occasion to examine the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that \"[all] persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States\u2026.\" (Emphasis added.) Justice Gray, writing for the Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark , 169 U.S. 649 (1898), detailed at some length the history of the Citizenship Clause, and the predominantly geographic sense in which the term \"jurisdiction\" was used.

Legally, the \"jurisdiction\" referred to by the Citizenship Clause is territorial jurisdiction, which is the power of a sovereign to enforce its laws within its territorial limits. This conventional interpretation has been called the \"ascriptive\" view (at least by some opponents) because it determines citizenship by the objective geographical circumstances of a person's birth. ", "On the other side, some argue that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require U.S. citizenship to be automatically granted to persons born in the United States to aliens, especially those aliens who are present unlawfully or who are domiciled elsewhere. The core of this argument is that the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" was intended to codify a limitation on the birthright citizenship principle that, in the words of two of its early proponents, \"demanded a more or less complete, direct power by government over the individual, and a reciprocal relationship between them at the time of birth, in which the government consented to the individual's presence and status and offered him complete protection.\" The \"jurisdiction\" referred to by the Citizenship Clause, in this view, is a more \"complete\" jurisdiction that entails undivided allegiance. This opposing view has been called the \"consensual\" approach, as its proponents would \"make political membership a product of mutual consent by the polity and the individual.\" In short, as one of the aforementioned Hamdi v. Rumsfeld amicus brief argued unsuccessfully before the Supreme Court in 2004, \"[i]t is not the physical location of birth that defines citizenship, but the express or implied consent to jurisdiction of the sovereign.\" It is generally acknowledged that opposition to the conventional interpretation is the minority viewpoint."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Divergent Interpretations of Common Law, Legislative History, Constitutional Text, and Case Law", "paragraphs": ["Both sides of the birthright citizenship debate look back to colonial and pre-colonial times for evidence for their respective positions. Some legal writers favoring a narrower reinterpretation of birthright citizenship have emphasized statements in English common law cases referring to \"aliens in amity\"; they argue that even the common law doctrine of jus soli came to rely upon mutual consent between the citizen and the sovereign, and that the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to abandon what they interpret as common law notions of consent. Other consensualist legal writers say that to the extent the English common law made persons English subjects purely on the basis of the place of their birth, the American Revolution rejected this element of the English common law and enshrined more consensualist ideals of a social contract. Consensualist legal writers have also emphasized the right of expatriation, or the voluntary ending of citizenship, as a corollary that they argue supports an allegiance based approach to gaining citizenship at birth. Proponents of the conventional interpretation of the Citizenship Clause generally argue that the American Founders understood the English common law doctrine of jus soli to include only limited exceptions for children born to diplomats and hostile occupying forces, and that, as various passages in the Wong Kim Ark decision describe, this understanding of the jus soli doctrine informed the framing of the Fourteenth Amendment.", "Interpretations of the legislative history of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of its precursor language in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, are similarly divergent, even as to some of the very same passages in the Congressional Globe . As recognized by the Supreme Court, \"the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment \u2026 like most other legislative history, contains many statements from which conflicting inferences can be drawn\u2026.\" Those in favor of narrowing birthright citizenship often point to passages in the 1866 congressional debates referring to \"complete jurisdiction\" or notions of \"allegiance,\" arguing that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment would not have understood today's unlawfully present aliens or their U.S. born children as meeting these requirements. However, the legislators' statements cited by consensualist writers were made largely, though not entirely, in the context of the exclusion from the Citizenship Clause of members of Indian tribes. As proponents of retaining birthright citizenship point out, other indicia in the legislative history indicate that children of aliens were considered differently than children of Indian tribe members and were broadly intended to be included within the Citizenship Clause's scope. The two sides also differ as to how the Civil Rights Act of 1866's language giving citizenship to all persons born in the United States \"not subject to any foreign power\" should be evaluated in interpreting the modified language in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.", "Within the consensualist camp, it appears that most argue that Wong Kim Ark could be interpreted narrowly, rather than overturned, in order to support reinterpreting the Citizenship Clause. As noted above, Wong Kim Ark's parents had apparently established as firm a foothold in the United States as was legally available to them; the holding of the case referred to their \"permanent domicil and residence in the United States\" at the time of his birth, although the rest of the analysis and the discussion in the case ranged much more broadly. Proponents of the birthright citizenship status quo argue that the Elk v. Wilkins and Wong Kim Ark Supreme Court decisions in the 1800s essentially settled the meaning of the Citizenship Clause, in part by enumerating the few exceptions to the jus soli doctrine, which did not include the unlawful or temporary presence in the United States of a person's alien parents at the time of that person's birth.", "Supporters of the ascriptive and consensual viewpoints also debate, for example, whether other case law supports giving the term \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause its more conventional and straightforward definition based on geographic territoriality, or a narrower and more context-specific definition based on allegiance and consent. Supporters of the prevailing interpretation also argue that a broader interpretation of \"jurisdiction\" hews more closely to a textualist approach, and avoids having to draw an \"elaborate construct\" of consent and allegiance from contextual sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disagreement over Historical Precedent for Modern Immigration Issues", "paragraphs": ["An argument often raised by those who wish to change the current rule of birthright citizenship is that illegal immigration, in the form it exists today, did not exist prior to the adoption of general immigration statutes, which was well after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Some commentators have argued that \"it is simply wrong to assert that there has ever been a conscious deliberate decision, by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment or its judicial interpreters, to accord birthright citizenship under the [Citizenship] clause to children of illegal aliens.\" Proponents of a narrower interpretation argue that the United States embraced a more open borders policy prior to the Twentieth Century, and point out that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment apparently did not discuss unlawfully present aliens per se, as recorded in the Congressional Globe (precursor to today's Congressional Record ). The Wong Kim Ark decision also did not expressly declare that the children of unlawfully present aliens were included within the scope of the Citizenship Clause, because Wong Kim Ark's parents had apparently been lawfully domiciled in San Francisco at the time of his birth. ", "On the other hand, the Chinese Exclusion Acts were a legal fact by the time the Wong Kim Ark case was decided, and any Chinese citizen who entered the United States in violation of these Acts would have been unlawfully present. Violations of the Chinese Exclusion Acts were known by the time of Wong Kim Ark to have occurred, and some late nineteenth century writers believed they had occurred at a large scale. Some modern commenters have also pointed to slaves imported in violation of the slave import ban that took effect in 1808, or to socially isolated and generally unwelcome \"Gypsies\" allegedly entering the United States, as nineteenth century precursors to today's unlawfully present aliens that would have been known to the framers and judicial interpreters of the Citizenship Clause.

This is because the Citizenship Clause sets a minimum guarantee, a floor above which Congress may but is not required to extend U.S. citizenship by birth to additional groups, as it has done for Native Americans and for children of U.S. citizens born abroad under certain circumstances. If, as many argue, the current interpretation is required under the language and context of the Citizenship Clause and relevant judicial precedent, then a statute or other action purporting to reinterpret the Citizenship Clause more narrowly would be held unconstitutional, and a new amendment to the Constitution would be necessary to impose new restrictions on America's birthright citizenship policy. ", "It would likely fall to the judicial branch to determine whether the Citizenship Clause would permit a narrower interpretation by Congress (or by the Executive Branch). This determination could potentially require a court to weigh a number of complex considerations, including: ", "canons of constitutional interpretation, including the degree to which textualist, originalist, traditionalist, prudential, and aspirational or ethical approaches should be applied to the Citizenship Clause; separation of powers, and each branch's relative authority to interpret\u2014and particularly to limit\u2014rights set forth in the Constitution, especially the Fourteenth Amendment; stare decisis, or adherence to judicial precedent, and how to interpret and apply relevant cases; and the specific nature and language of the citizenship-limiting statute or other action under review. ", "Opinions on the most likely outcome of such a determination differ. Judge Richard Posner, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated in a 1996 concurrence that \"[a] constitutional amendment may be required to change the rule whereby birth in this country automatically confers U.S. citizenship, but I doubt it. \u2026 Congress would not be flouting the Constitution if it amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to put an end to the nonsense.\" Some commentators have testified before Congress that they believe a statute denying birthright citizenship to children of unlawfully present aliens would likely survive constitutional challenge. Others, however, have concluded that any of a number of legal and constitutional obstacles would more likely prove insurmountable to a narrower reinterpretation of the Citizenship Clause.", "Since automatic granting of American citizenship to all who are born here, without inquiring into parental origins or status, has been the practice and the law for more than a century, some supporters of the status quo have contended that a reinterpretation of the Citizenship Clause would mark a \"seismic shift\" in constitutional law. The size of the policy change, in itself, could present an impediment to judicial support for the constitutionality of a citizenship-limiting statute. Opponents of reinterpretation could also urge a court to take into legal consideration what they view as practical, policy, or ethical considerations stemming from issues such as the potential for creation of a stateless subpopulation. It has also been argued that \"[t]he justices may also be reluctant to weaken a constitutional amendment explicitly designed to override a previous Supreme Court ruling\u2014especially if that ruling was Dred Scott .\" On the other hand, proponents of a narrower reinterpretation could potentially avail themselves of a number of practical and policy counterarguments; for example, some have asserted that a major divergence of modern circumstances from historical assumptions warrants a change from the prevailing interpretation.", "Congress's authority to reinterpret the Citizenship Clause, to exclude persons born in the United States to unlawfully or temporarily present aliens from its scope, would be significantly constrained if the Wong Kim Ark decision and subsequent case law were to be interpreted as having settled that issue in favor of those persons' inclusion. Factors that the U.S. Supreme Court generally considers when responding to a request to overrule precedent include whether that precedent \"has proved 'unworkable' \u2026, the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\" Ultimately, the Court \"does not overturn its precedents lightly. Stare decisis \u2026 is a foundation stone of the rule of law, \u2026 [and] 'any departure' from the doctrine 'demands special justification.'\" However, if any discussion in Wong Kim Ark arguably extending beyond the citizenship of a person born to lawfully present and domiciled aliens is deemed mere dicta, unnecessary to the case's holding, then the Court would not be bound by it, although it could still weigh the dicta's persuasive value.", "Other precedent less specific to citizenship issues could pose legal obstacles to a reinterpretation as well. For example, courts would have to grapple with the meaning of \"jurisdiction\" as it has been interpreted in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, which follows the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. ", "Finally, any statute reinterpreting the Citizenship Clause would be far more difficult to uphold if it were designed to operate retroactively to remove or revoke any living person's U.S. citizenship. As stated by the Supreme Court in Afroyim v. Rusk , a 1967 case that held unconstitutional a statute that provided that a U.S. citizen would lose his citizenship upon voting in a political election in a foreign state:", "Citizenship is no light trifle to be jeopardized any moment Congress decides to do so under the name of one of its general or implied grants of power. \u2026 The very nature of our free government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship. We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to, and does, protect every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race. Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.", "However, Congress tends to propose applying birthright citizenship restrictions only prospectively, which, as a consequence, would not result in the loss of citizenship by any person already a citizen. Nevertheless, a number of hurdles to such bills likely remain, including but not limited to the weight of the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, the extensive discussion in Wong Kim Ark , the statements in various cases defining \"jurisdiction\" more often on the basis of territory rather than undivided allegiance, and the embrace of the prevailing birthright citizenship interpretation by more than a century of subsequent law and practice. In light of these factors, it appears likely that a constitutional challenge to a statute denying citizenship to persons born to unlawfully present or nonimmigrant aliens could possibly succeed in barring the statute, absent a constitutional amendment providing that such persons do not acquire citizenship by right of their birth in the United States.
