Congress faces the issue of how to balance these interests (which may fall on various sides of any given species controversy) with the protection of endangered and threatened species and, as stated in ESA, \"the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend.\" Because of strong support and strong opposition, ESA has not been reauthorized since the last authorization expired in 1992. In the 109 th Congress, there were several unsuccessful attempts to enact comprehensive legislation that would have reauthorized ESA.

A stated purpose of ESA is to protect the ecosystems of which listed species are a part. Under ESA, species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) may be listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. More flexible management can be provided for species listed as threatened. Distinct population segments of vertebrate species may also be listed as threatened or endangered. Consequently, some populations of Chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California have been listed under ESA, even as other healthy populations of these same species in Alaska are not listed and may be commercially harvested. More limited protection is available for plant species under ESA. Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools, including penalties and citizen suits, are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat. Use of these tools, or the failure to use them, has led to conflict.", "ESA is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, Department of the Interior) for terrestrial and freshwater species and some marine mammals, and by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS; also referred to as NOAA Fisheries) in the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the remaining marine and anadromous species. The U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Resources Division conducts research on species for which FWS has management authority; NMFS conducts research on the species for which it is responsible.", "As of November 16, 2010, a total of 1,163 species of animals and 796 species of plants were listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA, of which the majority (578 species of animals and 793 species of plants) occur in the United States and its territories; the remainder occur only in other countries. Of the 1,371 U.S. species, 1,138 (83%) are covered in active recovery plans. Of the U.S. species, 600 (43.8%) have designated critical habitat (CH) in some portion of their range. In the most recent data available, FY2009 federal and state expenditures on endangered and threatened species totaled $1,470,755,607, of which $1,391,246,409 was reported by federal agencies and $79,509,198 was reported by the states. The top 10 species with the most total FY2009 expenditures (excluding land acquisition costs) included seven subpopulations of steelhead and Pacific salmon (altogether, more than $317 million), pallid sturgeon (more than $41 million), bull trout (almost $35 million), and the red-cockaded woodpecker (more than $25 million).", "However, species do not exist in isolation, but evolve and fluctuate in abundance because of their relationships with other species and the physical environment. Conservationists increasingly are talking about ecosystems as the units of interest, rather than species. At times, efforts to protect and recover listed species are controversial; declining species often function like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, by flagging larger issues of resource scarcity and altered ecosystems. Past resource debates in which ESA-listed species were part of larger issues include Tennessee's Tellico Dam (water storage and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves, as well as snail darters); Pacific Northwest timber harvest (protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing, recreation, and ecosystem protection, including salmon and spotted owls); and the management of the Apalachicola Basin in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia (allocation of water among metropolitan, agricultural, and industrial users along with commercial and recreational fishing interests, as well as one listed fish and three mussel species)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Provisions of Domestic Law", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Listing", "paragraphs": ["Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary or by petition from an individual, group, or state agency.

In deciding whether a species warrants the protections of ESA, the Secretary may not take into account the economic effects that listing may have; economic and other considerations may be taken into account in structuring alternatives for assisting the species after listing.", "In addition, FWS and NMFS may identify selected species by adding them to a list of candidate species that are believed to be at sufficient risk to warrant protection, but whose protection is precluded by work to protect species already listed.

However, if the publication of this information is not prudent (e.g., might encourage vandals or collectors), the Secretary may decide not to designate CH. In addition, the Secretary may postpone designation for up to one year after listing, if the information is not determinable (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533). As of November 16, 2010, FWS had designated CH for almost 44% of listed domestic species.", "As a practical matter, CH has not been designated for most listed species largely because FWS prefers to allocate its resources to listing new species, based on its regulation (50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02) that takes away much of the legal value of designating CH for the recovery of the species. Yet FWS consistently loses legal challenges for failure to designate CH, and several courts have found the regulation in question to be an erroneous interpretation of the law because it does not take into account the duty to avoid adverse modification of CH. Others have asserted the value of CH; for example, scientists with the Center for Biological Diversity published a study in April 2005 concluding that CH designation enhances species recovery. As for timing of the designation, the Keystone Center's ESA Working Group on Habitat released a report on April 28, 2006, on habitat protection and ESA. One conclusion of this study was that identifying the habitat that species require to recover is better done in the context of recovery planning, after more rigorous analysis and deliberation have been completed, rather than at the time of listing. Although recovery plans are not enforceable, preventing adverse modification of CH is enforceable.", "CH is frequently misunderstood by the public as posing a significant direct restriction on private landowners' authority to manage their land. While a landowner may experience some additional procedures and possible restrictions on land management because of the presence of an ESA-listed species (through ESA's prohibitions on taking a listed species), and the presence of CH may shed light on whether \"harm\" has occurred, the duty to avoid adverse modification of CH is an express obligation only for federal agencies and actions, and may affect private (nonfederal) actors only where and when actions involve a federal nexus (i.e., involve any federal funding, permit, or license).", "In the 111 th Congress, Section 208(a)(5) of S. 3597 would have identified CH designated under ESA authority as priority risk areas in which Coast Guard routing or other navigational measures are warranted to reduce the risk of oil spills and potential damage to natural resources ; this bill was reported (amended) by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on December 17, 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prohibitions and Penalties", "paragraphs": ["ESA contains prohibitions on the \"take\" of endangered animal species; take means to \"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532; harassment and harm are further defined by regulation at 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.3).

Proposed actions that may have adverse impacts on listed species may be permitted in two ways. First, under Section 7 of ESA, if federal agency actions (or actions of a nonfederal party that require an agency's approval, permit, or funding) may affect a listed species, the agency must ensure that those actions are \"not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of any endangered or threatened species, nor to destroy or adversely modify CH. This does not apply in those instances where a law requires a federal agency to take only certain specific actions in order to satisfy the law, according to a 2007 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.", "To review the possible effects of their actions on listed species and CH, federal agencies are to consult with the appropriate Secretary. If the Secretary finds that an action would jeopardize a listed species or destroy or adversely modify CH, the Secretary is to suggest any reasonable and prudent alternatives that would avoid these harms. Pending completion of the consultation process, agencies may not make irretrievable commitments of resources that would foreclose any alternatives. The Secretary issues a written statement, called a biological opinion (BiOp), that may allow the agency or the applicant to take individuals of a species incidental to otherwise lawful activities without triggering ESA's penalties, subject to terms and conditions specified in the BiOp (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536), or may conclude that jeopardy cannot be avoided, in which case the agency, a governor, or an affected permit or license applicant may seek an exemption for the action from the Endangered Species Committee.", "For actions without a federal nexus (i.e., no federal funding, permit, or license), the appropriate Secretary may issue permits under Section 10(a) of ESA to allow the incidental take of species during otherwise lawful actions. An applicant for a permit is to submit a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that shows the likely impact of the planned action; steps taken to minimize and mitigate the impact; funding for the mitigation; alternatives considered and rejected; and any other measures the Secretary may require.

These regulations took effect on January 15, 2009. Critics questioned this regulation, fearing that it provided federal agencies, some with little scientific expertise, with an unacceptable degree of discretion in deciding whether or not to comply with ESA. A lawsuit against these regulations was filed by various interest groups and the state of California.

The requirement that an exemption applicant must pay for mitigation may deter potential applicants. To date, this process has been little used and only one exemption (Grayrocks Dam, WY) has been granted and carried out. The ESC is required to accept the President's determination (under specified circumstances) on an exemption in declared disaster areas. The committee must also grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense determines that it is necessary for national security (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536). From time to time, the Department of Defense (DOD) has claimed that requirements under ESA conflict with its readiness activities, but DOD has not requested any exemptions to date.

Also, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive ESA (and other laws) \"to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads\" at the border.

Under this guidance, federal agencies would create conservation \"banks\" by paying private landowners to conserve species, allowing federal agencies to offset activities (e.g., military training exercises, oil and gas exploration and development, federal timber sales) on public land that could harm species.

The reasons cited by FWS are (1) recovery (20 species); (2) extinction (9 species; however, some may have been extinct when listed); and (3) original data in error (18 species). Recovered species include the American alligator, bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon (two subspecies), and three species of kangaroo. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill (a bird), and two small fish living in desert springs. However, it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or, in fact, are already extinct. For example, the ivory-billed woodpecker, thought by many to be extinct, may have been rediscovered in a remote area of Arkansas a few years ago. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find.", "Some have asserted that ESA is a failure since only 20 species have been delisted as recovered; however, only 9 species have been delisted because of extinction.

In addition, \"only those species whose situations are known to be the most desperate will receive priority,\" thereby making recovery difficult.", "Another measure of \"success\" might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species are not actually delisted; for example, 35 species have been reclassified (downlisted) from endangered to threatened. Under this standard, ESA could be considered a success, since a large number (41%, according to one study) of listed species have improved or stabilized their population levels after listing.

There may be little information on many species facing extinction, and only limited personnel or funds available to conduct studies on many of the less charismatic species, or those of little known economic import. What should be done in such instances? Some suggest that considerations other than species conservation should prevail; others seek to change the current posture of the law by changing the role of science. These considerations are complicated by the cost and time required to acquire more complete data, particularly in connection with many lesser-known species.", "ESA does not elaborate on this question, but some assert that, given the protective purpose of ESA\u2014to save and recover species\u2014and the wording of \"best scientific ... data available,\" species that may be dwindling are to be given the benefit of the doubt and a margin of safety. This is the position taken on pages 1-7 of the joint FWS/NMFS Endangered Species Consultation Handbook, which states that efforts should be made to develop information, but if a BiOp must be rendered promptly, it should be based on the available information, \"giving the benefit of the doubt to the species,\" with consultation possibly being reinitiated if additional information becomes available. This phrase is drawn from H.Rept. 96-697, p. 12 (1979), which states that the \"best information available\" language was intended to allow FWS or NMFS to issue BiOps even when information was incomplete, rather than being forced to issue negative BiOps for lack of data. The report also states that if a BiOp is rendered on the basis of inadequate information, the federal agency proposing an action has the duty to show that its actions will not jeopardize a species and a continuing obligation to make a reasonable effort to develop information, and that the statutory language \"continues to give the benefit of the doubt to the species.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information Quality", "paragraphs": ["Section 515 of P.L. 106-554 , known as the Information Quality Act or the Data Quality Act, directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue government-wide guidelines to federal agencies to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies. OMB published final guidelines on February 22, 2002. The Department of the Interior and FWS have both issued additional guidelines that are available through their websites, and have established a process for interested persons to seek correction of information.

Under this policy, FWS and NMFS are to receive and use information from a wide variety of sources, including individuals. Submitted information may range from the informal\u2014oral, traditional, or anecdotal\u2014to peer-reviewed scientific studies, and hence the reliability of the information can vary widely. Agency biologists are to review and evaluate all information impartially for purposes of listing, CH designation, consultation, recovery, and permitting actions, and to ensure that any information used by the agencies to implement ESA is \"reliable, credible, and represents the best scientific and commercial data available.\" Agency biologists are to document their evaluations of all information and, to the extent consistent with the use of the best scientific and commercial data available, use primary and original sources of information as the basis for recommendations. In addition, agency managers are to review the work of FWS and NMFS biologists to \"verify and assure the quality of the science used to establish official positions, decisions, and actions.\"", "Additionally, a companion document, the Interagency Cooperative Policy for Peer Review in Endangered Species Act Activities, notes that, in addition to the public comments received on proposed listing rules and draft recovery plans, the services are also to formally solicit expert opinions and peer review to ensure the best biological and commercial information.

In the context of issuing incidental take permits under Section 10(a), this ruling means the agency must demonstrate that a species is or could be in an area before regulating it, and must establish the causal connection between the land use being regulated and harm to the species in question.

This approach is still in the embryonic stage. The idea, as spearheaded by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), is to petition FWS and NMFS to list as endangered or threatened various animals whose habitat is or will be adversely affected by climate change. (CBD has already done so for several species, including the polar bear.) Once the species is listed, the argument would be made that sources of substantial greenhouse gas emissions, such as coal-fired power plants, cause an unlawful \"take\" of these species under ESA Section 9 by the effect such emissions have, via climate change, on the species' habitat. This could force negotiation of an incidental take permit for the source with greenhouse gas-limiting terms and conditions. Note that \"take\" is defined in the ESA to include \"harm\" to a member of a listed species, and \"harm,\" in turn, is defined by regulation to include certain \"significant habitat modification[s] or degradation[s].\" As a result, federal agencies proposing to issue permits for the construction or modification of greenhouse gas sources would be required, the argument runs, to initiate Section 7 consultation.", "Any effort to address climate change through the ESA will encounter several obstacles, chief among them whether the causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and habitat harm is too attenuated to fall within the ESA's prohibitions and requirements. The ESA also provides federal agencies with various tools to minimize ESA/climate change conflicts, such as Section 4(d) \"special rules\" for threatened species.", "In May 2008, FWS listed the polar bear as threatened, catapulting the above Section 7, Section 9, and 4(d)-rule mechanisms to the fore. In connection with the listing, FWS opposed using the ESA to address climate change. First, it issued a 4(d) rule for the polar bear specifically excluding from the Section 9 take prohibition \"any taking of polar bears that is incidental to, but not the purpose of ... an otherwise lawful activity.\" An effect of the exclusion appears to be that a coal-fired power plant could not be deemed to \"take\" polar bears through its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Second, FWS argued in the listing preamble that current scientific understanding has not established a causal connection between specific sources of GHG emissions and specific impacts to polar bears or their habitat, concluding that the Section 7 consultation mechanism would not be triggered by federal actions leading to greater GHG emissions (e.g., permitting of fossil-fuel-fired power plants).

The decline has been attributed to a combination of several factors, including entrainment (i.e., entrapment) in water export pumps, competition and predation from exotic fish species, toxic contaminants, changes in habitat size and quality, and changes in food supply. The contribution of each factor in causing the species decline is controversial.

When the government regulation removes only part, but not all, of the property's use or value, a three-factor balancing test is used to determine whether a taking has occurred.

In several of these cases, the taking claim failed because it was filed in the wrong court or was not \"ripe.\" Where taking claims were reached by the court, they were rejected principally because the economic impact was insufficient as to the property as a whole, or because of the long-standing principle that the government is not responsible for the actions of wild animals. Of the two decisions favoring the property owner, one, involving reduced water delivery to a water district owing to the need to maintain in-stream flows for listed fish, has been repudiated by the judge who wrote it. The other, however, instructs that when government requires water subject to appropriative water rights to be physically diverted to a fish ladder (here, for the use of a listed species), the diversion must be analyzed under a physical rather than regulatory taking theory.
