Federal grants are intended for projects benefiting states and communities. Individuals may be eligible for other kinds of benefits or assistance, or small businesses and students may be eligible for loans. Free information is readily available to grantseekers, who generally know best the details of their projects. The Assistance Listings database at beta.SAM.gov describes more than 2,200 federal programs, more than half of them grants, and can be searched by keyword, department or agency, program title, beneficiary, and applicant eligibility. Federal department and agency websites provide additional information and guidance, and they provide state agency contacts. Once a program has been identified, eligible grantseekers may apply electronically for grants at the website Grants.gov through a uniform process for all agencies. Through Grants.gov, grantseekers may identify when federal funding notices and deadlines for a program become available, sign up for email notification of funding opportunities, and track the progress of submitted applications.", "Because government funds may be limited, the report also discusses sources of private and corporate foundation funding.

Grants are intended for projects serving state, community, and local needs. Most federal funding goes to state and local governments, which in turn may make subawards to local entities such as eligible nonprofit organizations. Local governments seeking funds for community services, infrastructure, and economic revitalization may be eligible to tap into state or federal funds. Government funding may also be available for nonprofit organizations, including faith-based groups, for initiatives such as establishing soup kitchens or after-school tutoring programs benefitting entire communities.", "For others, such as for individuals seeking financial help, starting or expanding a small business, or needing funds for education, benefits or loans may be available.", "Individuals looking for government benefits (such as for child or health care, housing or energy costs, disability or veterans needs, or \"living assistance\") may find useful the website GovBenefits.gov at http://www.benefits.gov .

Because government funds may be limited, sources of private funding should also be considered. State and community foundations may be particularly interested in funding local projects; many projects may require a combination of government and private funding. Local business or private foundation funding might be appropriate for supporting local memorials or programs. Community fund-raising may be more suitable for school enrichment activities, such as band or sports uniforms or field trips.", "For eligible state and local governments and nonprofit organizations, identifying appropriate programs, and then contacting federal and state agencies early in the process, before submitting formal applications, is recommended.

Other times, it's a phone call supposedly from a \"government\" agency or some other organization with an official sounding name. In either case, the claim is the same: your application for a grant is guaranteed to be accepted, and you'll never have to pay the money back.", "But, warns the FTC, these \"money for nothing\" grant offers usually are misleading, whether you see them in your local paper, through the internet, or hear about them on television or receive a phone call.
