In order to achieve this goal, the NWPA established a statutory system for selecting a site for a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of nuclear waste. DOE was authorized by the statute to carry out the disposal program and develop the permanent nuclear waste repository. Commercial nuclear power owners and operators would fund a large portion of the program through significant annual contributions, or fees, to the newly established Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF).", "To carry out the statutory scheme created by the NWPA, DOE was also authorized to enter into contracts with private nuclear facilities to allow the federal government to take possession of nuclear waste and ensure its storage and disposal in the prospective permanent repository. Section 302 of the NWPA sets out the critical statutory deadline established in the NWPA and forms the main basis for litigation. This provision mandates: ", "(A) Following commencement of operation of a repository, the Secretary shall take title to the high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as expeditiously as practicable upon the request of the generator or owner of such waste or spent fuel; and", "(B) In return for payment of fees established by this section, the Secretary, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, will dispose of the high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as provided in this subtitle. ", "In an effort to streamline the collection and disposal process, DOE elected to create a single \"Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste\" (Standard Contract) for use with nuclear power providers. DOE chose to develop the Standard Contract through the formal notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The final contract, published in the Federal Register, somewhat modified the language of the NWPA and provides:", "The services to be provided by DOE under this contract shall begin, after commencement of facility operations, not later than January 31, 1998 and shall continue until such time as all SNF ... has been disposed of.", "Although the NWPA did not expressly mandate that all nuclear utility providers enter into an agreement with DOE for the disposal of nuclear waste, the utilities were required to enter into the Standard Contract as a condition of renewing or obtaining the required operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). All operating nuclear facilities, therefore, became parties to the Standard Contract. ", "By 1987, pursuant to its obligations under the NWPA, DOE had identified three potential sites for the permanent repository: Yucca Mountain, Nevada; Hanford, Washington; and Deaf Smith County, Texas. In 1987, Congress amended the NWPA to name Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for the permanent repository. The amendments, strongly lobbied for by the congressional delegations from Washington and Texas, did not, however, end the DOE selection and approval process which continued as outlined under the NWPA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Breach of the Standard Contract", "paragraphs": ["By 1993, DOE had made little progress in preparing to take possession of SNF, and the Yucca Mountain facility was at least a decade or more away from completion. Concerned as to whether DOE would be able to meet its contractual obligations by the end of January 1998, the nuclear utilities, which had been paying into the NWF for 11 years, requested in writing that DOE address its responsibilities under the NWPA and update the signatories of the Standard Contract on DOE's overall preparedness. DOE initially responded to this request with an informal letter, stating that DOE's interpretation of the Standard Contract was that the department's contractual obligations were not triggered until the nation's permanent repository was complete. ", "In response to this interpretive dispute, DOE sought comments from the public on the department's statutory obligations under the NWPA and the Standard Contract. After further review, DOE issued a \"Final Interpretation of Nuclear Waste Acceptance Issues\" which formally pronounced the department's position that it had no \"legal obligation under either the [NWPA] or the Standard Contract to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998, in the absence of a repository or interim storage facility.\" Pursuant to this interpretation, the department added that it would not begin accepting nuclear waste from nuclear utilities by the date specified in the act, nor did it have authority under the NWPA to provide interim storage for spent nuclear fuel. In the alternative, the DOE notice stated that were Section 302 to create an unconditional obligation on the part of DOE to begin disposing of nuclear waste by January 31, 1998, redress should be governed by the \"unavoidable delay\" provisions of the Standard Contract which expressly states that \"no party shall be liable for damages in the case of unavoidable delay.\"", "Nuclear utility companies, having paid billions into the NWF since 1982 in addition to the millions spent for on-site temporary storage, turned to the federal courts to review DOE's interpretation of its own obligations under the NWPA and the Standard Contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Waste Disposal Contract Litigation", "paragraphs": ["Issues relating to the NWPA have been consistently litigated for the last 15 years, and will continue to be litigated into the immediate future. Many difficult legal questions have arisen during this time period due to the somewhat peculiar relationship between the NWPA and the Standard Contract and the courts' attempts to distinguish between statutory and contractual duties. Although DOE argued early on that the department had no obligations absent a completed permanent repository, the courts have ruled that DOE had a statutory obligation to begin collecting SNF by no later than January 31, 1998. As that statutory obligation was also converted into a contractual obligation through the Standard Contract, the courts have also determined that DOE's delay in collecting the nuclear utilities' SNF has placed the federal government in partial breach of contract. Additionally, overturning a divergent decision by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has affirmed a D.C.

Although DOE had not yet breached the contract, as performance was not required before January 31, 1998, Indiana Michigan Power Company sought a preemptive judicial review of the department's determination that it had no obligation to begin accepting SNF until the completion of the Yucca Mountain facility.", "In Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. Department of Energy , the D.C. Circuit, applying the Chevron analysis for reviewing an agency's statutory interpretation, invalidated DOE's interpretation as contrary to the plain meaning of the NWPA. The court reasoned that Section 302(A) and Section 302(B) represented independent statutory obligations. While the obligation to \"take title to\" nuclear waste in section 302(A) may have been conditioned on the construction of a repository, the obligation to \"dispose\" of nuclear waste under Section 302(B) contained no such limitation. Indeed, DOE's duty to commence disposal of nuclear waste, held the court, was to begin \"not later than January 31, 1998 without qualification or condition.\" The argument put forth by DOE, and rejected by the court, was that Section 302(A) and Section 302(B) \"must be read together,\" since taking title to SNF cannot be separated from disposing of SNF. In construing DOE's \"disposal\" obligation broadly, the court noted that \"it is not unusual, particularly in the nuclear area, to recognize a division between ownership of materials and other obligations relating to such materials.\" The court concluded that the NWPA and Standard Contract had created a \"reciprocal\" and binding contractual relationship between DOE and the nuclear utilities, whereby DOE would dispose of the utilities' nuclear waste in return for the payment of fees into the NWF.", "DOE did not immediately take action in response to the D.C. Circuit's holding in Indiana Michigan . Instead, the department informed the nuclear utilities involved that it would be unable to comply with the January 31, 1998, deadline and was not prepared to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal.

Circuit to issue a writ of mandamus, compelling DOE to adhere to the court's earlier decision in Indiana Michigan and begin accepting nuclear waste for disposal. In Northern States Power Co. v. U.S. , the court refused to grant the \"drastic\" and broad relief the utilities asked for, holding that the terms of the Standard Contract provided for another \"potentially adequate remedy.\" Before the court would consider compelling DOE to act, the utilities would first have to pursue the administrative remedies available under the Standard Contract for delayed performance.", "However, the court was unwilling to accept DOE's interpretation of its own delays as \"unavoidable\" under the Standard Contract. The court reiterated, in rejecting DOE's argument that a lack of an operational repository qualified as an unavoidable delay, that DOE's obligation to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998, existed regardless of the existence of an operational storage facility. DOE's \"unavoidable delay\" defense, noted the court, represented a simple \"recycling [of] the arguments [previously] rejected by this court.\" Based on DOE's \"repeated attempts to excuse its delay on the grounds that it lacks an operational repository,\" the D.C. Circuit, in a significant exercise of authority, issued a writ of mandamus prohibiting DOE from concluding that the lack of an operational permanent repository constituted an \"unavoidable delay\" under the Standard Contract. The court ordered DOE to \"proceed with contractual remedies in a manner consistent with NWPA's command that it undertake an unconditional obligation to begin disposal of the SNF by January 31, 1998.\"", "In a preview of the jurisdictional dispute that would develop a decade later, DOE filed a petition for rehearing in response to the Northern States mandamus. DOE challenged the D.C. Circuit's exercise of authority by asserting that the court \"lacked jurisdiction to construe the unavoidable delays clause of the Standard Contract,\" as such an interpretation of a government contract was squarely within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. The D.C. Circuit denied the motion for rehearing, holding that the court had not adjudicated a contractual dispute, but rather issued the mandamus in an effort to enforce a statutory duty.

", "In considering the cases, the CFC initially had to answer the threshold question of whether the nuclear utilities were required to exhaust available administrative remedies under the Standard Contract prior to seeking judicial relief. Generally, if administrative remedies can provide adequate relief for a claim, the plaintiff must first exhaust those remedies before seeking redress in another court.

The \"avoidable delay\" provision of the Standard Contract requires that", "In the event of any delay in the delivery, acceptance, or transport ... caused by circumstances within the reasonable control of either [party] ... the charges and schedules specified by this contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any estimated additional costs incurred by the party not responsible for or contributing to the delay.", "The court disagreed, holding that the \"avoidable delay\" provision applied only to routine delays occurring after the parties had begun performance of their obligations under the contract, not to breaches of a \"critical and central obligation of the contract,\" such as a failure to begin performance by the statutory deadline. The court added that relief in the form of a \"charge or schedule adjustment,\" as provided under the Standard Contract, was wholly inadequate to compensate the nuclear utilities for damages they had sustained in storing spent nuclear fuel that had been covered by the contract.

Under the proposed modification, DOE was willing to return a portion of payments made by a utility into the NWF, and suspend any future payments if the utility was willing to relinquish all future claims against DOE. The department entered into one such agreement with Exelon Generation Company in 2002. Other utilities that had also contributed to the NWF, however, challenged this arrangement as an invalid use of NWF funds.", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Alabama Power Co. v. U.S. , invalidated the contractual modification reached between DOE and Exelon Generation Company. The agreed upon \"offset,\" the court held, was \"tantamount to an expenditure of funds\" from the NWF. Under the NWPA, NWF funds were to be used only for the \"permanent disposal\" of nuclear waste. DOE could not, therefore, allocate NWF funds to individual nuclear utilities to pay for what the court classified as on-site \"interim storage.\" Were DOE allowed to use NWF funds to offset the costs of the department's failure to dispose of SNF, it would be analogous to allowing DOE to \"pay for its own breach out of a fund paid for by the utilities.\" Any arrangement in which the utilities were made to \"bear the costs of the [department's] breach\" was invalid. Pursuant to the court's stringent interpretation of the statutory purposes of the NWF, DOE is likely prohibited from using NWF funds for any use other than the development and construction of a permanent repository. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculating Damages", "paragraphs": ["Although DOE had acknowledged by 2005 its partial breach of the Standard Contract in most cases, significant litigation has been required to determine the level of damages individual nuclear utilities may legally recover as a result of DOE's breach. Generally speaking, when one party to a contract materially breaches the contract, the non-breaching party has the option to sue for damages under either a \"full breach\" or \"partial breach\" theory. A successful claim for full breach discharges the contractual obligations of both parties and allows the non-breaching party to sue for all past, present, and future damages. A claim for partial breach, on the other hand, preserves the ongoing contractual relationship between the parties\u2014meaning both parties are still obligated to perform under the terms of the contract. Additionally, a party suing for partial breach may only recover the costs of mitigating the other party's breach that were incurred between the time the party became aware of a potential breach and the date of trial. A party suing for partial breach may not, therefore, recover future damages. Fundamentally, in electing to pursue a claim under a partial or full breach theory, the non-breaching party is choosing between continuing the contract, in the hope that the breaching party will eventually perform, or ending the contract in its entirety. ", "The nuclear utilities have pursued their breach of contract claims under a partial breach theory. Although a party may typically elect whether to sue for partial or full breach in response to a material breach, the CFC and the Federal Circuit have repeatedly and consistently expressed doubt as to whether a full breach claim seeking to discharge the existing contractual obligations would even be available to the nuclear utilities, noting that the utilities have been \"compelled\" to sue for partial breach by the statutory obligations underlying the Standard Contract. In Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. U.S. , the court stated in dicta that were a nuclear utility to bring an action for total breach \"DOE would [be] discharged from further responsibility under the [Standard] contract, a situation apparently not desired by [the utilities] and foreclosed by statute .\" The courts have noted three incongruous consequences that could result from a court's decision to discharge the parties' obligation to perform under the Standard Contract. First, Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating permits for all nuclear utilities are currently contingent on entering into the Standard Contract with DOE. As a result, if the contract is discharged, the utility may lose its operating license. Second, the NWPA makes DOE the exclusive collector of SNF, meaning the utilities may not seek alternative means of disposing of their SNF. Third, the NWPA places a statutory duty on the utilities that generate SNF to pay for the waste's disposal. Discharging the utilities contractual obligation to make payments into the NWF would run counter to this statutory duty. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit has repeatedly affirmed the notion that nuclear utilities are foreclosed from suing for a full breach.", "Even if permitted, it is not clear that the nuclear utilities would wish to pursue a claim for full breach. In 2006, in response to an order by the court to show why the CFC should not simply void the Standard Contract, more than 30 nuclear utilities, through amicus briefs, voiced opposition to the court's proposal. Absent a contract, the utilities would be exposed to \"substantial regulatory risks,\" and likely bear the burden and responsibility of permanently disposing of their own SNF. Although available damages could potentially be higher than what the utilities have been recovering through their numerous claims for partial breach, under a claim for full breach, the utilities would lose the benefit, no matter how remote, of the government collecting and disposing of their SNF.", "For these reasons, the nuclear utilities have sought to pursue, and courts have been hesitant to depart from, a partial breach scenario. As a result, the nuclear utilities continue to have the obligation to pay into the NWF and DOE continues to have the obligation to collect and dispose of SNF. As the Federal Circuit has stated, the utilities have had \"no choice but to hold the government to the terms of the Standard Contract while suing for partial breach.\"", "In August of 2008, the Federal Circuit further clarified the method for calculating damages in NWPA breach of contract suits by establishing a rate at which DOE was expected to accept SNF under the Standard Contract. The anticipated rate of acceptance was essential to calculating the total amount of SNF DOE was contractually obligated to accept from the nuclear utilities from the 1998 deadline forward. DOE argued for a lower rate established under a report issued in 1991, as opposed to the initial rate of acceptance established in a 1987 DOE scheduling report. The Federal Circuit, however, rejected this argument, holding instead that damages would be calculated in relation to the higher 1987 acceptance rate, as that rate most closely reflected the intent and expectations of the parties at the time of the contract. The 1991 rate, held the court, was most likely the result of a \"litigation strategy,\" put forth to \"minimize DOE's exposure for its impending breach, rather than as a realistic, good faith projection for waste acceptance.\"", "Nuclear utilities have thus been successful in recovering all reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred in mitigation of DOE's breach. Generally, these damages consist of costs associated with developing, implementing, and maintaining on-site interim SNF storage. Damages are limited, however, to the costs incurred from the date at which the utility became aware of DOE's potential breach, a realization often occurring well before the January 31, 1998, deadline, to the date of trial. As damages are limited to those expenses actually incurred at the time of trial, utilities may not recover additional future, or prospective, damages. Nuclear utilities are free, however, to re-file future claims as new damages are incurred."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Jurisdictional Dispute Develops in Nebraska Public Power District v.

The mere grant of jurisdiction to a court, such as the grant found in Section 119, is not sufficient to constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. The required express waiver is generally characterized by a \"specification of the remedy or relief that may be awarded against the U.S.\" The court could find no express waiver anywhere in the NWPA.", "With no express waiver in the NWPA, the D.C. Circuit had proceeded in Indiana Michigan as if the waiver derived from Section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Section 702 acts as a general waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against the U.S. that are based on agency action. The CFC determined that any reliance on Section 702 was misplaced, as the APA general waiver applies only where there is \"no other adequate remedy in a court.\" Although the D.C. Circuit had taken the position that the CFC was unable to accord adequate relief to a plaintiff seeking equitable relief, the Federal Circuit concluded that the Section 702 waiver was inapplicable under these circumstances because the nuclear utilities had an adequate remedy in the CFC under the Tucker Act. The Federal Circuit, citing the U.S. Supreme Court, rejected the notion that the limitation on the available remedies made relief in the CFC \"inadequate.\" Any other conclusion, reasoned the court, would allow plaintiffs to circumvent the jurisdiction of the CFC simply by attaching a prayer for equitable relief to what was essentially a damages suit. With an alternate and adequate remedy available in the CFC, the necessary trigger for Section 702 had not been met. The court held, therefore, that absent a waiver of sovereign immunity under either Section 119 of the NWPA or Section 702 of the APA, the D.C. Circuit had improperly granted relief against the United States in Indiana Michigan .", "The court concluded that since the D.C. Circuit in Indiana Michigan had exceeded its jurisdiction without the support of a valid waiver of sovereign immunity, its decision was therefore void. The mandamus issued in Northern States , which was predicated on the decision in Indiana Michigan , was, therefore, also void and could not preclude DOE from raising the unavoidable delay defense. The court closed by ordering the parties to brief the issue of whether DOE's failure to commence disposal of SNF by the established deadline was excused by the \"unavoidable delay\" clause of the Standard Contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Circuit", "paragraphs": ["Nebraska Power appealed the CFC's decision to the Federal Circuit and the case was argued in December 2007.

The court looked to the legislative history of the NWPA to support its conclusion, noting that it was clear that the statutory deadline's \"physical separation from the judicial review provision in section 119 [was] pure happenstance and in no way indicate[d] a congressional intent that review under the different subchapters be governed by different standards.\" Accordingly, claims relating to DOE's failure to begin the acceptance of SNF by the statutory deadline of January 31, 1998, were included within the D.C.

The APA waived sovereign immunity and granted judicial review only to \"agency action made reviewable by statute\" and \"final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\" The court referred to the first category of action as \"special statutory review,\" or agency action made reviewable by a \"specific review-authorizing statute.\" The court referred to the second category of action as \"nonstatutory review.\" There the APA acts as a waiver of sovereign immunity for a limited class of cases where no review of agency action has been granted by statute, but where absent review, the plaintiff can find \"no other adequate remedy at law.\" The court, distinguishing between the two categories, reasoned that the limitation that there be \"no other adequate remedy\" applied only to nonstatutory review of agency action.

By prohibiting DOE's use of the \"unavoidable delay\" defense, the D.C. Circuit was utilizing the mandamus as a means to enforce DOE's statutory obligations as established in Indiana Michigan . The Federal Circuit concurred with the D.C.

U.S . In doing so, however, the court has triggered confusion and contradictory opinions in the CFC. The Federal Circuit held in Southern Nuclear that while the government continues to be prohibited from concluding that the lack of a repository represents an affirmative defense to liability under the Standard Contract, the mandamus does not preclude the government from raising the unavoidable delay clause before the CFC in the damages context. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the Nebraska Public Power case \"did not suggest that the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in any way foreclosed arguing in favor of the [unavoidable delay] defense in the Claims Court. Indeed, we considered the government's argument and held that \u2026 [the mandamus] was entitled to res judicata effect on the issue of liability but that it did not 'direct the implementation of any remedy.'\" ", "The Southern Nuclear decision appears to hold that the Northern States mandamus acts only to prevent the government from interpreting the Standard Contract and the unavoidable delay clause in a manner contrary to the agency's clear and unconditional statutory duty to collect nuclear waste as established by the D.C. Circuit. The mandamus does not, however, necessarily prevent the government from raising the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to the imposition of damages or a demand for a specific remedy. This line of reasoning\u2014which attempts to draw a distinction between liability and damages\u2014was drawn from the concurrence in the Federal Circuit's Nebraska Public Power opinion in which the concurring judge stated: \"Although I read the majority as establishing government liability, it remains open for the government to argue that the Unavoidable Delays clause bars a damage award (as opposed to some other contractual remedy such as restitution).\" While holding that the government could argue unavoidable delay in defense to damages, Southern Nuclear did not establish whether such a defense had merit. The effect of the ruling has been to reopen the debate over unavoidable delays. ", "Application of the Federal Circuit's Southern Nuclear opinion has not been uniform in the CFC. Indeed, various judges have reached contradictory opinions on the government's use of the unavoidable delay clause in defense to damages, and one judge rejected the Southern Nuclear opinion as inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's decision in Nebraska Public Power . In Rochester Gas and Elec. Corp. v. U.S. , for example, the CFC adopted the Southern Nuclear reasoning and held that although the government is \"precluded from asserting the unavoidable delays clause as a defense to liability for breach of the standard contract,\" the government \"may, however, assert the unavoidable delays clause in opposition to a demand for damages.\" Although permitting the argument to be raised, the court did not reach the merits of the defense. In the subsequent case of Portland General Elec. Co. v. U.S ., the CFC appeared to impliedly accept the proposition set forth in Southern Nuclear that the government was not prohibited from raising the unavoidable delay argument in defense to damages, but the opinion ultimately determined that such an argument was without merit as the clause had no \"independent application\" to the \"determination of damages.\"", "To the contrary, in Entergy Nuclear Fitzpatrick v. U.S. , Judge Edward Damich rejected the Southern Nuclear decision\u2014determining that the Federal Circuit's decisions in Southern Nuclear and Nebraska Public Power were contradictory. Whereas Nebraska Public Power had foreclosed the use of the unavoidable delay clause \"not merely as a defense to liability but as a defense to damages for failing to meet its unconditional obligation,\" Southern Nuclear had \"implicitly held that the government could have raised the unavoidable delays defense.\" Accordingly, the two decisions could be reconciled only if Southern Nuclear was read \"extremely narrowly.\" The court then concluded that Southern Nuclear could not be read in such a manner, and thus found the \"two decisions to be at odds.\" Although noting its \"unenviable position,\" the court determined Nebraska Public Power to be the \"controlling precedent of the Federal Circuit\" and held that the Northern States mandamus barred the use of the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to damages. Recognizing the significance of the CFC's inability to reconcile Nebraska Public Power and Southern Nuclear , Judge Damich certified the question for direct appeal to the Federal Circuit.", "Were the Federal Circuit to affirm the Southern Nuclear court's interpretation of the scope of the Northern States mandamus, it appears the government would be permitted to raise the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to certain damages. However, whether such a defense would be successful in actually deflecting damages remains unclear. The only court to actually consider the merits of the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to damages, rather than merely whether such a defense was barred by the Northern States mandamus and Nebraska Public Power , found the argument to be unsatisfactory.

Approximately $500 million in additional legal damages will continue to build with each year beyond 2020 that DOE is unable to begin accepting SNF. It is important to note that all paid legal damages are drawn from the DOJ Judgment Fund rather than the DOE budget. In addition, the Department of Justice, which has litigated the contract cases on behalf of DOE, has spent over $192 million on litigation-related expenses. The nuclear utilities reportedly incur $5 million to $7 million in litigation costs in each individual case. ", "In an attempt to curtail damages, DOE and DOJ have sought to reach settlement agreements with a number of individual nuclear utilities. As of December 2011, agreements have been entered into with nuclear utilities that operate 65 of the 118 nuclear facilities covered by the Standard Contract. Under the settlements, contract parties submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for any delay-related nuclear waste storage costs that they incurred during that year. As the settlement agreements cover continuing damages, the affected nuclear utilities are able to submit annual claims directly to DOE rather than re-litigating ongoing damages in the federal courts. As of July 27, 2010, DOE had paid approximately $725 million pursuant to these settlements. ", "The Department of Justice has also entered into broader discussions with the nuclear industry \"to explore the possibility of reaching a standard settlement with a larger segment of the utilities whose claims are currently pending.\" As most of the contentious legal questions involved with the Standard Contract have been resolved over the last decade, \"the ultimate success of many types of claims is now more predictable to both the government and the utilities.\" Rather than continue to re-litigate substantially similar claims, DOJ has suggested that establishing an administrative claims process would likely lead to a less expensive and more efficient resolution of the ongoing nuclear waste litigation. An administrative claims process would presumably decrease litigation related expenses for both DOJ and the nuclear utilities by allowing qualified plaintiffs to submit claims to an administrative tribunal for approval, rather than force the parties to litigate damages in federal court. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended that the government continue to conclude these lawsuits both fairly and quickly \"through settlement agreements or through another process, such as mediation or arbitration.\" ", "Although problems related to the storage of SNF remain unresolved, the Obama Administration has pronounced a commitment to invest in domestic nuclear power.

The proposed reactors would be the first to begin construction in the United States in more than 30 years. Reaffirming his commitment to nuclear power in his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama called for nuclear power to be included in a national goal of generating 80% of U.S. electricity from \"clean energy sources\" by 2035. In preparation for any new reactors, DOE has developed a new contract to govern waste disposal. Under the new provisions, DOE \"would not be required to complete disposal of [SNF] until 20 years after the expiration of the [new reactor's] operating license and any extension thereto.\" DOE predicts that any a contractual obligation to collect SNF under the new contracts would not \"come into effect until the end of this century.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense Waste", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the projected $20.8 billion in damages as a result of delays in collecting and disposing of commercial nuclear waste, the federal government also faces the prospect of additional liabilities stemming from delays in collecting and disposing of defense-related nuclear waste.

The majority of the nation's defense waste, including high level liquid waste produced by the original Manhattan Project, is currently stored at federal facilities located in the states of Washington, South Carolina, and Idaho. These states have entered into regulatory agreements with DOE detailing requirements for the eventual removal of this defense waste.
