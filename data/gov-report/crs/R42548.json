On July 1, 2012, Mexico held federal (presidential and legislative) elections. Turnout reached record levels as 63% of eligible voters cast their ballots. Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) conducted the elections with the oversight of the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPFJ). Some election observers asserted that vote-buying and other irregularities marred the electoral process, while observers from the Organization of American States generally praised IFE's handling of the elections. After considering legal challenges to the results, the TEPFJ found insufficient evidence of vote-buying to warrant an annulment of the vote. The Tribunal declared Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a former governor of the state of Mexico, president-elect on August 31, 2012. Pe\u00f1a Nieto will take office on December 1, 2012.", "The centrist PRI that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 not only retook the presidency after 12 years of rule by the conservative National Action Party (PAN), but also won a plurality in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.

The narrow margin of Pe\u00f1a Nieto's victory, coupled with the fact that L\u00f3pez Obrador has refused to recognize the election results, could complicate the transition period. And, while PAN President Felipe Calder\u00f3n has pledged to work with the incoming administration, his party has joined the PRD in calling on authorities to investigate whether the PRI used any illicit finances to fund Pe\u00f1a Nieto's campaign.", "Polls predicted that the PRI might also capture a simple majority in one or both chambers of the Mexican Congress, a feat not accomplished since 1994. The PRI and the allied Green Ecological Party (PVEM) party failed to capture a majority in either house, but could achieve a simple majority in the Chamber by aligning with the PANAL. For legislation to pass the Senate, and for any measures to amend the constitution (which require a two-thirds majority), the PRI will have to form cross-party coalitions. The PRI will most likely find support from the PAN, which lost seats in the Chamber but retained a powerful bargaining position. The PRD-led coalition, which will now have more seats in the Chamber than the PAN and remains the third-largest force in the Senate, could complicate some reform efforts, including those aimed at increasing private participation in the energy sector, a key priority for Pe\u00f1a Nieto.", "Some Members of Congress may be concerned that the leadership changes resulting from the July 1, 2012, Mexican elections will significantly impact U.S.-Mexican relations, particularly now that the party controlling the presidency has changed. However, few analysts are predicting that the transition from PAN to PRI rule will result in seismic shifts in bilateral relations. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has sought to reassure U.S. policy makers that his Administration will continue to combat organized crime, while also striving to reduce violence in Mexico.

Analysts maintain that Mexico has experienced modest economic growth punctuated by a severe economic crisis (in 2009) and a growing security crisis under two successive PAN administrations. Often, these crises have overshadowed the policy achievements of those governments. As a result, economic and security issues figured as top concerns among the Mexican electorate. The major presidential candidates all stressed the importance of boosting job creation and improving public security in Mexico, with many arguing that an effective way to reduce the influence of criminal groups is by creating jobs. However, voters appeared to believe that the PRI may be best equipped to restore order and restart economic growth, despite uncertainty about how the party's return to power might impact Mexican democracy given its reputation for corruption and undemocratic practices. ", "Since even before the campaign officially began on March 30, 2012, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of the PRI/PVEM had maintained a double-digit lead in most polls over Josefina V\u00e1zquez Mota of the PAN, L\u00f3pez Obrador of the coalition led by the PRD, and Gabriel Quadri of the National Alliance Party (PANAL). Polling for the legislative elections followed the same trajectory as the presidential race, with a plurality of voters favoring PRI candidates followed by the PRD-led coalition, the PAN, and then the PANAL. While the polls correctly captured L\u00f3pez Obrador overtaking V\u00e1zquez Mota as the second-most popular candidate by late May 2012, they generally underestimated the level of popular support for his candidacy. L\u00f3pez Obrador benefitted from the YoSoy132 (I am 132) student protest movement that began in Mexico City in mid-May and organized itself through social media. Although the movement largely intended to have some of the youth voters' concerns\u2014such as perceived media bias\u2014heard by all of the candidates, many of its supporters also expressed antipathy for the PRI.

Another small party formed in 2005 and loosely aligned with Mexico's powerful teacher's union, the PANAL, decided to field its own presidential candidate after the PRI broke its alliance with the party earlier this year. Three states\u2014Sinaloa, Puebla, and Oaxaca\u2014are currently governed by coalitions composed of the PAN, PRD, and other small left-leaning parties. These \"stop the PRI\" coalitions were successful in the 2010 state-level contests. However, they did not field candidates in the 2011 gubernatorial elections or in the 2012 elections.", "The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI ) unified the country after the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) by organizing the major groups in Mexican society (organized labor, peasants, professionals) into a corporatist party that governed Mexico from 1929 until 2000. The PRI became a centrist party that relied on a hierarchical party structure, strong patronage system, and periodic electoral fraud to maintain its dominance. Through the 1960s, the PRI presided over a period of strong, state-led economic growth. The PRI's popularity declined, however, after its violent repression of student protesters led to the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, and its financial mismanagement in the 1970s contributed to an economic crisis in the early 1980s. Dissident PRI members split with the party in the mid-1980s, eventually creating a progressive party known as Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) after the PRI embraced neo-liberal (market-friendly) economic policies and proved unwilling to adopt more democratic internal procedures for choosing candidates. PRI presidential candidates were often hand-selected by incumbents through a process known as the \"tap of the finger\" ( el dedazo ) rather than through party primaries or nominating conventions. The PRI was accused of electoral fraud in the 1988 presidential election and has been criticized for corruption and for previously allowing organized crime to operate relatively freely within certain parameters set by the state. The PRI recently expelled Tomas Yarrington, a former governor of Tamaulipas, from the party after U.S. prosecutors alleged in a civil suit that he bought property in Texas to launder funds for Mexican drug traffickers. ", "PRI power has waxed and waned over the course of the past 15 years. The PRI lost control of the Chamber of Deputies in 1997 and handed over the Mexican presidency to the PAN in 2000. Even as its power diminished in 2000, the PRI remained the largest party in the Mexican Congress and retained control over several key governorships. Prior to the 2012 elections, the PRI controlled 19 of 32 governorships, 25% of the seats in the Senate, and 48% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies. With the allied PVEM, a small party focused exclusively on environmental protection, the PRI held a majority in the Chamber. The PRI is particularly dominant in the north/northeast and in the Yucat\u00e1n. It competes with the PRD in southern Mexico.", "The National Action Party (PAN) is a socially conservative, pro-business party that was formed in 1939 by Catholic activists, professionals, and entrepreneurs who disagreed with the PRI's intervention in the economy and its hierarchical and secularist tendencies. From the 1940s through the mid-1980s, the PAN served as the official opposition to the PRI, but failed to capture any governorships or large numbers of congressional seats. By the late 1980s, however, the PAN had begun to build on the support it had developed in local and state elections to capture governorships in business-friendly northern states and in conservative central western states. Vicente Fox's come-from-behind presidential victory in 2000 marked the party's crowning achievement, but some have become disillusioned that corruption, impunity, and poverty are still pervasive in Mexico after 12 years of PAN rule. Escalating organized crime-related violence, some of which has occurred in response to the Calder\u00f3n Administration's tough anticrime policies, has also weakened support for the PAN. Before the 2012 elections, the PAN governed six states alone and three in coalition with the PRD, and held 39% of the seats in the Senate and 28% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies. ", "The Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) is a center-left party founded by dissident PRI members in the late 1980s that has formed a \"Progressive Movement\" coalition with the Workers' Party (PT) and Citizens' Movement (PMC), two smaller left-wing parties. The PRD grew out of a coalition of leftist groups that supported the 1988 presidential bid of Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, son of famed President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Its early transition from movement to political party was hindered by the PRI's opposition to its existence and its own internal divisions. The PRD has traditionally been skeptical of neo-liberal economic policies, opposed opening state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) to private investment, and called for greater attention to poverty and inequality. The PRD has built its strongest support bases in and around Mexico City, which it has governed since mayors were first elected in the city in 1997, and in the poor states of southern Mexico. The PRD came close to capturing the presidency in 2006 with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a popular former mayor of Mexico City, as its standard bearer. The party lost popular support and became plagued by internal divisions, however, after L\u00f3pez Obrador refused to accept his defeat.

This year, rather than emphasizing the needs of one group over another, L\u00f3pez Obrador pledged to help rebuild Mexico into a \"republic of love\" that is built upon the values of honesty and justice and oriented toward creating jobs and well-being for all. He sought to expand his support base beyond the PRD and supporters of his Movement for National Regeneration (Morena) social movement. Some of his proposals included combating corruption and wasteful government spending; creating jobs and educational opportunities so that youth would not become involved in crime out of economic necessity; and involving the government, private sector, and social groups in development efforts. While L\u00f3pez Obrador still disputes the 2006 election results, he has apologized for launching disruptive protests against them and, prior to the election, pledged to accept the 2012 election results even if he did not win. Some analysts, though acknowledging his evolution as a candidate, maintained that L\u00f3pez Obrador's continued emphasis on state-led economic growth and revolutionary ideals might not appeal to Mexican voters, an increasingly middle-class and urbane electorate.

Even if he does not, Morena will join YoSoy132 and a number of other social movements that are likely to heavily scrutinize the actions of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his administration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Election Results", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the presidential contest, all 128 seats in the Mexican Senate and 500 seats in the lower house of congress, known as the Chamber of Deputies, were up for election this year. Senators will serve six-year terms and deputies will serve three-year terms that began on September 1, 2012. There is no consecutive reelection for seats in either chamber. In Mexico, passing regular legislation requires a simple majority and passing constitutional reforms requires a two-thirds majority. Polls had been predicting that PRI might capture a simple majority in one or both chambers. Somewhat surprisingly, the PRI and the allied PVEM party fell short of capturing a simple majority in either house (see Figure 2 and Figure 3 below on how the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are comprised in 2012 as compared to in 2009). ", "The PRI/PVEM's failure to capture a congressional majority means that President-elect Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the PRI will have to form cross-party coalitions in order to pass key reforms, particularly those requiring constitutional amendments. The PRI will most likely find support from the PANAL. If the PRI-PVEM coalition aligns with the PANAL (as it has in the past), together they would have 251 of 500 seats in the Chamber (a simple majority) and 62 of 128 seats in the Senate (2 seats short of a simple majority). The PAN, which lost seats in the Chamber but retained a powerful bargaining position, is another possible ally. PAN leaders, including President Calder\u00f3n, have pledged to support aspects of Pe\u00f1a Nieto's reform agenda that they believe are in the best interest of the country, even proposals that have been previously blocked by the PRI. President Calder\u00f3n has just re-submitted a proposal to the new Congress to reform Mexico's labor laws, a proposal which Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also supported, but which may encounter opposition from PRI legislators with close ties to labor unions. The PRD-led coalition, which will now have more seats in the Chamber than the PAN and remains the third-largest force in the Senate, could complicate labor reform efforts and initiatives aimed at increasing private participation in the energy sector, a key priority for Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Perhaps acknowledging the need to assuage the concerns of other parties, President-elect Pe\u00f1a Nieto has promised to push for laws to combat corruption and increase transparency at all levels and in all branches of government.

Prior to the 2012 elections, the PRI controlled 19 of 32 governorships in Mexico. The PRI retained control over Yucat\u00e1n and picked up two additional governorships in the recent elections: Jalisco, formerly governed by the PAN, and Chiapas, formerly governed by the PRD. In addition to winning the mayoral office of the Federal District for another term, the PRD also won two additional gubernatorial seats. PRD candidates in Morelos and Tabasco defeated the PAN and PRI, respectively. Although the PAN successfully maintained control of Guanajuato, defeats in Morelos and Jalisco represented significant losses for the party."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implications for U.S.-Mexican Relations", "paragraphs": ["Some Members of Congress may be concerned that the leadership changes resulting from the July 1, 2012, Mexican elections will significantly impact U.S.-Mexican relations, particularly now that the party controlling the presidency has changed. However, few analysts are predicting that the transition from PAN to PRI rule will result in any seismic shifts in bilateral relations. Throughout the campaign, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto sought to reassure U.S. policy makers that a PRI administration would continue to combat organized crime, combat corruption, and govern democratically. Pe\u00f1a Nieto also expressed support for increased bilateral and trilateral (with Canada) economic cooperation. Since the elections, President-elect Pe\u00f1a Nieto has said that he is committed to \"having an intense, close relationship of effective [security] collaboration measured by results\" with the United States. President Obama has congratulated Pe\u00f1a Nieto on his victory and Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson has said that U.S. officials \"look forward to working with him\" after he takes office. ", "During the campaign, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto pledged to continue the fight against organized crime and said that maintaining some form of military involvement in antidrug operations will be necessary. He also vowed, however, to focus more on reducing violent crime in Mexico than on seizing drugs or arresting kingpins. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he would increase the size of Mexico's Federal Police, create a national gendarmerie comprised of some military forces currently engaged in fighting organized crime that will be under civilian control, and establish 32 unified state police forces. He also announced that General Oscar Naranjo, former head of the Colombian National Police, would serve as one of his security advisors. Naranjo has reportedly recommended adopting a two-pronged strategy of using elite units of military and police forces to go after top DTO leaders (as Calder\u00f3n has done), while focusing the rest of law enforcement efforts on reducing violence and street crime in six of the country's most violent cities. ", "President-elect Pe\u00f1a Nieto is likely to pursue violence reduction as a key metric of the success of his government's security strategy, a goal that U.S. officials have said is \"extremely logical.\" In his platform, Pe\u00f1a Nieto pledged to develop a National Strategy to Reduce Violence that will contain binding commitments for all levels of government, along with civil society. He also proposed focusing anticrime efforts and socioeconomic programs in the most violent cities. ", "While some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about how Pe\u00f1a Nieto's victory may impact U.S.-Mexican security cooperation, Obama Administration officials have said that they expect to continue \"strong counter-narcotics cooperation with the new president.\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not comment much on the M\u00e9rida Initiative during the campaign, but made general statements to the effect that he would continue security cooperation with the United States, albeit with a different focus than under Calder\u00f3n. Pe\u00f1a Nieto appeared to give higher priority to increasing intelligence-sharing than to receiving larger amounts of U.S. assistance, but the four pillar strategy he outlined resembles the M\u00e9rida Initiative's four pillars with a more explicit emphasis on violence prevention and reduction. While Pe\u00f1a Nieto opposes allowing armed U.S. military or law enforcement agents to carry out operations in Mexico (as they have in Central America), he recently expressed an openness to allowing U.S. military trainers in Mexico. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also expressed a desire to hasten implementation of the judicial reforms passed in 2008, a major focus of M\u00e9rida efforts. The state of Mexico (where Pe\u00f1a Nieto served as governor) is one of only three states operating under the new adversarial, oral criminal justice system. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also mentioned the importance of both Mexico and the United States working more closely together to assist Central American governments, a proposal that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson has said is \"incredibly encouraging.\"", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his advisers have stressed the importance of passing structural reforms to make the Mexican economy more competitive and deepen economic integration with the United States, but have also said that they aim to diversify Mexico's trade relationships. Pe\u00f1a Nieto acknowledges that the PAN has maintained macroeconomic stability, but criticized the past two administrations for failure to spur economic growth rates in Mexico similar to those of other developing countries in Asia and Latin America. He has identified several reasons why Mexico's economic growth has lagged: low productivity, insufficient access to credit, deficient investment in infrastructure, monopolies, a large and expanding informal sector, and a continued over-reliance on the U.S. market. To counter these deficiencies, Pe\u00f1a Nieto advocates a 10-point economic plan that includes, among other measures, implementing recently passed legislation to counter monopolistic practices, passing fiscal reform, opening up the oil sector to private investment, making farmers more productive, and doubling infrastructure investments. Pe\u00f1a Nieto also endorses an active international trade policy aimed at increasing Mexico's trade with Asia, South America, and other markets. His government is likely to take an active role in the negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The proposed TPP would likely enhance the links Mexico already has with the United States and Canada under NAFTA, while also helping boost the country's trade ties with other fast-growing economies.", "Many U.S. observers are interested in whether the next Mexican administration will push for further reforms to increase private involvement in Pemex. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has endorsed such action, and has suggested that Pemex might follow the example of Petrobras in Brazil. Enacting energy reforms is a task which Pe\u00f1a Nieto's campaign manager has said would be an immediate priority for the new administration. However, constitutional reforms require a two thirds vote in the congress. And, the PRI-led coalition's failure to capture a majority in either chamber of the congress may mean that Pe\u00f1a Nieto will encounter the same type of opposition to his reformist agenda that Calder\u00f3n has experienced, unless he is able to reach agreements with the PAN. President Calder\u00f3n has reportedly pledged to encourage Mexican lawmakers to approve energy reforms before he leaves office, a move that Pe\u00f1a Nieto would welcome, but the PRD-led coalition and even some PRI legislators could block that effort. Some predict that Pe\u00f1a Nieto may move to implement reforms that have broad based support, such as making Pemex's budget more independent and reducing its tax burden as part of a larger fiscal reform effort, before pushing for greater private cooperation with Pemex."], "subsections": []}]}}
