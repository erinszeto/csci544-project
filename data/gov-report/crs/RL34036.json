The target price also can be increased in any month that feed costs are above a certain threshold. The MILC program is supported by milk producer groups in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. Large farmers, particularly in the West, contend that the program payment limit is biased against them. Market prices for farm milk have recently declined to levels near the target price, increasing the likelihood of MILC payments in 2009.", "Separately, under previous farm law, the dairy price support program indirectly supported the farm price of milk at $9.90 per hundredweight (cwt.) through government purchases of surplus dairy products from dairy processors. The 2008 farm bill extends the dairy support program through December 31, 2012, but modifies the program so that it directly supports the prices of dairy products at mandated levels. This program shift was designed to help reduce the program's exposure under World Trade Organization limitations. Most dairy farm groups and the Administration view the program as a necessary safety net in a market that is frequently characterized by volatile prices. Dairy processors consider the price support and MILC programs to operate at cross-purposes, which they say contributes to surplus milk production. A recent milk product price decline has resulted in government purchases of nonfat dry milk.", "A third federal dairy pricing policy tool, federal milk marketing orders, requires dairy processors in many regions to pay a minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use.

However, from October 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012, the 2008 farm bill raises the payment rate to 45% of the price deficiency, which results in a one-third larger payment to eligible farmers in months when a payment is triggered. The payment percentage rate will revert to the 34% level for the final month of the program (September 2012). This reversion was included to minimize long-term budget outlays, so that the cost of increasing the percentage payment rate does not get built into the baseline budget once the program expires. Production Payment Limit Increased: The 2008 farm bill maintained the payment quantity limit at 2.4 million pounds through September 30, 2008, and then raised the payment limit to 2.985 million pounds of annual production (equivalent to about a 160-cow operation) between October 1, 2008, and August 31, 2012. Like the increase in the percentage payment rate, the eligible production limit will revert to its original level (2.4 million lbs.) for the last month of program authority (September 2012) so that the budget baseline for future years does not include the cost of the increase. Since the inception of the MILC program, large dairy farm operators expressed concern that the 2.4 million lb. payment limit negatively affected their income. For larger farm operations, their annual production is well in excess of the limit, and any production in excess of that receives no federal payments. An increase was not part of the House-passed version of the bill, and the final level of 2.985 million lbs. is below the Senate-passed level of 4.15 million lbs. Payment Level Feed-Price Adjustment: Because of the rapidly rising cost of feed, some dairy farm groups had sought some type of adjustment to federal dairy support programs to soften the impact. The final 2008 farm bill includes a provision that adjusts upward the $16.94 target price in any month when feed prices are above a certain threshold. The law requires USDA to calculate monthly a National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost based on a formula that USDA currently uses to calculate feed costs. In any month that the average feed cost is above $7.35 per cwt., the $16.94 target price will be increased by 45% of the difference between the monthly feed cost and $7.35.

This budget scoring was based on the March 2007 CBO baseline, which was the official benchmark for the scoring of the 2008 farm bill. When scored against the more recent CBO baseline (January 2009), the increased costs associated with changes in the MILC program are, in fact, more than offset by lower overall program costs associated with higher projected milk prices through FY2012, even after incorporating the effect of the recent decline in milk prices.

Whenever market prices fell to the support level, processors generally made the business decision of selling surplus product to the government rather than to the marketplace.

The program was initially intended to counter foreign (mostly European Union) dairy subsidies, but subsequent farm bill reauthorizations expanded its purpose to market development. Payments since the program's inception have totaled $1.1 billion, with the most recent expenditures made in FY2004. The program was active throughout the 1990s, peaking in 1993 with $162 million in bonuses (see Table 4 ).", "U.S. dairy product exports made with DEIP bonuses are subject to annual limitations under the WTO Uruguay Round Agreement. The limits are 68,201 metric tons of nonfat dry milk, 21,097 tons of butterfat, and 3,030 tons of various cheeses. Total expenditures under WTO commitments are capped at $117 million per year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2008 Farm Bill Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Section 1503 of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) extends the authority for the DEIP until December 31, 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Dairy Import Assessment", "paragraphs": ["The Dairy Producer Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4501-4514) authorized a national dairy producer program for generic dairy product promotion, research, and nutrition education. The program is funded through a mandatory 15-cent per hundredweight assessment on all milk produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous states. Section 1505 of the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) amended the 1983 act requiring that the 15-cent assessment be collected on all imported dairy products. Section 1505 also required USDA to consult with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) before implementing the assessment on imports to ensure that the new requirement is consistent with U.S. international trade obligations. After consulting with the USTR, the Secretary of Agriculture determined that a mandatory dairy import assessment is not permissible, since Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the domestic assessment. According to USDA, the exemption treats some domestic producers more favorably than importers, thereby violating U.S. trade obligations. Hence, USDA has never implemented the import assessment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2008 Farm Bill Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Section 1507 of the enacted 2008 farm bill adopts the Administration's proposal to ensure that the current 15-cent assessment applies to Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

The enacted 2008 farm bill also reduces the assessment on imports from 15 cents to 7.5 cents.", "The import assessment is supported by most dairy producer groups. However, milk producers in Alaska and Hawaii were opposed to any definition change that required them to contribute to the program.
