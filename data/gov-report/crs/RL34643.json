USPS states that 100 billion pieces of advertising mail were delivered to households in the United States in 2007\u2014about 16.7 pieces of advertising mail to each household per week. In 2007, advertising mail represented 60% of all household mail delivered in the United States. In 2006, advertising mail accounted for roughly 2.3% of all municipal waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Standard Mail generated nearly 5.9 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2006. Nearly 2.3 million tons (38.7%) of that waste was recovered. Groups seeking to reduce or eliminate advertising mail assert that it inflicts costs upon the environment and the public. Advocates of curbing advertising mail state that nearly half of it is brought to landfills unopened. According to the New American Dream, a Takoma Park, Maryland-based nonprofit organization, \"more than 100 million trees' worth of bulk mail arrive in American mail boxes each year ... the equivalent of deforesting the entire Rocky Mountain National Park every four months.\" Forest Ethics calculates that it \"would take the equivalent of over 500,000 garbage truck loads to dump all junk mail into landfills and incinerators each year.\" In addition, ProQuo\u2014a San Diego-based company that helps consumers control which organizations receive their names, addresses, and other personal information\u2014advocates for the reduction of unsolicited advertising mail. ProQuo claims that such mailings could lead to identity theft because direct mail marketers, credit bureaus, and data brokers often trade and sell consumer information, making it more accessible to thieves and computer hackers.", "The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) does not dispute the New American Dream's statistics or calculations, but points out that the numbers do not include important details. According to DMA, for example, many of the trees cut down to make paper for advertising mail were grown carefully and specifically for the purpose of being harvested for paper. According to a USPS study, 48% of recipients read their unsolicited advertising mail; an additional 33% glance at it, leaving 19% of people who do not read their advertising mail. According to USPS's Household Diary Study , an average of 1 in 10 pieces of advertising mail elicited a consumer response. A 2007 USPS Environmental Impact of Mail study found \"that advertising mail, through the elimination of shopping trips, harmful emissions, and traffic accidents, results in an annual $553 million net benefit to the American economy.\"", "Additionally, USPS, the Direct Marketing Association, Valassis , and other direct mail marketers contend that advertising mail is constitutionally protected commercial speech, and provides very little opportunity for identity theft. According to the Federal Trade Commission 2006 Identity Theft Survey Report , in 2005 2% of 8.3 million identity theft victims believe their personal information was acquired through postal mail items.", "Finally, these organizations stress advertising mail's importance to the economy. Estimates suggest that advertisers spent $60 billion on direct mail marketing in 2006. One out of every five dollars spent on advertising in the United States is spent on mail. In addition to USPS's 786,000 part-time and full-time employees, DMA estimates that nearly 460,000 people have jobs linked directly to advertising mail. Those who hold jobs include delivery employees, graphic artists, catalog designers for companies like L.L. Bean, employees of tree-growing companies, and paper company employees.
