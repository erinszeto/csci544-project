For example, average individual income will lie below average household income, simply because households can have multiple earners. For these reasons, disagreement over the interpretation of income levels and trends frequently centers on how income is defined.

It can refer simply to earnings (i.e., wages, salaries, and self-employment earnings) or to more expansive measures that span several sources of cash income and in-kind benefits and account for taxes paid and tax credits. One income formulation is not necessarily superior, as there may be valid reasons for selecting one definition over another. For example, a restrictive measure may be preferred when assessing trends and outcomes for a particular family of income streams (e.g., how market income is distributed among households). A comprehensive measure, however, may make more sense when examining households' overall ability to use income to meet basic needs. ", "Recognizing a lack of consensus on how to define income and the benefits of definitional flexibility for certain types of analyses, the Census Bureau makes several income formulations available to data users. In addition to the money income definition it uses to produce official income dispersion estimates, Census provides annual estimates of market income, post-social insurance income, disposable income, and an income measure recommended by the National Academies of Science. Census also allows data users to customize an income measure for certain statistics by specifying which of the 42 Census income components to include. ", " Table 1 compares three Census-defined income measures and illustrates the variability of income concepts. The first column shows money income, the income definition used by Census to calculate annual income dispersion estimates. Money income represents pre-tax cash income received on a usual basis by households; notably, it excludes occasional income such as capital gains (and losses) and in-kind benefits. Market income (second column) is a somewhat narrower concept that reflects pre-tax income from market sources. Disposable income (column three) is the most expansive formulation in the table. In addition to all components in money and market income, it includes receipt of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP); free, reduced, and regular-price school lunches; public housing and rental subsidies; and economic stimulus payments (in 2009 only) and recovery payments (in 2010 only).

These include whether and how to account for capital gains and losses, tax deductions and credits, and government-supported health insurance. How these components are treated is consequential for income distribution analysis because they are experienced differently by low-, middle-, and high-income individuals and households. This means the difference between including these components in income and not including them in income is not a mere shift in the distribution, but potentially alters the shares of total income held by various income groups, and where an individual or household ranks in the distribution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting for Capital Gains and Losses", "paragraphs": ["One notable difference between the Census money income concept and the two alternative definitions presented in Table 1 is the treatment of capital gains. Money income, the definition used by Census to generate its annual income dispersion statistics, does not include capital gains and losses at all. This is frequently identified as a limitation of official Census income statistics in accurately characterizing U.S. income levels, distribution, and trends, because capital gains can be a significant source of income, particularly among households at the upper end of the distribution.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income tax return data record capital gains only when the gains are realized and reported as part of taxable income. For these data, capital gains may therefore be more visible among high-income households because they are more likely to hold (and sell) assets that produce taxable income. In addition, some contend that the standard one-time valuation of capital gains income in the year of realization (i.e., sale of asset) is misleading. This is because the value of assets can accrue over the course of several years, contributing incrementally to available resources. The counter perspective is that continuous accounting for capital gains is a purely theoretical exercise, noting that (1) living standards do not rise with asset value accrual, and (2) the view that available resources rise with asset appreciation rests on the assumption that households can obtain peak prices for their assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pre-tax versus Post-tax Income", "paragraphs": ["The treatment of taxes (i.e., payments and credits) is another point of consideration highlighted in Table 1 . Unlike money income and market income, disposable income presents income in post-tax status, taking into account payment of personal income taxes and receipt of tax credits. It could be argued that this income formulation provides a more realistic representation of income available for consumption in a given year. It also affects the measurement of the income distribution because tax payments and credits are likely to be experienced differently by lower- and higher-income groups. Some low-income individuals and households may not meet the earnings threshold for taxable income or otherwise have a disproportionately lower tax bill than their middle- and high-income counterparts. Likewise, low-income individuals and households are more likely to qualify for certain tax credits, such as the EITC.

The opposite pattern is observed at the top of the distribution: the addition of income dimensions to the income definition appears to reduce the number of households with high incomes. The market income and money income definitions produce nearly identical percentages of households with $100,000 or more in 2007 (20.4% and 20.3%, respectively).

Although synonymous in regular discourse, family and household concepts can have important distinctions for statistical purposes. The Census Bureau defines a family as two or more people with a direct familial relationship (i.e., related by birth, marriage, or adoption), and a household as one or more people who live together and may or may not be related. A household may be a single person, a collection of roommates, or one or more families living together. Tax units are an IRS concept and describe the person or persons filing a tax return (i.e., individual filer and dependents or married filers and their dependents). A tax unit can represent an individual, an entire household or family, or several tax units can reside within a household or family.", "The income distribution will look different depending on whether it is organized at the individual level or household (or other aggregate) level. Individuals (and single tax units) are more numerous and have lower average income levels than households and families, because the latter groups can have multiple earners. Individual income analysis will reveal more low-income persons\u2014such as college students with summer jobs\u2014who are otherwise aggregated into household or family income measures. For these reasons, income analyses that organize income at the individual level are not directly comparable with those that use data on multi-member units that may pool resources.", "Comparability issues affect income data organized at multi-member levels as well. For example, the number of members can vary considerably across households, families, and tax units, complicating comparisons of per-person resources. That is, a member of a four-person household with an income of $52,000 does not have the same access to resources as a two-person household earning $52,000 in the same year. The composition of units also matters to how resources are pooled and shared across members.

To start, Census income estimates are based on information collected from a random sample of households; survey responses are extrapolated to population estimates using sample weights. This method tends to be most effective for estimating the level and distribution of income among middle- and low-income households, where households are clustered together and income ranges are relatively narrow. Estimates at the top, however, where incomes are spread much farther apart, can be quite sensitive to sample composition. ", "Data recording and internal processing procedures introduce further restrictions on top incomes in the CPS-ASEC data. Census limits the number of digits available to survey interviewers when recording individual responses to income questions, effectively capping the level of income that can be reported. This limit was raised from $299,999 to $9,999,999 for each of the four earned-income sources in 1994, when Census moved from a pen-and-paper data collection method to a computer-assisted interview. This means that during the interview, if an individual reports earned income of $10 million or more, it will be recorded by the enumerator as $9,999,999. Once collected, Census edits its income data to minimize the incidence of interviewer error or misreporting on the part of the individual interviewed. For the purposes of Census-published data tabulations and public-use data, the internal processing limit is $999,999 for each of the four individual earnings categories. Finally, Census has historically faced problems in capturing accurate information on interest and dividend income, which is disproportionately received by high-income households.

Median household income in 2013 was slightly higher than median household income in 1995 ($51,719 in 2013 dollars)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Changing Shape of the Distribution: Mean-to-Median Ratio", "paragraphs": ["As noted in the discussion of Figure 2 , the shape of the distribution affects the relative position of mean and median. Drawing on this relationship, the mean-to-median ratio can be used to convey big picture information about the shape of distribution. When a distribution is symmetrical, mean and median will be the same (or very close), and the mean-to-median ratio will be one. The mean exceeds the median for a right-skewed distribution, characterized by a mass of observations on the left side of the graph and a tail to the right, yielding a mean-to-median ratio that exceeds one. ", "Observed over time, the mean-to-median ratio provides information about the extent to which the mean is approaching or retreating from the median, and can be used to gauge changes to the shape of an income distribution. Figure 5 plots the mean-to-median ratio from 1993 to 2013. For all years, the mean-to-median ratio is greater than one, indicating a right-skewed distribution throughout the time period. Between 1993 and 2013, both mean and median income increased in real terms (not shown in Figure 5 ), but growth in average income outpaced growth for the median. This is captured by the rise in the mean-to-median income from 1.33 to 1.40. In terms of the shape of the distribution, a rising mean-to-median ratio suggests an increasingly right-skewed distribution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quantile Analysis over Time", "paragraphs": ["Quantile trend analysis can reveal changing patterns in the absolute and relative experience of U.S. households. Figure 6 presents mean quintile household income from 1993 to 2013. A few points of interest can be taken from this graph. First, mean income among the top quintile is markedly above the other four quintiles for the duration of the observed period. In all years, mean income among the top quintile was at least twice as large as the mean income in the fourth quintile. Second, mean income increased for the 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th , and top quintiles over this time period\u2014though the rate of growth in mean quintile income becomes steadily smaller when moving from the top quintile to the second quintile. Finally, quintile mean income growth stalls or declines during periods of recession.", " Figure 7 shows the evolution of 90-10, 90-50, and 50-10 income ratios between 1993 and 2013, and can be used to assess relative experiences of income groups over time. Households at the 90 th , 50 th , and 10 th percentiles are traditional stand-ins for the top, middle, and bottom of the income distribution. Movement across these ratios, therefore, can be used to gauge changes in the relative experience of top to bottom (90-10 ratio), top to middle (90-50 ratio), and middle to bottom (50-10 ratio). All ratios increased between 1993 and 2013, indicating that the income groups are moving farther apart from each other. The most pronounced change is in the 90-10 ratio, which increased from 10.6 to 12.1 (or approximately 14%). ", "An interesting question, and one that is not immediately apparent from Figure 7 , is whether growth in the 90-10 ratio reflects growing distance between the bottom and middle households or relatively high-income growth at the very top (i.e., a further extension of the right tail). To address this question, income ratios are sometimes expressed (and graphed) in terms of cumulative percentage change from an anchor year. Figure 8 does just that. It converts the same data into the cumulative percentage change since 1993. All ratios show growth over their 1993 values, but more notably, the 90-50 ratio growth tracked closely with the 90-10 ratio while the 50-10 ratio exhibits low to no growth (over the 1993 ratio). The take away from these patterns is the rise in the 90-10 ratio is driven by growth at the top half (90-50) of the distribution (i.e., the extension of the right tail).", " Figure 9 compares quintile income shares across 1993, 2003, and 2013, and reveals growing concentration of U.S. household income at the top of the distribution over the past 20 years. The top of the distribution held a disproportionate share of income in 1993, 2003, and 2013. The share of income among the top 20% of the distribution grew from 48.9% in 1993 to 49.8% in 2003 and to 51% in 2013. The shares of total income held by each of the four lower quintiles fell between 1993 and 2003, and again between 2003 and 2013. ", " Figure 10 translates the movement in income shares across quintiles into the percentage change in quintile share since 1993. This presentation can help identify trends and changes in trends. Figure 10 suggests 2000 was a turning point of sorts for the top quintile and bottom three quintiles. Prior to 2000, each quintile fluctuated close to a 2% increase or decrease over its 1993 share. After 2000, Figure 10 shows a relatively steady climb in the income share held by the top quintile, paired with declining shares among the bottom three quintiles; the fourth quintile continued to fluctuate steadily around a 2% cumulative change. It is important to note that data points shown in the line graphs in Figure 10 represent cumulative change since 1993; they do not describe year-by-year (i.e., annual) percentage change (except for 1994) nor depict percentage point changes. ", " Figure 9 and Figure 10 present the same information in visually different ways. In comparing the two charts, the decline in income share among the lower quintiles appears much more pronounced in Figure 10 . This happens because percentage point changes ( Figure 9 ) reflect an absolute change in percentage points, whereas the percentage change shown in Figure 10 is a relative difference that is sensitive to base (i.e., value in 1993). Since the lowest quintile has a small base (3.6% in 1993), even small absolute changes in percentage points will represent a large percentage change. For example, Figure 10 shows an 11.1% fall in income share for the lowest quintile between 1993 and 2013, but the same change is shown in Figure 9 as a 0.4 percentage point decrease."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comparing Income by Geographical Location", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Variation in Median Household Income across States", "paragraphs": ["Comparing income statistics across U.S. states can reveal interesting economic and distributional variation that is otherwise masked by national-level data.

It is used to assess changes in income dispersion for a given population over time and make comparisons across groups, especially international comparisons.", "The Lorenz curve ( Figure 13 ) plots the cumulative percentage of the population in ascending order of income (i.e., from poor to rich) on the horizontal axis against the cumulative percentage of total income on the vertical axis. Points along the Lorenz curve indicate the portion of total income held by a particular segment of the population. The straight grey line in Figure 13 shows what the Lorenz curve would look like if total income was equally distributed. Under that scenario, for example, 50% of total income would be held by the (poorest) 50% of the population (point A), 75% of total income would be held by the (poorest) 75% of the population (point B), and so forth. This line is alternately referred to as the line of equality or the equidistribution line. The curved line illustrates the Lorenz curve under a more realistic scenario, in which income is dispersed unevenly across the population. As more income is concentrated at the top of the distribution, the curve pulls farther away from the equidistribution line.", "The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the Lorenz curve and the equidistribution line (area A) to the total area underneath the equidistribution line (area A + area B). As the Lorenz curve approaches the equidistribution line, area A falls and the Gini index value declines. Perfect equality occurs when the Lorenz curve overlaps the equidistribution line and there is no area between the two curves, reducing the Gini to zero. When a single household holds all income\u2014the perfect inequality scenario\u2014the Lorenz curve runs along the horizontal axis up until the final percentile where it jumps to 100%. Under this scenario, the area between the equidistribution line and the Lorenz curve and the area underneath the equidistribution line are the same (area A + area B), producing a Gini index value of one. ", "As demonstrated above, Gini index values range from zero to one, with zero indicating perfect equality (i.e., all individuals hold the same income) and one indicating perfect inequality (i.e., all income is held by one household). It provides a convenient way to compare the distribution of income over time or the income distributions for different groups, with higher values indicating greater dispersion. However, the index has drawbacks as well. For example, the Gini index does not convey information about the shape of the income distribution; several different shapes can yield the same Gini index value. Figure 14 provides an example of two Lorenz curves that both produce a Gini value of 0.20. The Gini is also not perfectly decomposable, which means it is not well-suited for comparing the dispersion of income within groups to the dispersion between groups.", " Figure 15 plots the Gini index between 1993 and 2013 and shows an upward trend. Over this time period, the Gini index for the United States ranged from 0.450 (in 1995) to 0.477 (in 2011). It was 0.476 in 2013. ", "Appendix A. Describing Incomes at the Top of the\u00a0Distribution", "Survey data, like the CPS-ASEC used by the Census Bureau to describe the distribution of household money income cannot be used to identify with certainty the highest and lowest earners in the population (See \"Census Data\"). IRS data are superior for studying incomes at the top, but privacy rules limit the information the IRS can share publicly about filers, though it does provide some information. For example, IRS is required by law to report (in aggregate) on the number of filers with adjusted gross incomes above $200,000, and it produces occasional reports on the top 400 filers, considered in aggregate and with identifying information removed.", "Through data agreements with both agencies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is able to combine CPS and IRS data to create a more comprehensive picture of the income distribution than could be obtained from either data set used alone. As part of their analysis, CBO describes the distribution of incomes within the top 20% of households. ", " Figure A-1 shows average after-tax income within the top quintile for 2011 as reported by CBO. CBO data indicate a wide range of incomes at the top of the income spectrum. The top 20% of households received $188,200 on average in after-tax income in 2011. Average income among the top 1% was $1,031,900. While mean income among the top 1% is high relative to the overall quintile mean, it is likely to lie far below incomes of the highest earners. For reference, IRS analysis of the top 400 filers in 2009 revealed that average adjusted-gross income among them was $202 million. ", "Appendix B. Summary Indicators Reported by\u00a0Census", "The U.S. Census Bureau publishes several summary measures of income dispersion in its annual Income and Poverty in the United States report: the Gini index, mean log deviation of income (MLD), Theil index, and Atkinson index. These indicators differ from the measures described in the main body of this report in that they do not convey descriptive details on the experience of the typical household, the range of incomes, or the shape of the distribution, but instead use information on the full distribution to characterize overall income dispersion (i.e., they are relative measures used to assess departure from a perfectly equal distribution of income). While the Gini is familiar to many (and discussed in this report\u2014see \" Gini Index \"), the other three measures are less so. This appendix provides an overview of the MLD, Theil, and Atkinson indices, explaining their basic properties and interpretation, and the value they bring to analysis of the income distribution.", "Generalized Entropy Indices: MLD and Theil Index", "General entropy (GE) indices are a family of relative inequality measures that are based on ratios of incomes to the mean. A sensitivity parameter\u2014typically identified using the Greek letter alpha\u2014adjusts the weight the index gives to various portions of the distribution and distinguishes members of the broader class of GE measures. Two of the most popular GE measures are the MLD and Theil index, which are defined when the sensitivity parameter is set to zero and one, respectively. They are bounded from below by zero, the value that communicates perfect income equality. Both indices rise in value as the dispersion of income increases; higher values indicate a wider dispersion (i.e., more unequal distribution). Unlike the Gini, general entropy indices are not capped at one.", "The MLD and Theil index share several attractive features. They are scale invariant, meaning that the value does not change when all incomes are multiplied by a constant. This is helpful because it means, for example, that the measure is not sensitive to currency conversion. They also respond in an intuitive way to transfers of income within a distribution. Namely, they will register more dispersion when income is transferred from households at the bottom to those at the top. Finally, they are perfectly decomposable by subgroups. Both measures permit within and between components to be identified separately (e.g., they can be used to assess the extent to which a change in income dispersion is due to changes within U.S. states and how much can be explained by changes between states). ", "The MLD and Theil differ, however, in their sensitivity to changes at various parts of the income distribution. MLD is sensitive to changes at the bottom of the distribution, and will be more responsive than the Theil index to increased dispersion among low to middle incomes. The Theil index, on the other hand, will rise faster than the MLD as incomes at the top of the distribution grow disproportionately. As such, it is possible to compare changes in income dispersion across portions of the distribution (lower tail, middle, or upper tail) by observing how the MLD and Theil index change over time for a given income distribution. ", "The Atkinson Index", "The Atkinson index is a welfare-based measure. It uses a specific mathematical function to quantify the \"social welfare\" of a given income distribution and compares it to the value the same social welfare function would have if total income was distributed with perfect mathematical equality. The interpretation given to the numerical value of the index is the proportion of total income a society would be willing to forfeit to achieve a perfectly equal distribution. For example, consider a society with 100 individuals and a total (societal) income of $1 million. An Atkinson index of 0.10 indicates that this society would be equally content with 90% of total income (i.e., $900,000) if it were distributed equally among all 100 members (i.e., all members earn $9,000), as they are with the actual distribution of (actual) total income. The Atkinson index values range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that total income is distributed with perfectly mathematical equality (i.e., society would be willing to give up none of its total income to achieve an equal distribution, because they are already there). ", "Like general entropy indices, the Atkinson index is a parameterized measure. The Atkinson sensitivity parameter\u2014denoted by the Greek letter epsilon and often called the inequality aversion parameter \u2014varies the priority applied to incomes at the lower end of the distribution in the social welfare function. As epsilon increases, so does the weight given to lower-income households and the value of the Atkinson index for a given income distribution.", "Like the MLD and Theil index, the Atkinson index is scale invariant, meaning that the index value does not change when all incomes are multiplied by a constant. It also registers more inequality, for a given inequality aversion parameter, as income is transferred from the bottom to the top of the income distribution. Unlike the MLD and Theil index, however, the Atkinson index is not easily decomposable into within and between components."], "subsections": []}]}}
