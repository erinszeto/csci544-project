OASDI benefits are based on an insured worker's career-average earnings in jobs covered by Social Security and designed to replace a portion of the income lost to a family due to the worker's retirement, disability, or death. Workers become insured against these events by acquiring a certain number of earnings credits during their careers in covered employment or self-employment. The SSDI component of the program provides benefits to disabled workers who are under Social Security's full retirement age and to their eligible spouses and children. The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) component also provides disability benefits to eligible disabled dependents of retired workers and to eligible disabled survivors of deceased beneficiaries and deceased insured workers. Although these individuals are not technically disability insurance beneficiaries, they are often included in the term SSDI because they receive Social Security benefits due to a qualifying impairment. SSDI and OASI disability benefits are paid from the Social Security trust funds, which are financed primarily by payroll and self-employment taxes levied on the earnings of covered workers.", "SSI is a federal assistance program that provides needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals with a guaranteed minimum income to meet their basic living expenses. Although there are no work or contribution requirements to qualify for payments, the program is based on need and therefore is restricted to individuals with limited financial means. SSI is commonly known as a program of \"last resort\" because claimants must first apply for most other benefits for which they may be eligible; cash assistance is awarded only to those whose assets and other income (if any) are within prescribed limits. The basic federal SSI payment is the same for all recipients and is reduced by the amount of other income that an individual receives. Some states supplement the federal SSI payment with solely state funds. Unlike Social Security, SSI is financed by appropriations from general revenues.", "Most claimants are considered disabled for SSDI and SSI eligibility purposes if they are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or to result in death. In 2018, the SGA earnings limit is $1,180 per month for most individuals. Claimants generally qualify if they have an impairment (or combination of impairments) of such severity that they are unable to perform any kind of substantial work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy, taking into consideration their age, education, and work experience.

Workers obtain insurance protection by working for a sufficient number of years in jobs where their earnings are subject to Social Security taxes and therefore are creditable for program purposes. Social Security is financed largely on a pay-as-you-go basis, which means that payroll and self-employment tax contributions from current workers, their employers, and self-employed individuals are used to make monthly benefit payments to today's beneficiaries. In 2017, an estimated 173 million people (or about 94% of all workers) worked in paid employment or self-employment covered by Social Security, and the program paid monthly benefits to approximately 62 million beneficiaries ( Figure 1 ).

The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) component of Social Security also provides benefits to eligible disabled dependents of retired workers and to eligible survivors of deceased beneficiaries and deceased insured workers. Although these individuals are not technically disability insurance beneficiaries, they are often included in the term SSDI , because they receive Social Security benefits due to a qualifying impairment. In December 2017, the SSDI component of Social Security paid benefits to 10.4 million individuals, including 8.7 million disabled workers and 1.7 million of their dependents.

In 2018, workers receive one QC for each $1,320 in covered earnings, up to the maximum of four QCs per year, regardless of when the money is earned. Thus, if a worker earns $5,280 in covered wages or net earnings from self-employment income during the first week of January 2018, then he or she would be credited with the maximum number of QCs for the calendar year. The amount of earnings needed for one QC is adjusted annually for average earnings growth in the national economy, as measured by SSA's Average Wage Index (AWI). Requiring individuals to have earned a certain number of QCs to qualify for cash benefits ensures that such individuals contribute a minimum amount to the insurance system via payroll and self-employment taxes on each QC's worth of covered earnings.", "To be insured in the event of disability, known as disability insured , covered workers must be both fully insured for Social Security and meet a recency-of-work requirement. To be fully insured for SSDI, covered workers must have at least one QC for each calendar year after they turned 21 years old and before the year they became disabled. The minimum number of QCs for fully insured status is six for the youngest workers (or 1.5 years of covered work); the minimum number of QCs needed for workers aged 62 or older is 40 (or 10 years of covered work). In effect, individuals must have worked in covered employment or self-employment for about a quarter of their adult lives to be fully insured. ", "To meet the recency-of-work requirement , disabled workers generally need QCs during the 40-quarter period immediately before the onset of the disability. In other words, individuals must have worked in covered employment or self-employment for five of the 10 years before becoming disabled. However, workers under 31 years old may meet the recency-of-work requirement with fewer QCs based on their age.

Next, years with the highest earnings in the applicable computation period are summed and then divided over the number of months in that period to produce the worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME).

The team may request additional evidence or a new consultative examination. As with the initial level, the reconsideration level generally does not involve a face-to-face meeting between the adjudicator and the individual (i.e., case review ). However, if the individual received benefit payments (i.e., was a beneficiary or recipient) and contests an initial determination based on medical factors that he or she is not now blind or disabled, then the individual may request a disability hearing , which is a face-to-face reconsideration of the individual's last medical determination. After the review has been completed, the adjudicator makes a determination based on the preponderance of the evidence in the case record. The claimant is later notified of the decision in writing. ", "In 1999, SSA eliminated the reconsideration level in the following states as part of the Disability Redesign Prototype Model: Alaska, Alabama, California (Los Angeles West and North Branches), Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania. In these 10 states, claimants who appeal the initial determination skip the reconsideration level and proceed directly to the hearing level. As part of FY2019 President's budget request to Congress, the Trump Administration proposes to reinstate the reconsideration level in the 10 prototype states. In addition to the legislative proposal, officials from SSA's Office of Budget informed CRS that the agency plans to use its regulatory authority to gradually reinstate the reconsideration step in the 10 prototypes over the next several years.

Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)", "paragraphs": ["The second mandatory step of the administrative appeals process (or the first mandatory step for those who reside in one of the prototype states) is to request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). An ALJ is an impartial hearing examiner who issues a de novo (i.e., fresh) decision with respect to the individual's claim for benefits. The hearing level is often the first time that a claimant has the opportunity to appeal his or her case face-to-face (either in person or via video teleconferencing). During a hearing, an ALJ investigates the merits of an appeal by informally questioning the claimant, as well as any scheduled witnesses such as medical or vocational experts. A claimant or his or her appointed representative may also present additional evidence, examine evidence used in making the determination under review, introduce witnesses, question witnesses, and present oral or written arguments in support of a favorable decision. In general, all evidence, objections, or written statements must be submitted to SSA at least five business days before the date of the hearing. Because SSA is not represented at the hearing, the proceeding is considered inquisitorial (i.e., non-adversarial). An ALJ issues a decision based on the preponderance of the evidence in the hearing record. In certain situations, the ALJ may dismiss a case without making a decision of its merits, such as when a claimant fails to appear for the hearing.

The AC reviews ALJ decisions and orders of dismissal, as well as processes certain court actions. The AC may dismiss or deny the request for review, or the AC may grant the request and either issue a decision or remand the case back to an ALJ for further proceedings. The AC may also review an ALJ decision or dismissal on its own motion within 60 days after the date of a decision or dismissal. Once the AC decides to review an ALJ decision on its own motion, it may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision (including a favorable decision) or remand the case back to an ALJ for further proceedings.

A district court may issue a decision or remand the case back to SSA for further action. Court remands are initially sent to the AC, which may assume jurisdiction and issue a decision or remand the case to an ALJ for further proceedings and a new decision.

This evaluation is known as a continuing disability review (CDR). The frequency of a CDR depends on the beneficiary's prospective medical improvement. SSA's regulations specify three basic types of schedules or di a ries .", "Medical Improvement Expected (MIE). If medical improvement is expected, then SSA schedules a review at intervals from 6 to 18 months following the most recent decision that the individual is disabled or that disability is continuing. Examples of impairments that fall into this category include traumatic injuries and severe bone fracture. Medical Improvement Possible (MIP). If medical improvement is possible but cannot be accurately predicted based on current experience and the facts of the case, then SSA schedules a review at least once every three years. Examples of impairments that fall into this category include heart failure and severe diabetes with end organ damage. Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE). If medical improvement is unlikely due to the severity of an individual's condition, then SSA schedules a review once every five to seven years. Examples of impairments that fall into this category include intellectual disabilities, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which is sufficiently severe, and Parkinson's disease which is sufficiently severe. Individuals who receive this classification are considered permanently disabled by SSA.", "As shown in Figure 8 , few SSDI beneficiaries and SSI disability recipients are assigned a MIE diary.", "SSA conducts two types of medical CDRs on individuals whose diaries mature: full medical CDRs and mailers. A full medical CDR involves SSA sending the case to the state DDS agency for a full medical review. A mailer is a questionnaire sent to the individual in order to obtain additional information, which SSA uses to determine if a full medical CDR is appropriate. If the answers to the mailer do not indicate likely improvement, SSA may defer a full medical CDR. ", "Under current law, SSA must find substantial evidence of medical improvement during a CDR to find a SSDI beneficiary or SSI disability recipient no longer disabled and therefore ineligible for benefits. The legal requirement for determining if disability continues during a CDR is called the medical improvement review standard (MIRS). Under a MIRS determination for adults, the agency generally considers a SSDI beneficiary or SSI disability recipient no longer disabled if the review finds considerable evidence that (1) there has been substantial medical improvement in the individual's impairment(s) related to his or her ability to work since the last favorable medical decision and (2) the individual has the ability to engage in SGA. For a child SSI recipient, SSA typically considers the child no longer disabled if the review demonstrates that there has been substantial medical improvement in the recipient's impairment(s) since his or her most recent favorable medical decision to the point in which the recipient's condition no longer meets or medically or functionally equals the severity in the listings. When a SSDI beneficiary or SSI disability recipient is found no longer disabled, he or she may appeal the decision using the process described previously.

Unscheduled redeterminations are conducted based on a report of a change in a recipient's circumstances that may affect program eligibility or payment amount.

Qualified disability expenses include costs related to education, housing, transportation, employment training and support, assistive technology and personal support services, health and wellness (including long-term services and supports), financial management and administrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses identified in guidance published by the IRS. To qualify for an ABLE account, an individual must either be (1) entitled to Social Security or SSI benefit payments due to blindness or disability and such impairment occurred before the date the individual attained age 26 or (2) certified by a physician that his or her impairment meets the blindness or disability standards used for children under the SSI program, regardless of the individual's age, and such impairment occurred before the date the individual attained age 26. ", "There are three advantages to ABLE accounts. First, earnings in an ABLE account can grow tax-free annually until they are withdrawn. Second, distributions (i.e., withdrawals) from an ABLE account are tax-free if they are used to pay for qualified disability expenses. Third, assets in and distributions from an ABLE account for qualified disability expenses are disregarded in determining a designated beneficiary's eligibility for and the amount of assistance provided by most federal assistance programs. Under the SSI program, however, only the first $100,000 in an ABLE account is excluded. The balance of an ABLE account above $100,000 is treated as a resource to the designated beneficiary and is counted against the program's resource limit. If a designated beneficiary becomes ineligible for SSI due solely to excess ABLE funds, his or her cash payments are suspended (without a time limit) until the balance of the ABLE account falls to or below $100,000. This suspension does not affect the beneficiary's eligibility for Medicaid. In addition, a distribution from an ABLE account for housing-related expenses is counted against the resource limit unless the distribution is spent in the month of receipt. ", "ABLE accounts allow SSI disability recipients to save for disability-related expenses without such savings jeopardizing their SSI and Medicaid eligibility. Although ABLE accounts have no effect on an individual's entitlement to SSDI, the accounts may allow beneficiaries to save and establish or maintain their eligibility for other federal programs, such as Medicaid or SNAP.

Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, the Federal Perkins Loan program, and the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program.

To address such concerns, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in March 2015 that directed the Secretary of Education and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security, to develop a plan to proactively identity student loan borrowers who receive SSDI and determine if they qualify for the TPD discharge. Later that year, ED released a report that, among other things, advocated for the streamlining of the TPD discharge process by having federal agencies coordinate their efforts to notify borrowers automatically of their potential eligibility for the discharge.", "In April 2016, ED announced that it had conducted a data match with SSA to identify borrowers potentially eligible for the TPD discharge under the SSA method.

Shortly thereafter, borrowers who were positively identified in the match received a customized letter from ED's TPD servicer, Nelnet, explaining their eligibility for the discharge and how to apply for it. The number of individuals identified in the data match represented about 3% of the total SSDI beneficiary and SSI disability recipient population in July 2016, and about 7% of the total population with a MINE CDR diary that month. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), as of July 31, 2016, \"TPD discharge applications were sent to about 234,000 borrowers based on the data matching and slightly more than 19,000 applications had been submitted and approved.\"", "In April 2018, ED announced that it would conduct a similar data match with the VA to identify borrowers potentially eligible for the TPD discharge under the VA method.", "Recent Changes to the Federal Income Tax Treatment of Loans Discharged Under the TPD Discharge Program", "Under prior law, the amount of student loan debt discharged under the TPD discharge program was included in the borrower's gross income for purposes of federal income tax in the year the discharge became final, which for borrowers approved under the SSA method or physician's certification method is at the close of the three-year monitoring period and for borrowers approved under the VA method is the date that ED approves the discharge. This resulted in some borrowers having markedly high taxable income relative to their income exclusive of the discharged student loan indebtedness for the tax year.
