The provisions also require several federal agencies to report whether Florida is meeting the deadline. If not, some provisions state that Congress may disapprove funding for some Everglades restoration projects, including some projects in the $7.8 billion Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). (For more information, see CRS Report RS20702, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration and the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].)", "These provisions may represent a turning point in the 10-year federal-state partnership to restore the Everglades. Since 1993, the federal, state, tribal and local governments have generally worked together towards restoration. Congress has not previously conditioned federal Everglades funding on Florida taking specific actions towards restoration, both because of this partnership and because a federal Consent Decree and a state law (the Everglades Forever Act) set a deadline of 2006 for phosphorus mitigation. However, in spring 2003, the Florida legislature amended the Everglades Forever Act to extend the deadline until at least 2016.", "Phosphorus pollution has been a concern in the Everglades for many years. Excess phosphorus can cause imbalances in vegetation and habitat and alter native ecosystems. Much of this phosphorus is discharged in water from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), which is located north of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and the Everglades National Park. The EAA has been used intensively for farming, particularly sugar cane, since the 1950s. In 1988, the federal government sued the State of Florida and two of its agencies, alleging that water released onto federal lands from agricultural sources contained elevated levels of phosphorus and other nutrients in violation of state water quality standards. Based on a 1992 Consent Decree settling this lawsuit, Florida enacted the Everglades Forever Act in 1994. This act required the state to establish a numeric limit for phosphorus by December 2003 and required actions to comply with this limit by December 2006. The federal judge overseeing the Consent Decree later adopted the December 2006 deadline. In spring 2003, Florida amended the 1994 Act to create flexibility in meeting deadlines for phosphorus mitigation to 2016 or later, and in July 2003, Florida issued a rule establishing a limit for phosphorus of 10 parts per billion and methods to measure compliance with that limit.", "This report discusses the FY2004 appropriations provisions that condition federal funding for Everglades restoration on compliance with water quality standards, provides a side-by-side analysis of pending appropriations legislation, and provides background and a timeline of efforts to address Everglades phosphorus pollution.

The Interior legislation requires the waters to meet a broader set of standards, as state water quality standards will include limits on several substances besides phosphorus. Where water is measured (e.g., entering the land or throughout the land) may be significant as phosphorus levels can vary greatly depending on the point of measurement.

This report provides for a planning process to ensure that discharges of water into the Everglades will comply with state water quality standards and that phosphorus levels in these waters will not alter the native Everglades ecosystem. In contrast to the EFA, the new law contains provisions that appear to create flexibility in this goal. For example, the Long-Term Plan is to be implemented from 2003 to 2016 and is expected to \"provide the best available phosphorus reduction technology\"(\u00c2\u00a73(b)). Further, the new law allows the Long-Term Plan to be changed through adaptive management, which may lead to changes in the implementation of phosphorus reduction activities and an extension of any compliance deadlines.", "The amended EFA does contain provisions that suggest the December 2006 deadline for meeting the phosphorus criterion is expected to be met.

Note that this provision requires the implementation of projects and strategies by December 2006 to achieve the phosphorus criterion, but does not require the phosphorus criterion be met by 2006. The new law does not specify a particular date by which the phosphorus criterion must be met. The Long-Term Plan also specifies that a second 10-year phase (2017-2026) to reduce phosphorus may be necessary to achieve the Plan objective. The objective in the Plan is to obtain, to the maximum extent practicable, a long-term geometric average phosphorus concentration in waters discharged to the Everglades that is within the upper annual concentration limit of the criterion as calculated in the 2003 Everglades Consolidated Report .

Some critics also argue that if phosphorus mitigation is delayed, it may compromise the state and federal governments' efforts to restore the Everglades, as well as jeopardize federal appropriations for CERP. In a joint statement issued by six U.S. Representatives, five criticisms of the Amended EFA were listed: (1) there is an uncertain period for compliance with water quality standards; (2) there is uncertainty over the water quality standard for phosphorus discharge; (3) because of delays in phosphorus mitigation, discharges of phosphorus-polluted water may enter federal lands such as Everglades National Park; (4) this bill provides for discharges of phosphorus-polluted water in unpolluted dry areas; and (5) this bill does not reflect the state's intent to fully fund water quality improvements in the Everglades and may shift some of the cost to the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Support of Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Proponents of the new law, which include the Florida legislature and agricultural interests in the Everglades, claim that it provides a realistic opportunity for mitigating phosphorus pollution in the Everglades.

Indeed, they argue that it is more cost-effective and productive to implement a substitute plan for the plan provided in the original EFA, as (1) some of the more expensive projects are aimed at waters which contribute relatively little phosphorus to the Everglades and (2) CERP projects incorporate water quality standards and call for diverting water away from the Everglades anyway. Under this new plan, they argue, CERP and state efforts to lower phosphorus will work together more efficiently, and that the 1994 law did not foresee the creation of CERP.

Some researchers have also attributed phosphorus in the Everglades to atmospheric deposition, but measurement techniques and values for this are highly uncertain. The 2003 Everglades Consolidated Report documents total phosphorus concentrations as being highest in the northern Everglades (waters flowing into LNWR and Water Conservation Areas; see Figure 1 ), and lowest in the southern Everglades, where ENP is located.

Eutrophication is a natural process that occurs when bodies of water experience an increase in the inflow of nutrients, including phosphorus, leading to an increase in organic matter (e.g., plants in the case of the Everglades). When plants begin to die and decompose, they consume dissolved oxygen from the water. A rapid inflow of excessive nutrients can speed this process to an unnatural pace. If dissolved oxygen levels fall substantially and rapidly, fish and aquatic plant populations will suffer. Eutrophication also favors plants that can use high levels of nutrients. For example, excessive levels of phosphorus in the Everglades is thought to be the primary factor behind the conversion of native sawgrass marshes and sloughs to vegetation stands dominated by cattails. This shift in vegetation has resulted in less habitat for wading birds and other wildlife and reduced populations of several native plant species. Further, the rapid growth of cattails is partly responsible for clogging waterways and altering the hydrology in parts of the Everglades."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of Everglades Phosphorus Pollution", "paragraphs": ["The beginning of excessive phosphorus input into the Everglades can be traced back to the 1940s, when several thousand acres of land were cleared and converted to agricultural production. This clearing exposed soils, which began to erode and leach phosphorus into waterways that connected to the Everglades. Production intensified after the Cuban revolution in 1959, as Cuban exiles fled to Florida and established sugar plantations. By the mid-1960s, Florida sugar production had increased four-fold. Today, sugarcane production contributes two-thirds of the economic production of Everglades agriculture, and uses nearly 80% of the crop land in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). (See Figure 1 .) Sugar production contributes phosphorus to the ecosystem primarily through fertilizers and to a lesser extent through decomposition of plants.

State water quality standards at the time included a narrative criterion stating that nutrient concentrations in water should not cause an imbalance in natural populations of aquatic flora and fauna.

Water in LNWR was expected to meet phosphorus limits of 7 ppb (in a wet year) to 17 ppb (in a dry year) by July 2002.
