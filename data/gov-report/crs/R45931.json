It was established by the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 (SLRA), Title IV of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ). Federal student loans were first made through the Direct Loan program in 1994.", "In the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government using federal capital (i.e., funds from the U.S. Treasury), and once made, outstanding loans constitute an asset of the federal government. Some important characteristics of loans made through the Direct Loan program are that the federal government assumes the risk for losses that may occur as a result of borrower default, and that it pays for the discharge of loans in cases of borrower death, total and permanent disability, and other limited instances. The federal government also assumes the cost of loans that are not required to be paid in full due to borrowers satisfying criteria that make them eligible to have a portion or all of the balance of their loans discharged under any of several loan forgiveness programs. For federal budgeting purposes, the program is classified as a direct loan program, which is a type of federal credit program for which mandatory spending authority is provided. ", "ED's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is the primary entity tasked with administering the Direct Loan program. The institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in the Direct Loan program originate loans to borrowers through FSA's Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system. Contractors hired by ED service and collect on the program's loans. ", "When the Direct Loan program was first established, it was intended gradually to expand and then ultimately fully replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, a guaranteed student loan program authorized under Title IV, Part B of the HEA, and through which most federal student loans were being made. The FFEL program had descended from the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, which was enacted under Title IV of the HEA in 1965 to enhance access to postsecondary education for students from low- and middle-income families by providing them access to low-interest federal student loans. In the FFEL program, loan capital was provided by private lenders who also originated and serviced loans. The federal government guaranteed lenders against loss due to factors such as borrower default, death, total and permanent disability, and in limited instances, bankruptcy. State and nonprofit guaranty agencies administered the federal guarantee. The federal government was also responsible for making several different types of payments to lenders and guaranty agencies to support the operation of the program. The FFEL program was administratively complex and the Direct Loan program was established with the aims of streamlining the federal student loan delivery system and achieving cost savings. ", "Several years into the implementation of the Direct Loan program, statutory provisions specifying that it ultimately succeed the FFEL program were repealed by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ). From 1994 to 2010, the Direct Loan program and the FFEL program operated side-by-side. During this period, IHEs could elect to participate in the program of their choice. As this decision was made at the institutional level, the program through which an individual could borrow federal student loans was dependent upon the program participation decisions made by the institution a student attended. ", "During the period while loans were being made through both the FFEL and Direct Loan programs, from the perspective of the borrower the terms and conditions of loans offered through the programs were similar in most respects. However, the degree of similarity varied over time. Notable differences included certain characteristics of the repayment plans offered and, beginning in 2008, the availability of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program only to borrowers of loans made through the Direct Loan program.", "The authority to make loans through the FFEL program was terminated, effective July 1, 2010, by the SAFRA Act, Title II of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA; P.L. 111-152 ). While loans are no longer being made through the FFEL program, as of the end of the second quarter of FY2019, $271.6 billion in principal and interest on FFEL program loans, borrowed by or on behalf of 12.8 million students, remained outstanding and due to be repaid over the coming years. ", "Over the history of the Direct Loan program, Congress has periodically made changes to loan terms and conditions. Such changes have often been made as part of comprehensive amendments to the HEA, which authorizes the Direct Loan program; as part of amendments contained in budget reconciliation measures; or as part of amendments included in annual appropriations measures. Congress may well contemplate making future changes to loan terms and conditions.

These loans are available only to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. Direct Subsidized Loans are characterized by having an interest subsidy that applies during an in-school period when a borrower is enrolled in an eligible program on at least a half-time basis, during a six-month grace period, during periods of authorized deferment, and during certain other periods. The Direct Subsidized Loans currently being made have a fixed interest rate that remains constant for the duration of the loan. Direct Unsubsidized Loans . These loans are available to undergraduate students, graduate students, and professional students, without regard to the student's financial need. Direct Unsubsidized Loans generally do not have an interest subsidy. The Direct Unsubsidized Loans currently being made have a fixed interest rate that remains constant for the duration of the loan. The interest rate on loans made to graduate and professional students is higher than the rate on loans made to undergraduate students. Direct PLUS Loans . These loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of undergraduate students who are dependent upon them for financial support. They are made without regard to financial need and generally do not have an interest subsidy. The Direct PLUS Loans currently being made have a fixed interest rate, which remains constant for the duration of the loan; and the interest rate is higher than the rate on both Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Direct Consolidation Loans . These loans allow individuals who have at least one loan borrowed through either the Direct Loan program or the FFEL program to refinance their eligible federal student loan debt by borrowing a new loan and using the proceeds to pay off their existing federal student loan obligations, including loans that are in default. Direct Consolidation Loans may be obtained without regard to financial need. The Direct Consolidation Loans currently being made have fixed interest rates, which are determined by calculating the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans that are consolidated, rounded up the result to the next higher one-eighth of a percentage point. Upon an individual obtaining a Direct Consolidation Loan, a new repayment period begins, which may be for a longer term than applied to the loans originally borrowed.

This is the dollar amount a student and the student's family (e.g., parents or spouse) are expected to contribute toward his or her education expenses for a year. A student's EFC is calculated according to procedures specified in law using information supplied by the student on the FAFSA.

However, if a borrower seeking to repay according to one of the IDR plans has some types of loans that may be repaid according to an IDR plan and some that may not, the borrower may repay the eligible loans according to an IDR plan and the ineligible loans according to a non-IDR plan.

For the first 15 years that the Direct Loan program was in operation, an Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan fulfilled this requirement. Over time, additional repayment plans that served this purpose became available. Collectively, these plans have come to be referred to as income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. ", "Several IDR plans are currently available to borrowers: the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan (one version of which is available to individuals who qualify as a new borrower on or after July 1, 2014, and another which is available to individuals who do not qualify as a new borrower as of that date), the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, and the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan.", "The IDR plans afford borrowers the opportunity to make monthly payments in amounts that are capped at a specified share or proportion of their discretionary income over a repayment period that may not exceed a specified duration . Discretionary income is defined as the portion of a borrower's adjusted gross income (AGI) that is in excess of a specified multiple of the federal poverty guidelines applicable to the borrower's family size. In general, a borrower's family size includes the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's children, and may include other individuals who both live with the borrower and receive more than half of their support from the borrower. The portion of a borrower's income that is below the federal poverty guideline multiple that is applicable to a particular IDR plan may be considered nondiscretionary income, or income that may be needed for purposes of meeting certain basic needs such as food and shelter. Multiples of the federal poverty guidelines that are applicable to the IDR plans are presented below in Table 7 for family sizes of one through eight persons. ", "The various IDR plans are primarily distinguished by (1) the multiple (e.g., 100%, 150%) of the federal poverty guidelines used to define discretionary income, (2) the percentage of a borrower's discretionary income (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%) that is assessed as being available for purposes of making student loan payments, and (3) the maximum duration of the repayment term (e.g., 20 years, 25 years). The IDR plans also share other common characteristics that include the following: ", "Required certification of income and family size. The processes for determining IDR plan monthly payment amounts take into account a borrower's income and family size. Consequently, on an annual basis borrowers must provide documentation of their income and must certify their family size to become and remain eligible for IDR plan repayment. In addition, borrowers may update their income and family size at any time if either changes. Potential n egative amortization. IDR plan payment amounts are capped at no more than a certain proportion of a borrower's discretionary income. As a result, in some circumstances required payment amounts may be less than the amount of interest that accrues, which may lead to a borrower's loan(s) becoming negatively amortized. Potential availability of l oan forgiveness. All the IDR plans make available the prospect of eventual loan forgiveness if a borrower, after making payments according to one or more of the IDR plans, has been unable to fully repay his or her student loan debt by the end of the maximum repayment term. Payments made on defaulted loans repaid according to the IDR plans do not count toward a borrower's eligibility for loan forgiveness.", "Each of the IDR plans are described in detail below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan", "paragraphs": ["The Income-Contingent Repayment plan permits borrowers to make payments on eligible student loans in amounts that are determined according to procedures that take into account a borrower's adjusted gross income and family size. Any loan balance that remains unpaid after 25 years of repayment according to the ICR plan and other qualified plans will be forgiven. Specifications for the ICR plan are established by the Secretary and are codified in regulations. An income-contingent repayment plan has been available to borrowers since the establishment of the Direct Loan program in 1994. ", "Eligibility. The ICR plan is available to all borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans made to graduate and professional students, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Direct PLUS Loans made to parent borrowers are not eligible to be repaid according to the ICR plan; however, parent borrowers of Direct PLUS Loans may qualify to repay those loans according to the ICR plan by consolidating them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. There are no specific income restrictions that limit a borrower's eligibility to repay according to the ICR plan.", "Payment Amounts. Under the ICR plan, monthly payment amounts are calculated according to procedures that take into account factors including the outstanding loan balance at the time the borrower's loans enter repayment status, the interest rates applicable to those loans, the amount of any unpaid accrued interest, the borrower's adjusted gross income (AGI) and family size, and an income percentage factor. For a married borrower who files a joint federal tax return with his or her spouse, the AGI for both spouses is used; for a married borrower who files a separate federal tax return, only the AGI of the borrower is used. Consistent with these criteria, monthly payment amounts are the lesser of", "a monthly payment amount calculated according to a 12-year amortization schedule, multiplied by an income percentage factor that corresponds to the borrower's AGI and tax filing status; or one-twelfth of 20% of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 100% of the federal poverty guideline applicable to the borrower's family size (see Table 7 ). ", "Monthly payment amounts may range from $0 for a borrower with an income at or below 100% of the federal poverty guideline to amounts more than sufficient to repay the borrower's loans in 12 years or less. For a borrower whose calculated monthly payment results in an amount that is greater than $0 but less than $5, a minimum monthly payment amount of $5 is required. Monthly payment amounts are recalculated annually to take into account changes (e.g., borrower AGI, the amount of any unpaid accrued interest) that may have occurred over the past year.", "Joint ICR Plan Repayment for Married Borrowers . Borrowers of loans made through the Direct Loan program who are married to each other may elect to repay their loans jointly. Married borrowers must file a joint federal tax return to qualify for Joint ICR plan repayment. Under this option, the sum of the outstanding loan balances of each borrower, as of the time they elect joint repayment, is used to determine their combined monthly payment amount according to the procedures described above for the ICR plan. Payments made by married borrowers repaying jointly are applied to each borrower's loans in proportion to each borrower's share of the combined outstanding balance.", "Subsidized Interest . No special interest subsidies are made available to borrowers as part of the ICR plan.", "Application of Payments. Payments made by borrowers under the ICR plan are first applied to any outstanding charges or collection costs, then to outstanding interest due on the loan, and then to principal. Under the ICR plan formula, it is possible that a borrower's monthly payment amount may be for less than the amount of interest that has accrued since the last payment. Should this occur, interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal balance and unpaid interest that has accumulated will be capitalized into the principal balance of the loan once per year. However, unpaid accrued interest may only be capitalized until the outstanding principal balance reaches 110% of the amount of the original principal balance as of when the borrower's loan(s) entered repayment. Once the OPB has reached 110% of the original principal balance, unpaid accrued interest may continue to accumulate but will no longer be capitalized.", "Failure to Certify Income and Family Size . To qualify and remain eligible to repay according to the ICR plan, borrowers must annually provide certification of their income and family size to ED. Certification of income is normally satisfied by providing the borrower's AGI. However, if the borrower's AGI does not reflect his or her current income, alternative documentation of income may be provided. If the borrower fails to provide certification of income, his or her monthly payment amount will be recalculated to equal the amount the borrower would have paid according to the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term, based on the amount owed at the time he or she first elected to repay according to the ICR plan. The repayment period based on the recalculated payment amount may exceed 10 years. If the borrower fails to certify his or her family size, a family size of one will be assumed and used for the year.", "Maximum Repayment Period and Loan Forgiveness . The ICR plan has a maximum repayment period of 25 years. If a borrower repays according to the ICR plan and obtains an additional loan that is eligible to be repaid according to the plan, a new, separate repayment period will begin for the new loan when it enters repayment. If after 25 years of having repaid a nondefaulted loan or loans according to the ICR plan or certain other repayment plans, or having qualified for and received an economic hardship deferment, a borrower still has an outstanding loan balance, the remaining unpaid balance will be discharged (i.e., forgiven). The maximum 25-year repayment period for the ICR plan, after which loan forgiveness may be granted, includes periods during which the borrower", "made monthly payments (including payments of $0) according to the ICR plan, made monthly payments (including payments of $0) according to an IBR plan while experiencing a partial financial hardship; made monthly payments, either as part of an IBR plan after no longer having a partial financial hardship or after leaving an IBR plan, in amounts calculated according to the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term, based on the outstanding balance as of when the borrower first began repaying according to an IBR plan; made monthly payments (including payments of $0) according to the PAYE repayment plan or the REPAYE repayment plan; made monthly payments according to the REPAYE Alternative Repayment plan prior to changing to an IBR plan; made monthly payments on a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan according to the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term during the portion of the maximum 10-year repayment period that remains after the borrower ceases to repay according to an IBR plan; made payments on a Direct Consolidation Loan according to the Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms or the Graduate Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms during the portion of the maximum 10-year to 30-year repayment period that remains after the borrower ceases to repay according to an IBR plan; made monthly payments according to the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term; made monthly payments during periods after October 1, 2007, according to any repayment plan in amounts not less than the amount required under the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term; only for borrowers who entered repayment prior to October 1, 2007, and only if the applicable repayment term is for not more than 12 years, made payments according to the Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms, the Extended Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms, or the Graduated Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms (see Table 5 ); or received an economic hardship deferment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plans", "paragraphs": ["The Income-Based Repayment plans permit borrowers to repay eligible student loans according to procedures that limit monthly payment amounts based on criteria that take into account a borrower's adjusted gross income, family size, and monthly payment amount as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period, based on the greater of the amount owed at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or the amount owed at the time the borrower elects to repay according to the IBR plan.

In both cases, exceptions pertain to loans made to parent borrowers. Direct PLUS Loans and FFEL PLUS Loans that were made to a parent borrower and Direct Consolidation Loans and FFEL Consolidation Loans that that were used to repay either a Direct PLUS Loan or a FFEL PLUS Loan that was made to a parent borrower are ineligible to be repaid according to either of the IBR plans. These loans to parent borrowers are also excluded from being considered when determining a borrower's eligibility for IBR plan repayment. This discussion addresses the IBR plans available through the Direct Loan program.", "Partial Financial Hardship. To be eligible to begin repaying according to an IBR plan, a borrower must be determined to have a partial financial hardship . The criteria for determining whether a borrower has a partial financial hardship take into account the borrower's federal income tax filing status (e.g., single, married filing jointly), AGI, family size, multiples of the federal poverty guidelines applicable to the borrower's family size, and monthly payment amounts as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period based on the greater of the amount owed at the time the borrower initially entered repayment or the amount owed at the time the borrower elects to repay according to the IBR plan. ", "If a borrower is single, or is married and files an individual federal tax return, he or she is determined to have a partial financial hardship if the total annual payments for all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period, are greater than the applicable percentage (15% or 10%) of his or her discretionary income. If a borrower is married and files a joint federal tax return, he or she is determined to have a partial financial hardship if the total annual payments for all of the eligible loans of the borrower and, if applicable, the eligible loans of the borrower's spouse, as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period, are greater than the applicable percentage of the combined discretionary income of the borrower and the borrower's spouse. Discretionary income is defined as the portion of a borrower's adjusted gross income that is in excess of 150% of the poverty guideline that is applicable to his or her family size. If the total annual payments for all of the borrower's eligible loans, as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period, do not exceed 15% or 10% of his or her discretionary income, as applicable, the borrower is no longer considered as having a partial financial hardship.", "Payment Amounts. During periods while a borrower has a partial financial hardship and repays according to an IBR plan, monthly amounts due on his or her loans may range from $0, for a borrower with an AGI that is at or below 150% of the poverty guideline, to a maximum of one-twelfth of the specified percentage factor (15% or 10%) of a borrower's discretionary income. For example, based on the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines, 150% of the poverty guideline for a family of one in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia is $18,735. (See Table 7 .)

Nonetheless, the required payment amount may not exceed the monthly amount due, as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period based on the borrower's loan balance at the time he or she elected to begin repaying according to the IBR plan.

As part of the IBR plans, an interest subsidy is available on subsidized loans during periods of negative amortization for a maximum of the first three years from the start of a borrower's repayment according to an IBR plan. If a borrower's required monthly payment is not sufficient to cover all of the interest that accrues on a Direct Subsidized Loan (or the subsidized component of a Direct Consolidation Loan), the portion of the accrued interest not covered by the borrower's monthly payment is subsidized, or paid by the Secretary. Any periods during which the borrower has received an interest subsidy under either the PAYE plan or the REPAYE plan are applied toward this three-year period. However, any periods during which a borrower has received an interest subsidy while qualifying for an economic hardship deferment (during which an interest subsidy is provided on Direct Subsidized Loans and on the subsidized component of a Direct Consolidation Loan) are excluded from the three-year period.", "Application of Payments. Payments made by borrowers repaying under an IBR plan are first applied to interest due on the loan, then to any fees, and then to principal. If a borrower's required monthly payment is for an amount that is less than the amount of interest that accrues on a loan other than a Direct Subsidized Loan or the subsidized component of a Direct Consolidation Loan, or that accrues on a subsidized loan type after the three-year interest subsidy period described above, the unpaid accrued interest will accumulate, but not be capitalized, so long as the borrower remains in the IBR plan and continues to have a partial financial hardship. If a borrower's required monthly payment is sufficient to pay the accrued interest but is insufficient to repay the amount of principal due, then the payment of any principal due in excess of the monthly payment amount owed will be postponed until the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship or leaves the IBR plan. Upon a borrower either no longer having a partial financial hardship or electing to no longer repay according to an IBR plan, any accumulated accrued interest that has not been paid will be capitalized.", "If a borrower chooses to leave an IBR plan, he or she must change to the Standard Repayment Plan that is applicable to the loans\u00e2\u0080\u0094either the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term or the Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans with 10-Year to 30-Year Terms.

A borrower who changes from the IBR plan to a standard repayment plan must make at least one monthly payment according to the standard repayment plan before changing to another repayment plan for which the borrower may be eligible. Borrowers may request a forbearance that permits the making of a smaller payment amount than otherwise would be required for purposes of making that one required monthly payment according to the Standard Repayment Plan.", "Failure to Certify Income and Family Size .

The borrower of a defaulted loan may be assessed a variety of charges for the costs of collecting on it.", "Several options are available to borrowers to bring defaulted loans back into good standing. A borrower may remove a loan from default status by rehabilitating the loan, consolidating the loan into a new Direct Consolidation Loan, or paying off the defaulted loan balance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consequences of Default for Borrowers", "paragraphs": ["A borrower who defaults on a loan made through the Direct Loan program becomes subject to many consequences, which are briefly described below:", " Ineligibility for Federal Student Aid . The borrower becomes ineligible to receive federal student aid made under Title IV of the HEA. A defaulted borrower may regain eligibility by voluntarily making six consecutive, on-time, full monthly payments. A borrower may restore eligibility for Title IV aid though this method only once. Capitalization of Interest. Any unpaid interest that has accrued (e.g., during periods of negative amortization, during delinquency) may be capitalized into the principal balance of the loan. Acceleration. The entire unpaid balance owed on the borrower's loan becomes due in full. Transfer to Private Collection Agencies. Upon default, student loan accounts are initially transferred from the borrower's student loan servicer to the Office of Federal Student Aid's Default Management and Collection System (DMCS), which may then transfer defaulted loans to private collection agencies (PCAs) that are under contract with FSA for collections. A PCA will first contact the borrower before pursuing efforts to collect on the debt. The PCA may offer the borrower the opportunity to rehabilitate the loan or to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement. If the borrower accepts neither offer, or does not honor a voluntary repayment agreement, the PCA may seek to collect on the defaulted loans by means of administrative wage garnishment (AWG). The PCA may also refer defaulted loans to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for collection, or may recommend litigation. Assessment of Collection Charges. The borrower may be charged for the costs of collecting on the loan, including loan collection fees, TOP processing fees, court costs, and attorney's fees. Administrative Wage Garnishment . Up to 15% of the borrower's disposable pay may be garnished to repay the defaulted student loan. Disposable pay is defined as that part of a borrower's compensation that remains after deducting amounts required by law to be withheld. Defaulters must be given written notice of the intent to garnish wages; and they have rights to examine the debt record, have a hearing concerning the existence and amount of the debt or repayment terms, and establish a repayment schedule before garnishment begins. Federal Salary Offset. Similar to AWG, up to 15% of the disposable pay (including retirement pay) of a borrower who is a current or former federal employee may be offset to repay a defaulted student loan. Treasury Offset Program. Defaulters become subject to having their federal income tax returns, Social Security benefits, and certain other federal benefits offset through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) as payment on their student loans. Up to 100% of federal tax refunds may be offset. Social Security benefits may be offset in an amount up to the lesser of 15% of the borrower's monthly benefit amount, or the amount that his or her monthly benefit exceeds $750. Special rules apply with regard to the offset of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. If a recipient has a disability rating of medical improvement not expected (MINE), the offset of SSDI benefits will be suspended. However, if a recipient's disability benefits are converted to retirement benefits, the offset of Social Security benefits may resume. Civil Lawsuit . Litigation is employed as a last resort to collect on a defaulted loan. If this option is pursued, the U.S. Department of Justice may sue the defaulter, on behalf of the Office of Federal Student Aid, to compel repayment. Reporting to Consumer Reporting Agencies . Information on student loans, including amounts borrowed, amounts owed, and repayment status, is regularly exchanged with consumer reporting agencies. Upon default, information about it will also be shared. Consumer reporting agencies may report information on the status of a borrower's defaulted student loan for seven years from the date of the default."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resolution of Default", "paragraphs": ["A number of options are available to borrowers to get out of default. As noted above, a borrower may rehabilitate the defaulted loan, obtain a Direct Consolidation Loan and use the proceeds to pay off the defaulted loan, pay the amount owed on the defaulted loan in full, or, in limited circumstances, enter into a compromise agreement. ", "Repaying a defaulted loan in full may be beyond the means of many borrowers. However, options to do so may include obtaining financing from outside the Direct Loan program to pay off the defaulted debt. A compromise agreement or debt settlement may permit a borrower to satisfy the debt by making a lump sum payment in an amount that is less than the full balance due. Compromise agreements and settlements are offered only after other repayment options have been exhausted.", "Loan rehabilitation and loan consolidation are more widely available to and used by borrowers.

A defaulter must contact the PCA to whom the debt has been transferred to request loan rehabilitation. If during a period of 10 consecutive months a borrower voluntarily makes nine reasonable and affordable monthly payments on a defaulted loan within 20 days of the due date, the defaulted loan is rehabilitated. ", "One of two methods may be used to determine what constitutes a reasonable and affordable payment amount for purposes of rehabilitating a defaulted loan. It is initially determined as being an amount equal to the greater of either one-twelfth of 15% of any portion of the borrower's AGI that is in excess of 150% of the poverty line applicable to the borrower's family size (see Table 7 ), or $5. However, a borrower is permitted to object to the initial determination and may instead elect to have the amount calculated according to an alternative formula that is based on an itemized accounting of his or her monthly income and expenses. In either case, the borrower is required to provide documentation of income and, as applicable, expenses for purposes of determining a reasonable and affordable payment amount.", "Only payments that are voluntarily made by a borrower may be counted as among the nine reasonable and affordable payments required for loan rehabilitation. Involuntary payments may continue to be collected (e.g., through administrative wage garnishment or the TOP) while a borrower pursues loan rehabilitation.", "Upon a loan being rehabilitated, the borrower again becomes eligible for full borrower privileges, such as deferments and loan forgiveness, and other means of collecting on the loan while it was in default will cease. The borrower's loan will then be transferred by DMCS to a nondefault loan servicer and he or she will be placed in one of the alternative repayment plans (discussed above) for a period of 90 days. The borrower may then apply for another repayment plan for which he or she is eligible; if the borrower does not apply for a repayment plan, he or she will be placed in a standard repayment plan. Consumer reporting agencies will also be instructed to remove any record of the default from the borrower's credit history; however, records of late or missed payments that led to the loan defaulting will not be removed. ", "A defaulted loan may be rehabilitated only once. Defaulted loans upon which a court judgement has been obtained through a civil lawsuit are not eligible to be rehabilitated. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["A borrower may use the proceeds of a new Direct Consolidation Loan to pay off one or more defaulted loans. To become eligible to do so, a borrower must make what are considered satisfactory repayment arrangements. ", "One approach is for the borrower, prior to consolidation, to make three voluntary, consecutive, on-time, full monthly payments that are considered reasonable and affordable, based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. These payments must be made within 20 days of the due date and may not be involuntary payments (e.g., payments collected through administrative wage garnishment or the TOP). A borrower who chooses this approach may repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan according to any available repayment plan. ", "Another approach is for the borrower to agree to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan according to one of the IDR plans for which the borrower is eligible. If the borrower obtains a Direct Consolidation Loan for purposes of repaying a Direct PLUS Loan or a FFEL PLUS Loan made to a parent borrower, he or she must repay the new loan according to the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, which is the only IDR plan available to borrowers of parent loans. ", "Several restrictions limit the availability of loan consolidation as an option for borrowers to bring defaulted loans into good standing. If the borrower's loan was subject to AWG, this must first be lifted for the loan to be eligible for consolidation. A loan on which a court judgment has been secured through litigation is not eligible for loan consolidation. If the borrower's defaulted loan is a Direct Consolidation Loan, the borrower must include at least one other eligible loan in the new Direct Consolidation Loan. If the borrower's defaulted loan is a FFEL Consolidation Loan, the borrower may include the loan in a new Direct Consolidation Loan without including any other loans; however, the borrower must repay according to one of the IDR plans.", "If a borrower consolidates a loan out of default, collection fees will be assessed on the outstanding principal and interest of the defaulted loan, and these fees will be included as part of the original principal balance of the new Direct Consolidation Loan. Upon a defaulted loan being repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan, the borrower regains eligibility for full borrower privileges, such as deferments and loan forgiveness, as well as eligibility for additional federal student aid.
