New Zealand and the United States enjoy very close bilateral ties across the spectrum of relations between the two countries. These ties are based on shared cultural traditions and values as well as on common interests. New Zealand is a stable and active democracy with a focus on liberalizing trade in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand also has a history of fighting alongside the United States in most of its major conflicts including World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. New Zealand is a regular contributor to international peace and stability operations and has contributed troops to the struggle against militant Islamists in Afghanistan, where it has a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan Province.", "The bilateral relationship between the United States and New Zealand was strengthened significantly through the signing of the Wellington Declaration in November 2010. At that time, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key signaled that past differences over nuclear policy have been set aside as the two described the relationship as the strongest and most productive it has been in 25 years. In the mid-1980s New Zealand adopted a still-in-effect policy of not allowing nuclear armed or nuclear powered ships to visit New Zealand ports. In a mark of how the relationship has been changing in recent years, New Zealand's nuclear stance earned Prime Minister John Key an invitation to President Obama's nuclear summit in April 2010. The Congressional Friends of New Zealand Caucus and the ongoing Partnership Forum between the two countries, which includes Congressional participation, have played a key role in deepening relations between the two nations.", "New Zealand favors an open and inclusive strategic and economic architecture in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand also continues to seek closer strategic and economic relations and continued U.S. engagement in the Asia Pacific through U.S. participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a Asia-Pacific regional free trade initiative, as well as through U.S. membership in the East Asia Summit (EAS). New Zealand is a member of both the TPP group and the EAS. New Zealand's main export products include dairy products, meat, and wood products.", "New Zealand also plays an important role in promoting regional stability in the Southwest Pacific and in archipelagic Southeast Asia. New Zealand's commitment to such operations is demonstrated by its leading role in helping to resolve conflict on Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, and its participation in peace operations in East Timor, and through its contribution of troops to security operations related to the Regional Assistance Mission in the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). New Zealand has also contributed to peace operations in places such as Bosnia, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo outside its region.", "The National and Labour Parties have traditionally been the leading political parties in New Zealand. Prime Minister John Key of the National Party has faced a daunting challenge of dealing with the aftermath of a February 22, 2011 earthquake that devastated Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city.

Past differences over New Zealand's nuclear policy, which prevents nuclear armed or powered ships from entering New Zealand ports, had hindered the relationship despite deep common interests. At the time of the signing, Clinton and McCully discussed \"shared interests in the Pacific, security interests including Afghanistan, the trade agenda, and U.S. engagement with the region.\" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key noted at the signing of the Declaration that the relationship is \"the best it's been for 25 years.\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed this sentiment and stated that the initiative was part of a \"concerted effort to restore America's rightful place as an engaged Pacific nation.\" This initiative, begun under the Bush Administration, sets aside most all residual areas of policy difference that date back to the mid-1980s. The Declaration is viewed as a tangible symbol of the restoration of the relationship which reportedly followed a 2007 U.S. decision to accept New Zealand's nuclear policy as permanent. In this way, the Declaration recasts the strategic partnership between the U.S. and New Zealand to enable the two states to continue to work together and expand their cooperation as they meet shared challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, between the British Crown and Maori Chiefs, serves as the basis for defining relations between the Maori and Pakeha (European) communities. Subsequent conflict over land led to the New Zealand Wars between colonial forces and Maori fighters. New Zealanders are over 80% urban and the nation has a 99% literacy rate. New Zealand has a land area of 103,733 square miles, which is about the size of Colorado. It is 28% forested, 50% in pasture, and 9% under cultivation. New Zealand's principal exports are agriculturally based.", "New Zealand was a part of the British Empire until 1907 when it shifted from colonial to Dominion Status. New Zealand's demographic makeup defines it as an increasingly Pacific nation that is still largely European in national origin though with an increasing Asian population as well.

Maori represent 14.9% of the population while Pacific Islanders comprise 7.2%. Together these largely Polynesian people account for 22.1% of the population.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Australia", "paragraphs": ["New Zealand's closest external relationship is with Australia, while its most enduring relationship is with the United Kingdom. The closeness with Australia stems from their common origins as British colonies and includes a strong rivalry in rugby, which is New Zealand's most popular sport. Relations between New Zealand and Australia are formalized in the Closer Economic Relations (CER) and Closer Defense Relations (CDR) agreements. With a common labor market, an estimated 400,000 New Zealanders now reside in Australia out of a total estimated population of 4.2 million. On a cultural level, shared national lore, such as the Australia-New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) experience, which was largely forged at the battle of Gallipoli in WWI, serves to reinforce ties between New Zealand and Australia.

The United Kingdom purchased two thirds of New Zealand's exports in 1950. In more recent years, the U.K. has dropped to New Zealand's fourth or fifth largest destination for exports. This has made the search for new foreign markets a key aspect of New Zealand's foreign policy. New Zealand's proactive and successful policy of export diversification has expanded New Zealand's markets to include Japan, China, the European Union, Australia, and the United States. New Zealand remains a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) that includes The United Kingdom and four of its former colonies: Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore. The FPDA was initially undertaken in 1971 following the British decision to remove ground troops east of the Suez after 1971. The FPDA was also established in the period following the Indonesian Konfrontasi of 1963 to 1966. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Chronology74", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}}
