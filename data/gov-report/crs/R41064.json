After the ouster, the Honduran Supreme Court asserted that an arrest warrant had been issued for Zelaya as a result of his noncompliance with judicial decisions that had declared the non-binding referendum unconstitutional. However, the military's actions halted the judicial process before a trial could be held. The Honduran National Congress then adopted a resolution to replace Zelaya with the President of Congress, Roberto Micheletti.", "Micheletti insisted that he took power through a \"constitutional succession\" throughout the seven months between Zelaya's forced removal and the inauguration of new President Porfirio \"Pepe\" Lobo Sosa. He also maintained tight control of Honduran society, severely restricting political activity that opposed his government. President Lobo, who won a November 2009 election that had been scheduled prior to the ouster, took office on January 27, 2010. Some Hondurans declared the election illegitimate, however, as a result of the conditions in the country at the time it was held. The political crisis has left Lobo with a number of challenges, including considerable domestic political polarization, a lack of international recognition, and a faltering economy.", "The United States and the rest of the international community universally condemned Zelaya's ouster. They leveled a series of diplomatic and economic sanctions against the Micheletti government and pushed for a negotiated agreement to end the crisis.

The unity of the international community crumbled along with the agreement, as some countries\u2014such as the United States\u2014agreed to recognize the results of the election despite Zelaya never being restored to office, while others refused to do so.", "Members demonstrated considerable interest in the Honduran political crisis during the first session of the 111th Congress.

Zelaya\u2014a wealthy landowner with considerable investments in the timber and cattle industries\u2014was generally regarded as a moderate when he was inaugurated to a four-year term in January 2006. As his term progressed, however, Zelaya advanced a number of populist policies, including free school enrollment, an increase in teachers' pay, and a 60% increase in the minimum wage. Zelaya also forged closer relations with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, joining PetroCaribe and the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) in 2008. Although Zelaya's populist policies allowed him to maintain considerable support among certain sectors of Honduran society, they alienated many within the traditional economic and political elite.

The fourth ballot would consult Hondurans about whether the country should convoke a national constituent assembly to approve a new constitution.

A day later, Zelaya ordered the resignations of Honduran Defense Minister Edmundo Orellana Mercado and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Romeo Vasquez Velasquez after they informed him that the Honduran military would not provide logistical support for the non-binding referendum since the courts had ruled it unconstitutional. The removal of Orellana and Vasquez prompted the resignation of 36 other Honduran military commanders, including the heads of the army, navy, and air force.

In the aftermath of the ouster, the Honduran Supreme Court produced documents asserting that an arrest warrant for President Zelaya had been issued in secrecy on June 26, 2009, as a result of the executive branch's noncompliance with judicial rulings that had declared the non-binding referendum unconstitutional. Zelaya was charged with crimes against the form of government, treason, abuse of authority, and usurpation of functions for calling a referendum without the approval of the National Congress and intending to use the INE to supervise the vote rather than the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

H.Res. 620 called upon the Micheletti government to end its \"illegal seizure of power\" and work within the rule of law to resolve the situation. On July 10, H.Res. 630 (Delahunt) was introduced in the House. It condemned the \"coup d'etat\" in Honduras; refused to recognize the Micheletti government; called for the reinstatement of Zelaya; urged the Obama Administration to suspend non-humanitarian assistance to Honduras; called for international observation of the November 2009 elections; and welcomed the mediation efforts of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. On September 17, H.Res. 749 (Ros-Lehtinen) was introduced in the House. The resolution called for the Secretary of State to work with Honduran authorities to ensure free and fair elections in Honduras. It also called on President Obama to recognize the November elections \"as an important step in the consolidation of democracy and rule of law in Honduras.\"", "The Honduran political crisis also influenced a change to one of the provisions of the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-117 ). The heading of section 7008 of the \"Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010\" (Division F) was changed from \"Military Coups\" to \"Coups d'\u00c9tat.\" Section 7008 requires the U.S. government to terminate some foreign assistance to any country \"whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree.\" The U.S. Department of State has asserted that although Zelaya's ouster could be considered a \"coup d'\u00e9tat,\" it was not a \"military coup\" and a termination of assistance was not legally required. The House report to the appropriations bill ( H.Rept. 111-366 ) notes that there are no substantive changes to section 7008, but conferees are \"concerned that the previous title implied an unintended limitation of the provision's application.\" The House report also directs the Department of State's Office of the Legal Advisor to \"undertake a review of events necessary to trigger the provisions of this section and submit a report on such events to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enactment\" of the bill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
