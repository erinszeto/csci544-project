Otherwise, Kosovar leaders feared, the association could result in the de facto partition of Kosovo, much as some observers see the existence of the Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated largely autonomous \"entity\" within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Marty claimed he had proof of close links between the crimes in the Medicus case (which occurred in 2008) and organ trafficking during the war in the 1990s.

Moreover, the country's European integration may be hindered if Kosovars, particularly young people, find it difficult to travel to the EU and see how EU countries function at first hand. In January 2012, the EU launched a dialogue with Kosovo on visa-free travel.
