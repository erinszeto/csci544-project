This initiative was reflected in the President's budgets for FY2010 through FY2014. Congress approved $2.5 billion for high speed and intercity passenger rail in FY2010 (P.L. 111-117), but has provided no funding for the program since then, and in the FY2011 appropriations act rescinded $400 million from prior year unobligated balances of program funding.", "There are two main approaches to building high speed rail: (1) improving existing tracks and signaling to allow trains to reach speeds of up to 110 miles per hour (mph), generally on track shared with freight trains; and (2) building new tracks dedicated exclusively to high speed passenger rail service, to allow trains to travel at speeds of 200 mph or more. The potential costs, and benefits, are relatively lower with the first approach and higher with the second approach.", "Much of the federal funding for HSR to date has focused on improving existing lines in five corridors: Seattle-Portland; Chicago-St. Louis; Chicago-Detroit; the Northeast Corridor (NEC); and Charlotte-Washington, DC. Most of the rest of the money has been allocated to a largely new system dedicated to passenger trains between San Francisco and Los Angeles, on which speeds could reach 220 mph. Plans for HSR in some states were shelved by political leaders opposed to the substantial risks such projects entail, particularly the capital and operating costs; the federal funds allocated to those projects were subsequently redirected to other HSR projects. California's HSR plans are being challenged in court, and court decisions in the fall of 2013 have put its funding in question.", "Estimates of the cost of constructing HSR vary according to train speed, the topography of the corridor, the cost of right-of-way, and other factors. Few if any HSR lines anywhere in the world have earned enough revenue to cover both their construction and operating costs, even where population density is far greater than anywhere in the United States. Typically, governments have paid the construction costs, and in many cases have subsidized the operating costs as well. These subsidies are often justified by the social benefits ascribed to HSR in relieving congestion, reducing pollution, increasing energy efficiency, and contributing to employment and economic development. It is unclear whether these potential social benefits are commensurate with the likely costs of constructing and operating HSR.", "Lack of long-term funding represents a significant obstacle to HSR development in the United States.

While Congress has been interested in HSR since the 1960s, the ARRA funding represented an enormous appropriation in historical terms. The $8 billion was included in ARRA largely at the behest of President Obama, and a subsequent announcement in April 2009 made it clear that the development of HSR is a priority of his Administration.

Some projects were stopped after federal funds were awarded; these funds were subsequently redirected to HSR projects in other states. Debate on the merits of HSR may continue where projects are ongoing because these projects are often only small steps along the way to providing much faster service in an entire corridor.

In the 1970s, ownership of the NEC was transferred from the bankrupt Penn Central to Amtrak, a government-controlled company. At the same time, Congress initiated the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program, which has funded major infrastructure improvements and, in the late 1990s, purchase of new high speed Acela trains for Amtrak.", "Congress has also supported research into various high speed rail technologies and studies of potential high speed corridors outside of the NEC where speeds are currently slower (see Table 1 ). The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has calculated that Congress provided a total of $4.17 billion to various high speed rail projects between 1990 and 2007, an average of $232 million annually (not adjusted for inflation). Most of that money went to improvements on the NEC. There have also been state and private sector efforts to develop dedicated high speed rail lines without federal support. But it was only in February 2009, when Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ), that the federal government dedicated large sums to a national high speed rail program.", "ARRA provided $8 billion specifically for intercity passenger rail projects, including high speed rail projects.

In the fall of 2008, Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (Division B of P.L. 110-432 ). Among other things, this act created a high speed rail development grant program with a total authorization of $1.5 billion over FY2009-FY2013.

It included a provision directing the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to seek private companies to build and operate one or more high speed lines.", "In evaluating these efforts, it is important to note that there is no single definition of what constitutes high speed rail. The European Union defines HSR as", "separate lines built for speeds of 250 kilometers per hour (kph) (155 mph), or existing lines upgraded to speeds of 200 kph (124 mph), or upgraded lines whose speeds are constrained by circumstances such as topography or urban development.", "The U.S. government also has several definitions of what constitutes high speed rail. FRA has defined high speed rail as service \"that is time-competitive with air and/or auto for travel markets in the approximate range of 100 to 500 miles.\" As FRA notes, this is a market-driven definition which recognizes that, in choosing a transportation mode, travelers are more interested in total trip time than in top speed, and that travelers evaluate transportation modes not in isolation, but by how those modes compare to each other.", "Congress has, at different times, established high speed rail funding programs using different speed-based definitions and eligibility criteria (see Table 3 ).", "In its strategic plan for high speed rail, FRA defined three categories of high speed rail corridors.

This is estimated to reduce trip times from 5 hours 30 minutes to between 4 and 5 hours. Illinois later received $186 million in FY2010 intercity passenger rail funding to improve about 40 miles of track between Dwight and Joliet, IL. This is estimated to save another 9 minutes from the overall trip time. Building out the whole route for 110 mph is projected to reduce trip times to 3 hours and 50 minutes. Missouri also received $13.5 million in ARRA funding for rail improvements in the approach to St. Louis and several intermodal projects in the corridor have received $46 million in TIGER grant funding.

In 2008, California voters approved the sale of $9 billion in bonds to partly finance such a system. The Los Angeles to San Francisco line is phase one of a two-phase project, with phase two involving extensions to San Diego and Sacramento. To date, the project has been awarded nearly $4 billion in federal funds.. ", "Despite the California project's success in attracting federal funds, it remains controversial. Among the main elements of controversy are the project's cost and its financing. In its 2009 business plan CHSRA estimated the cost of building phase one at $36.4 billion in 2010 dollars. In its 2012 draft business plan, the cost of phase one was estimated for two different systems, a full high speed system and a blended system that would make some use of existing passenger rail infrastructure. The full high speed rail system was estimated to cost between $65.4 billion and $74.5 billion and the blended system between $54.9 billion and $66.3 billion (both in 2010 dollars). CHSRA attributed about 80% to 85% of the cost increase since 2009 to the need for additional viaducts, tunnels, embankments, and retaining walls. The other 15% to 20% of the increase results from higher expected construction costs.", "The doubling or near doubling of estimated costs for phase one, depending on the proposed system, led to renewed calls for the project to be reexamined or abandoned. Subsequently, a revised business plan, released April 2, 2012, dropped the full high speed rail system scenario as too costly. It provided a revised estimate for the blended system at between $53.4 billion and $62.3 billion (in 2011 dollars). ", "The draft 2012 business plan proposed that nearly two-thirds of the construction funding would come from the federal government, although this share might be somewhat lower depending on the system built, the amount of private sector investment, and other variables. A number of commentators, including California's Legislative Analyst Office (LAO) and the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group, have questioned this assumption and have contended that CHSRA's financial plan is highly uncertain. The revised business plan continues to rely on the federal government for about two-thirds of the system's funding, but it states that revenue from California's quarterly auctions of greenhouse-gas emissions allowances, beginning November 2012, could be used instead if federal funding is not forthcoming. In response, the LAO has called this plan \"very speculative.\" ", "Another element of controversy surrounds the choice of the section between Merced and Bakersfield in the Central Valley to be the first segment built. It appears that this section was chosen largely because it may face fewer challenges than other sections in the more heavily populated areas near San Francisco and Los Angeles, increasing the likelihood that California will be able to spend the ARRA money by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2017. Critics, however, claim that this segment of the phase one project will have little utility if the rest of the system is not built. The revised draft business plan commits to building an initial operating segment that connects the Central Valley to the Los Angeles Basin within 10 years.", "In late 2013 the project received several setbacks. A California state judge ruled that the state's approval to issue the bonds to fund the project had been made without complying with a requirement of state administrative law that evidence be placed in the record to support the decision, and that the CHSRA's funding plan does not satisfy certain of the conditions attached to use of Proposition 1A bond funds for the project. These conditions included a requirement that all environmental studies for an operable segment be completed, and all sources of funding for construction of an operable segment be identified, before a funding plan is approved and bond funding is made available.", "The initial operating segment identified by CHSRA is a 300-mile stretch from Merced south to the San Fernando Valley (a little north of Los Angeles). But the plan foresees completion of that segment by 2021, four years after the deadline for expending the federal funding already granted to the project. The plan assumes that CHSRA will receive roughly $20 billion in additional federal funds to build the initial operating segment, although Congress has not provided any additional funding for high speed rail grants since FY2010. CHSRA proposes to complete the first construction portion of the initial operating segment (130 miles) by 2017, and the remaining 170 miles by 2021 (see Table 6 ). ", "Also, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) issued a decision that complicates the path for the project. The STB had previously approved construction for a 65-mile portion of the first construction segment. CHSRA has issued a contract for 29 miles of the first construction portion, including five miles outside the 65-mile portion already approved by the STB. CHSRA asked STB to conditionally approve construction on the remainder of the first construction portion, pending future environmental clearances. STB declined to issue the exemption, meaning that environmental review will have to be completed before construction can begin on that five-mile stretch included in the initial construction contract."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Options for Building High Speed Rail", "paragraphs": ["There are two options for developing high speed rail service; the option chosen determines the level of high speed service that can be attained:", "upgrading existing track, signaling systems, and equipment (e.g., tilting trains) to enable trains to travel somewhat faster over the existing rail network, or building new rail lines for the exclusive use of passenger trains enabling trains to travel at much higher speeds than are possible over the existing rail network, which is shared with freight rail.", "The advantage of upgrading existing track is its lower cost; a 2007 estimate put the average cost of such upgrades at around $7 million per mile. In the 1990s Amtrak (and commuter railroads) spent around $2 billion\u2014an average of around $9 million per mile, in 2003 dollars\u2014to upgrade the 229-mile north end of the Northeast Corridor (connecting Boston to New York City), including electrifying the route and replacing a bridge. This reduced rail travel time between Boston and New York City from 4 hours to 3 hours and 24 minutes\u2014an increase in average speed over the route from 57 mph to 68 mph. However, track upgrades also have important limitations. One is that many aspects of the rail infrastructure, such as curves and at-grade road crossings, limit the potential speed improvements. Another is that almost all existing track is used for freight trains that operate at slower speeds than passenger trains. Freight traffic may constrain the speed of passenger trains, and FRA regulations limit train speeds on routes that handle both freight and passenger traffic. ", "Conversely, building new rail lines, including the train, the track, and the signal and communications network, makes much higher speeds possible. One limitation of that approach is the cost, which is estimated to average $35 million per mile, or more in densely populated areas or difficult terrain. In order to attain such high speeds, freight trains would have to be prohibited from using the track\u2014which also means that freight operators would not be contributing to the construction or maintenance costs. New lines can use either conventional steel wheel on steel rail technology or magnetic levitation (maglev), in which superconducting magnets levitate a train above a guide rail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conventional High Speed Rail", "paragraphs": ["With one minor exception, all current high speed rail systems use conventional steel wheel on steel rail technology. At speeds up to around 125 mph, these trains can be pulled by diesel-electric locomotives. For higher speeds, trains powered by externally supplied electricity become necessary. These trains' engines draw power from overhead wires (catenaries). This technology allows for lighter-weight trains, in part because they do not have to carry fuel. Because of their lighter weight, electric trains can stop and start more quickly and cause less wear on the track. These trains can operate at very high speeds: in 2007 a French electric-powered train on conventional tracks reached 357 mph. However, because of the greater costs and diminishing benefits of operating at extremely high speeds, the top operating speed of high speed trains in most countries is around 210 mph.", "There are two main reasons why such trains are not widely available in the United States. First, only a small portion of the U.S. rail network is electrified, so most passenger trains must use diesel-electric locomotives. Second, because passenger trains typically use the same tracks as freight trains (and neither generally uses the most advanced collision avoidance systems), federal regulations require that passenger trains have a variety of design features to protect passengers in the event of a train crash. This results in relatively heavy passenger trains, which are thus slower to get up to speed and take longer to stop."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Track", "paragraphs": ["To make very high speed operation possible, rail track must be substantially flat and straight, with shallow curves and gentle changes in elevation. As train speeds increase, the risk of crashes where roads cross the rail line (\"at-grade crossings\") increases, so safety dictates that high speed tracks not have any at-grade crossings. This is the standard to which new very high speed lines in other countries are usually built. The result is the rail equivalent of the Interstate Highway System, allowing trains to operate at high average speeds without risk from crossing traffic. ", "A high speed rail system using dedicated track can handle many trains at one time without compromising safety. For example, the Japanese high speed rail network, which began operation in 1964, now has trains running at speeds up to 200 mph, with as little as three minutes of headway (the time separating trains operating on the same track) during peak periods. In almost 50 years of operation, there has never been a fatality due to a train crash on the Japanese high speed network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Signal and Communications Networks", "paragraphs": ["The prevailing train control system on the U.S. rail network relies on dispatchers at central locations who track the location of trains and signal to train operators when it is safe to proceed onto a stretch of track. This system is somewhat analogous to the air traffic control system, in that the dispatchers can see the location of trains but cannot directly control those trains. Thus, when a train operator does not respond correctly to an operational signal, a collision may occur.", "Very high speed rail networks use electronic train control systems (often referred to as \"positive train control,\" or PTC). PTC uses communications systems, global positioning systems, on-board computers with digitized maps, and central control system computers to monitor and control train movements. This technology is intended to improve efficiency and safety through better communication and reducing the threat of human error in the operation of trains. Outside of the NEC, almost none of the nation's rail network is equipped with positive train control. However, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires that rail carriers implement positive train control by December 31, 2015, on main lines over which passengers or poison- or toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials are transported. Implementation is underway, though there are proposals to extend the deadline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Levitation (Maglev)", "paragraphs": ["Maglev train technology was developed in the United States in the 1960s. It uses electromagnets to suspend (levitate) the train above a guideway, as well as to propel the train. The lack of direct contact (and hence friction) between the train and the guideway allows maglev trains to go very fast. Maglev trains and tracks are expected to experience relatively little wear and tear and hence to have low maintenance costs, although there is not enough experience with maglev in commercial operations to verify this.", "Many maglev lines have been proposed, but the few that have been constructed, notably a 19-mile line completed in 2004 connecting a Shanghai subway station to Pudong International Airport, have been relatively short. As a consequence, the costs of constructing and maintaining an intercity maglev line are unclear. It is generally believed that such projects are very expensive, in part because the need for a relatively straight guideway may require costly land acquisition and tunneling. Japan and Germany have operated maglev test tracks since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively, but neither country has gone on to build the commercial maglev lines that were envisioned. Congress established a program to promote maglev in the United States in the 1990s, but none of the projects that received federal support have advanced beyond the planning stage. ", "Because conventional train technology is capable of speeds comparable to maglev technology, and the costs of maglev implementation are probably very high, there is little impetus to adopt maglev technology. Moreover, maglev trains could not operate over the existing rail network, but would require an entirely separate network. China reportedly built the Shanghai line in part to examine maglev technology as a candidate for high speed lines it planned; it subsequently chose conventional train technology for its high speed rail network.", "The Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) has announced that it will deal with capacity limitations on its high speed line between Tokyo and Osaka, the most heavily traveled intercity rail segment in the world, by building a maglev line roughly parallel to the existing line. The planned train would travel at 300 mph over the 175 miles between Tokyo and Nagoya and would eventually be extended to Osaka. Due in part to the geographic constraints\u2014as the line would pass through mountainous areas, as well as densely populated areas, about 80% of the track would be located on viaducts or in tunnels\u2014JR Central has estimated the cost of building the Tokyo-Nagoya segment at 5.1 trillion yen (around $60 billion), or a little less than $350 million per mile. The full line is estimated to cost 9 trillion yen (about $110 billion).

However, system costs are highly site- and project-specific. A leading determinant of cost is whether a new right-of-way is planned or if an existing railroad right-of-way is going to be improved. Another key cost determinant is speed. Generally, as speed increases, the cost of providing the infrastructure to attain that speed rises at an increasing rate. The highest speeds will require grade-separated corridors, limited curvature, and modest gradients so that passengers do not experience extreme discomfort at high speeds. As speed increases, the signaling and communications system must be more advanced (and costly) to ensure safe operations. Building a route through mountainous terrain is more costly than construction on level terrain, and building a route through an urban area is generally costlier than construction in a rural area.", "These drivers of cost are evident in the various projects to build higher speed or very high speed rail in the United States. For instance, a proposed route between Los Angeles (Anaheim) and Las Vegas would utilize maglev technology, with a top speed of 311 mph, at an estimated cost of nearly $12 billion, or $48 million per route mile. A proposed alternative would use conventional steel rail, with a top speed of 150 mph, and, rather than beginning in Anaheim, would start in Victorville, CA, which is beyond the mountains to the north of Los Angeles. The estimated cost of this alternative is nearly $4 billion or $22 million per route mile. Much of the decrease in estimated cost is due to not bringing the line through the mountains into the Los Angeles area, which in turn may lower its attractiveness to potential riders. ", "In contrast to these projects involving acquisition of new rights-of-way, a project to increase train speeds between Chicago and other Midwest cities would involve improvements to approximately 3,000 miles of existing track at an estimated cost of $7.7 billion, or about $2.5 million per route mile. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of six projects involving incremental track improvements found that per-mile costs ranged from $4.1 million to $11.4 million. The DOT Inspector General has estimated that reducing travel time between Washington, DC, and New York City and between New York City and Boston by a half hour would require corridor improvements totaling $14 billion (or about $31 million per route mile).", "Since the objective of building or improving a rail line is passenger mobility, rail project costs could be compared with the costs of alternative methods of increasing mobility, such as expanding a highway or an airport. The cost of highway or airport expansion is also highly project- and site-specific. Comparing costs on a per-mile basis is not as useful as comparing costs on a per passenger-mile basis (the cost of moving one passenger one mile) or comparing the reductions in total travel time across alternative modal projects. These measures incorporate the improvement in passenger throughput expected from the construction project. However, comparing costs and benefits of modal options in this manner is not common because of institutional and organizational obstacles. These include a federal DOT that is organized by modal segments, congressional authorizing committees organized by mode, earmarking of projects, prohibitions in state trust fund and federal trust fund financing, and industry advocacy that is largely organized by mode.", "In addition, there is evidence that transportation project costs are routinely underestimated. One study examined 258 transportation infrastructure projects around the world and found that in almost 90% of the cases costs were underestimated, that actual costs on average were 28% higher than estimated, and that rail projects in particular were the most severely underestimated, costing on average 45% more than estimated.", "Most U.S. railroad track is owned and maintained by private freight railroad companies whose trains operate more economically at slower speeds. Improving the quality of this track to allow for higher speed passenger trains could involve rebuilding track substructure, such as replacing the ballast, improving drainage, or replacing wood ties with concrete ties, as well as upgrading signaling and communications systems. Although the host freight railroads might gain some benefit from such improvements, they may be reluctant to fund them, as they may gain little advantage from being able to operate freight trains at higher speeds. ", "More importantly, because intercity passenger and freight trains, as well as commuter trains, share the track in many corridors where higher speed service is proposed, it will be necessary to increase capacity on these routes to avoid delays caused by interference from other trains. For example, Amtrak's on-time performance on the NEC, which has multiple tracks and on which Amtrak controls the dispatching, was around 86% in FY2013, but its on-time performance outside the NEC, where there is often only a single track and where dispatching is controlled by freight rail companies, was 82% for short-distance trains and 72% for long-distance trains. According to Amtrak, many delays are due to interference from freight trains, and to a lesser extent, commuter trains. The simplest way to increase capacity is to add sidings to allow slower trains to make way for faster trains to pass, but significant improvements in speed and reliability may require installing a second track with high-speed crossovers so trains can shift from one track to the other, a layout which more than doubles route capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Costs and Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Once a higher speed or very high speed infrastructure has been completed, operating costs can be a significant public expense if the train operator cannot generate sufficient revenue from passenger fares. Operating costs include labor, fuel or electric power, equipment and track maintenance, track access charges, and other costs that vary depending on the number of trains that are operated. In the United States, all intercity passenger operations except Amtrak's Acela service are subsidized, in the sense that federal and state governments supplement revenues from ticket sales, as these are insufficient to cover the costs of operating the trains plus a portion of general administrative expenses. Few if any passenger rail operations anywhere in the world generate sufficient revenue to cover all capital as well as operating costs.", "Some high speed rail project sponsors have estimated that their services would be able to operate without public subsidies once construction is complete. Additionally, some supporters of high speed rail projects have asserted that profit-maximizing private companies could operate rail services without subsidy, especially in corridors where air and highway congestion are extreme.", "The organizational structure of passenger rail is not conducive to a market environment in which competition among carriers exerts downward pressure on operating costs. The \"low-cost carrier\" phenomenon in the airline and intercity bus industries, in which multiple carriers compete with one another over the same infrastructure, is not practicable in the passenger rail industry.", "Airlines and bus lines operate using publicly owned infrastructure to which all carriers have access on similar terms. Most track suitable for passenger service in the United States, on the other hand, is controlled by railroads whose main business is operating freight trains rather than accommodating passenger operations. Indeed, under federal law freight railroads are not obligated to carry trains of passenger operators other than Amtrak. The freight railroads have little incentive to negotiate access charges favorable to potential passenger operators, especially where their trains would interfere with freight operations or would necessitate a higher level of track maintenance. This poses a considerable obstacle to state governments or private companies seeking to operate high-speed passenger trains in competition with Amtrak or on routes Amtrak does not serve.", "Operating costs aside, the other key determinant of whether high speed rail can be profitable without subsidies is fare revenue, which is dependent on ridership levels and how much riders would be willing to pay for the service. The cost-effectiveness of higher speed and very high speed rail depends on achieving high ridership levels. Estimates of the level of ridership needed to justify the cost of a high speed line similar to those in other countries range from 6 million to 9 million riders in the first year. To put that figure in context, Amtrak's current high speed service, the Acela, which began operating in 2000 in the most densely populated corridor in the United States, carried 3.3 million passengers in FY2013.", "Ridership, of course, will depend heavily on the fares charged. Most plans for very high speed systems are premised on their ability to attract business customers who currently travel by air, as these are the travelers most willing to pay high fares for premium service. Despite an airplane's speed advantage, HSR can be time-competitive with airplanes if distances between cities are less than about 400-500 miles, given that security screening and pre-boarding wait times generally are significantly longer for air travelers than they are for train riders. Amtrak has been competitive with the airlines between certain cities along the Northeast Corridor. It captures 77% of the air/rail market share between Washington, DC, and New York City and 54% of the air/rail market share between New York City and Boston. However, Amtrak only captures about 5% of the air/rail market share for trips from Washington, DC, to Boston, a distance of about 440 miles, which takes nearly seven hours even on the Acela.", "It is more difficult for rail to compete with automobile transportation. If a traveler needs to make multiple stops en route to or around the destination city, a car may be more convenient, especially if the destination city lacks an extensive mass transit system. Driving is likely to be less expensive than rail if two or more people are traveling together, since the added cost of each additional traveler is virtually zero for passenger cars, and if tolls and parking fees are low. People traveling for leisure or personal reasons are likely to be more price-sensitive than business travelers, and their willingness to use the train instead of a personal car may depend in good part on the availability of low-cost fares.", "High speed trains are not expected to compete well against intercity buses in many instances because bus travelers are more concerned about price than about travel time or comfort. Recent improvements in intercity bus service quality and frequency may reduce demand for high speed rail in some markets.", "Trains depend on population density to operate efficiently. To compete with the airlines, trains must depart frequently but they also must fill a large proportion of their seats to generate sufficient ticket revenue if they hope to cover their operating costs. Not only is the population size of a city important but also the concentration of economic activity in the central business district or otherwise near the train station(s). Although the nation as a whole is becoming more urbanized, trends show that employment is steadily decentralizing in almost all U.S. cities, which may raise questions about the viability of high speed rail as a transportation alternative for many business travelers. It is worth noting that tickets to or from New York City accounted for 30% of Amtrak's total ridership in 2012. New York has an extremely high population density, has a large concentration of businesses within walking distance of the train station, and is the only city in the country where more residents (55%) do not own an automobile than do.

DOT's Inspector General (IG) found much the same thing in a more recent analysis of HSR in the Northeast Corridor, estimating that reductions of one hour in rail trip times from Boston to New York and from New York to Washington would reduce automobile ridership along the NEC by less than 1%. Planners of a high speed rail link in Florida between Orlando and Tampa, a distance of about 84 miles, estimated that it would shift 11% of those driving between the two cities to the train, but because most of the traffic on the main highway linking the two cities, Interstate 4, is not travelling between Orlando and Tampa, the HSR project was estimated to reduce traffic on the busiest sections of I-4 by less than 2%.

Airlines might substitute smaller aircraft for larger ones, or replace flights to locations accessible by rail with flights to and from other locations. The net effects of such changes may be positive, as they may improve intercity transport links overall. However, it is possible that a smaller airport in a community served by HSR could suffer a disproportionate loss of its air service.

However, the House T&I proposal for high speed rail did not include a dedicated revenue source. Given that HSR projects can require 10 years or more to develop, funding projects in the face of changing political priorities will be difficult without a dedicated funding source. Otherwise, rail projects must compete with the programs for limited discretionary funding. Only about $15 billion of DOT's funding came from the general fund in FY2012, with the balance coming from motor fuel taxes dedicated to the highway trust fund.

This approach is not promising, as the highway trust fund's outlays for highway and transit currently exceed its revenues. Adding a tax onto the tickets of intercity rail passengers, just as the airport and airway trust fund is funded in part by a tax on airline tickets. In addition to raising the price of the rail travel it is meant to support, this proposal would produce relatively small amounts of revenue: a 10% tax on Amtrak tickets in FY2011 would have raised $189 million, assuming that ridership would not have declined as a result of the price increase. Dedicating a portion of the revenues from proposed greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs to a rail trust fund. To date, however, Congress has not established greenhouse gas control programs that would raise significant sums.

Once that line is built, and if it is considered successful, the desire for similar benefits in other parts of the country can result in political pressure to build additional lines, even if economic analysis indicates that these are unlikely to be as successful as the initial line.

The extent of those benefits would depend largely on the level of ridership, which is difficult to forecast accurately and is likely to be influenced by the adoption or rejection of policies that would encourage people to use high speed rail. Other countries with high speed rail systems support HSR\u00a0use through both incentives (e.g., widespread provision of a complementary mode, public transit) and disincentives (e.g., high road tolls and high taxes on motor fuel to make automobile use more expensive).

What is the desirable allocation of the costs of high speed rail development among federal, state, and local governments and the private sector? Congress specified that the $8 billion provided in ARRA would be provided without requiring any local matching funds, but the HSR development program authorized in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) provided that the federal share of grants under that program should not exceed 80%. Most highway construction receives an 80% federal match, but the federal share of most rail transit projects is less. How should federal funds be allocated among types of HSR? One or two successful very HSR projects might demonstrate HSR's potential and build public support, but they could also consume large amounts of funding. Incremental improvements to passenger routes in many parts of the country might bring better rail service to more people, but would probably not achieve the high density, very high speed operations generally associated with the concept of HSR. Which HSR projects should receive funding? In the HSR development program, Congress required that projects be part of a state rail plan or the national rail plan in order to receive funding. The FRA is currently developing a national rail plan, but high speed rail development grants have been awarded prior to the completion of the plan.
