Environmental and public health advocacy groups and 11 states had petitioned the agency, and subsequently filed suit in the D.C. Circuit alleging that EPA failed to perform its mandated duty to complete the review of the PM NAAQS within the statutory deadline. EPA has agreed to issue final revised PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012. EPA's review of the PM NAAQS has generated considerable debate and oversight in Congress.", "The June 2012 proposal would strengthen the existing (2006) annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for \"fine\" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (or PM2.5), lowering the allowable average concentration of PM2.5 in the air from the current level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), to a range of 12 to 13 \u00b5g/m.3 The annual PM2.5 NAAQS is set so as to address human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants. The existing 24-hour primary standard for PM2.5 that was reduced from 65 \u00b5g/m3 to 35 \u00b5g/m3 in 2006 would be retained, as would the existing standards for larger, but still inhalable \"coarse\" particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter or PM10. \"Secondary\" standards that provide protection against \"welfare\" (non-health) effects, such as ecological effects and material deterioration, would be identical to the primary standards the same as in 2006, but the June 2012 proposal included two options for a 24-hour PM2.5 standard to improve visibility.", "In developing the June 2012 proposal, EPA reviewed scientific studies available since the agency's previous review in 2006. EPA determined, and the independent scientific advisory committee mandated under the CAA (Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC) concurred, that evidence continues to show associations between particulates in ambient air and numerous significant health problems, including aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, non-fatal heart attacks, and premature death. Populations shown to be most at risk include children, older adults, and those with heart and lung disease, and those of lower socioeconomic status.", "EPA expects that the potential benefits of the proposed revisions would range from an estimated low of $88.0 million to a high of $5.9 billion dependent on the concentration level and other factors, and estimated costs would range from $2.9 million to $69.0 million. Some stakeholders and some Members express concerns that the cost impacts will be more significant than EPA estimated in those areas unable to comply with the new standards. EPA's establishment of or revisions to the PM NAAQS do not directly regulate emissions from specific sources, or compel installation of any pollution control equipment or measures, but indirectly could affect operations at industrial facilities and other sources throughout the United States.", "Final revised PM NAAQS will start a process that includes a determination of areas in each state that exceed the standard and must, therefore, reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it. Following the determination of \"nonattainment\" areas (primarily counties) based on multiple years of monitoring data and other factors submitted by the states, state and local governments must develop (or revise) State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining measures to attain the standard. These often involve promulgation of new regulations by states, leading to the issuance of revised air permits. The process typically takes several years. Based on statutory scheduling requirements, designation of areas as nonattainment for any revised PM NAAQS would not be determined until the end of 2014, and states would have until at least 2020 to achieve compliance."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator signed a proposal to strengthen the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) on June 14, 2012, intended to address potential health effects (including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality) associated with short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter. The date of the proposal was per a June 6, 2012, order issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in response to petitions filed by advocacy groups and 11 states. EPA's most recent statutorily required review and proposal has generated controversy and national debate among stakeholders, health and environmental advocacy groups, and states, as well as oversight in Congress, as did the previous changes leading up to the existing PM NAAQS promulgated October 2006, and those established in 1997.", "The proposed rule subsequently published in the Federal Register June 29, 2012, started a nine-week public comment period through August 31, 2012. EPA also held two public hearings for the proposal on July 17, 2012, in Philadelphia, PA, and July 19, 2012, in Sacramento, CA. Per the D.C. Circuit decision and as agreed to in a September 4, 2012, consent decree, EPA is to finalize its decision regarding the PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012.", "The June 2012 PM NAAQS proposal is the culmination of EPA's statutorily required review of the NAAQS under the Clean Air Act (CAA) based on studies available through mid-2009 and recommendations of EPA staff and a scientific advisory panel (Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC ) established by the CAA. The agency initiated the review not long after the 2006 promulgation of the PM NAAQS. EPA staff reassessed scientific studies considered in setting the 2006 PM NAAQS revisions, reviewed and analyzed extensive subsequent research, and considered public comments and recommendations of the CASAC. Based on the scientific evidence considered, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson signed the proposal that would tighten the current standard primarily by lowering the annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5 ). The proposal includes options for new secondary standards to address visibility impacts in urban areas associated with PM 2.5 , but would not modify the standards for inhalable coarse particles smaller than 10 microns or PM 10 . Because some farming and livestock practices contribute to particulate matter emissions, the agricultural community and some Members have maintained a particular interest in EPA's consideration of PM 10 and the potential impacts on agricultural operations.", "As per statutory scheduling requirements under the CAA, the final designation of areas (primarily counties) as nonattainment for any revised PM standards would not be determined until the end of 2014, and states would have until at least 2020 to achieve compliance. In its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying the proposed rule assessing the costs and benefits of proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS, EPA estimated that strengthening the PM 2. 5 annual standard would add further similar health benefits anticipated with the promulgation of the 2006 PM NAAQS. Others have suggested that potential health benefits of tightening the PM NAAQS might be higher than EPA's estimates. On the other hand, tighter standards could impose additional compliance requirements on communities, states, industry, and others, at what some stakeholders and Members contend will be a substantial economic cost. EPA expects that requirements and emission reductions associated with existing and recently promulgated federal regulations under the CAA will significantly allay impacts of complying with the proposed revised PM standards, and anticipates that virtually all counties will meet the standards as proposed in 2020.", "Several recent and pending EPA regulations implementing the various pollution control statutes enacted by Congress have garnered vigorous oversight during the 112 th Congress. Members have expressed concerns, in hearings, through bipartisan letters commenting on proposed regulations, and through introduced legislation that would delay, limit, or prevent certain EPA actions. Particular attention is being paid to the CAA, under which EPA has moved forward with the first federal controls on emissions of greenhouse gases and also addressed emissions of conventional pollutants from a number of industries. Because of health and cost implications, NAAQS decisions historically have been the source of significant concern to some in Congress. The evolution and development of the PM NAAQS, in particular, have been the subject of extensive oversight. During the 112 th Congress, some Members expressed concerns in hearings, letters to the administrator, and proposed legislation in anticipation of potential changes to the PM NAAQS, and the June 2012 proposal is expected to generate further oversight.", "This CRS report summarizes EPA's June 2012 proposed changes to the PM NAAQS and includes comparisons with previous (1997) and current (2006) promulgated and proposed standards. Key actions leading up to the June 2012 proposal, and potential issues and concerns associated with the proposal to strengthen the PM 2.5 annual standard, are also highlighted.

", "PM 2.5 can be emitted directly from vehicles, smokestacks, and fires but can also form in reactions in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors, including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organics occurring naturally or as emissions typically associated with gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, and from utility and other industrial processes. PM 10 (or coarse PM) is an indicator used in the NAAQS to provide protection from slightly larger (in the range of 2.5 to 10 microns or thoracic coarse particles), but still inhalable particles that penetrate into the trachea, bronchi, and deep lungs. These particles are generally associated with dust from paved and unpaved roads, certain industrial processes and agriculture, construction and demolition operations (including mining), and biomass burning. ", "Establishing NAAQS does not directly limit emissions; rather, it represents the EPA Administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an \" adequate margin of safety .\" Under Sections 108-109 of the CAA, Congress mandated that EPA set national ambient (outdoor) air quality standards for pollutants whose emissions \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health (primary standards) or welfare (secondary standards)\" and \"the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" The process for setting and revising NAAQS consists of the statutory steps incorporated in the CAA over a series of amendments. Several other steps have also been added by the EPA, by executive orders, and by subsequent regulatory reform enactments by the Congress. ", "Section 109(d)(1)) of the CAA requires EPA to review the criteria that serve as the basis for the NAAQS for each covered pollutant every five years, to either reaffirm or modify previously established NAAQS. EPA has revised the PM NAAQS three times, in 1987, 1997, and most recently, October 2006, to ensure that the standards continue to provide adequate protection for public health and welfare.", "A February 24, 2009, decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had remanded elements of EPA's decisions as promulgated in October 2006, in particular the decision not to tighten the primary annual NAAQS for PM 2.5 , to the agency for further consideration but did not vacate the revised standard nor set a specific timeline. The decision was in response to petitions filed in the D.C. Circuit by 13 states, industry, agriculture, business, and environmental and public health advocacy groups, challenging certain aspects of EPA's revisions for both PM 2.5 and PM 10 . The D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part with regard to the PM 2.5 annual standard and the secondary standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 (including visibility impairment), denying other challenges. ", "Concerned with delays in EPA's schedule for proposing revisions to the 2006 PM NAAQS, the American Lung Association and the National Parks Conservation Association, and nine states separately filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit in November 2011 urging the court to order EPA's immediate compliance with the February 2009 remand. Subsequently, in February 2012 the two organizations sued EPA in the D.C. Circuit for failing to fulfill their statutory duty to review the October 2006 PM NAAQS within five years, and a coalition of 11 states filed a similar suit with the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York. In response, the D.C. Circuit initially directed EPA to complete its review of the PM NAAQS by June 7, 2012, and following a motion filed by the agency, amended the deadline to June 14, 2012.", "Promulgation of revised PM NAAQS will initiate a series of statutorily required actions, starting with EPA/States coordinated effort to designate areas (counties or portions of counties) with respect to attainment or nonattainment of any new primary standards three years following the effective date of published final revisions. Within three years of EPA's final designations of areas, states are required to submit plans (state implementations plans or SIPs) outlining how they will achieve or maintain compliance with the revised primary PM NAAQS.

The current primary (health protection) PM NAAQS as revised in 2006 include an annual and a daily (24-hour) limit for PM 2.5 , but only a daily limit for PM 10 . To attain the PM 2.5 annual standard, the three-year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean PM 2.5 concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency. The 24-hour standards are a concentration-based percentile form, indicating the percent of the time that a monitoring station can exceed the standard. For instance, a 98 th percentile 24-hour standard indicates that a monitoring station can exceed the standard 2% of the time during the year.

Specifically, set a 24-hour averaging time of 30 or 28 deciviews (dv) based on a 90 th percentile form over three years.

The act also requires the establishment and role of an independent advisory committee (CASAC ) to review EPA's supporting scientific documents, and the timeline for completing specific actions. EPA administratively added the preparation of a \"staff paper\" that summarizes the criteria document and lays out policy options. In addition, Executive Order 12866 requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), although the economic impact analysis is essentially only for informational purposes and cannot be directly considered as part of the decision in determining the NAAQS.", "Beginning June 2007 with its general call for information, EPA initiated the current PM NAAQS review, which culminated in assessments of the scientific research and risk analyses, and ultimately the April 2011 publication of the staff's final Policy Assessment for the Review of the Particulate Matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (or PM Policy Assessment) . The staff paper presented the staff conclusions and recommendations on the elements of the PM standard based on evaluation of the policy implications of the scientific evidence contained in the criteria document and the results of quantitative analyses (e.g., air quality analyses, human health risk assessments, and visibility analyses) of that evidence.

The CASAC closure letter was an indication that the majority of the CASAC panel members had generally reached consensus that the criteria documents and the staff paper provided an adequate scientific basis for regulatory decision-making. The discontinuance of the closure letter was the subject of considerable debate, particularly within the science community. EPA revised certain aspects (not including reinstating the closure letter) of the CASAC review process most recently in May 2009.

Recognizing certain limitations of the data, a range of alternatives were presented for consideration by the Administrator for modifying the current PM NAAQS. These recommendations were the basis for the Administrator's decision, taking into account other factors including public comments received, for proposing to strengthen the annual PM 2.5 primary standard.

However, staff and CASAC placed considerable emphasis on continuing uncertainties and lack of sufficient data to initiate relevant quantitative risk assessment to support such modifications to the standard.

EPA published its final designations of 31 areas in 18 states, comprising 120 counties (89 counties and portions of 31 additional counties) for nonattainment of the revised 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard, on November 13, 2009. The designations, based on 2006 through 2008 air quality monitoring data, included a few counties that were designated nonattainment for PM 2.5 for the first time, but the majority of the counties identified overlapped with EPA's final nonattainment designations for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. It is important to note that most of the 1997 PM 2.5 nonattainment areas were only exceeding the annual standard; thus, tightening the 24-hour standard resulted in an increased number of areas being designated nonattainment based on exceedances of both the 24 - hour and the annual standard. The majority of the roughly 3,000 counties throughout the United States (including tribal lands) were designated attainment/unclassifiable, and are not required to impose additional emission control measures to reduce PM 2.5 .", "Based on anticipated reductions associated with several other existing national air pollution control regulations and programs (see discussion in \" National Regulations \" section), EPA predicted that only a few counties would not be in compliance with the proposed primary standards by 2020: two counties in California are projected to not meet the proposed annual standard of 13 \u00b5g/m; 3 an additional four counties in Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, and Montana would not meet the proposed option of 12 \u00b5g/m 3 for the annual standard.

The Clean Air Act requires that NAAQS be set solely on the basis of public health and welfare protection, while costs and feasibility are generally taken into account in implementation of the NAAQS (a process that is primarily a state responsibility). As discussed previously, in setting and revising the NAAQS, the CAA directs the EPA Administrator to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety . This language has been interpreted, both by the agency and by the courts, as requiring standards be based on a review of the health impacts, without consideration of the costs, technological feasibility, or other non-health criteria. ", "Nevertheless, coinciding with the PM NAAQS proposed rule in the June 29, 2012, Federal Register , EPA released a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) assessing the costs and benefits of setting the standard at the proposed and other alternative levels, to meet its obligations under Executive Order 12866 and in compliance with guidance from the White House Office of Management and Budget. EPA emphasized that the RIA is for informational purposes and that the proposed decisions regarding revisions to the PM NAAQS presented in the June 2012 proposed rulemaking are not based on consideration of the analyses in the RIA in any way. Table 2 below presents a range of EPA's estimated economic costs, monetized benefits, and net benefits (subtracting total costs from the monetized benefits) associated with achieving the June 2012 proposal, and other alternatives considered.", "As shown in the table, estimated benefits are expected to be at least 30 times greater than the costs of $69 million for the most stringent option included in the June 2012 proposal. EPA also notes that a full accounting of benefits would include additional environmental and societal benefits that were not quantified in the analysis. The basis for the benefits calculations are health and welfare impacts attributable to reductions in ambient concentration emissions of PM 2.5 resulting from a reasonable, but \"speculative,\" array of known state implementation emission control strategies selected by EPA for purposes of analysis. The analysis does not model the specific actions that each state will undertake or emerging technologies in implementing the alternative PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA notes that mortality co-benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized benefits (over 98%). ", "The EPA estimated total costs under partial and full attainment of several alternative PM standards. The engineering costs generally include the costs of purchasing, installing, and operating the referenced control technologies. The technologies and control strategies selected for analysis are illustrative of one way in which nonattainment areas could meet a revised standard. EPA anticipates that in actual SIPS, state and local governments will consider programs that are best suited for local conditions as there are various options for potential control programs that would bring areas into attainment with alternative standards. EPA includes a detailed discussion of the limitations and uncertainties associated with the benefits assumptions and analyses.", "While recognizing the need to adequately protect against potential health concerns associated with PM, some Members and stakeholders are also apprehensive that EPA has underestimated potential costs and are concerned with the potential monetary consequences associated given the current economic environment. In particular, some stakeholders question the validity of EPA's reliance on the associated impacts of other national regulations in reducing the potential burdens. Critics are concerned that this results in underestimating the number of areas (counties) likely to be affected in terms of their ability to attain the proposed alternative PM NAAQS and the expected associated costs of necessary measures that will be required to in the form of SIPs.

In general, business and industry opposed more stringent standards particularly in light of the current national and global economic environment; and public health and environmental advocacy groups advocated support for more stringent standards based on the continuing evidence of health effects from ongoing scientific research. As mentioned earlier, several states petitioned EPA, and subsequently filed suit in the D.C.

Just prior to EPA's release of the proposal, several Members urged the Administrator to include retaining the PM 2.5 standard as an option for consideration in the agency's proposal.", "During the second session of the 111 th and during the first session of the 112 th Congress, some Members raised concerns in letters to the EPA Administrator and during oversight hearings, about EPA's staff draft reports, and CASAC recommendations leading up to the June 2012 proposal, and the potential impacts that tightening the PM 10 NAAQS standards could have on the agricultural industry. Many Members encouraged EPA to retain the current PM 10 NAAQS standards.

In its assessment of the impacts of tightening the PM NAAQS as proposed, EPA expects few additional areas will be in nonattainment and require more stringent pollution controls to achieve compliance. Industry, some Members and some state representatives anticipate that the proposed tighter PM NAAQS will likely result in more areas classified as nonattainment and needing to implement new controls on particulate matter. Further, they are concerned that stricter standards may mean more costs for the transportation and industrial sectors, including utilities, refineries, and the trucking industry, impacted by particulate matter controls.

EPA's 1997 promulgation of standards for both coarse and fine particulate matter prompted critics to charge EPA with over-regulation and spurred environmental groups to claim that EPA had not gone far enough. Not only was the science behind the PM NAAQS challenged, but EPA was also accused of unconstitutional behavior. More than 100 plaintiffs sued to overturn the standard. Although EPA's decision to issue the standards was upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, for the most part, stakeholders on both sides of the issue continued to advocate their recommendations for more stringent and less stringent (in some cases no) PM standard. Several states and industry, agriculture, business, and environmental and public health advocacy groups petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, challenging certain aspects of EPA's revisions of the PM NAAQS as promulgated December 2006. A February 24, 2009, decision by the D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denying other challenges, and remanded the standards to EPA for further consideration. The court did not specifically vacate the 2006 PM NAAQS and implementation is currently underway.", "The final form of the current efforts to revise PM NAAQS may not be known for some time. EPA will likely receive considerable comments in response to the June 2012 proposal.
