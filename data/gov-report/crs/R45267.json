The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that U.S. agricultural exports reached nearly $139 billion in FY2017 ( Figure 1 ). To successfully ship agricultural products, exporters must conform to importer requirements. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the U.S. government authority tasked with regulating most animal and plant product exports. Export health certificates are commonly necessary for the export of horticultural products (e.g., fruits and vegetables) and livestock, which represent over one-third ($53 billion) of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2017 ( Figure 2 ). APHIS is also responsible for informing the international community of U.S. animal or plant disease outbreaks. ", "To meet the health standards required by U.S. trading partners, APHIS and other U.S. federal agencies negotiate \"export health certificates\" with each partner country ( Figure 3 ). Export health certificates are also part of broader agreements between the United States and its trading partners on the World Trade Organization's (WTO) established \"sanitary and phytosanitary\" (SPS) measures. These measures protect against diseases, pests, toxins, and other contaminants. APHIS technical personnel, often working with other federal agencies, negotiate with their foreign counterparts on SPS measures. APHIS maintains a public website with import requirements by product and country to assist U.S exporters. Without these certificates, shipments could be delayed or rejected. Neither APHIS nor any other U.S. agency enforces or requires the usage of export health certificates, but failure to obtain an importer-required specific certificate would likely lead to a rejected shipment by the importing country.", "This report discusses APHIS's role in export health certificate issuance to facilitate agricultural trade.

Certificate of Free Sale. The Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has jurisdiction over a wide range of food products.

Export Certificate of Wholesomeness . USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issues Export Certificates of Wholesomeness for meat, poultry, and egg products that are exported from the United States. These certificates verify that the accompanying products have been inspected by FSIS at official FSIS slaughter and processing establishments and approved cold storage facilities. 3. Export Verification (EV) Program. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) reviews and approves companies as eligible suppliers of certain products for export under the USDA EV Programs. The EV Program outlines the specified product requirements for individual countries that must be met through an approved Quality System Assessment Program. Only eligible suppliers may supply products for the applicable EV Program.

APHIS, in collaboration with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), is primarily responsible for resolving disputes that arise between U.S. exporters and importing countries over health-certificate-related issues. In FY2017, APHIS negotiated or renegotiated 110 export protocols for animal products involving 24 new markets, three expanded markets, and 83 retained markets. APHIS also negotiated 126 export protocols for live animals. In particular, export health certificate discussions among scientific authorities contributed to opening markets for beef to China, poultry to Korea, and potatoes to Japan in FY2017.", "Export health certificates and the process underlying them may help facilitate trade in certain animal health situations. For example, following an outbreak of particular cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), or \"bird flu,\" member countries of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are obligated to report particular such incidents to OIE. The HPAI-affected country is expected to alert the international community and follow the OIE's disease control guidelines. In addition, they would likely have an altered relationship with their trading partners concerning poultry and poultry product exports (including certain eggs) following notification of the outbreak. Typically, importers would either ban poultry imports from the affected country or ban poultry from certain regions from the country\u2014a negotiated \"regionalization agreement.\" In this situation, regionalization protocols in the agreement may facilitate exports by limiting the ban to a particular region. ", "Export health certificates may facilitate market-opening opportunities for U.S. exports, as in the case of U.S. pork exports to Argentina. Until 2017, the United States had for over 25 years neither access to export pork to Argentina nor a pork health certificate for Argentina because of animal health concerns Argentina cited in U.S. pork production. After Argentine food safety officials conducted an on-site verification of the U.S. meat inspection system in late 2017, the United States finalized a pork SPS agreement and export health certificate with Argentina.

The Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response portion of the APHIS budget is responsible for monitoring animal and plant health in the United States and throughout the world, representing roughly 85% of APHIS's budget. Most of the export health certificate activities are housed in this mission area.", "In February 2018, the Office of Management and Budget released the President's FY2019 proposed budget. The FY2019 APHIS proposed budget totaled $742 million, down 25% from FY2018 funding. This proposed reduction would affect all major area activities, particularly Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response. The President's FY2019 APHIS budget proposal for this line item is $623.6 million, a decrease of nearly $200 million from FY2018. This proposed budget reduction for FY2019 could affect APHIS's ability to issue health certificates for both exports and imports of agricultural products. Limiting APHIS's ability to issue export health certificates could negatively impact U.S. agricultural exports. Likewise, APHIS funding for this budget line item also supports APHIS's ability to enforce animal and/or plant health requirements that protect the United States against the unintended introduction of animal and/or plant pests and diseases. As such, a reduction in funding to support these APHIS activities could slow the agency's ability to respond to a disease or pest outbreak in the future while also negatively impacting trade. These APHIS activities also administer certain U.S. commitments to the WTO.

On May 24, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2976 with an increase of $19 million (+1.9%) year-over-year.", "Finally, as the United States has entered into, or is currently negotiating or renegotiating, certain regional and bilateral free trade agreements that address agricultural trade, APHIS's health certificates would be expected to be a component of any SPS chapter included as part of a free trade agreement or trade negotiation that includes agriculture. These SPS chapters adhere to WTO guidelines and generally include additional specific importer requirements. Each importing country is allowed to have different import requirements\u2014and some are stricter than others\u2014which sometimes result in \"non-tariff measures,\" as explained in the text box below. SPS requirements by individual countries can become the source of a trade dispute and may be used by some countries as a way to protect local markets, thereby discouraging U.S. exports.
