The economic and scientific potential of this technology, as well as certain regulatory concerns (such as 3D printing of firearms), have recently increased congressional interest.", "3D printers are used in a variety of industries\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as aerospace, medicine, and education\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as in nonspecific custom prototyping. Both private industry and the federal government have supported these applications of 3D printing. Support from the federal government has included basic and applied research funding from the National Science Foundation, as well as research and development funding from mission agencies such as the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. More broadly, federal support for additive manufacturing has been provided through the flagship institute of the Manufacturing USA program, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (also known as America Makes). This consortium of industry, university, and government seeks to \"[accelerate] the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies in the United States to increase domestic manufacturing competitiveness.\" In recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0094public and private\u00e2\u0080\u0094have been invested in 3D printing-related companies and 3D printing research and development.", "3D printers span a range of alternative capabilities, print with many different kinds of materials, and are capable of building products at a variety of scales. The price of a 3D printer varies with its capabilities; machines may cost from hundreds of dollars to millions of dollars.", "3D printing uses a fundamentally different process than most methods for traditional manufacturing. Much of modern manufacturing uses subtractive manufacturing processes, beginning with a block of material (e.g., a tube, a bar, or an ingot) and using a variety of tools to remove parts of the initial material to achieve a final design. 3D printers are additive, stacking up and fusing thin layer upon thin layer of a material (or materials) onto a blank platform to achieve a final design. This allows for flexibility and complexity in the manufacturing of 3D-printed items. Four primary properties of 3D printers stem from this unique additive construction method: reduced waste, capacity to create parts with high internal complexity, cost-effectiveness of small production runs, and ease of design modification.", "These four primary properties of 3D printers translate into several distinctive manufacturing impacts: potential reduction in discrete parts per product, potential reduction in manufacturing costs, improved prototyping abilities, potential reduction in part weight or improvement in part strength, potential reduction in inventory, mass customization, potential environmental efficiency, decentralized manufacturing, and low barriers to entry.", "Although these manufacturing impacts are particularly advantageous for some manufacturing activities, most experts say the current state of 3D printing tends to make the technology a poor fit for mass production of simple parts. For this reason, some have estimated that 3D printing may account for 5% to 10% of manufacturing in the long term.", "In general, 3D printing has been widely viewed as a driver for American economic development, national security, and combat readiness. At the same time, some have expressed concerns about potential adverse effects of this technology, such as its potential use in the manufacture of firearms or other contraband material by individual criminals, criminal organizations, or terrorists.", "3D printing technology is expected to mature substantially in the coming decades to allow the use of new materials, faster production speeds, and lower costs.

This material can be in the form of solid filament, pellets, liquid, or powder.", "Print head \u00e2\u0080\u0094The input material is deposited at the tip of the print head. This process can occur through a variety of methods, including pushing filament or pellets through a metal extruder, using a laser to melt powder, or using a light to solidify liquid.", "Build plate \u00e2\u0080\u0094The build plate is the base (flat surface) upon which the part is constructed. At the beginning of the 3D printing process, the print head is nearly touching the build plate. As more layers are added to the part, the distance between the print head and the build plate increases.", "Axes \u00e2\u0080\u0094The axes move the print head relative to the build plate. This enables the 3D printer to create a particular pattern for each new layer of material. The final part is made up of the patterns in each layer, stacked on top of each other.", "3D design file \u00e2\u0080\u0094The 3D printing process is governed by a digital 3D design file. This file provides instructions to the 3D printer that describe how to move the axes, which in turn move the position of the print head relative to the build plate.

Prices vary from several hundred dollars to millions of dollars. More specifically, 3D printers at the price range of $5,000 and below (known as consumer printers ) often are designed to print plastic parts. Several different plastics are available, each with different capabilities and costs. These materials include tough nylon plastics; flexible, rubber-like plastics; plastics reinforced with carbon fiber; dissolvable plastics; clear plastics; and decorative plastics with the appearance of wood or metal. Some 3D printers in this price range can also print using materials such as ceramic or chocolate.", "Structural metal-infused plastic, as opposed to decorative metal-infused plastic, also can be used in 3D printers at this price range. However, structural metal-infused 3D-printed parts require additional high-temperature post-processing to burn off the plastic. This process leaves an entirely metal product behind. The necessary high temperatures for post-processing can be attained using pottery kilns, sintering machines, or other specialized devices. Commercial services are available that offer high-temperature post-processing of metal-infused 3D-printed parts.", "3D printers at the price range of $5,000 and up (known as industrial printers) are able to use a wider variety of materials in an even greater variety of applications. These 3D printers can create structures that are larger, more detailed, or more reliable than structures created by consumer printers, or they can print in materials that are unavailable at lower price ranges. For example, medical biofabrication printers can print structures made of living cells. Metal 3D printers can create parts out of titanium, steel, and other metals, which may cost less than traditional subtractive machining processes.

In the early 2000s, the 3D printer market expanded into specialized industries, including medicine, dentistry, and jewelry. At the same time, new plastic printing materials were developed.", "The first decade of the 21 st century marked the expiration of several key 1980s 3D printing patents. In the same period, consumers gained access to improved web connectivity and user-friendly computer-aided design (CAD) tools. These factors contributed to the birth of the consumer 3D printing movement. Key developments in this movement included the formation of the open-source 3D printer community; the 2007 release of the first website for print-on-demand custom 3D prints (Shapeways); and the 2008 creation of the popular 3D printing file-sharing website Thingiverse.

Higher-end consumer printers gained advanced features that made them easier to use and maintain.", "Innovations in 3D design software and improvements in printer reliability contributed to the spread of consumer and industrial 3D printers in shared makerspaces, commercial establishments, libraries, and universities. 3D file sharing also became widespread, both for paid and free models. One 3D file website, Thingiverse, had more than 2 million active users in 2015. Transmission of 3D design files occurred not only through mainstream file-sharing sites such as Thingiverse, 3DShook, and Cults but also through anonymous channels, including internet torrents (a distributed, hard-to-trace online file-sharing method). At the same time, materials for consumer and industrial 3D printers grew more diverse and were sold by more companies, helping to reduce 3D printing costs.", "Print-on-demand services also expanded in this period, offering a wide variety of materials, including plastics, precious metals, and ceramics. These services allowed consumers to purchase a 3D-printed part made from their own 3D design file but fabricated by a third party.
