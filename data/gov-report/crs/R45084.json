The BCA also provided exceptions to those limits for a number of purposes. One such exception was a reiteration of a long-standing exception for funding designated as an emergency requirement. ", "The Budget Control Act of 1990 had previously established an adjustment to discretionary spending limits to accommodate spending that both the President and Congress designate as an emergency requirement. Prior to the enactment of the BCA in 2011, this adjustment was frequently used to provide funding for the disaster response and recovery. However, it was also used for a broad variety of other purposes, some instances of which sparked debate over whether the designated funding was truly for unanticipated \"emergency\" needs, stoking controversy in some quarters over the potential for abuse.", "The BCA also included a more specifically defined limited adjustment specifically for disaster relief, distinct from emergency funding. The BCA defined \"disaster relief\" as federal government assistance provided pursuant to a major disaster declared under the Stafford Act. Funding designated as disaster relief in future spending bills could be \"paid for\" by adjusting upward the discretionary spending caps. This allowable adjustment for disaster relief is limited, however, to an amount based on a modified 10-year rolling average of what has been spent by the federal government on relief efforts for major disasters.", "The allowable adjustment for disaster relief does not, however, act as a limit on federal appropriations for disaster assistance. When Congress provides more funding for disaster relief than can be covered by the disaster relief adjustment in a given fiscal year, as was the case for Hurricane Sandy and the 2017 disasters, the emergency designation may be used for such funding.

The BCA spending caps would not need to be adjusted for funding that is offset. In most cases between 1990 and 2017 FEMA's DRF generally has been given a priority status for prompt funding in times of need, without offsetting spending reductions. Disaster assistance from other agencies has at times been funded through shifting resources from one program to another through appropriations legislation, but such activity is relatively rare. The largest single occurrence of this was in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, when P.L. 104-134 rescinded $23.4 billion from the DRF and subsequently appropriated a similar amount to other agencies to meet disaster response and recovery needs. ", "The question of offsets was salient in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Beginning in November 2012 there were calls for supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, as well as calls for offsets to pay for them. On December 7, 2012, the Obama Administration requested $60.4 billion in supplemental appropriations in connection with Hurricane Sandy, including $11.5 billion for the DRF. The preamble to the request specifically opposed offsetting the cost of the legislation, and although amendments to offset the cost of the legislation were considered in the House and Senate, they did not become law.", "During Senate debate on a Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations bill, a point of order was raised against the emergency designation for $3.4 billion in Army Corps of Engineers Construction appropriation for disaster mitigation projects. This point of order was sustained, eliminating the emergency designation for that particular appropriation. This meant that the $3.4 billion for the mitigation projects would count against the discretionary spending limits imposed by the BCA, limiting the amount that could be provided for other discretionary appropriations. At the time, some observers critical of the move considered this as setting a precedent by effectively requiring an offset for disaster assistance. Others considered this as including part of the cost of disaster preparedness (as opposed to disaster relief) within the discretionary budget.", "All three of the Trump Administration's supplemental appropriations requests have sought an emergency designation for the funding that would be provided in the legislation. However, unlike the Trump Administration's first two requests for supplemental disaster relief funding, the November 2017 request sought to offset some of the additional spending as well, suggesting $14.8 billion in rescissions and spending cuts and $44.4 billion in savings from extending the nondefense discretionary spending limits for two additional years. Many of the rescissions and spending cuts had already been proposed in the Administration's FY2018 budget request.

In addition, when supplemental spending is designated as an emergency requirement (as is typically the case with disaster relief), it is often considered outside the constraints of a single subcommittee's suballocation. The scope, purpose, and size of a supplemental appropriations measure is instead typically driven by an event or events, the unfunded needs such events generate, and the associated political support for considering and enacting the legislation. In the case of disaster relief supplemental appropriations measures, these conductors may include a single unanticipated catastrophic event, a series of events over time, events occurring as the legislation is being developed and considered, or a combination of all three.", "Although the colloquial naming practice of recent years has associated supplemental appropriations legislation with a particular event or problem that has drawn public attention, it is rare to have a supplemental appropriations bill focus on a single event to the exclusion of all other purposes.", "At times, \"controlling language\" has been included in supplemental appropriations measures to clarify the intent of a specific appropriation, more often in the case of accounts that are not usually for disaster-related activities.

This measure included a range of forms of controlling language, the most common being \"for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\" Other controlling language of varying specificity targeted various subsets of the disaster-related needs across the United States, including the following:", "Natural disasters; Natural disasters occurring in 2017; Damage reduction in flood and storm damage in states with more than one flood-related major disaster in calendar years 2014-2017; Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and 2017 wildfires; Hurricanes occurring in 2017; Hurricane Harvey; Hurricanes Irma and Maria; Major disasters; and Oversight of funds provided in the measure.", "Such a range of overlaying specific intentions of controlling language is distinct from the unified controlling language from P.L. 113-2 . However, in both cases, because in most cases the language does not direct funding with a high degree of specificity, and much of the resources are for programs that allocate resources to state governments outside the legislative process, it is not possible to determine exact amounts provided for individual jurisdictions or incidents solely on the basis of the legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disaster Relief Appropriations Without Controlling Language", "paragraphs": ["These appropriations measures continue a pattern of applying controlling language to appropriations that do not on a regular basis provide disaster relief.

GAO noted in the report that", "At least 5 federal departments and agencies reported that some disaster assistance programs or activities are not separately tracked because spending related to these activities is generally subsumed by a department's general operating budget or mission-related costs. For example, U.S. Coast Guard officials stated that most of the agency's disaster-related costs are associated with maintaining a constant state of readiness to immediately respond to disaster and emergency incidents, which is funded from the U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue appropriation and is not separately tracked. Similarly, the Army has deployed personnel in anticipation of a possible disaster event, even when FEMA has not requested the support. If a disaster does not occur or the activity does not result in a FEMA mission assignment, the Army will not be reimbursed for prepositioning personnel or assets in anticipation of an event and therefore may categorize the expenditure as training in the event of a disaster. Another 4 federal departments and agencies reported that obligations and expenditures specific to disaster assistance activities are not tracked or cannot be reliably estimated because there is no requirement for state or other recipients of the financial support to indicate whether or how much of the funding or assistance is used for disasters.", "Placing consistent reporting requirements on agencies providing assistance through disaster-applicable programs would be one way to obtain a clearer picture of precisely how much the federal government is spending on disaster relief and recovery. Such reporting requirements could include pass-through requirements to state and local governments that receive the funds to provide contract and subcontract data to the providing federal agency. This could help inform budgeting decisions, and determine if a particular program is providing fewer resources than anticipated to its nondisaster missions.
