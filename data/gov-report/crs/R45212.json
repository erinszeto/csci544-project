AWIA 2018 would have amended the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to authorize special terms for loan assistance provided to state Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund finance authorities.

In the Senate, deliberations also focused on a range of drinking water and water quality issues facing communities and rural areas.

For example, USACE and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have certain responsibilities related to national programs for dam and levee safety. Both WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 would have extended beyond FY2019 the authorization of appropriations for a federal levee safety initiative and a national dam safety program; WRDA 2018 would have extended the authorizations of appropriations through FY2023, and AWIA 2018 would have extended them through FY2021.

WRDA 2018 focused on USACE water resource projects and programs and dam and levee safety program authorities; although the majority of AWIA 2018's titles and provisions also related to the USACE's water resource projects, numerous provisions of AWIA 2018 were not directly related to USACE water resource activities. AWIA 2018 included provisions addressing a range of other topics, including EPA administered water programs and regulatory authorities, and water-related activities and other authorities of the Department of the Interior and other agencies.

", "In addition, AWIA 2018 would have addressed an array of water-related programs and activities specific to tribes; most of these provisions were in Subtitle I of Title III. They included provisions related to Indian dam safety and irrigation authorities and USACE housing assistance related to certain dam construction in the Pacific Northwest. A few provisions were in other titles of AWIA 2018; for example, Section 1040 would have required that nonfederal interests for a water resource development study or project be provided \"the opportunity to participate in all consultations with Federal and State agencies and Indian tribes required by Federal law.\" WRDA 2018 had fewer provisions affecting tribes than AWIA 2018, and they directly related to USACE activities.

This backlog also reflects the difference between federal funding appropriated for these projects and the rate of project authorization. Among the issues that shaped the deliberation of WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 were the extent to which the legislation addresses the delivery of water resource projects and the legislation's effect on federal spending. ", "Congress has, particularly in WRRDA 2014 and WIIN, provided opportunities for nonfederal entities to have more prominent roles in the delivery and funding of projects, while maintaining the division of costs and responsibilities between the federal government and nonfederal project sponsors. Nonfederal entities have been using these authorities to conduct work on studies and projects and to receive federal credit or be eligible for reimbursement for this work. WRRDA 2014 also provided for new or expanded authorities for novel financing of water resource projects, including authorities for piloting public-private partnerships (P3) and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) credit assistance program.

", "Although President Trump (as well as previous Presidents) and many Members of Congress have expressed interest in improving the nation's infrastructure, including its water resource infrastructure, balancing the potential benefits of such improvements and concerns about increased federal expenditures poses an ongoing challenge. Cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have been part of the deliberations about previous water authorization bills and have influenced which provisions are included in enacted legislation. On June 4, 2018, CBO released a cost estimate on H.R. 8 as reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; on June 28, 2018, CBO released a cost estimate for S. 2800 , as reported; and on July 10, 2018, CBO released an estimate of the direct spending and revenue effects for the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 8 (as posted on the Senate EPW website on July 9, 2018)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USACE Topics Related to WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 Deliberations", "paragraphs": ["Provisions in WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 would have addressed the following selected broad USACE topics:", "information dissemination and public input; USACE permissions and permits for nonfederal activities; studies of USACE structure and efficiency; budget processes for USACE; nature-based alternatives and projects; continuing authorities programs; project and study deauthorization; independent peer review; innovative financing for water resource projects; permitting of nonfederal water storage; and pricing of storage for domestic, municipal, and industrial water supply.", " Table 3 discusses each of these topics. Although both WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 included provisions related to USACE structure and efficiency, neither proposed to shift USACE civil works responsibilities out of the Department of Defense.

Title V would have removed WIFIA's designation as a pilot program and added a new section to WIFIA regarding loans to state CWSRF and DWSRF finance authorities. Although state SRF financing authorities are currently eligible to receive WIFIA assistance, these provisions would have authorized EPA to provide secured loans at subsidized interest rates for states meeting certain conditions. Unlike other WIFIA assistance, this section also would have allowed the use of federal assistance to support 100% of project costs, and it would have waived application fees.
