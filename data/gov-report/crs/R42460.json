EPCA specifically authorizes the President to draw down the SPR upon a finding that there is a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The meaning of a \"severe energy supply interruption\" has, over time, been controversial. The authors of EPCA intended the SPR only to ameliorate discernible physical shortages of crude oil. Historically, increasing crude oil prices typically signal market concerns for supply availability. However, Congress deliberately kept price trigger considerations out of the President's SPR drawdown authority because of the question about what price level should trigger a drawdown, and the concern that a price threshold could influence market behavior and industry inventory practices. As a member of the International Energy Agency\u2014a coalition of 28 countries\u2014the United States agrees to support energy supply security through energy policy cooperation, commit to maintaining emergency reserves equal to 90 days of net petroleum oil imports, develop programs for demand restraint in the event of emergencies, and participate in allocation of oil deliveries among the signatory nations to balance a shortage.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) manages the SPR, which is comprised of 62 underground storage caverns that were solution-mined from naturally occurring salt domes located at four sites in Texas and Louisiana. The 2005 Energy Policy Act directed SPR expansion to its authorized capacity of 1 billion barrels, but the SPR's physical expansion has not proceeded beyond 727 million barrels. The SPR's maximum drawdown capability is 4.4 million barrels per day, based on the capacity of the pipelines and marine terminals that serve it. Legislation restricts SPR sales to no more than 30 million barrels over a 60-day period for anything less than a severe energy supply interruption.", "Congress initially appropriated funds to fill the SPR through crude oil purchases, but ended that practice in 1994. In 2000, the Department of Energy began acquiring oil to fill the SPR through the royalty-in-kind (RIK) program. In lieu of paying cash royalties on Gulf of Mexico leases, producers diverted a portion of their production volume to the SPR. The Secretary of the Interior administratively terminated the RIK program in 2009.", "The DOE has conducted sales and loans of crude oil from the SPR for several different reasons. The 1990 Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments expanded SPR drawdown authority to include responding to short-term supply interruptions stemming from situations internal to the United States. U.S. Presidents have authorized emergency sales of SPR crude to meet IEA obligations during the 1990 Persian Gulf War, in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and after a prolonged disruption of Libyan crude in 2011. In addition to these emergency sales, the Department of Energy has released oil, from time-to-time, to test the SPR system and make loans to help refiners bridge temporary supply disruptions, and has sold oil at the direction of Congress to generate revenue for budget deficit reduction.", "The 30.64 million barrel SPR sale in 2011 reduced the SPR's inventory from 726.6 million barrels to 695.9 million barrels. The SPR currently holds the equivalent of 139 days of import protection (based on 2016 data of 4.871 million barrels per day of net petroleum imports)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The changing role of the United States in world petroleum markets has driven a reassessment of the size of, and perhaps even need for, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Over the past several years, LTO, originally sold at a discount and shipped to U.S. refineries by rail, pipeline, barges, and trucks, has caused U.S. net imports of crude oil to decline while increasing U.S. exports of refined products. In addition, prohibitions on U.S. exports of crude oil have been lifted, resulting in increased exports.", "A majority of U.S. refineries (some 115) were originally designed to process primarily heavy crude oils. Moreover, these refineries account for roughly 75% of U.S. refining capacity. Should the prospect of releasing SPR oil arise, the relevant question may be whether to sell heavy or light oil as much as the quantity of oil that should be released to the market. For example, in 2011, President Obama ordered a sale of 30 million barrels of light sweet crude oil to offset a curtailment in Libya's production when NATO forces intervened militarily in that country's internal conflict. The oil released from the SPR was thought to be a close substitute of curtailed Libyan supplies. As expected, the oil sale had short-term influence on global crude oil prices, but a limited (if any) influence on long-term prices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background: Creating the SPR", "paragraphs": ["From the mid-1970s through the present day, the United States has had to absorb a number of significant spikes in the price of crude oil and petroleum products. Whether driven by disruptions in the physical supply of crude or refined fuels, unexpected demand growth, or by uncertainties owing to international conflicts and instabilities, these price increases have had consequences for the U.S. economy. Elevated petroleum prices affect the balance of trade by increasing the value of oil imports and siphoning away disposable income that might support local economies, investment, or savings.", "The SPR came about as a result of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. In reaction to the United States' support for Israel, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) imposed an oil embargo on the United States, the Netherlands, and Canada, and reduced production. While some Arab crude did reach the United States, the price of imported crude oil rose from roughly $4/barrel (bbl) during the last quarter of 1973 to an average price of $12.50/bbl in 1974. In addition, local spot shortages of gasoline created a shortage mentality in U.S. markets.", "In response to the 1973 oil embargo, Congress created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve of up to 1 billion barrels in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975. The SPR was meant to contain enough crude oil to replace net imports for 90 days, with a requirement initially to store 150 million barrels. In May 1978, Congress authorized expansion of the SPR's physical capacity to 750 million barrels, and in 2005 directed further expansion to the authorized size of 1 billion barrels. The George W. Bush Administration unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Congress of the need to expand the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels.", "Congress intended the SPR to help prevent a repetition of the economic disruption that the 1973 Arab oil embargo had caused. While no amount of strategic stocks can insulate an oil-consuming nation from paying the market price for oil in a supply emergency, the availability of strategic stocks can help mitigate the magnitude of the market's reaction to a crisis. One of the original perceptions of a strategic stockpile's value was that it would discourage the use of oil as a political weapon. OAPEC intended to create a physical supply disruption with the embargo. Congress's motivation in creating the SPR focused especially on a deliberate and dramatic physical oil supply disruption and on mitigating the economic effects of a shortage stemming from international events. In the event of a supply interruption, proponents reasoned that introducing oil into the U.S. market from the SPR would offset the lost supply and in doing so help calm markets, mitigate sharp price spikes, and reduce economic disruptions (i.e., gross domestic product loss). The holding of crude oil rather than petroleum products was done because then, as now, the United States had sufficient domestic refining capacity to meet domestic demand. As a result, potential oil market disruptions would most likely affect the United States through the disruption of crude oil, and not petroleum product, supplies. The SPR could also buy time for the crisis to sort itself out or for diplomacy to seek some resolution before a potentially severe oil shortage escalated the crisis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Energy Agency Obligation", "paragraphs": ["The OAPEC oil embargo also fostered the establishment of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to develop plans and measures for emergency responses to energy crises. Strategic stock holdings are one of the policies included in the agency's International Energy Program (IEP). IEA member countries, including the United States, are committed to maintaining oil stocks (inventories) equivalent to 90 days of their prior year's net imports, developing programs for demand restraint in the event of emergencies, and agreeing to participate in allocation of oil deliveries to balance a shortage among IEA members. In 2011, the United States participated in a coordinated IEA drawdown in response to the shutdown of Libyan oil exports. (See below.) At its current inventory of about 691 million barrels, the SPR provides the United States 139 days of net import protection and surpasses the 90-day IEA obligation. At the full drawdown rate, the SPR can deliver 4.4 MMb/d of crude oil for 90 days, dropping to a rate of 3.8 MMb/d for an additional 30 days, and dropping further in drawdown rate for up to 180 days as stocks deplete. These measures of days of protection assume a total curtailment of oil supply to importing nations, a scenario that is highly unlikely. This would be especially true for the United States, given that Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela are currently the nation's major foreign sources for imported crude oil.", "Some IEA member nations require a certain level of stock holding by the private sector or by both the public and private sectors.

The cavern passed all integrity tests and remains out of any immediate danger of leaking, however. To limit any risk, DOE reduced the oil stored in Cavern 20 from 7.5 million barrels to 3.2 million barrels by using only the upper portion of the cavern. DOE temporarily stored Cavern 20's oil in the Big Hill and West Hackberry caverns. Instead of physically expanding the caverns, additional storage space came from displacing the brine cushion at the bottom of the two caverns. The brine cushion helps counteract naturally occurring cavern creep that results from the salt dome's geological deformation.

While RIK avoids the necessity of making outlays for purchasing oil, it also meant a loss of revenues in settling royalties in wet barrels rather than in cash payments to the U.S. Treasury. DOI worked out final details during late 1999 and 2001. The RIK program was used to transfer oil to the SPR to replace oil sold in the mid-1990s for deficit reduction purposes.

While agreeing that a sale of slightly more than 1% of SPR oil would not cripple U.S. emergency preparedness, some in Congress vigorously opposed the idea, in part, because it might establish a precedent that would bring about additional sales of SPR oil for purely budgetary reasons, as did indeed occur. There were three sales of SPR oil during FY1996. The first was to pay for the decommissioning of the Weeks Island site. The second was for reducing the federal budget deficit, and the third was to offset FY1997 appropriations. The total of 28.1 million barrels sold raised revenues of $544.7 million.

Some might argue that it would be unwise under any scenario for the United States to draw down its strategic stocks while other nations continue to hold theirs at current levels. Additionally, it is always possible that producing nations will reduce production to offset any SPR oil delivered into the market. In 2017, some might argue that the market is already well-supplied and that short-term supply concerns are not affecting prices, but market conditions and current and anticipated geopolitical events are affecting prices. Others argue that the oil commodity futures market is behind speculative bidding that has driven prices.", "Some have perceived the SPR as a defensive policy tool against high oil prices. If an SPR release has no discernible impact on oil prices, it is possible that the SPR will lose some of whatever psychological advantage it exercises on prices when left as an untapped option."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Refining Capacity vs. Crude Supply", "paragraphs": ["While the number of U.S. refineries that process crude oil into fuels has decreased over the last decade, refining capacity has increased somewhat. In 2016, the EIA reported 141 refineries operating with over 18 million barrels per day in capacity (this includes three refinery complexes each made up of two formerly independent refineries). Some 55 refineries have coking processes for converting petroleum resid to higher value products. The Gulf Coast region (Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3) makes up nearly 45% of the U.S. refining capacity, with 57 refineries processing more than 9.0 million barrels per day. The region also has the highest concentration of coking refineries. ", "Over the last 25 years, the API gravity of imported crude oils had been decreasing, while average sulfur content had been increasing. API gravity, a measure developed by the American Petroleum Institute, expresses the \"lightness\" or \"heaviness\" of crude oils on an inverted scale. With a diminishing supply of light, sweet (low sulfur) crude oil until relatively recently, U.S. refineries had to add coking capacity to convert lower-priced heavier, sour crude oils to high-value products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. More recently the problem has become how to effectively integrate growing production of LTO into the refinery input stream.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) observed in 2006 that 40% of the crude oil refined by U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, and that the proportion of stored crude oil grades was not as compatible as it could be with refineries that had been moving towards heavier grades of crude oils. Based on a 2005 SPR crude oil compatibility study, DOE agreed that the SPR could store a small percentage of heavy crude to satisfy the short-term needs of a few refineries in the event of a supply disruption. However, DOE argued, the current mix of crudes was compatible for use in the majority of refineries, and suggested considering the addition of heavy crude for any future expansion of the SPR. ", "Refineries that process heavy oil cannot, in general, operate at normal capacity if they run lighter oils. Refiners reported to the GAO that running lighter crude in units designed to handle heavy crudes could impose as much as an 11% penalty in gasoline production and 35% in diesel production. The agency reported that other refiners indicated that they might have to shut down some of their units. The types of oil currently stored in the SPR would not be fully compatible with 36 of the 74 refineries considered vulnerable to supply disruptions. (A majority of the refineries that have pipeline access to the SPR are located in the Gulf Coast region and the Midwest region.) GAO cited a DOE estimate that U.S. refining throughput would decrease by 735,000 barrels per day (or 5% of total U.S. refining capacity) if the 36 refineries had to use SPR oil\u2014a substantial reduction in the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially if the disruption involved heavy oil.", "In response to the 2006 GAO report, DOE agreed to consider storing heavy crudes if an opportunity were to occur through expansion. However, the expansion plans were cancelled in 2011. In addition, since 2006, the SPR updated its crude compatibility study and concluded in its 2010 report that storing heavy crude in the SPR would not provide a net benefit in the event of a supply disruption.", "As of late, however, light sweet crude production has increased in the United States. Unconventional resources such as the Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford shales are producing crude oils comparable to West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for light sweet crude oil. Producers have also returned to the Texas Permian Basin, the historic source of WTI. The increasing supply of lower-priced light sweet crude oil has begun to edge out heavier crude oils in supplying U.S. refineries. Some refineries are bypassing their coking units to run the lighter crudes given the economic advantage that these lower-priced crudes offer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gasoline Price Increases", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, increases in the price of gasoline have been tied to calls for the release of reserves from the SPR. For example, over the first two months of 2012, retail gasoline prices increased by over 15%. The price of gasoline rose from an average of $3.21 per gallon in late December 2011 to $3.64 in late February. Prices continued to go up, rising to a U.S. average of $3.92 per gallon as of March 26. With these higher prices came calls for, and against, the release of crude oil from the SPR as a way to control price increases. ", "Although there is a general recognition that a release from the SPR would likely only provide temporary relief from rising prices, some view it as a signal to the market that a continuing spiral of prices would be met by resolve and policy action by the United States.", "The judgment that a release of crude oil from the SPR provides only temporary relief from rising prices seems well founded. On June 23, 2011, when gasoline prices were at $3.60 a gallon, President Obama announced a 30 million barrel release from the SPR under IEA obligation. The price of gasoline declined by about 2% over the next two weeks following the SPR release announcement, but by July 8, 2011, the price had again reached $3.61 per gallon, approximately the same level as before the release. Gasoline prices continued to rise through the first week of August, before declining later that month. Gasoline prices averaged about $3.60 per gallon in August 2011, declining to $3.40 per gallon in October and $3.21 per gallon in December. The gasoline price reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 were likely related to the reductions in crude oil prices between August and October 2011, in light of the lag between acquiring title to crude oil and the oil becoming available as retail gasoline, as well as refineries switching production from summer to winter grade gasoline.", "Crude oil prices also responded immediately to the release of oil from the SPR. The price of oil was $94.96 per barrel on June 22, 2011. On June 23, the day President Obama announced the SPR release, the price fell to $90.70 per barrel. By June 30, 2011, the price had risen to $95.73 per barrel, exceeding the price before the announcement. The initial market response to the SPR release lasted about one week. However, the announcement of the SPR release promised to deliver the oil to market by the end of August. The price of oil began to decline in August 2011 and generally declined during August and September, until reaching $75.40 per barrel on October 4, 2011. Thereafter, prices began to rise, exceeding $100 per barrel later in the year.", "The gasoline price increases of 2012, like virtually all previous price increases, resulted from an increase in the price of crude oil. Crude oil price increases generally result from actual or anticipated market tightening, that is, an increase in demand, a reduction in supply, or both. For example, many viewed the price increases of 2008 as related to the rapid expansion of petroleum demand in China, India, and other emerging markets. In 2011, the price increases were thought to be largely attributable to the loss of Libyan production during the revolution in that country. In 2012, although there were some reductions in supply due to instability in South Sudan, Yemen, and other areas, the primary driver of higher prices seem to be tensions with Iran and related policy responses by both sides in the controversy over Iranian nuclear capability.", "This environment, where current supplies are uninterrupted but speculation concerning future availability is active, may appear to some observers to be a situation that a release from the SPR would do little to mitigate. For example, if Iranian military action succeeded in blocking the Strait of Hormuz, it would prevent over 17 million barrels per day of crude oil from reaching the market. This quantity is almost four times the size of the maximum drawdown capability of the\u00a0SPR, if acting alone. However, an event of such size would almost certainly trigger an international response and a coordinated release of crude oil and products from the United States as well as the 27 other IEA member countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Future of U.S. Imports of Crude Oil", "paragraphs": ["The ability of the SPR to supplement the domestic U.S. supply of crude oil and effectively replace imports depends on the size of the reserve as well as its drawdown capabilities. Its effectiveness also depends on the volume of U.S. imports and the rate of U.S. consumption.", "Crude oil imports are the difference between U.S. demand and domestic production. If either demand falls, or domestic production rises, the need for imports declines. Because of a number of factors, some temporary, including the recession, high prices, and conservation, U.S. consumption of petroleum products has declined since 2005 by about 9.5%. This decline in consumption has reduced the demand for crude oil. Over the same period, U.S. production of crude oil increased from 5.18 million b/d to 5.67 million b/d, an increase of 9.5%. The combination of falling consumption and increasing production has reduced the share of imports in total consumption from 49% in 2005 to about 25% in 2016. In addition, Canada increasingly provides the United States with crude oil imports, and arguably represents a secure source of supply.", "If recent trends continue, the United States will rely less on crude oil imports. Consequently, the SPR, even if its capacity and contents remain fixed, may be better able to meet U.S. requirements in times of supply shortage on the world market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of the SPR as a Funding Instrument", "paragraphs": ["Since 2015, several laws were passed by the 114 th Congress which required the sale of oil from the SPR, with the proceeds to be used largely for program funding. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-74 ) authorized the sale of 58 million barrels of oil from the SPR over the period FY2017 through 2025. In addition to sales revenues to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury, $2 billion is to be used to modernize and maintain SPR facilities. The 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-256 ) authorizes the sale of 25 million barrels of SPR oil from FY2017 through FY2019 for a variety of health-related uses. The Fixing American Surface Transportation Act ( P.L. 114-94 ) authorized the sale of 66 million barrels of SPR oil from FY2023 through FY2015 to supplement highway and transit programs.", "Because the SPR sales authorized by this legislation are specified in millions of barrels, it does not guarantee a value of revenue for program funding. The price of oil can change rapidly, yielding potentially large swings in sale proceeds. ", "In total, this legislation will reduce the inventory of the SPR by some 149 million barrels by 2025, a reduction of about 21%. All of this legislation includes restrictions to prevent a fall in SPR balances below the 90-day net import coverage level consistent with U.S. IEA obligations. The SPR balance consistent with the 90-day net import coverage value could change for a variety of reasons. Factors that could lead to reduced SPR inventories include reduced U.S. petroleum imports, which itself could be linked to increased U.S. petroleum production, or reduced consumption, or increased petroleum exports. If these factors were reversed, the required SPR balance would increase. While it is likely the petroleum position of the United States will remain favorable and might well improve, rapid changes and volatility have characterized oil markets in the past.
