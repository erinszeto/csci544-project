It also provides examples of how the Senate uses these alternative procedures and actions to facilitate consideration and passage of some bills and joint resolutions.", "Provisions of Senate Rule XIV and the practice of unanimous consent allow the Senate to bypass a measure's referral to committee, whether that measure might be major or noncontroversial. Rule XIV requires measures to be read twice before referral to committee. By objecting after the second reading of a measure to any further proceeding on it, a Senator, normally the majority leader, acting on his own initiative or at the request of any Senator, prevents a bill or joint resolution's referral to committee. The measure is placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business. Alternately, unanimous consent is also used to bypass referral and place measures directly on the calendar.", "Although placing a measure directly on the calendar may facilitate calling it up later for consideration on the Senate floor, placement on the calendar does not guarantee floor consideration.", "A bill or joint resolution, in addition, might be neither referred to committee nor placed on the calendar: a measure might be held at the desk (of the presiding officer)\u2014either simply being at the desk in the absence of any proceeding on it or after being ordered by unanimous consent to be held at the desk.

Although a Senator may demand (under paragraph 2) that the readings occur on three different legislative days, bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day \"for reference\" (referral) if there is no objection (under paragraph 3). Most bills and joint resolutions are read twice \"without any comment whatsoever from the floor\" and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by a Senator or received from the House.", "Senate Rule XVII, paragraph 1 states that a measure should be referred to the committee \"which has jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates.... \" Rule XXV contains the jurisdictions of the Senate's standing committees. These rules and the precedents from referral decisions based on them guide the referral of measures. There also exist agreements between committees that might govern the referral of certain bills and joint resolutions.", "Under Rule XVII, paragraph 1, the presiding officer formally refers bills and joint resolutions; in practice, the parliamentarian refers measures in behalf of the presiding officer. The introduction and referral of bills and joint resolutions, and the referral of House-passed bills and joint resolutions, occurs as \"morning business,\" pursuant to Senate Rule VII, paragraph 1.", "The Senate may, however, use provisions of Senate Rule XIV or unanimous consent to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a committee. The Senate might also hold a measure in abeyance at the desk (of the presiding officer), at least temporarily not referring it to committee or proceeding on it. The Senate might also agree by unanimous consent to truncate a committee's consideration of a measure that had been referred to it. Reasons for bypassing a committee's consideration of a bill or joint resolution include wishing to place the measure directly on the Senate's Calendar of Business, which under General Orders lists measures eligible for floor consideration, or wanting to immediately call up and consider the measure.", "Senators might also convert introduced bills and resolutions into an amendment form and offer their proposal as a germane, relevant, or nongermane amendment, including amendments in the nature of a substitute and managers' amendments, to a measure being considered on the Senate floor. They might also choose not to introduce a bill or resolution at all, but only seek to amend another measure. This report does not examine the use of the amendment process as a way to bypass Senate committees.", "This report examines alternative procedures and actions that the Senate uses to bypass committee consideration of bills and joint resolutions.

It is usually the majority leader (or a Senator acting in the majority leader's stead), acting on his own or at the request of any other Senator, who objects to \"further proceeding\"\u2014committee referral\u2014on a measure.", "For example, this procedure was used to place S. 1035 directly on the calendar.

Although placing a bill directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full Senate will ever consider it, the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps, like committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill's consideration, and procedural requirements, like the two-day availability of a committee report, may be obviated.", "In the 114 th Congress, at least 82 bills were placed directly on the calendar using the Rule XIV procedure. For example, S. 1 , to approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, was a priority for many Republican Senators and a group of Democratic Senators. A reason that it might have been placed directly on the calendar was that the issue had been discussed in the second session of the 113 th Congress and a related bill ( S. 2280 ) had been debated and voted on in the 113 th Congress's lame-duck session. On January 6, 2015, in the 114 th Congress, Senator John Hoeven introduced S. 1 . It was read a first time that day, and, on January 7, it was read the second time and placed on the calendar, thereby enabling the majority leader to expeditiously call up the bill in the Senate. ", "Although no measure on the Senate Calendar is assured rapid or any consideration, the majority leader moved to proceed to the consideration of S. 1 on January 8 and immediately presented a motion to invoke cloture. The Senate on January 12 by a 63-32 vote invoked cloture on the motion to proceed. The Senate subsequently agreed to the motion to proceed on a voice vote on January 13, whereupon debate and the consideration of amendments began. Upon a second attempt to invoke cloture on the measure , cloture was invoked by a vote of 62-35 on January 29. The Senate voted 62-36 the same day to pass the bill.", "As mentioned, House-passed bills might also be placed directly on the calendar using the Rule XIV procedure. The Senate might choose this option when\u2014", "a related Senate measure is already on the calendar; a Senate committee is in the process of completing consideration of Senate companion legislation; an amendment to the House measure is already in discussion among interested Senators and the House-passed measure will be the Senate's legislative vehicle; Senators of the committee of jurisdiction support for the House-passed measure is stronger in the full Senate than in the committee to which it would be referred; the House-passed measure includes tax or appropriations provisions, which must originate in the House, requiring the use of a House-passed legislative vehicle; or for another reason.

", "The procedure under Rule XIV is also used by minority-party Senators, or by a majority-party Senator with a viewpoint different on an issue from that of other Senators of his or her party, to give added visibility to specific bills and to avoid potential inaction or hostility in a Senate committee. A Democratic Senator in the 114 th Congress, for example, used this procedure to put directly on the calendar S. 3348 , a bill to require major-party presidential candidates to disclose tax return information.
