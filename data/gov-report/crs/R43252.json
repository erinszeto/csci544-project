The number of initially furloughed employees does not tell the entire story of the impact of a government shutdown. In this situation, the government likely draws back significantly from its contracting activities overall, as it cannot spend monies normally provided through the appropriations process. In addition, hiring, procurement, and other projects in process are often stalled, and research efforts could be disrupted.

It is unclear whether passage of this legislation would provide for a transfer of funds to the DHS OIG to pay for oversight of disaster relief operations, as has occurred in recent years, and whether such a transfer would allow the OIG to conduct those activities. ", " Figure 2 , below, shows a graphical representation of the relative size of the DHS appropriations that would be restored under the bill, relative to the resources that would be provided through H.J.Res. 85 and the actions taken in P.L. 113-39 and P.L. 113-46 .", " Figure 2 compares the CBO-estimated impact of the two enacted and two proposed temporary appropriations measures affecting DHS. The underlying circle of the pie chart reflects the annualized discretionary budget authority that is provided for DHS through P.L. 113-46 \u2014essentially, the equivalent of the post-sequester appropriated budget for DHS for FY2013. This is the same as the annualized discretionary budget authority that would have been provided to DHS through H.J.Res. 59 . The sections in blue are regular discretionary appropriations, while the tan sections are covered by adjustments for disaster relief and costs of overseas military operations that are provided for under the Budget Control Act. The crosshatched section of the pie represents the annualized budget authority provided under P.L. 113-39 \u2014appropriations that will not lapse for FY2014. The two pieces \"lifted\" from the circle reflect what continuing appropriations would have been provided under H.J.Res. 79 and H.J.Res. 85 . All of these continuing resolutions, proposed and enacted, had the same rate\u2014the FY2013 post-sequester level of funding provided under P.L. 113-6 . Their coverage differed, however, with only H.J.Res. 59 and P.L. 113-46 covering the entire department (in fact, the entire government), and H.J.Res. 79 , H.J.Res. 85 , and P.L. 113-39 covering appropriations for portions of DHS.
