Over the past 50 years, the legislative foundation for U.S. foreign aid has evolved largely by amending the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195), the primary statutory basis for U.S. foreign aid programs, and enacting separate freestanding laws to reflect specific U.S. foreign policy interests. Many describe U.S. aid programs as fragmented, cumbersome, and not finely tuned to address overseas needs or U.S. national security interests. Lack of a comprehensive congressional reauthorization of foreign aid for half of those 50 years compounds the perceived weakness of U.S. aid programs and statutes.", "The structure of U.S. foreign aid entities, as well as implementation and follow-up monitoring of the effectiveness of aid programs, have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Criticisms include a lack of focus and coherence overall; too many agencies involved in delivering aid with inadequate coordination or leadership; lack of flexibility, responsiveness, and transparency of aid programs; and a perceived lack of progress in some countries that have been aid recipients for decades. Over the last decade a number of observers have expressed a growing concern about the increasing involvement of the Department of Defense in foreign aid activities. At issue, too, has been whether the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) or the Department of State should be designated as the lead agency in delivering, monitoring, and assessing aid, and what the relationship between the two should be.", "The Obama Administration, led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, announced action to seek solutions to the problems associated with foreign aid and begin the process of reform. Secretary Clinton announced in July 2009 that the Department of State would conduct a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) to address issues involving State Department and USAID capabilities and resources to meet 21st century demands. In September 2010, the President signed a Presidential Study Directive (PSD) on U.S. Global Development Policy to address overarching government department and agency issues regarding foreign aid activities and coordination.

On September 22, 2010, President Obama signed a Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on Global Development emanating from the Presidential Study Directive on Global Development (PSD-7) to improve agency coordination and identify foreign aid with foreign investment. The directive places a premium on economic growth and democratic governance, uses a new business model to be a more effective development partner, and creates a new government architecture that elevates development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. On June 29, 2010, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Berman released a discussion draft, \"Global Partnerships Act of 2010,\" which provided a preamble and first title of the House bill to revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The discussion draft established a new framework for U.S. foreign aid; stated seven purposes of foreign assistance, placing \"Reducing Global Poverty and Alleviating Human Suffering\" as the number one purpose; and required the President to develop and implement rigorous monitoring and evaluation systems. It also provided authorization language to create a Development Support Fund to encourage long-term, sustainable development activities in developing countries. The President released the National Security Strategy in May 2010, providing a glimpse of some foreign aid priorities within the Administration's national security agenda. Among other things, the strategy included a \"whole-of-government\" approach to integrate all tools, including those in defense, diplomacy, and development, and to improve coordination of foreign assistance programs, as well as activities advancing democracy and human rights.

Also related is the debate among some lawmakers and policymakers about how to strengthen USAID's role in aid planning, decision making, and implementation, as well as whether to designate it as the lead coordinator of all entities involved with U.S. development and humanitarian assistance programs in Washington and in aid-recipient countries.

Another criticism is a perceived lack of progress in some countries that have been aid recipients for decades.

", "The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 and following, the main statutory basis for aid programs), is viewed by most development experts as being outdated and not reflecting current international conditions. It contains an emphasis on the Cold War and communism with a multitude of goals and outdated priorities and directives, many of which have been appended piecemeal to the original act. In addition, Congress has enacted over 20 other pieces of legislation establishing foreign aid authorities outside the FAA, adding to the diffusion of aid responsibility and initiatives within U.S. foreign policy overall. Many claim that the FAA needs to be rewritten in order to streamline and add coherence to a piece of legislation that has been amended frequently since its enactment nearly 50 years ago.", "Recommendations on rewriting the FAA include stripping foreign aid legislation of fragmentary earmarks, aid restrictions, and aid procurement rules; refocusing aid on the core mission of poverty reduction; and restructuring aid legislation to set development goals based not on outdated Cold War-era policy, but rather on the realities facing the United States in a post-9/11 environment. ", "A number of nongovernmental organizations, development experts, and policy makers have pressed Congress and the Administration to take steps to reform the U.S. foreign aid program. Several actions occurred in 2009 and 2010, including introduction of legislation to reform certain aspects of foreign aid, a State Department announcement of a quadrennial review, and a Presidential Study Directive (PSD) on U.S. Global Development Policy.

Improving the way we use foreign assistance will make it more effective in strengthening responsible governments, responding to suffering, and improving people's lives.\" In the FY2007 foreign affairs budget request, the Bush Administration stated, \"There are no hard lines between our security interests, our development interests, and our democratic goals.\" Many observers, however, have questioned whether the rhetoric has been matched by related policies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issues and Actions During the George W.

The F process was to develop a coherent, coordinated foreign assistance strategy; provide multiyear country-specific assistance strategies; consolidate policy planning, budget, and implementation mechanisms to improve leadership in aid activities; and provide guidance for other government agencies involved in aid activities. The F Bureau developed a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to align U.S. aid programs with strategic objectives. The Framework guided the writing of the FY2008 and FY2009 budgets under President Bush.", "During the Bush Administration an increasing portion of total aid was being delivered by DOD, largely due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan involving emergency humanitarian assistance, as well as reconstruction and stabilization activities. DOD's role in disbursing foreign aid has its advocates and detractors in State, DOD, and the NGO community.

She has emphasized that this does not mean the United States will give up long-term development goals for short-term objectives, or hand over more development work to diplomats and defense experts.
