It also included provisions affecting several other domestic food aid programs/activities operated under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture that have typically been included in farm bills: nutrition assistance block grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), Community Food Projects, and rules governing foods used in domestic feeding programs such as the School Lunch program. Beyond this traditional array of food assistance programs, the 2002 bill encompassed provisions for a new Seniors Farmers' Market program, a new Fruit and Vegetables pilot program, a set-aside to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables for schools, a Congressional Hunger Fellows program, the purchase of locally produced food, and changed eligibility rules for free and reduced-price school meals and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program).", "As a historical source and in the expectation that the issues raised in and the results of actions taken during consideration of the 2002 farm bill may come up again in the next scheduled farm bill (2007), this report presents in some detail what happened with regard to nutrition programs in 2002.", "The nutrition title of the 2002 farm bill (Title IV): substantially expanded food stamp eligibility for legally resident noncitizens (the single largest change), liberalized food stamp benefits and eligibility rules, provided new options for states to vary from regular Food Stamp program rules, greatly changed the system for penalizing states with high rates of erroneous benefit and eligibility determinations, increased funding for TEFAP and CSFP, and, as noted above, introduced several new programs. It was estimated to cost $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion over FY2002-FY2007. However, a number of issues were raised but not addressed: Administration requests to loosen the food stamp asset test as it relates to vehicles and to limit state options to make public assistance recipients automatically eligible for food stamps, a provision to increase benefits for those with very high shelter costs, recommendations to open up work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, a change to allow states to conform their method of reviewing households' food stamp eligibility to the method used for other public assistance programs, and a proposal to allow food stamps to be used for dietary supplements.", "Overall, the basic themes of the nutrition title of the 2002 farm bill were expanded eligibility for legal noncitizens, more leeway for states to establish their own version of food stamp rules, and support for expanded availability of fresh fruit and vegetables.", "This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal nutrition program policies, as well as farm support and other agriculture-related programs, are governed by a variety of separate laws.

The most recent farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002 ( P.L. 107-171 ), the first since 1996, reauthorized appropriations for and substantially revised the Food Stamp program and a number of other domestic food aid programs. Much of the Agriculture Department's mandatory spending is and was for food stamps and other programs in its nutrition title (Title IV). In 2007, Congress is scheduled to take up the next farm bill because many of the provisions and authorizations for appropriations expire at the end of FY2007.

In the case of the 2002 bill, this was particularly true.", "In May 2001, Congress agreed to a budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 83 ) that allowed for substantial added funding for programs covered by the upcoming farm bill. The availability of this \"new\" money and how it would be divided up among the various farm bill components dominated much of the farm bill debate that began in earnest in July 2001. For example, the Senate version of the farm bill provided more new funding for nutrition programs than the House bill (see the last portion of the table at the conclusion of this report). And the fact that the ability to tap the new funding would end in the spring of 2002, pushed the Agriculture Committees to take up the farm bill earlier than would normally be the case. In the end, the nutrition title of the enacted farm bill claimed between 5% and 6% of the total estimated new spending in the enacted bill, depending on which Congressional Budget Office projection was used (also see later discussion of nutrition program spending under the farm bill)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nutrition Program Issues in the Farm Bill", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the debate over how much new spending would go into nutrition programs, significant substantive debate arose with regard to food stamps, TEFAP, the CSFP, and support for initiatives to increase the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in meal programs like the School Lunch program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Food Stamps", "paragraphs": ["Three developments were basic to the farm bill food stamp debate: the relatively low level of program participation at the time; frustration with federal food stamp eligibility, benefit, and administrative policies; and the concerns of some over ineligibility of many legally resident noncitizens (as provided for in the 1996 welfare reform law).", "Although food stamp enrollment was increasing, in 2001-2002 it was well below its peak in the spring of 1994 and only a bit over 10% higher than the all-time low. More than half of the decline over the 5 years since the last major food stamp amendments was estimated to have come from a sharp drop in the rate at which those who were eligible actually participated.", "State officials, program advocates, and supporters of the 1996 welfare reform law (with its goal of moving families from welfare to work), maintained that various aspects of food stamp eligibility, benefit, and administrative rules thwarted participation and effective administration\u2014denying needed support to working poor families and others in need, and interfering with efforts to coordinate assistance. They pointed to overly complex policies that burden administrators and applicants/recipients, food stamp rules that differ too much from those applied by states in other welfare programs, and inadequate benefits not worth the \"hassle\" of applying and maintaining eligibility. Finally, they contended that the program's \"quality control\" system for measuring state performance penalized too many states too harshly for erroneous benefit/eligibility determinations\u2014thereby pressuring states to \"over-administer\" the program and limiting participation.", "Food stamp advocates, states, and welfare reform supporters all expressed their dissatisfaction with this state of affairs, but there was not a single, unified reform agenda, and most alternatives for change imposed significant new costs. States called for simplified federal food stamp rules, much greater state control over policies, lifting federal limits on work and training activities, and revamped and more standardized benefit and eligibility rules to help administrators and applicants/recipients. They also wanted major revision of the quality control system and a more open federal policy as to waiving food stamp rules. Program advocates emphasized the inadequacy of benefits and the need to grant eligibility to legally resident noncitizens. Although they supported reform of the quality control system and selective changes to make eligibility/benefit determinations easier for applicants/recipients, they resisted vesting too much decision-making with states and tampering with what they saw as a nationally uniform food stamp \"safety net.\" Welfare reform supporters also agreed with quality control reforms, but stressed the need to ensure that the food stamp program fulfills a major role in supporting the working poor as its first priority.", "Within cost constraints, the farm bill's food stamp provisions responded to many of these criticisms, by easing/lifting administrative requirements, allowing states to achieve greater conformity between rules used by food stamps and other welfare programs, reforming the food stamp quality control system, increasing benefits, and opening up eligibility for noncitizens.", "To a large extent, the Administration's food stamp reform package also recognized the concerns voiced by states, advocates, and welfare reformers. It included: (1) a modest benefit increase for larger households (similar to the final law); (2) standardizing or giving states control over several important federal rules; (3) liberalizing eligibility rules by excluding the value of one vehicle per adult; (4) making eligible all low-income noncitizens who have resided in the U.S. legally for 5 years (similar to the final farm bill); (5) restructuring and reducing spending for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients (similar to the final bill); (6) ending automatic eligibility for some welfare beneficiaries; and (7) significantly reforming the food stamp quality control system to penalize fewer states and give bonuses to states performing well (although in a different way than the final farm bill).
