DPPSP indirectly supported the farm price of fluid milk at $9.90 per hundred lbs. (i.e., hundredweight or cwt.) through government purchases of dairy products from dairy processors at statutorily set prices. The program was countercyclical, in that government purchases occurred when product prices were low, and ceased as product prices rose above support levels. However, by the mid-1990s, the annual farm price of milk had trended higher, albeit subject to an increasingly volatile pattern ( Figure 1 ), whereas the federal support rate was flat at $9.90 per cwt. ", "Volatile milk prices made planning more difficult and made dairy producers more vulnerable to unexpected or sustained increases in the cost of feed (the major cost component of dairy production). Milk producers have argued since the early 1990s that support levels had become too low, relative to market prices and costs of production, to provide meaningful support. More recently, milk producers argued that support based strictly on the price of milk failed to account for the sharp escalation of feed costs that has occurred since 2006 ( Figure 2 ). ", "After the emergence of the U.S. ethanol industry as a major source of corn demand in 2006, coupled with a series of weather-related, below-trend yield years (especially 2010-2012) for the U.S. corn crop, U.S. feed grain markets surged to new price levels by 2012 that were nearly three times above the levels that had persisted during the previous four decades. Rising feed costs are of particular concern to dairy producers because they represent a substantial portion of the cost of milk production\u2014in 2011, feed costs accounted for 80% of operating costs and 54% of total costs of milk production (compared with 71% and 37% shares during the 2000-2004 period).", "The combination of volatile milk market prices rising well beyond support levels coupled with rapidly rising feed costs contributed to a shifting of focus away from price supports and towards protecting or guaranteeing some portion of the margin between milk prices and feed costs.", "This refocusing of policy interest on the dairy operating margin was formalized by a proposed dairy margin protection program published in June 2010 by the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) called the Foundation for the Future (FTF). A version of the FTF was introduced in the 112 th Congress as H.R. 3062 , The Dairy Security Act (DSA), by House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson on September 23, 2011. Through the legislative process FTF eventually evolved into the new dairy program described in the following sections.

The program also included USDA resale of acquired dairy products under certain price and stock-volume conditions. Some variation of a dairy price support program has been in effect since the Agricultural Act of 1949 first required USDA to support the farm price of milk. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program is temporarily extended until September 1, 2014, or until the implementation date of the new margin program (described below), whichever comes earlier and after which it is permanently repealed. MILC is a counter-cyclical payment program first authorized in the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) that makes payments available on up to 2.985 million lbs. of milk whenever the monthly Boston Class\u00a0I price of fluid milk falls below a threshold of $16.94/cwt. adjusted for feed cost changes. The Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP) , originally authorized by the 1985 farm bill ( P.L. 99-198 ), is repealed immediately.

The program allows regulated handlers to pay farmers in accordance with the terms of a forward contract instead of paying the minimum FMMO blend price for pooled milk. The prices paid by milk handlers under the contracts are deemed to satisfy the minimum price requirements of FMMOs. The 2014 farm bill allows for new contracts until September 30, 2018, but no contract can extend beyond September 30, 2021. The Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) makes payments to dairy producers when a public regulatory agency directs them to remove their raw milk from the commercial market because it has been contaminated by pesticides, nuclear radiation or fallout, or toxic substances and chemical residues other than pesticides through no fault of their own. Payments also are made to manufacturers of dairy products, but only for products removed from the market because of pesticide contamination. The Dairy Promotion and Research Program is a generic dairy product promotion, research, and nutrition education program, funded by a mandatory 15\u00a2/cwt. assessment on milk produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous states.

The FMMO system regulates milk marketing across state lines but within these 10 explicitly defined and geographically aligned multi-state regions. Within each FMMO, dairy processors or handlers (i.e., milk buyers) are required to pay a minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use. Dairy Import Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) are a system of product-specific import quotas\u2014with low in-quota tariffs and high, often-prohibitive above-quota tariffs\u2014designed to protect higher-priced domestic dairy products by limiting the importation of lower-priced foreign dairy products. Dairy TRQs are part of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and are unaffected by changes made in the 2014 farm bill. The Dairy Price Support Program is authorized under \"permanent farm law\" contained in the 1949 Agricultural Act, but is suspended by periodic passage of new farm legislation. Under permanent law, USDA is required to purchase manufactured milk and butterfat products in sufficient quantities to raise demand in order to raise the farm price of fluid milk to the equivalency of 75% to 90% of a 1910-1914 parity price index\u2014which would result in milk support prices near $40/cwt. double the average all-milk farm price of $20/cwt. during 2013. Reversion to permanent dairy law has been referred to as the \"milk price cliff.\" The Dairy Product Mandatory Reporting Program requires manufacturers to report to USDA the price, quantity, and moisture content of dairy products sold. Quarterly audits are to be undertaken to ensure compatibility between submitted information and related dairy market statistics. The Livestock Gross Margin Insurance for Dairy (LGM -D ) is an ongoing pilot program available for purchase from private insurers through USDA's permanently authorized federal crop insurance program. LGM-D provides protection to dairy producers when feed costs rise or milk prices drop. Gross margin is the market value of milk minus feed costs. LGM-D uses futures prices for corn, soybean meal, and milk to determine the expected gross margin and the actual gross margin. The Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program , established by the 1990 farm bill ( P.L. 101-624 ) with subsequent reauthorizations, develops and finances generic advertising programs designed to maintain and expand markets and uses for fluid milk products produced in the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia. The program is funded through a 20\u00a2/cwt. assessment paid by processors on all milk processed for fluid consumption.

This combination can be expected to provide some degree of production incentives to participating milk producers.

As a result, strong adverse gaming incentives exist for participants in the MPP. Economic analysis suggests that the adverse gaming incentives can be reduced or mitigated by specifying an earlier sign-up date for coverage decisions\u2014for example, 60 to 90 days ahead of each year's program starting date of January 1.

What Are the Trade Implications of MPP and DPDP?", "paragraphs": ["The 2014 farm bill dairy provisions made several changes that have profound implications for U.S. and international trade agreements.

Thus, the repeal of DPPSP is likely to have a substantial effect in lowering annual U.S. domestic support notifications to the WTO, and keeping U.S. domestic support outlays well below the United States' $19.1 billion ceiling. ", "It is not yet clear how USDA will notify program outlays under MPP and DPDP\u2014for example, possibly as amber box but exempt under the de minimis exclusion\u2014but current CBO spending projections of about $1.2 billion over 10 years or about $120 million per year pale in comparison with the DPPSP's annual average notification of $5.5 billion. In addition, repeal of DEIP fulfills a general commitment by WTO members to end use of agricultural export subsidies, and brings greater pressure to bear on the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, and the rest of the world to act similarly.
