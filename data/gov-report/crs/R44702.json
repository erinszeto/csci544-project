For example, if a payment of $50 was due, and the agency paid $60, then only the $10 above the correct amount would be counted in the improper payment total. Similarly, if the agency had paid $40 to a recipient that was supposed to receive $50, then only the $10 below the correct amount would be counted as improper. However, if a $100 payment was made without sufficient documentation to confirm that the payment was correct, the entire $100 would be included in the improper payment total. A-123 permits agencies to sample transactions at certain steps within the lifecycle of a payment rather than the entire payment process, if the agency believes that only those steps have the highest risk or have the greatest return on investment.

Overpayments from mandatory fund accounts, trust fund accounts, or special fund accounts must revert back to those accounts, as well.

While the rate has fluctuated over the 11-year period for which data are available, it has equaled or exceeded the FY2004 level for five of the past seven years.

The improper payment rate for the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) program, for example, increased from 5.2% in FY2005 to 12.1% in FY2015, and the amount of improper payments made under the program has more than tripled in that same period of time, increasing from $12 billion to approximately $43 billion. Similarly, the improper payment rates have increased for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Other programs have reduced their error rates, but not substantially. The error rate for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program has decreased from 25.4% to 23.8% in ten years , Medicaid's error rate has decreased from 10.5% to 9.8% in seven years, and Medicare Part C's error rate has decreased from 10.6% to 9.5% in seven years.

Federal agencies did not report on five risk-susceptible programs in FY2015, including Temporary Aid for Needy Families, a program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with nearly $17 billion in outlays. One of the largest risk-susceptible programs lacking an established improper payment error rate is the EITC, which is administered by the Department of the Treasury. The initial improper payment rate for the EITC, published for FY2004 expenditures, was 24.5%, with total outlays $39.4 billion, resulting in $9.7 billion in improper payments. OMB estimates that the FY2015 improper payment rate for the EITC was between 21% and 26%, with a \"rough\" estimate of improper payments in excess of $15 billion.

Improper payment reduction targets may be important oversight tools for Congress, as they may be used evaluate agency efforts to make needed changes to their payment processes and policies. If agencies consistently do not meet their targets, then it may indicate that agencies are not implementing new strategies effectively, or that those strategies do not actually address the root causes of improper payments. The absence of published reduction targets may indicate that an agency does not understand what factors are driving the error rate.", "Agency Inspectors General (IGs) did not always meet IPERA reporting requirements.

As a consequence, only $680,000 in improper payments was prevented through the use of the DNP working system in FY2015.

HHS said it was unable to find a contractor in time for FY2015, but hopes to have one in place for FY2016.
