The act requires companies issuing securities to disclose information deemed germane to investors. Potential investors must also receive an offering prospectus containing disclosed securities data. Certain offerings are exempt from such registration requirements, including private offerings and offerings made to a limited number of sophisticated persons or institutions.", "Shortly afterwards, Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (P.L. 73-291), which authorized creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an independent and nonpartisan regulatory agency responsible for administering federal securities laws. As such, the agency exercises broad regulatory authority over significant parts of the securities industry, including stock exchanges, mutual funds, investment advisers, and brokerage firms.", "In subsequent years, Congress enacted a number of other federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act; P.L. 76-768), which defined the role and responsibilities of investment advisers and imposed SEC registration and disclosure requirements on them. ", "As noted above, the federal securities laws are responsible for regulations that are overseen and enforced by the SEC, which apply to various entities involved in the securities markets entities as well as companies that issue securities. Statutorily, the regulations that the SEC oversees\u2014whether specifically directed by Congress or adopted independently by the SEC per its authority under the securities laws\u2014are supposed to facilitate the agency's broad mission to (1) ensure investor protection through a regime of information transparency aimed at facilitating informed investment decisionmaking; (2) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and (3) facilitate capital formation.

However, this dynamic may be complicated, as some studies have found that markets may punish assets through lowered pricing after their corporate issuers were exempted from certain required investor disclosures. The policy tradeoff dynamic may become even more complicated when some of the many mandatory corporate disclosures may not necessarily facilitate informed investing because they may be superfluous or may contribute to investor information overload. For example, in a 2013 speech, SEC Chair Mary Jo White noted that the agency would be examining whether investors' needs are served by the \"detailed and lengthy disclosures about all of the topics that companies currently provide in the reports they are required to prepare and file with us \u2026 [and] whether information overload is occurring.\" ", "The 114 th Congress is currently considering securities legislation that in many instances would extend the JOBS Act's focus on providing corporate regulatory relief to foster capital formation.

Banks and BHCs were also allowed to stop registering securities with the SEC, a process known as deregistration, if the number of their shareholders of record fell to 300 or fewer. ", "Generally speaking, a central perceived benefit of SEC registration is enhancing investor protection by ensuring that investors have access to significant financial and nonfinancial data about firms and the securities they issue. The cost of SEC registration is a regulatory burden on the firm issuing securities associated with complying with SEC requirements, which potentially raises the cost of capital and reduces how much capital a firm can raise. For small firms, the regulatory burden of registration is thought to be greater than for larger firms. Policymakers often strive to reach the optimal trade-off between costs and benefits of SEC registration by exempting firms below a certain size from registration requirements.", "Title VI of the JOBS Act raised the SEC shareholder registration threshold from 500 to 2,000 and increased the upper limit for deregistration from 300 to 1,200 for those banks and nonfinancial firms. In other words, the JOBS Act made it easier for banks and BHCs to increase the number of their shareholders while remaining unregistered private banks and, if already registered, to voluntarily deregister while also adding more shareholders. The provision went into effect immediately upon the enactment of the JOBS Act on April 5, 2012.", "These changes made by the JOBS Act did not apply to savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs). Title LXXXV of P.L. 114-94 ; H.R. 37 ; H.R. 1334 ; Section 601, S. 1484 ; and Section 971, S. 1910 would extend the higher registration and deregistration shareholder thresholds in the JOBS Act for banks and BHCs to SLHCs. Savings and loans (also known as thrifts and savings banks) are similar to banks in that they take deposits and make loans, but their regulation is somewhat different. ", "Under the provision, an SLHC would be required to register with the SEC if its assets exceed $10 million and it has 2,000 shareholders of record, up from the current requirement of 500 shareholders of record. SLHCs that want to deregister from the SEC would have to have no more than 1,200 shareholders of record, an increase over the current 300 or fewer shareholders. ", "Reports indicate that after passage of the JOBS Act, a number of privately held banks and BHCs took advantage of Title VI's reduction in shareholder ownership registration triggers by raising capital from additional shareholders without having to register with the SEC. Some banks have also taken the opportunity to deregister from the SEC. One study found that the act was generally financially beneficial to banks. For example, it found that, on average, the legislation resulted in $1.31 in higher net bank income and $3.28 lower pretax expenses for every $1.00 of bank assets and was responsible for $1.54 million in increased assets per bank employee. The study did not attempt to estimate the costs to investors of reduced disclosure under the changes made by the JOBS Act. ", "Potentially expanding the exemption threshold on SEC registration for thrift holding companies raises two main points to consider. First, should exemption levels from SEC registration requirements be different for thrifts and savings and loans than for banks? Current law makes it more difficult for small thrifts to raise capital than for small banks. Second, are the costs and benefits of registration requirements for small banks better balanced at the higher thresholds enacted for banks in the JOBS Act or the lower thresholds in current law for thrifts?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Relief for Small Business Merger and Acquisition Brokers (H.R. 37, Title IV; and H.R. 686)", "paragraphs": ["Merger and acquisitions (M&A) brokers, often referred to as Main Street brokers , are intermediaries who negotiate privately negotiated \"sale of business\" transactions involving small and mid-sized companies that often do not involve the exchange of securities. This role has been described as somewhat akin to the role that \"Wall Street\" investment firms play as intermediaries for transactions involving changes in ownership of the securities of publicly traded firms. As is the case with other broker-dealers\u2014such as Wall Street investment firms, which can act as broker-dealers themselves and also employ individuals who also perform that role\u2014M&A brokers are also required to register as broker-dealers with the SEC and to be members of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA, the frontline regulator of securities brokerage firms and their brokers overseen by the SEC).

Given these conditions, there are significant concerns that brokers oftentimes end up passing their regulatory costs on to the handful of the relatively small-sized corporate clients they serve. ", "Some observers say that initial SEC registration costs for M&A brokers can run more than $150,000, with annual registration running as high as $75,000. To avoid these costs, some sellers and acquirers have reportedly fled to unregistered M&A brokers, who are said to be a majority of such brokers. Unregistered brokers are, however, in technical violation of the registration requirements under federal securities laws.

To that end, the act created a new class of public company known as an emerging growth company (EGC), which generally must have less than $1 billion in revenues in its last fiscal year. Among other things, the act phased in certain regulatory requirements for EGCs during a five-year period known as an initial public offering (IPO) \"on-ramp.\" EGCs are also permitted to confidentially file their registration statement with the SEC, reduce their mandatory SEC financial disclosures for their IPOs and subsequent mandatory public filings, and delay the implementation of various Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Dodd-Frank Act corporate governance requirements. Among them is a Sarbanes-Oxley requirement that a company's external auditor attest to the company management's report on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. ", "Between April 2012 (when EGCs began) and mid-2014, EGCs reportedly dominated initial public offerings, accounting for about 84% of domestic IPOs that went into effect during that time. ", "Unlike other companies that pursue IPOs, an EGC may submit its IPO registration statement confidentially as a draft for informal SEC staff review, enabling it to have a non-public \"back and forth\" with the agency over the contours of the projected IPO. In the event of unfavorable market conditions and thus perceived weak investor demand, under the confidential SEC review, an EGC may withdraw its draft registration statement, ending its pursuit of an IPO. Having that preliminary confidential SEC review option thus gives EGCs greater flexibility with respect to \"pulling the trigger\" to launch an IPO. ", "If an EGC does decide to move forward with its IPO, its initial confidential submission, registration statement, and prospectus must be formally submitted to the SEC at least 21 days before commencing an IPO roadshow. Companies must also provide the SEC with their latest as well as some historical financial disclosures prior to an IPO launch.

Currently, a company that qualified as an EGC when it filed its confidential registration statement with the SEC, but later lost that qualification, would have no recourse for regaining EGC status for regulatory purposes.", "Proponents have argued that reducing the time between registration and the roadshow would reduce the likelihood that external events could have a negative impact on an IPO. The provisions have, however, been criticized by those who argue that while a number of EGCs are relatively large in size and are likely to garner \"fairly immediate\" attention from securities analysts, some will likely be rather small and will not attract such immediate analytical attention. As such, the concern is that compressing the time for public reaction to such smaller and unanalyzed EGCs in particular could be \"a poor and untested idea.\"", "A 2014 study of EGCs concluded that a sample of EGCs began their roadshows an average of 43 days after they had publicly filed their registration statements with the SEC. That 43-day average, more than twice the current 21-day minimum window, suggests that a reduction to 15 days is not likely to have a significant overall impact on the EGC IPO process.", "Advocates have also argued that not having to provide historical information to the SEC would translate into meaningful cost savings. Critics, however, have countered that, due to the central role that financial statements play in the overall scheme of mandatory corporate disclosures to the SEC and investors, the ability to compare multiple years of such statements is critical.", "By contrast, there appears to be little substantial criticism of enabling an EGC that filed confidential registrations statements but subsequently no longer qualified for EGC status to still be treated as an EGC from a regulatory perspective.

In 2009, the SEC adopted additional requirements that such disclosures would also have to be submitted to the agency in XBRL. Phased in over the next four years, the XBRL requirement began with larger companies, eventually extending to all publicly traded firms.", "XBRL imposes a computer-readable data structure on the financial statements and their associated notes and footnotes through assigning electronic tags to each item. The protocol also reports on the relationship between individual items in the financial statements. And unlike the conventional paper-based disclosures, data in the XBRL format can be easily converted into spreadsheets for analysis.

", "In this context, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and XBRL US, a national XBRL consortium, surveyed XBRL vendors who provide XBRL tagging and filing services to some 1,300 smaller reporting companies (public companies with $75 million or less in market capitalization). The survey found that (1) 69% of the companies paid $10,000 or less annually for fully outsourced creation and filing solutions of their XBRL filings; (2) 18% of the companies had annual costs of $10,000 to $20,000 for full-service outsourced XBRL solutions; (3) 8% of the companies paid in excess of $25,000 annually; and (4) no annual XBRL-based costs exceeded $50,000. ", "The survey also found that in the case of companies with higher XBRL-based expenditures, their outsized costs derived from exceptional circumstances, namely the \"complexities in their financial statements and rush charges imposed given the many last minute changes to the filings (e.g., filing changes for an IPO).\"", "Overall, the study concluded that XBRL \"is not overly burdensome on small companies and in fact [is] ... worth the additional cost.\" Examining trends in the cost of XBRL compliance for companies in general, a complementary study reported that for many companies, costs were declining as many companies moved to financial management programs that incorporate the XBRL process. ", "The other side of the XBRL cost/benefit debate involves the XBRL user side, which a few studies have tried to throw some light on. ", "For example, one survey of smaller reporting companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange found that many of the firms believed that because smaller companies tended to produce relatively less complicated financial statements, the benefit from XBRL-based attributes (such as the ability to hyperlink to financial schedules and tagged footnotes) is insignificant.", "In addition, a study from the Columbia University Business School found that less than 10% of investors and analysts surveyed used XBRL-tagged SEC data, and none tried to access XBRL data from corporate websites. It also reported that the relatively small number of analysts and investors who had attempted to use the data tended to be disappointed with both its usability and its general quality. ", "Some of the legislations' detractors, however, counter that exempting smaller firms from using it would ultimately harm investors because they would lose access to small company financial data that they had benefited from heretofore. Relatedly, the head of the SEC's Office of the Investor Advocate, an SEC office charged with assisting retail investors in their dealings with the agency, has argued that the XBRL regulatory relief legislation \"would seriously impede the ability of the SEC to bring disclosure into the 21 st Century\" and that proper congressional intervention would entail urging the SEC to continue in its efforts to make corporate disclosures \"more accessible and useful\" to the investing public.

", "As part of this, the agency also issued a separate proposal that would subject issuers using the Reg D exemption to additional requirements, including (1) requiring issuers to file a single Form D (i.e., the document issuers file with the SEC to facilitate the Reg D exemption) no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in an offering (as currently required) and an additional Form D filing at least 15 days before engaging in general solicitation for an offering and updated information on their Form D filing within 30 days of completing an offering; (2) disqualifying an issuer for one year from obtaining a Reg D Form 506 exemption if the company has not complied with earlier Form D filing requirements for a Rule 506 offering; (3) requiring issuers adhere to certain cautionary statements in general solicitation materials used in a Rule 506 offerings to alert potential investors that an offering is confined to accredited investors and that such offerings may have certain risks; and (4) extending Rule 156 under the Securities Act of 1933, which gives guidance regarding the sales literature provided by SEC-registered investment companies, such as mutual funds, that could be fraudulent or misleading to the literature provided by private funds (such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and private equity funds). ", "Upon adopting the proposals, the SEC argued that it would \"improve the SEC's ability to evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506 offerings and would address certain concerns raised by investors related to issuers engaging in general solicitation.\"", "H.R. 4852 as reported by the House Financial Services Committee ( H.Rept. 114-726 ) would ensure that the aforementioned proposals are not implemented by the SEC. It would require the agency to revise its rules under Reg D to prohibit it from implementing the aforementioned proposals on new Form D filings, disqualifications, and new material for general solicitations. The SEC would also be prohibited from extending Rule 156 to private funds. ", "Critics of the proposals have praised H.R. 4852 . For example, Paul Atkins, former SEC commissioner and current chief executive officer of Patomak Global Partners, commented that in issuing the proposals, the SEC commissioners had \"put the cart before the horse\" by \"proposing further amendments even before the ink was dry on the [general solicitation] rule.\" More critically, he asserted that H.R. 4852 would help reverse the current \"regulatory uncertainty\" that he claimed was restraining companies from using their new general solicitation privileges under Rule 506."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proxy Advisory Firm Regulation (H.R. 5311)", "paragraphs": ["The investment portfolios of institutional investors, such as certain investment adviser firms, mutual funds, and pension funds, may contain the securities of hundreds of different public companies. As a consequence, for many of them, understanding the issues associated with multiple public company board member elections and shareholder proposals at corporate annual meetings can be both complicated and costly. Many institutional investors lack the size to cost-effectively conduct their own research on current and potential portfolio company investments, so they often outsource such work to consultants known as proxy advisory firms. Those firms help the institutional investors to (1) conduct research on corporate issues that may be associated with director elections and corporate proposals pushed by management and shareholders; (2) provide voting recommendations for director elections and management and shareholder proposal; and (3) directly cast their clients' votes during shareholder voting opportunities. ", "Essentially a duopoly, the domestic advisory firm industry is dominated by two firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass-Lewis. ", "Over the years, several criticisms have been levied against advisory firms with respect to the voting recommendations they provide to their investor clients. Criticisms include ", "the firms have often used opaque criteria to arrive at their recommendations; the firms have made mistakes in their analysis of proxy statements, analysis that they have not always been open to discuss or to correct; and the fact that ISS provides paid consulting services for public companies to model its compensation policies for corporate heads and its corporate governance policies as well as concerns of \"an apparent\u2014or at worst actual\u2014conflict of interest in offering companies services for which a company is then scored by ISS.\"", "In 2014, in an effort to enhance proxy advisory firm accountability, the SEC staff issued a guidance document, Proxy Voting: Proxy Voting Responsibilities of Investment Advis er s and Availability of Exemptions from the Proxy Rules for Proxy Advisory Firms . Among other things, the guidance provides greater clarification regarding the SEC's Proxy Voting Rule, reinforces the mandate that fiduciary obligations should govern the development and the receipt of proxy advice, and underscores the idea that improving shareholder value should be the central focus when proxy advisory firms are providing proxy-voting advice or are making proxy-voting decisions. ", "In the aftermath of the SEC's guidance, advisory firms still faced criticism over their perceived lack of accountability. For example, in 2015, then-SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher observed that \"too many institutional investors uncritically vote the proxy advisory firm recommendations [who] \u2026 in turn seem to have done little to address the factors that have given rise to poor research, erroneous recommendations, and conflicted advice.\"", "H.R. 5311 represents a legislative attempt to improve advisory-firm accountability and transparency. The bill, which has been ordered reported by the House Financial Services Committee, would require proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC. This registration process would include providing information about its procedures and methodologies, organizational structure, and the existence of a code of ethics; disclosing potential or actual conflicts of interest related to its ownership structure and its client services, including public company consulting services; identifying its largest clients; and describing internal policies and procedures aimed at managing conflicts that might surface. ", "The bill would also require advisory firms to file descriptions of their policies on proxy voting and voting recommendations with the SEC. Public companies would be entitled to both review and comment on proposed advisory firm recommendations before they are given to investors. The SEC-registered advisory firms would be required to appoint an internal compliance officer. They would also have to hire an ombudsman tasked with receiving complaints levied by corporate subjects concerning the accuracy of advisory firm information used in the development of voting recommendations on the subject. Those complaints would then have to be settled in a timely fashion. H.R. 5311 would also prohibit SEC-registered advisory firms from engaging in practices that are \"unfair, coercive, or abusive.\" The corporate subjects of a proxy advisory firm's voting recommendations would also be given limited rights of private action against the firms in federal district court. ", "On the benefits of the bill, Representative Sean Duffy, its sponsor, argued that it would \"foster accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry- thereby improving corporate governance and protecting investors.\" ", "A more granular perspective came from an official with the Center for Capital Competitiveness, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The official emphasized that the bill would give all stakeholders input into the proxy voting process. The legislation's conflict of interest disclosure requirements, he also argued would enable advisory firms and their clients to handle advisory firm conflicts of interest, including the advisory firm Glass Lewis' ownership by an activist institutional investor, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The trade group official gave special praise to a section of the bill that would permit companies to review and comment on proposed advisory firm client voting recommendations pertaining to them. He said that it would critically ensure that advisory firms are cognizant of all of the various aspects of issues, enabling them to \"prevent mistakes from being disseminated to investors.\" ", "The Council of Institutional Investors (CII) is a trade group of employee benefit plans, foundations, and endowments, many of whom are the clients of proxy advisory firms. Broadly critical of the bill, CII claimed the bill would \"weaken public company corporate governance \u2026 lessen the fiduciary obligation of proxy advisors to investor clients; and reorient any surviving proxy advisors to serve companies rather than investors.\" Furthermore, it argued that the impetus for the bill derived from several fundamentally false premises. Among them are (1) the idea that the two major advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, direct proxy voting results; (2) the notion that advisory firms tend to make single recommendations for each shareholder ballot item, which their clients tend to slavishly follow; and (3) the view that the 2014 SEC staff guidance on proxy advisors has been inadequate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exempting Securities Traded on Alternative Stock Exchanges from State Securities Regulation.

Such securities are called co vered securities . Therefore, issuers with an interest in having their securities listed and traded on an exchange that is not substantially similar to the three would likely face the prospect that the securities would not be covered securities and would thus be subject to the blue sky regulation, a potential cost deterrent in the decision to list and trade on a particular exchange. ", "H.R. 5421 , which has passed the House, would amend Section 18 of the act by stripping specific references to the aforementioned exchanges. It would then provide for an exemption from the blue sky regulation for any SEC-registered security that is listed on a \"national securities exchange\" whose listing standards receive SEC approval. ", "Arguing for the bill, the report accompanying the House Financial Service Committee's markup of H.R. 5421 ( H.Rept. 114-684 ) observed that Section 18 problematically required the SEC to compare \"innovative\" securities listing standards with standards that may have been in effect when the section was adopted in 1996. As a consequence, the report argued that current law statutorily tilts the SEC toward a position that constrains both exchange innovation and exchange competition, a situation it indicated would be remedied by H.R. 5421 .", "The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), an association of state and provincial securities regulators has, however, criticized the legislation. The group observed that current law already permits \"exchanges with varied listing requirements, including alternative marketplaces\" but unless they conform to the substantially similar listing standards of the three big national exchanges, they are subject to state regulatory review. By eliminating Section 18's substantially similar references to the national exchanges, the NASAA argued that H.R. 5421 would \"undercut\" the \"distinction\" between the alternative trading marketplaces and the major national exchanges. It then spoke of its basic concern that investors would suffer due to the blurring of those distinctions.", "Additional criticism of H.R. 5421 has come from a group of minority members on the House Financial Services Committee. The members argued that the bill would remove the current substantially similar framework, replacing it with no alternative protocol. This absence of any alternative criteria was predicted to \"at best create confusion and at worst encourage a race-to-the-bottom as exchanges try to compete for business by lowering their listing standards.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Relief for Investment Advisers (H.R. 5424)", "paragraphs": ["The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is the principal federal securities law overseeing investment advisers. Dodd-Frank amended the act to require private funds (i.e., private equity funds and hedge funds) with more than $150 million in assets under management to register with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Predicated on the view that various parts of the Advisers Act are both obsolete and burdensome for certain investment advisers, H.R. 5424 , which has been marked up by the House Financial Services Committee, would provide regulatory relief to certain investment advisers who manage private funds as well as some who do not. Among other things, the bill would amend various federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act, to (1) repeal a rule that currently prohibits investment advisers from employing testimonials and references to specific past investment recommendations when such materials are solely distributed to certain sophisticated clients and high net worth investors; (2) eliminate a current requirement that private fund investment advisers provide investors that are limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and other \"pooled vehicles\" with multiple disclosure documents containing largely identical information; and (3) provide for regulatory relief in the regulation of the assignment of advisory contracts for investment advisers not structured as partnerships when there is a change in minority ownership so that they would face the same regulatory requirements that partnership-based advisers currently face.

", "The Investment Adviser Association, a trade group of SEC-registered investment adviser firms, noted that federal investment adviser regulations had not kept pace with various financial services developments affecting investment advisers. The group then praised H.R. 5424 as needed reform that would address some of the dated parts of the Investment Advisers Act that imposed \"undue burdens on investment advisers \u2013 most of which are small businesses \u2013 without commensurate benefit to investors.\"", "In the House Financial Services Committee report accompanying the markup of H.R. 5424 ( H.Rept. 114-698 ), the various minority committee members, including ranking members Maxine Waters, criticized the bill for undoing various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the obligations of SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds.
