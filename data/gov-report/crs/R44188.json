It was created in the 1996 welfare reform law, which rewrote the rules for cash assistance programs for these families. The 1996 law also created TANF as a broad-purpose block grant with state flexibility to design programs to address both the effects of and root causes of childhood economic disadvantage.", "TANF funding is based on the amount of federal and state expenditures in its predecessor programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and related programs) in the early to mid-1990s. The bulk of federal TANF funds is in a basic block grant. Both the national total of the basic block grant, $16.5 billion per year, and each state's grant are based on federal funding in the predecessor programs during this period. States must also expend a minimum amount of their own funds on TANF or TANF-related programs under the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. That minimum totals $10.4 billion per year. The MOE is based on state expenditures in the predecessor programs in FY1994. Over time, states have received some extra TANF funding: welfare-to-work grants, contingency funds, supplemental grants, and bonus funds. However, these grants were small relative to the basic block grant and MOE funding.", "The cash assistance caseload declined substantially in the late 1990s from its 1994 peak, resulting in a decline in spending on TANF basic assistance. In FY1995, under TANF's predecessor programs, AFDC cash assistance represented 70% of total expenditures in the programs consolidated into TANF. By FY2000 cash assistance had declined to 40% of total TANF and MOE funds; in FY2014 cash assistance represented 26% of all TANF and MOE funds. TANF also provides funds for state-subsidized child care programs ($5.1 billion or 16% of total FY2014 TANF and MOE funds) as well as a wide range of services, including those addressing child abuse and neglect and pre-kindergarten programs.", "Most of TANF's financing issues relate to its fixed level of funding, based on programs and conditions that existed in the early and mid-1990s. Neither the national total funding level nor each state's level of funding has been adjusted for changes since then, such as inflation, the size of the cash assistance caseload, or changes in the poverty population. From FY1997 through FY2014, the TANF block grant lost 32% of its value due to inflation alone. The TANF allocation \"locked in\" historical differences among the states that resulted in a wide range of funding levels relative to the number of poor children. Further, TANF potentially lacks a source of sufficient additional funding in case of a future economic downturn. Should Congress seek to address these issues, it would do so in the context of budget rules that apply to TANF as a mandatory program with fixed funding. Current budget rules would require legislation to increase TANF funding to contain corresponding offsets by reducing other mandatory funds and/or increasing revenues."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes for benefits and services to help ameliorate, or address the root causes of, childhood economic disadvantage.

These three programs provided matching grants to states, reimbursing them for a share of the expenditures in their programs. Thus, the federal government and the states shared in the costs of these programs. The system of matching grants for cash assistance for needy families dated back to the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271).", "Under the pre-TANF cash welfare program of AFDC, federal funding was generally provided at the Medicaid matching rate. Under that rate, states with lower per-capita incomes received a higher match, with a statutory minimum matching rate of 50% (for higher income states) and a maximum matching rate of 83% (for the lowest income states). Federal grants for AFDC benefits, AFDC administration (matched at a 50% rate), and EA (matched at a 50% rate) were not subject to caps; federal funds reimbursed states in full for a share of expenditures in their programs. Federal grants for JOBS were subject to annual caps, with matching funds provided up to the cap. The matching rate for JOBS was the Medicaid matching rate, though the statutory minimum matching rate for JOBS was 60% instead of 50%.", "The amount of federal funding in the predecessor programs for a state depended on the expenditures in the state. While there were some federal rules for these predecessor programs, states had a great deal of discretion in determining which families were financially \"needy,\" and hence eligible for benefits, and the amount of benefits received in the state. Under AFDC, there was a great deal of state variation in both income eligibility thresholds and benefits paid in the states, creating variation in state grants relative to their cash assistance caseloads or population related to the program (e.g., number of poor children). This variation is depicted in Figure 1 , which shows the relationship between the AFDC maximum benefit for a family of three in January 1995 and the amount of federal funding per poor child under AFDC and related programs in 1995. As shown, there is a clear relationship between the size of the AFDC benefit provided by a state and federal funding provided per poor child: states with higher maximum benefits also received more federal funding per poor child. For example, in January 1995 Mississippi paid a maximum benefit for a family of three of $120 per month; its grant per poor child in FY1995 was $343. On the other hand, in that month Alaska paid a maximum benefit of $923 per month for a family of three; its FY1995 grant per poor child was $2,403."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1996 Law: \"Freezing\" Historical Funding Levels in the Basic TANF Block Grant", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 welfare reform law substantially rewrote the rules for state cash assistance programs, imposing time limits on benefit receipt and revamping work requirements for adult recipients of aid. Along with these policy changes was a change in the financing of state cash assistance programs and other activities from matching grants to a block grant. ", "The 1996 law consolidated into TANF the three predecessor programs\u2014AFDC, EA, and JOBS\u2014creating a single funding stream. The bulk of the funding is provided in a basic block grant. That block grant reflects peak spending for each state during the FY1992 to FY1995 period in TANF's predecessor programs. (For the formula used in the computation and TANF basic block grant per state, see Table A-1 .) The total of the basic block grant distributed to the 50 states and the District of Columbia is $16.5 billion per year. This is also known as the State Family Assistance Grant. It is not adjusted for changes in conditions either nationally or in each state, such as changes in prices (inflation), the cash assistance caseload, or the population (e.g., poor children). According to the House Committee report accompanying the legislation that became the 1996 welfare reform law, states were given fixed funding to provide them \"with an incentive to help recipients leave welfare because, unlike current law, States do not get more money for having more recipients on the welfare rolls.\" ", "Though the 1996 welfare reform law contemplated no increases in the basic TANF block grant for future years, it also provided that a state could receive no less under the block grant than it historically did under the old system of matching grants to the states. That is, it was \"held harmless\" for the change in financing. However, having the TANF block grant based on historical expenditures had a number of additional implications. One of these is that it also \"froze\" the differences among the states in federal funding relative to their populations. Figure 1 shows how these differences were related to state decisions about their AFDC program; Figure 2 shows a sharp regional pattern in these differences, portraying FY1995 federal funding in TANF's predecessor programs per poor child. Grants per poor child for FY1995 varied from $2,530 in Connecticut to $263 in Arkansas. Generally, grants per poor child in states in the South were less than grants per poor child in states in the N ortheast and Midwest, along the Pacific Coast, and Alaska and Hawaii.", "These state differences have been continued over time as each state's basic block grant has remained \"frozen\" since FY1997. Figure 3 shows the basic TANF block grant (State Family Assistance Grant) per poor child in FY2013. The regional pattern of historical funding differences per poor child from the pre-TANF programs remained in place during that year. In general, funding per poor child was lower in FY2013 than in FY1995 (there were more poor children in 2013 than in 1995), but states in the South continue to have lower grants per poor child than those in the Northeast and Midwest, and along the Pacific Coast. Note that these dollars per poor children are in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. The impact of inflation is discussed in the \" Selected TANF Financing Issues \" section of this report.", "Though funding became more limited, states were given increased flexibility in how funds could be spent. Under TANF, states have the authority to spend their block grants on activities to address both the effects of economic disadvantage (e.g., cash assistance) and what were viewed as some of the root causes of childhood disadvantage (e.g., preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promoting the formation and maintenance of two-parent families)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Federal Funds", "paragraphs": ["The $16.5 billion basic block grant has constituted the bulk of federal funding each year since the enactment of TANF. However, this basic funding has been supplemented in most years by some additional grants to states funded in the TANF law. The additional funding streams are listed below:", "Supplemental grants . During consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 law, funding frozen at levels based on historical expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states: (1) those that had relatively high population growth and (2) those that had historically low welfare grants relative to poverty in the state. One of the purposes of supplemental grants was to address the differences in state funding per assistance family or per poor person shown in Figure 2 . The other purpose was to provide additional funding to states with high rates of population growth. In total, 17 states qualified for supplemental grants: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. Funding for TANF supplemental grants was discontinued after June 30, 2011. Welfare-to-Work Grants . In 1997, President Clinton proposed additional funding for \"welfare-to-work\" grants on the presumption that the basic TANF block grant provided insufficient funding for the increased emphasis on moving cash assistance recipients to work. Congress accepted the proposal in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), providing $3 billion over two years (FY1998 to FY1999) to augment TANF funds with special \"welfare-to-work\" grants. These grants were administered through the Department of Labor (DOL) rather than the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where TANF is administered, and at the state and local level through the workforce system. Additionally, funding was split between formula grants to states (and then passed-through to local workforce boards) and competitive grants. No new welfare-to-work funding was provided after FY1999. Contingency Fund. The fixed basic grant under TANF also led to concerns that funding might be inadequate during economic downturns. The 1996 welfare reform law established a $2 billion \"regular\" TANF contingency fund. To draw upon contingency funds, a state must both (1) meet a test of economic \"need\" and (2) spend from its own funds more than what the state spent in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training in TANF's predecessor programs. The original $2 billion in the contingency fund was depleted in early FY2010; annual appropriations have provided new contingency fund monies for FY2011 through FY2015. Emergency Contingency Fund . The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) provided an additional $5 billion for FY2009 and FY2010. This was partially in response to the anticipated depletion of the regular contingency fund and partially to address that the contingency fund had not always responded to changes in economic circumstances (see Figure 9 ). Unlike regular contingency funds, which could be used for any TANF activity, the ARRA \"Emergency Contingency Fund\" (ECF) financed only increased spending on basic (cash) assistance, short-term emergency aid, and subsidized employment. No ECF funding was provided after FY2010. Bonus Funds . The 1996 welfare reform law, while giving states flexibility, had a number of provisions to hold a state accountable for its performance in meeting TANF's statutory goals. These accountability provisions included two \"bonus funds\"\u2014one for states with reduced out-of-wedlock pregnancy rates and a second that provided bonuses for states with \"high\" levels of performance in meeting TANF's statutory goals. The bonus for reduced out-of-wedlock pregnancies was funded at up to $100 million per year and up to five states could receive funds; the \"high-performance bonus\" provided an average of $200 million per year to states that qualified for it. FY2005 was the last year for which states received bonus funds.", " Figure 4 shows total TANF state grant funding for FY1997 through FY2015. As shown, funding has remained at approximately the same level with slight annual variations since FY1998, with the exception of a spike in funding from the \"Emergency Contingency Fund\" during FY2009 and FY2010. (The funding level discussed here is without adjustment for inflation. The impact of inflation on grants is discussed in the \"Issues\" section of this report.) However, there were no additional \"Emergency Contingency Funds\" after FY2010, and supplemental grants were ended after FY2011. ", "Though the overall level of federal TANF grants to states in FY2015 is about the same as in earlier years, the composition of the grants differs. In the earlier years, funding in addition to the basic block grant came from welfare-to-work grants, supplemental grants, and bonus funds. For FY2012 through FY2015, the only funds in addition to the basic block grant for states were from the contingency fund. While overall funding levels in FY2015 were similar to overall levels in the early 2000s, the group of states that received contingency funds in that year differed from the group of states that received supplemental grants and bonus funds in earlier years. Also, as discussed in \" Recessions and the TANF Block Grant ,\" the level of funding provided by the contingency fund has not been responsive to improvements in the economy over the FY2011 through FY2015 period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The State Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Requirement", "paragraphs": ["TANF consolidated and replaced programs that provided matching grants to the states.

States are required in the aggregate to maintain at least $10.4 billion in spending on specified activities for needy families with children. The $10.4 billion, called the maintenance-of-effort level, represents 75% of what was spent from state funds in FY1994 in TANF's predecessor programs of cash, emergency assistance, job training, and welfare-related child care spending. States are required to maintain their own spending of at least that level, and the MOE requirement increases to 80% of FY1994 spending for states that fail to meet TANF work participation requirements (discussed below).

Thus, there would be a regional pattern to the reallocation of funding: typically, states in the South would have their grants increased, and California and those in the Northeast and Midwest would experience funding decreases. ", " Figure 8 shows this regional pattern, and provides information on the percentage change from the current allocation that would occur with a reallocation of funds based on equal grants per poor child (child poverty in 2013). The state that would experience the largest increase would be Texas, with a 267% rise in its basic block grant relative to current law. The District of Columbia would be the jurisdiction with the largest decrease in block grant funding, with a cut of 64.5%.

As shown in the figure, the contingency fund often has not behaved as a countercyclical source of extra TANF funds. The fund was little used before FY2008. Grants did not increase together with the unemployment rate during the 2001 recession. States generally did not sufficiently increase their own spending, criteria required to access this fund, during that recession.", "Beginning in 2008, grants did increase with the more severe recession of 2007-2009. With the increase in access, it was projected that the $2 billion contingency fund would be exhausted. In fact, the fund was exhausted in early FY2010. Figure 10 also shows grants from the ARRA ECF. It was the ECF\u2014and not the regular contingency fund\u2014that provided the bulk of extra TANF funding in response to the recent severe recession. The ECF expired at the end of FY2010.

Over all years from FY2010 to FY2014, all states except Wyoming (which became ineligible during FY2014) were considered economically needy because they had higher SNAP caseloads than prior to welfare reform (FY1994 or FY1995). SNAP caseloads are projected to remain above those levels for the indefinite future. Therefore, the TANF contingency fund may continue to spend most of its annual appropriations into the future despite the economic recovery. ", "There are some implications of the potential lack of a counter-cyclical funding source for TANF. During the past recession, state government budgets were stressed, with many states cutting back on spending to meet balanced budget requirements. However, for the period when the ECF provided states with extra funds, states generally maintained their TANF benefit amounts. When the ECF expired at the end of FY2010, a number of states reduced their benefits and tightened eligibility for cash assistance.

That is, it could create a fund that would spend less than is currently projected during good economic times, and would provide a higher level of funding in case the economy falls into recession. Though a fund to provide extra grants during recessions might help TANF respond to future economic downturns, there are a number of difficulties in developing such a fund.
