That bar on employment-based immigration lasted until 1952, when Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a sweeping law also known as the McCarran-Walters Act that brought together many disparate immigration and citizenship statutes and made significant revisions in the existing laws. The 1952 act authorized visas for aliens who would perform needed services because of their high educational attainment, technical training, specialized experience, or exceptional ability. Prior to the admission of these employment-based immigrants, however, the 1952 act required the Secretary of Labor to certify to the Attorney General and the Secretary of State that there were not sufficient U.S. workers \"able, willing, and qualified\" to perform this work and that the employment of such aliens would not \"adversely affect the wages and working conditions\" of similarly employed U.S. workers. This provision in the 1952 act established the policy of labor certification. The major reform of INA in 1965 included language that obligated the employers to file labor certification applications (LCAs).", "Within DOL, the former Bureau of Employment Security first administered labor certification following enactment of the policy in 1952. After the abolishment of Employment Security in 1969, the Manpower Administration handled labor certification. In 1975, the Manpower Administration became the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), and ETA continues to oversee the labor certification of aliens seeking to become legal permanent residents (LPRs).

This permanent worldwide immigrant level consists of the following components: 480,000 family-sponsored immigrants; 140,000 employment-based preference immigrants; and 55,000 diversity immigrants.", "The employment-based preference categories are", "first preference : priority workers who are persons of extraordinary ability in the arts, sciences, education, business, or athletics; outstanding professors and researchers; and certain multinational executives and managers; second preference : members of the professions holding advanced degrees or persons of exceptional ability; third preference : skilled workers with at least two years training, professionals with baccalaureate degrees, and unskilled workers in occupations in which U.S. workers are in short supply; fourth preference : special immigrants who largely consist of religious workers, certain former employees of the U.S. government, and undocumented juveniles who become wards of the court; and fifth preference : investors who invest at least $1 million (or less money in rural areas or areas of high unemployment) to create at least 10 new jobs.", "In 1990, Congress had amended the INA to raise the level of employment-based immigration from 54,000 LPR visas to more than 143,000 LPR visas annually. That law also expanded two preference categories into five preference categories and reduced the cap on unskilled workers from 27,000 to 10,000 annually.

Although there were almost the same number of first, second, and third preference employment-based LPRs in FY2007 and FY2008 (155,889 and 155,627, respectively), the number of employment-based LPRs in the extraordinary and exceptional categories rose in FY2008, particularly among those with advanced degrees. Despite the dip to 126,874 employment-based LPRs in FY2009, the first preference extraordinary category rose slightly. In FY2009, the number of skilled and unskilled LPRs was at its lowest level of admissions since FY1999.", "The dip and surge early in the 2000s depicted in Figure 1 was not necessarily the result of labor market demand.
