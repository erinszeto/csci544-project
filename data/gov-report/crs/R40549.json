It also discusses some statutes implicated by fraudulent actions in the secondary mortgage market.", "In general, federal regulation of financial institutions is handled by numerous regulatory agencies. However, criminal liability applies in instances involving criminal intent. Mortgage-related criminal schemes range from fraud committed by an individual borrower for the purpose of obtaining a loan to fraud-for-profit schemes that involve institutions or industry insiders. In general, federal criminal enforcement efforts have focused on schemes involving industry insiders.", "Although there is no one federal crime of \"mortgage fraud,\" many federal statutes may impose criminal liability for mortgage fraud and related schemes. Relevant federal provisions include, among others, those criminalizing mail and wire fraud, financial institutions fraud, and false statements, together with those that impose criminal penalties for violations of federal regulations. Money laundering, conspiracy, and racketeering provisions may provide additional bases for federal criminal liability. In addition, to a limited extent, securities fraud and corporate fraud provisions may apply to fraudulent actions taken in the secondary mortgage market.", "Looking forward, a debate has emerged regarding the adequacy of existing federal criminal provisions. Some have suggested that existing statutory authorities are sufficiently broad and that regulatory reforms are the most appropriate response. Others have argued that several key federal criminal statutes need to be expanded because they do not cover all mortgage companies. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA, S. 386), versions of which have been passed by the Senate and House, would expand the scope of existing criminal provisions, for example by expanding the definition of \"financial institution\" under U.S. criminal law to include mortgage lending businesses."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Recent breakdowns in U.S. financial markets have prompted congressional interest in criminal provisions available to federal prosecutors in cases involving mortgages.

However, several federal criminal provisions \u2013 most notably mail and wire fraud, financial institutions fraud, and a number of crimes involving false statements \u2013 may encompass various fraudulent activities at issue in mortgage fraud cases. The mail and wire fraud statutes have a relatively broad application and are perhaps most likely to apply to those at the high end of the mortgage transaction ladder. Various provisions criminalizing false statements will also apply in some circumstances. In addition, financial institutions fraud provisions apply to instances in which an entity against whom a fraud is perpetrated falls within the definition of \"financial institution\" under federal law. Money laundering, conspiracy, and racketeering provisions may provide additional grounds for federal criminal liability. Other statutes, such as securities fraud provisions, may apply to fraudulent transactions within the secondary mortgage market. Finally, some provisions criminalize violations of federal regulations, creating an important connection between regulatory reforms and the scope of authorities for federal criminal liability.", "Looking forward, legislative proposals address a perceived need to expand the scope of federal statutory authority for mortgage fraud prosecutions. Although the U.S. Constitution's ex post facto clauses prohibit the states and federal government from imposing retroactive criminal penalties, Congress may choose to amend existing law to enhance liability for future crimes and deter fraud which targets people who are newly vulnerable to foreclosure proceedings in the current market or to ensure that wrongdoers are held liable in future situations.

Types of fraud-for-profit schemes that the FBI has identified as having \"currently rising\" incidences include equity skimming, property flipping, mortgage related identity theft, and foreclosure rescue scams. One example of equity skimming involves entities which offer to improve a homeowner's credit or help with mortgage payments by placing title to a home with a third-party \"straw borrower,\" ostensibly to increase the original borrower's credit but actually to draw on the home's equity through the straw borrower. New York State law enforcement authorities brought charges against five people in connection with one such scheme in the Hamptons on Long Island. Similarly, foreclosure rescue scams advertise help with a foreclosure process but collect fees without providing any actual assistance.

For example, in the context of testimony regarding the FBI's mortgage fraud investigations, the FBI's Deputy Director has referred to \"mortgage and related corporate fraud\" and to \"mortgage fraud and related financial institutions fraud.\" This broad approach to the issue results in the inclusion of some activities which are best described as belonging to a criminal law category other than mortgage fraud but which, if kept separate, could result in an incomplete picture of the role of mortgage fraud.", "These related types of corporate, financial institutions, or securities fraud might relate to mortgages in one of at least two ways. First, a financial institution's officer or employee might play an \"industry insider\" role in a mortgage fraud scheme, for example by approving a loan but hiding pertinent information from the lending institution, thus participating directly in mortgage fraud. Alternatively, an employee might have committed an action constituting corporate, securities, or financial institutions fraud in relation to mortgage-backed financial instruments, utilizing mortgage assets that might or might not have been fraudulently obtained, for example by intentionally misstating the value of a mortgage-backed security to shareholders or to the Securities and Exchange Commission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role in the Economic Downturn", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the categorization of fraudulent activities, many believe that mortgage fraud has played an important role in the recent economic downturn.

As banks and private mortgage companies relaxed their standards for loans, approving ever riskier mortgages with less and less due diligence, they created an environment that invited fraud. Private mortgage brokers and lending businesses came to dominate the home housing market, and these companies were not subject to the kind of banking oversight and internal regulations that had traditionally helped to prevent fraud.", "In other words, although such fraud is not the only cause of the crisis, fraudulently obtained mortgages, home loan scams, and other mortgage fraud activities likely contributed to instability in the mortgage markets, which in turn spurred breakdowns in financial markets dependent on mortgage-backed securities.", "Many perceive mortgage fraud and related behavior as a pervasive issue, indirectly affecting the nation's and world's economy and directly affecting thousands, and perhaps even millions, of homeowners.

Such calls prompt questions regarding the respective roles of federal and state prosecutors. For schemes perpetrated for the purpose of defrauding a federal regulatory agency, federal prosecutors are likely to have sole prosecutorial authority. For other schemes, including schemes involving federally regulated institutions, federal and state prosecutors are likely to have overlapping prosecutorial jurisdiction. In those situations, generally speaking, the federal focus is on the prosecution of relatively large fraudulent schemes. However, state prosecutors are not limited to prosecution of smaller schemes and often pursue fraud involving institutions or industry insiders. ", "As discussed, numerous federal regulatory agencies play vital roles in the enforcement and supervision of financial institutions. Since the recent financial downturn, some agencies have implemented regulatory reforms on their own initiative, whereas others have implemented new regulations in response to congressional mandates. For example, as part of the 2009 omnibus spending legislation, Congress directed the Federal Trade Commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to regulate mortgage loans pursuant to its existing regulatory authority within 90 days of the act. Regulatory agencies also often partner with the Justice Department during criminal investigations, although the discretion to pursue criminal prosecution at the federal level ordinarily rests with the Justice Department. ", "Since the breakdown in financial markets, resources for federal criminal investigations and prosecutions have shifted or expanded to emphasize mortgage fraud. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has more than 2,000 active mortgage fraud investigations and has increased the number of mortgage fraud investigators. The United States has obtained guilty pleas in some cases involving \"straw borrower\" schemes. In addition, in June 2008, the Department of Justice conducted \"Operation Malicious Mortgage,\" wherein U.S. Attorneys, with help from the FBI and others, brought charges against more than 400 defendants involved in lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams, and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes. In addition, the Treasury and Justice Departments have announced that the Obama Administration will initiate a coordinated crackdown on foreclosure-rescue and mortgage loan modification fraud in an effort to protect homeowners from new frauds that might be perpetrated to take advantage of individuals \"during these challenging times.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "S. 386", "paragraphs": ["The role of mortgage fraud in the economic downturn has prompted concerns regarding the adequacy of existing federal criminal statutes. In particular, noting the large role that private (i.e., non-federally-chartered) mortgage lending businesses played in the residential mortgage market during the years preceding the recent financial crisis, some perceive a need for an expansion of federal criminal liability to encompass actions perpetrated to defraud such institutions. Such proposals have noted that false statements and schemes to defraud a private mortgage lending businesses currently escape liability under several traditional federal fraud statutes. Namely, neither the institutions fraud statute nor the statute criminalizing false statements on mortgage applications, both discussed infra , applies to frauds perpetrated against a private mortgage lending business. Because many such institutions relaxed their loan standards and are perceived as having contributed to an environment that invited fraud, proposals for expanded authorities generally deemphasize the victimization of such institutions and emphasize the importance of holding accountable the mortgage brokers and others who may have taken advantage of mortgage lending businesses' lax loan standards. ", "On the other hand, other federal fraud statutes, most notably the mail and wire fraud statutes, also discussed infra , authorize criminal liability over frauds perpetrated against private mortgage lenders in many circumstances. In addition, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other measures enacted during the past few decades have substantially increased the penalties pertaining to the mail and wire fraud federal statutes, making the provisions very powerful prosecutorial tools. Consequently, some have indicated that existing statutes provide a sufficient basis for prosecutions connected with the current economic downturn.", "The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( S. 386 ), a bill introduced by Senators Leahy, Grassley, and Kaufman and passed by the Senate \u2013 together with authorizing new funding for the Justice Department, establishing a new federal crime for the misuse of the Troubled Assets Relief Program funds, and amending the federal False Claims Act \u2013 would amend several federal criminal statutes to expand federal criminal liability \"to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, securities fraud, financial institution fraud, and other frauds.\" The amendments most relevant to mortgage fraud include: (1) expanding the definition of \"financial institution,\" which applies in the context of institutions fraud and other sections, to include a \"mortgage lending business,\" defined as \"an organization which finances or refinances any debt secured by an interest in real estate ...\"; (2) adding \"mortgage lending business whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce, or any person or entity that makes ... a federally related mortgage loan\" to the list of entities to which the crime of false statement on a loan or credit application applies; (3) expanding the crime of major fraud against the United States to apply to grants, loans, subsidies, insurance, and other categories, rather than only contracts received from the government; and (4) expanding the definition of \"proceeds\" for money laundering to include gross receipts (as discussed infra , courts currently interpret the definition as encompassing only profits and not gross receipts); and (5) amending the federal securities fraud statute to extend to commodities, including derivatives comprised of mortgage-backed securities.", "The House passed S. 386 after replacing the text with a substitute amendment.

First, although criminal provisions provide maximum penalty amounts, which serve as upper limits for federal courts during the sentencing process, courts determine specific sentences in individual cases after considering recommendations in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.

In such cases, the \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" definition will be relatively easily satisfied. In cases involving lenders or other entities, the analyses will likely turn on whether an action constituted deprivation of \"honest services.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet interpreted this phrase, and the federal circuit courts of appeal have adopted differing interpretations of the scope of \"honest services.\" However, it appears that the mail and wire fraud statutes now apply at least to some fraudulent activities involving intangible property.", "Materiality presents another necessary component to the analysis in mail and wire fraud cases.

Although the Supreme Court has discredited the defense, the U.S. Attorneys, as a general policy, avoid prosecutions in situations that would implicate the doctrine. Second, an \"ambiguity\" defense applies in some circumstances. In particular, criminal liability cannot apply if the question answered was \"truly\" or \"fundamentally\" ambiguous.

One provision makes it a crime to knowingly or intentionally violate 15 U.S.C. \u00a76821, which prohibits accessing \"customer information of a financial institution relating to another person\" by false pretenses. Another provides criminal penalties for the unauthorized participation in profits from a loan with intent to defraud. A third makes it a crime to transfer, including by wire, securities or money with a value of $5,000 or more with knowledge that the property was converted or taken by fraud.", "In addition, a few provisions address kickbacks received in exchange for procurement of loans. One provides a criminal penalties, namely up to 30 years imprisonment and fine up to $1 million (or three times the value of the gift, whichever is greater), for receiving gifts to procure loans. Another provides criminal penalties, including a fine of up to $10,000 and up to one year imprisonment, for giving or accepting kickbacks in exchange for a business referral related to a \"federally related mortgage loan\" and for splitting fees in connection with such loans.", "Another provision criminalizes a government contractor's knowing execution (or attempted execution) of a \"scheme or artifice\" with intent to either defraud the United States or to obtain money or property from the United States by false pretenses. Such \"major fraud\" must involve a prime contract with the United States, and the value of the contract or a part of the contract must be $1 million or more.", "Finally, federal securities fraud provisions could impose criminal liability in situations involving fraudulent behavior related to mortgage-backed securities. The crime of securities fraud applies to activities in connection with \"any security of an issuer with a class of securities\" that is registered under or must file reports pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act. Specifically, penalties including fines and up to 25 years imprisonment apply in cases involving either of the following related to such securities: (1) \"defraud[ing of] any person\"; or (2) \"obtain[ing], by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any money or property.\" This provision could provide a basis for criminal liability in a case involving a mortgage-backed security. However, it would not necessarily reach derivative contracts and other financial transactions that involve mortgage-backed securities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Some individuals have raised concerns regarding additional federal criminalization of white collar crimes. This caution might be especially relevant given the increased penalties that have been established for existing federal crimes over the past few decades. However, as discussed, Congress may choose to amend federal criminal statutes, such as the financial institutions fraud and false statement on a mortgage loan application provisions, to include a broader basis for federal prosecutorial authority in cases involving criminal actions taken related to mortgages. ", "Any legislative proposal to amend criminal provisions will inevitably be shaped by the broader response to the financial downturn. In the mortgage fraud arena, many activities likely walk a fine line between maneuvers that were legal under loose regulatory enforcement, on one hand, and illegal activity, on the other. Partly for that reason, there has been renewed attention given to revamping the federal financial institution regulatory structure. For example, the acting director of the federal Office of Thrift Supervision has called for amendments to existing regulatory authorities that would ensure that more housing debt and finance entities would be subject to federal supervision. In addition, some agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have recently enacted new regulations for which statutory authority already existed or are considering boosting enforcement activities under current authorities. In many cases, such actions would trigger the existing criminal provisions which provide penalties for violations of regulatory provisions. Thus, in some cases, regulatory reforms might effectively expand the scope of federal authority in criminal prosecutions involving mortgage fraud."], "subsections": []}]}}
