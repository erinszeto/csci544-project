The NAICS is used by the federal government to collect and analyze data with regard to the U.S. economy. There is agreement that Green Jobs will relate to renewable energy and energy efficiency, but the extent to which these jobs will be exclusive to these areas is under debate as the skills and training necessary may be transferable from and to other job classifications. The level and specialization of these jobs could vary from tradesmen such as electricians and welders, to technical engineers or financial managers, and from intellectual design to maintenance workers. ", "Part 2 of the legislation focuses on assisting workers impacted by climate change mitigation measures. Climate change mitigation may adversely affect the competitiveness of U.S. industries as legislation requiring adaptation to a low-carbon future has the potential to increase the costs of manufactured products. As such, if a group of workers can show how their current or prospective employment is impaired by such measures, then these workers may apply for climate change adjustment assistance. Assistance may include a monetary allowance while workers are retrained or otherwise seeking new jobs or seeking full employment if their work hours are reduced. The proposed legislation appears to be adaptable to the training needs of affected workers from various employment levels and backgrounds, as assistance may be provided for up to three years for eligible workers.", "Training for Part 1\u2014Green Jobs seems to be focused on providing qualified workers for renewable energy construction projects, i.e., wind and solar projects, energy transmission systems, and energy efficiency jobs envisioned by the act. It is likely that while certain of these jobs will require new skills, many of these jobs can be filled by tradesmen with existing skills in electrical wiring and welding. Other skills in machining and parts fabrication may also be directly transferable. Many of these jobs may require workers to follow projects as they are won and built, and require moving on to where the jobs are. Many of these projects will be built where the renewable resources are best, and for large scale wind or solar thermal projects, this means the broad plains of the Midwest or the sunny arid desert regions of the Southwest. ", "Funds are to be made available to states to carry out the retraining, on-the-job training, career counseling, or other employment services. The federal government may seek to audit use of funds and applicants to guard against fraud or misuse of funds. Eligible workers must be citizens or nationals of the United States, or have \"satisfactory immigration status\" to receive program benefits. Linkages of \"apprenticeship\" and \"pre-apprenticeship\" programs with business and industry needs must be addressed (and eventually with potential employers' needs), and secondary schools prepared to advise students on apprenticeship career options.

Retraining programs and climate adjustment assistance benefits are projected up to three years for eligible workers, during which time the worker may or may not be placed. The worker may then apply for a lump sum for job search assistance or relocation, or both if suitable employment is not found. At the same time, adjustment assistance to climate change-impacted industries is to be made available through allocations and auctions of emissions allowances, but such businesses are likely to downsize to survive. Growth in green industries and other sectors is assumed to provide future employment as companies look to climate change business opportunities. Coordination of government, education, and retraining providers and potential employers on one hand, and corresponding efforts to create or rebuild competitive industrial sectors on the other hand will likely be crucial if the desired economic growth and employment results are to be realized.
