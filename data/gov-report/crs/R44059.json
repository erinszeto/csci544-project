The BCA specifies separate limits for defense and nondefense spending; HUD discretionary programs are subject to the nondefense discretionary limits.

When a plan was not enacted, the BCA required that a one-time sequestration of nonexempt discretionary spending occur in FY2013. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, largely across-the-board spending reductions.) In addition, the BCA required that the discretionary spending limits be lowered further for FY2014 through FY2021. Various amendments to the BCA have been enacted that have altered the discretionary spending reductions that were otherwise scheduled to occur under that law. Most recently, the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 had the effect of lessening the BCA reductions for FY2016 and FY2017, by establishing higher levels for those fiscal years' limits than otherwise would have been the case. Under current law, those BCA reductions are to resume for the FY2018 limits. ", "In each fiscal year, if discretionary funding is enacted that exceeds either of the limits (defense or non-defense), then sequestration will be imposed to reduce spending in the applicable category.
