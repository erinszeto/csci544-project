All government functions can arguably be divided into three categories: those that must be performed by government employees, those that should be performed by government employees, and those suitable for private sector performance. However, the size and content of these categories have fluctuated throughout American history. The \"must\" category has arguably experienced the least fluctuation, whereas the \"should\" and \"private\" categories have significantly increased or diminished over time with changes in administrations or even within administrations (e.g., moving from peacetime to war). The \"Background\" section surveys the history of this public/private debate, focusing particularly upon how it has played out in the context of federal contracting. ", "The debate over DOD functions generally corresponds to the overall public/private debate; however, it sometimes reflects unique aspects of DOD or its procurement system. First, because DOD has two distinct workforces, military and civilian, capable of performing functions, DOD must determine which workforce will perform functions in the \"must\" or \"should\" categories. Where functions in the \"must\" category are concerned, DOD has to determine whether it matters which DOD employees, military or civilian, perform the function. Similarly, where functions in the \"should category\" are concerned, DOD must determine not only whether the function should be performed in-house or by the private sector, but also which workforce will perform functions deemed appropriate for in-house performance. Second, DOD relies upon ammunition and armaments in its operations, items which some commentators at various periods of time have thought should be manufactured by defense agencies in arsenals or Navy shipyards, for example, instead of by the private sector. The arguments for in-house manufacturing of DOD materiels have varied over the years, but have included the claim that manufacturing of weapons is an inherently governmental function and thus falls within the \"must\" category. However, such arguments appear to confuse considerations of national defense policy (i.e., the security of having an in-house supply of important products), which might argue for placing the function in the \"should\" category, with functions \"intimately related to the public interest.\" Third, the federal government has consistently maintained two parallel acquisition systems, civilian and defense, wherein the rules for DOD are not always identical to those for the rest of the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Constitutional Grounding for the Public/Private Debate", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution, with its enumerated powers and limits on these powers, is the logical, best starting point for distinguishing between \"must,\" \"should,\" and commercial functions. The Constitution envisioned certain functions that must be carried out by one branch or other of the federal government. The legislative function of Article I is clearly an inherently governmental function entrusted to Congress. Article II, with equal clarity, entrusted several inherently governmental functions to the President, such as the executive power, the Commander-in-Chief function, the appointment power, the power to conduct foreign affairs, and the granting of pardons. The Constitution also recognized the public/private tension with explicit limitations on certain public functions when they directly affect private interests. For example, takings of private property under the Fifth Amendment must be for public purpose. However, more than 200 years after ratification of the Constitution, commentators are still trying to determine what constitutes a public purpose. The Constitution also recognized and provided for the other end of the spectrum: private functions. The most explicit such recognition is in the Tenth Amendment, which states, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" ", "Very early in American history, the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison recognized that the President and other executive branch officials exercise inherent powers founded upon their discretion and accountability. In Marbury , while addressing whether a judge whose commission was not delivered to him by a new administration had a legal remedy, the Court distinguished between \"ministerial functions\" of the executive branch, which officials are legally required to perform, and \"political powers,\" in which executive officials may exercise discretion. Regarding the latter, the Court stated ", "By the constitution of the United States, the President is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance of these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority and in conformity with his orders.", "These two issues, discretion and accountability, have remained central to discussions of what functions the government must perform to this day. Various commentators would afford the executive branch different degrees of discretion in classifying particular functions as inherently governmental or commercial and seek to hold the executive branch accountable for its classifications to differing degrees and in differing ways. ", "In attempting to protect the public and private sectors as defined by the Constitution, post-Marbury courts articulated various theories and tests, several of which also appear in some recent discussions of inherently governmental functions. One key test focuses upon functions \"affected with the public interest.\" Courts in the 19 th century, in particular, distinguished between functions \"affected with the public interest\" and other functions when determining whether government regulation (an exercise of the public sector) of certain businesses (private-sector entities) was permissible. Where the business was \"affected with a public interest,\" such as common carriers were, courts found the regulation permissible. This test arguably focuses upon the functions that the government \"should\" or \"may\" perform, however, rather than those that the government \"must\" perform. Another key test focused upon \"public interests\" or \"public functions.\" This test was used to determine when private-sector entities were accountable to individuals for certain public-sector protections, such as due process. The courts concluded that when entities, such as company towns, performed public functions, they owed individuals due process. Another key test, largely used in the 1930s, was the \"private delegation doctrine,\" which precluded Congress from delegating its power to legislate (a public-sector power) to third parties not in the government (private-sector entities).

The emphasis has also shifted depending upon which agencies are conducting the procurements and the nature of the goods or services procured.

The George W. Bush Administration could be described as having an even narrower conception of the role of the public sector. Among other things, the Bush Administration proposed amending OMB Circular A-76 so that all functions were presumed commercial unless agencies justified why they were inherently governmental.

For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as transportation, food, and maintenance.

OMB Circular A-76 also provided procedures for agencies to conduct cost comparisons to determine whether the government or private enterprises should perform specific activities on the government's behalf. However, although OMB Circular A-76 established policies and procedures, it reportedly failed to result in public-private competitions for performance of commercial activities, or agencies' contracting with the private sector for performance of their commercial activities. The FAIR Act sought to address this situation by requiring agencies to compile annual lists of all commercial activities they perform and make these lists available to Congress and the public. The FAIR Act does not require agencies to contract out any particular activities, however. It requires only that agencies use competitive processes to select the source when they consider contracting with private sector sources for performance of certain activities performed by government employees.", "Although the FAIR Act's primary focus is upon commercial activities performed by government agencies, it defined inherently governmental functions in order to contrast them with commercial activities.

The range of mission essential functions, for example, could include any function necessary for the completion of a task, not just those functions that must be performed by government employees because they are \"intimately related to the public interest.\" Translating directions from a foreign language into English could be mission essential (e.g., necessary in order for commanders to get troops from Point A to Point B) without being inherently governmental (e.g., if the troops were on a routine patrol in friendly territory). Replacing \"inherently governmental functions\" with one of these terms could thus expand the range of functions exempt from contracting out, which might also constitute a short-term solution to any alleged over-reliance on contractors. However, this approach would not necessarily address which functions government employees must perform because they are in the public interest. Moreover, tying functions more closely to agency operations than to the public interest could result in situations where a function is categorized differently by different agencies.

Enactment of legislation classifying particular functions as inherently governmental is necessarily ad hoc , and often possible only after agencies have already engaged in allegedly improper contracting for performance of inherently governmental functions. Mandatory training for agency officials could cost money, and it would be hard to ensure that the persons providing the training would categorize specific functions in the same way that some Members of Congress or commentators would.

Section 730 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008, for example, specifies that ", "[n]one of the funds made available in this Act may be used to study, complete a study of, or enter into a contract with a private party to carry out, without specific authorization in a subsequent Act of Congress, a competitive sourcing activity of the Secretary of Agriculture, including support personnel of the Department of Agriculture, relating to rural development or farm loan programs. ", "Such approaches do not require any changes in the definition of inherently governmental functions, and they remove all possible questions about whether the executive branch will categorize a function as Congress might wish. These approaches are probably best utilized as tailored responses to specific concerns, however, because they are reactive and potentially time-limited. Congress generally uses these approaches on an ad hoc basis in response to agencies' contracting out, or proposed contracting out, of specific functions. Moreover, if included in an appropriations bill, such prohibitions could be limited to specific agencies or time periods. Prohibitions in a DOD appropriations bill would not necessarily apply to the Department of State, for example, and prohibitions could be limited to funds covered by the appropriation, or automatically carried over to future appropriations bills long after the situation prompting the prohibition has otherwise been resolved.", "A more general prohibition on the use of the OMB Circular A-76 process, such as was in place through September 30, 2009, might seem helpful in preventing the contracting out of inherently governmental functions because it addresses all contracting out under OMB Circular A-76. However, such an approach is arguably both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. It is over-inclusive in the sense that prohibiting agencies' contracting out under OMB Circular A-76 encompasses all functions performed by the government, not just those that are allegedly inherently governmental. OMB Circular A-76 articulates the competitive process that agencies are to use in source selection whenever they consider contracting with private sector sources for the performance of commercial activities performed by government employees. It thus potentially applies to contracts for functions that are generally not considered to be inherently governmental (e.g., custodial services), as well as to those for functions that some might argue are inherently governmental (e.g., acquisitions-related functions). A general prohibition on the use of the A-76 process is also under-inclusive in the sense that A-76 addresses only commercial functions performed by government employees. It does not apply to new functions, which have not been performed by government employees, nor does it provide a mechanism for \"insourcing,\" or determining whether government employees or contractors should perform functions currently performed by contractors. Such a prohibition may also generate opposition from trade groups if it appears designed to protect government employees at the expense of contractor employees. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Structural Factors Prompting Agencies to Rely on Contractors", "paragraphs": ["Some commentators have suggested that Congress could potentially make agencies less prone to contract out allegedly inherently governmental functions, or other functions, by addressing structural factors that may lead agencies to rely on contractors instead of military personnel or civil servants. \"Personnel ceilings\" have been identified as one such factor. A personnel ceiling establishes the maximum number of positions that may be budgeted in a job category or for all personnel in an organization. Although DOD is prohibited from converting a function performed by DOD civilian personnel to contractor performance to circumvent a personnel ceiling, it is otherwise subject to ceilings on the number of civilian employees and military personnel. It may also hire contractors without engaging in public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76 when converting functions from military to DOD civilian performance if the director of the local Human Resources Office determinates that civilian employees cannot be hired. Some commentators have suggested that DOD relied on contractors to perform certain functions, most notably acquisition functions, in part because of the operation of such personnel ceilings. Recently enacted or introduced legislation removed or would remove personnel ceilings imposed by the executive branch, as well as certain congressionally imposed ceilings on the number of DOD personnel. However, such legislation does not address congressionally imposed ceilings outside DOD, or troop needs in situations where DOD civilian personnel cannot be substituted for military ones and there are insufficient volunteers for the military. However, complete removal of personnel ceilings is not possible because of limits on the use of appropriated funds and, arguably, would not comport with some Members' desire to keep agencies within their budgets.", "Another factor involves the ease of hiring and firing government personnel. Because of the procedural requirements for hiring new federal employees, as well as the procedural protections ensuring that federal employees are not improperly dismissed, agencies can experience difficulties matching their existing personnel to the functions they need to perform when there are sudden changes in their missions. An unanticipated need for workers to perform a new function, or the actual or anticipated ending of a particular mission, poses particular problems. This factor may become less salient over time, however, as Congress has given, or is considering giving, agencies expedited or other hiring authorities, and agencies have begun creating some term-limited positions for federal employees. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Effective Oversight of Executive Branch Contracting Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Congress receives some information about agencies' contracting decisions under the FAIR Act, but this information may be insufficient to enable Congress to adequately ascertain which functions agencies may be improperly contracting out. Under the FAIR Act, agencies must compile annual lists of all activities they perform that are not inherently governmental and make these lists available to Congress and the public. However, such lists include only functions that agencies currently perform, not new functions, and the listings may not provide Congress or the public with enough information to ascertain whether a listed function is, in fact, commercial, as Figure 2 illustrates. Moreover, under the FAIR Act, agencies' lists are not directed to any specific committee(s) of Congress, nor is there an established procedure for congressional review of or response to the lists once they are received. This is not to say that Congress and its Members cannot or do not exercise their oversight functions in response to specific items on agencies' FAIR Act inventories. It does, however, mean that congressional involvement with FAIR Act inventories is ad hoc , not systemic, which could limit Congress's ability to provide effective oversight of contracting out under the FAIR Act. Systemic congressional involvement in the OMB Circular A-76 process is equally limited. OMB Circular A-76 focuses primarily upon public notice, as Figure 3 illustrates; notice to Congress is mentioned only as an accompaniment to public notice. ", "Congress has recently considered several proposals that would increase the information about agencies' contracting decisions available to Congress and/or the public. The CLEAN-UP Act, for example, would require that the Chief Acquisition Officer of each agency, or his or her equivalent, certify that each function to be performed under an agency service contract (including task or delivery orders and exercises of options) is not inherently governmental, closely related to inherently governmental, or mission essential. In addition, agency heads would have to report to the head of OMB annually on each contract, with the report being posted on the Internet and notice of the report's availability being published in the Federal Register . The hope is, apparently, that increased congressional or public awareness of agencies' decisions may diminish the likelihood that an agency will improperly classify as commercial an activity that is arguably inherently governmental. With increased awareness of potentially problematic decisions, Congress could exercise oversight or enact legislation. However, oversight may be insufficient to get an agency to change its classification of a particular function, especially in the short term, and enacting legislation can take time. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focusing on Questions of Contracting Policy", "paragraphs": ["Another option for Congress would be to shift its focus from questions of contracting law to questions of contracting policy, or from discussions of whether specific functions are inherently governmental to discussions of which of the functions that are not inherently governmental should be performed in-house. The current discussions regarding the definition of inherently governmental functions, or whether certain functions are inherently governmental, do not address what should be done with those functions which are not inherently governmental. Agencies are presently answering these questions on an ad hoc basis, without appreciable congressional guidance, in part because the only government-wide authorities on contracting out were designed for different purposes and focus upon contracting out of commercial functions. The FAIR Act focuses upon listings of commercial functions that could be lawfully contracted out, while OMB Circular A-76 focuses upon how to determine whether government employees or the private sector will perform specific commercial functions. ", "No legislation, regulation, or policy document systematically addresses how agencies should determine which of the non-inherently governmental functions they perform should be performed in-house because of concerns related to transparency, accountability, employment policy, or related issues, although commentators have proposed some such frameworks. Figure 4 illustrates one possible model for separating questions of contract law from those of contract policy, while Figure 5 illustrates one model for deciding questions of contracting policy. The need for \"balance\" and \"reasonableness\" in agencies' use of contractors, as well as their need to \"maintain agency capability to perform core functions\" have been particularly noted. However, discussions of \"balance\" and \"reasonableness\" can have two different focal points. While the focus is often on the perceived overuse of contracting out, there are those who believe that the problem is under-use of the private sector. The Freedom from Government Competition Act of 2009, for example, takes the latter view. The cost of performing functions is assessed as part of the A-76 process, although there have been some concerns about how accurately this process reflects the costs of either performance in-house or by contractors.", "Congress has arguably recently begun to pay increased attention to questions of contract policy. Sections 3 and 11 of the CLEAN UP Act, for example, encourage executive branch agencies to pursue business process engineering, \"even if such efforts reduce or increase the need for Federal employees or contractors.\" Business process engineering is, however, more concerned with cost-savings in operations than it is with decision making as to who performs specific functions. Congress could take additional actions to focus attention on questions of contracting policy by, among other things, holding hearings at which agencies can present and discuss their developing frameworks for deciding questions of contracting policy, mandating that executive branch officials develop a framework for deciding questions of contracting policy, or legislatively establishing such a framework to be used by executive branch officials. ", "A focus on contracting policy may also allow Congress to better address related questions, such as the management and oversight of contractors' work, that often get caught up in the debate over inherently governmental functions, but are arguably separate from it. For example, some commentators seem to desire the expansion of the category of inherently governmental functions because there have been problems with contractor performance under specific contracts and classifying a function as inherently governmental ensures that a contractor cannot lawfully perform that function. However, while it may be tempting to conflate \"shall\" and \"should\" and categorize all functions as inherently governmental whenever there are any possible grounds for saying that the government \"should\" perform them, such an approach could constrain the options of future administrations and avoids the question of which functions must be performed by the government in every case. A function that should be performed by the government could potentially be contracted out in an emergency if it cannot be performed in-house. The same would not be true of an inherently governmental function. ", "Appendix A. Examples of Congressional and Executive Branch Interactions in Defining Inherently Governmental Functions During the 1980s", "Some illustrations of Congress's responses to attempts by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations to contract out certain functions during the 1980s may help to clarify the give-and-take in the current debate over the public and private sectors and contracting out. During this period, Congress frequently used the appropriations rider to counter contracting-out decisions. An appropriations rider places conditions\u2014generally in the form of language specifying that \"no funds shall be used for\"\u2014on the outsourcing of a particular type of function or on outsourcing in general. Alternatively, an appropriations rider might impose conditions that must be met before funds can be expended (e.g., a report to Congress). This type of legislation is easily tailored to particular concerns, but is generally only effective for the period of the appropriation.", "Appropriations Riders", "General Prohibitions on Contracting Out", "An example of a general prohibition on contracting out was contained in the Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY1983, which provided that none of the funds appropriated under the act for the General Services Administration (GSA) could be obligated or expended to contract out any service performed by GSA employees. Another example of a general prohibition was contained in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for FY1989, which prohibited the use of funds authorized by the act to contract out any function currently performed by federal employees at the Kansas City National Weather Service Training Center.", "Prohibitions on Contracting Out Specific Functions", "The 1984 appropriation for GSA illustrates a more specific type of restriction on contracting out. The continuing resolution for FY1984 specified that no funds could be expended by GSA to contract out any guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodian functions performed by GSA employees. However, the act granted an exception for certain services contracted out to sheltered workshops employing the \"severely handicapped.\" Another example of a prohibition on contracting out specific functions can be found in the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for FY1989, which prohibited use of any funds made available under the act to contract out positions at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police Force. ", "Requiring Agencies to Meet Certain Conditions Prior to Contracting Out", "There were also many instances where Congress required agencies to meet certain conditions before they could use appropriated funds to implement any outsourcing decision. The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for FY1989, for example, specified that none of the funds provided under the act could be obligated, or expended through a reprogramming of funds, to contract out any function or activity performed by federal employees without first notifying the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY1989 similarly prohibited the use of funds appropriated by the act for contracting out any activity performed by the Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia unless the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress received advance notice.", "Specifying Procedures for Contracting Out", "Another approach was to limit agencies' discretion by prescribing how particular agencies should approach their outsourcing decisions. Congress used this approach to address both contracting out generally and contracting out of specific functions. For example, Congress sometimes enacted statutes setting out the criteria that an agency must use in making outsourcing determinations, the procedure it must follow in any public/private cost comparisons, definitions of key terms (e.g., \"inherently governmental functions\"), penalties for violations, and any specific or generic exemptions. Chapter 146 of Title 10 of the United States Code, which governs DOD contracting for performance of civilian commercial or industrial functions, illustrates this type of legislation. Chapter 146 has provisions (1) specifying the studies and reports that DOD must perform before converting a function; (2) defining and exempting \"core functions;\" (3) listing the requirements for conducting cost comparisons involving retirement costs; and (4) listing specifically exempted functions. ", "Interestingly, Chapter 146 was not enacted as one statute, but resulted from several provisions enacted during the 1980s, as the following chronology illustrates. ", "Departme nt of D efense Authorization Act for FY 1980 . This act prohibited DOD from converting, during that fiscal year, any commercial or industrial function of DOD performed by DOD personnel as of November 9, 1979, to performance by a contractor unless the Secretary of Defense notified Congress. Two types of notification were required. First, the Secretary was to notify Congress of any decision to study possible conversion and certify that the government in-house cost calculation for the function was based on an estimate of the most efficient and cost-effective organization for in-house performance. Then, if a decision to convert the function was ultimately made, the Secretary had to report (1) the economic impact on the employees affected, the community, and the federal government; (2) the effects of the conversion on the military mission of the function; and (3) the amount of the private bid for performance of the function, the cost if the function were continued in-house, and any costs or expenditures the government would incur because of the contract. The act also prohibited, during the fiscal year, any conversion to circumvent civilian personnel ceilings. The act exempted funds appropriated for any fiscal year for DOD research, development, testing, or evaluation, or procurement or production related thereto, unless the funds were obligated or expended for operation or support of installations or equipment used for research and development, including maintenance support for laboratories, operation and maintenance of test ranges, or maintenance of test aircraft and ships. Departme nt of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1981 . This act contained restrictions on contracting out that were nearly identical to those included in the DOD authorization for FY1980, but made these restrictions permanent law with an effective date of October 1, 1980. The act prohibited converting any commercial or industrial function of DOD performed by DOD personnel on October 1, 1980, to performance by a private contractor unless the Secretary of Defense provided the following information to Congress in a timely manner: (1) notice of any decision to study possible conversion; (2) a detailed summary comparing the cost of DOD personnel performing the function and performance by a private contractor and demonstrating that privatization of the function would result in cost savings to the government over the life of the contract; (3) certification that the government's in-house cost calculation for the function was based on an estimate of the most efficient and cost-effective organization for in-house performance; (4) a report on the economic impact of the proposed contract on the employees affected, the community, and the federal government; (5) the effects of the conversion on the military mission of the function; and (6) the amount of the private bid for performance of the function, the cost if the function were to be continued in-house, and any cost or expenditure which the government would incur because of the contract. If DOD decided to convert the function after these studies were completed, the Secretary of Defense had to report this decision to Congress. The effective date of this provision was October 1, 1980. The act also prohibited conversion to circumvent civilian personnel ceilings. Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1983 . This act amended the 1981 authorization for DOD so that the foregoing prohibitions applied only to functions performed by civilian employees of DOD, as opposed to DOD personnel. It exempted functions performed by 10 or fewer DOD civilian employees, but prohibited modification, reorganization, or division of functions to take advantage of this exemption. The amendment also provided that the restrictions of the act should not apply during war or declared national emergencies. The effective date of this amendment was October 1, 1982. The act also specifically prohibited use of any funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization to contract out firefighting or security-guard functions at any military facility except for the renewal of existing contracts. The act also placed a six-month moratorium on use of any funds appropriated under this authorization for new studies of the benefits or feasibility of contracting out functions performed by DOD civilian employees except for custodial, laundry, refuse collection, grounds maintenance, food service and preparation, and base transportation functions. The six-month period ran from October 1, 1982, to March 31, 1983. Department of Defense Author ization Act for FY 198 4 . This act continued for two years the prohibition on contracting out DOD firefighting and security-guard functions that had been initiated in the DOD authorization for FY1983. The extended prohibition did not apply to contracts to be performed outside the United States, situations where the use of military personnel would affect unit readiness, contracts to be carried out on government-owned but privately operated installations, or renewal of existing contracts. Department of Defense Authorizat ion Act for FY 1985 . This act required the Secretary of Defense to identify logistics activities that are essential to the national defense. The act prohibited contacting out these activities unless the Secretary provided Congress with a \"waiver\" stating that the activity was no longer required for national defense, as well as the criteria used in granting the waiver. Departmen t of Defense Authorization Act for FY 1986 . This act declared that certain functions of DOD should be deemed logistics activities essential to the national defense under Section 307 of P.L. 98-525 . These functions were depot-level maintenance of mission essential materiel at certain facilities of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Defense Logistics Agency, and Defense Mapping Agency.", "Codifying Restrictions from Appropriations Riders", "As the notes under many of the foregoing provisions indicate, numerous limitations were codified late in the 99 th Congress and or in the 100 th Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1987, for example, codified the prohibition on contracting out DOD firefighting functions that had been initiated in the DOD authorization for FY1983. However, this prohibition did not apply to contracts performed outside the United States, situations where use of military personnel affected unit readiness, contracts performed on government-owned but privately operated installations, or renewal of existing contracts. The prohibition on contracting out security-guard functions was continued for one year with the same exceptions as for firefighter functions. Also exempted from this prohibition were contracts for security-guard services when the requirement for the services arose after the effective date of the act and the Secretary of Defense determined that the functions could be contracted out without adversely affecting installation security, safety, or readiness. The act also codified the general policy on contracting out noted earlier, (i.e., that DOD should contract out any function not prohibited by law if it would be provided at a lower cost\u2014including any cost differential required by law, executive order, or regulation\u2014by the private sector). Guidelines were provided for determining if money would be saved by contracting out. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1988 and 1989 similarly made permanent the prohibition on contracting out security-guard functions at DOD facilities, with the same exemptions as apply to firefighter functions. ", "Permanent Laws", "In addition to appropriations riders, Congress also enacted permanent laws to limit outsourcing. For example, the Veterans' Compensation, Education, and Employment Amendments of 1982 prohibited contracting out medical care provided by what was then the Veterans Administration (VA). If the VA determined that an activity was not a direct patient care activity, or an activity incident to direct patient care, it could contract out the activity provided that the then-Administrator of the VA made two determinations after conducting a study required by the act. First, the Administrator of the VA had to determine that (1) the costs to the government (including the costs of the study) would be lower by 15% or more than the costs of in-house performance and (2) the quality or quantity of health care services would be maintained or enhanced by the contract.", "The Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 similarly required the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to notify the President of the Senate; the Speaker of the House; the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries; and the House Committee on Science and Technology at least 30 days before awarding any contract for the performance of a commercial activity as defined in OMB Circular A-76. The notice had to include a description of the contract, a comparison of the costs of and services provided by contracting out or in-house performance, and an assessment of the benefits to the federal government of proceeding with the proposed contract.", "The Sikes Act Extension and Amendments authorized the Secretary of Defense to enter into cooperative plans with the Secretary of the Interior and state agencies for the development, maintenance, and coordination of wildlife, fish, and game conservation and rehabilitation on military reservations. The implementation and enforcement of these plans was specifically exempted from OMB Circular A-76 and priority was given to federal and state agencies.
