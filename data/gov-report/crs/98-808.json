It reaches false statements in federal court and grand jury sessions as well as congressional hearings and administrative matters but not the statements of advocates or parties in court proceedings. Under Section 1001, a statement is a crime if it is false, regardless of whether it is made under oath.", "In contrast, an oath is the hallmark of the three perjury statutes in Title 18. The oldest, Section 1621, condemns presenting material false statements under oath in federal official proceedings. Section 1623 of the same title prohibits presenting material false statements under oath in federal court proceedings, although it lacks some of Section 1621's traditional procedural features, such as a two-witness requirement. Subornation of perjury, barred in Section 1622, consists of inducing another to commit perjury. All four sections carry a penalty of imprisonment for not more than five years, although Section 1001 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than eight years when the offense involves terrorism or one of the various federal sex offenses. The same five-year maximum penalty attends the separate crime of conspiracy to commit any of the four substantive offenses.", "A defendant's false statements in the course of a federal criminal investigation or prosecution may also result in an enhanced sentence under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for the offense that was the subject of the investigation or prosecution.", "This report is available in abbreviated form\u2014without footnotes, quotations, or citations\u2014as CRS Report 98-807, False Statements and Perjury: A Sketch of Federal Criminal Law."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Lying, or making a false statement, is a federal crime under a number of circumstances.

Depending on the final offense level otherwise applicable to a particular crime, the impact of a 2-level increase spans from no impact at the lowest final offense levels to a difference of an additional 68 months at the highest levels.", "Section 3C1.1 instructs sentencing courts to add 2 offense levels in the case of an obstruction of justice:", "If (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.", "The accompanying commentary explains that the section \"is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right.\" More specifically, a \"defendant's denial of guilt (other than a denial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury), refusal to admit guilt or provide information to a probation officer, or refusal to enter a plea of guilty is not a basis for application of this provision.\" Early on, the Supreme Court made it clear that an individual's sentence might be enhanced under Section 3C1.1, if he committed perjury during the course of his trial. Moreover, the examples provided elsewhere in the section's commentary and the cases applying the section confirm that it reaches perjurious statements in a number of judicial contexts and to false statements in a number of others. The examples in the section's commentary cover conduct: ", "(B) committing, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury, including during the course of a civil proceeding if such perjury pertains to conduct that forms the basis of the offense of conviction;", "(F) providing materially false information to a judge or magistrate;", "(G) providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense;", "(H) providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court; [and]", "(I) other conduct prohibited by obstruction of justice provisions under Title 18, United States Code ( e.g. , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71510, 1511). ", "The courts have concluded that a sentencing enhancement under the section is appropriate, for instance, when a defendant has (1) given perjurious testimony at his suppression hearing; (2) made false statements to the probation officer for the presentence report; (3) given perjurious, exculpatory testimony at the separate trial of his girl-friend; (4) made false statements in connection with a probation officer's bail report; (5) made false statements to the court in an attempt to change his guilty plea; (6) made false statements to federal investigators; (7) encouraged a witness to lie to the police or on the stand; (8) made false statements to state investigators relating to conduct for which the defendant was ultimately convicted; or (9) given preposterous, perjurious testimony during his own trial. The lower federal appellate courts are divided over the question of whether an obstruction of justice enhancement may be based on a defendant's false statement of indigence in order to secure appointment of counsel. ", "When perjury provides the basis for a sentencing enhancement under the section, the court must find that the defendant willfully testified falsely with respect to a material matter. Thus, the court must find that \"the defendant consciously act[ed] with the purpose of obstructing justice.\" When based upon a false statement not under oath, the statement must still be material, that is, it must \"tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\" Even then, false identification at the time of arrest only warrants a sentencing enhancement under the section when the deception significantly hinders the investigation or prosecution."], "subsections": []}]}}
