A stated objective of the U.S. Public Health Service, set out in its report Healthy People 2010 , is to increase the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their children. The national objective set out in this report is to achieve a 75% participation rate of nursing mothers in the early postpartum period, a 50% participation rate of nursing mothers in the period after the infant reaches six months of age, and a 25% participation rate of nursing mothers at the age of one year. Numerous health care professionals encourage breastfeeding as the optimal type of nutrition for infants for at least the first six months of life. It has been reported that in 2000, more than 68% of mothers were breastfeeding their infants immediately after delivery, and it has been observed that the number of nursing mothers is significantly increasing. Breastfeeding rates increased steadily from 1992-2004. Breastfeeding is considered to be beneficial to both mother and child, and breastfeeding is believed to reduce the incidence of various childhood illnesses and chronic diseases.", "Along with the growing popularity of breastfeeding and the growing incidence of women in the workforce, certain concerns have arisen. It may be necessary for a working mother to express milk during her working hours, and/or to breastfeed her child during working hours. Related issues concern nursing and/or the expression of milk in public or semi-public places such as restaurants, stores, public transportation facilities, and other locations where the public is present. Numerous legal issues and controversies have developed concerning where a mother may breastfeed her child.", "Concurrent with the growing popularity of breastfeeding, state and federal legislation relating to breastfeeding has been proposed and enacted. There has been significant legislation at the state level. Some of the legal issues which state legislation has addressed include exemption of nursing mothers from public nudity, lewdness, and indecent exposure laws; affirmation that breastfeeding is to be permitted in public places where the mother and child are lawfully present; and exemption (or postponement) of nursing mothers from jury service. Other states have enacted laws dealing with breastfeeding in the workplace; breastfeeding awareness education campaigns; and various breastfeeding support programs. At the current time, thirty-eight states and Puerto Rico have some type of legislation dealing with the protection of nursing mothers and/or the promotion of breastfeeding.", "Another legal issue that has arisen at the state level involves various issues concerning breastfeeding mothers and jury duty. Various states have enacted legislation to excuse or postpone the jury duty of a breastfeeding mother.", "At the federal level, Congress has established various federal programs to encourage the practice of breastfeeding and to improve child nutrition, especially infant nutrition. Congress has also enacted legislation, in appropriations measures, to affirm the right of a mother to breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the mother and child are otherwise authorized to be present at that location. This legislation is examined below. This practice has been promulgated into federal regulations.", "Legislation to significantly broaden federal fostering of the practice of breastfeeding has been introduced in the 109 th Congress. This proposal, contained in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2005 ( H.R. 2122 ), follows proposals introduced in the 108 th Congress to encourage and protect breastfeeding through amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Internal Revenue Code.

The stated purpose of the proposed amendment to Title VII is to promote the health and well-being of infants whose mothers return to the workplace after childbirth and clarify that breastfeeding and expressing breast milk in the workplace are protected conduct under the amendment made by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 to Title VII of the act.
