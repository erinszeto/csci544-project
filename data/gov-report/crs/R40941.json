In military servicemembers, TBI may result from those kinds of events or from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortars, grenades, bullets, or mines. Some explosives cause a blast wave (i.e., over-pressurization force), which may result in TBI without outward physical signs of injury. TBI caused by blast waves may be accompanied by other injuries (e.g., to hearing or vision). The DOD reports that in 2013 (the most recent full-year data), a total of 27,324 servicemembers sustained TBI.

Another method determines severity based on the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (i.e., an inability to recall events that occur after the injury, accompanied by disorientation or confusion). The Glasgow Coma Scale takes into account multiple signs of TBI, assigning points in three areas (eye opening, verbal response, and motor response), such that the sum of points ranges from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater severity of TBI.

In general, the Office of Research and Development funds intramural research by individual VA investigators and researchers. Research related to TBI includes developing and testing new treatments, as well as studying changes in the brain, thinking, and psychological well-being. Research on TBI and related conditions may also be conducted under the auspices of the VA's Mental Health Strategic Healthcare Group, which supports research efforts conducted at the National Center for PTSD, four Centers of Excellence, and 10 Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Centers.", "The VA is collaborating with the Department of Education's National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) to develop the Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans Health Registry, which is intended to facilitate future research by providing longitudinal data on the demographics, military service, injury, and treatment of all OEF/OIF veterans with TBI. The VA is also working with the NIDRR to establish a database similar to the institute's existing TBI Model System National Database (established in 1989), which is intended to facilitate research collaboration and program evaluation. Congress has encouraged and in some cases required the VA to collaborate with other entities involved in TBI research. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( P.L. 110-181 ) required the VA to collaborate with the TBI rehabilitation research community, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, NIDRR grantees, and other governmental entities engaged in TBI rehabilitation.
