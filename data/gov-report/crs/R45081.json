To address the risks of bank failures and excessive risk-taking, and the problem that consumers at times lack the information or expertise to make sound choices concerning financial products and services, both federal and state lawmakers have imposed a host of regulations on commercial banks.", "The United States has what is referred to as a \"dual banking system,\" in which banks can choose to apply for a charter from a state banking authority or a federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau within the Department of the Treasury. A bank's choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator, as state regulatory agencies serve as the primary regulators of state-chartered banks, and the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks. Despite receiving their authorities from state law, state banks are subject to many federal laws. Among other federal laws, state banks are subject to certain federal tax, consumer protection, and antidiscrimination laws. Similarly, although they receive their powers from federal law, national banks are not wholly immune from state law. Rather, national banks are often subject to generally applicable state laws concerning contracts, torts, property rights, and debt collection when those laws do not conflict with or frustrate the purpose of federal law.", "Nonetheless, federal law preempts state laws that interfere with the powers of national banks. In Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, the Supreme Court held that the National Bank Act of 1864 (NBA) preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with a \"national bank's exercise of its powers\"\u2014a standard that lower courts have applied to hold a wide variety of state laws preempted. The Court has also issued two decisions on the preemptive scope of a provision of the NBA limiting \"visitorial powers\" over national banks to the OCC, holding that the provision extends to the operating subsidiaries of national banks, but does not bar state judicial law enforcement actions against national banks. Finally, the OCC has taken a broad view of the preemptive effects of the NBA, a view that it has reaffirmed after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank).", "This report provides an overview of the respective roles of the federal government and the states in regulating banking.

Among other things, banks provide loans to businesses, help individuals finance purchases of cars and homes, and offer services such as checking and savings accounts, debit cards, and ATMs. As of December 2017, there were 888 nationally chartered banks in the United States holding a total of slightly less than $11 trillion in assets, and 4,040 state-chartered banks holding a total of slightly more than $5 trillion in assets. Banking has also played a central role in American political culture, from President Jackson's criticism of the Second Bank of the United States to the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement, making banking regulation an issue of perennial interest to Congress.", "Many commentators regard banking regulation as essential to the protection of depositors and consumers, the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, and the promotion of an efficient and competitive financial system. More specifically, observers have argued that bank regulation is warranted to correct for a number of market failures, including, among other things: (1) the risk of bank failures, which impose externalities on the financial system when they cause depositors to withdraw their assets from solvent banks; (2) the possibility that access to government deposit insurance, central bank liquidity, and government bailouts will cause banks to take on excessive risk (a problem often referred to as \"moral hazard\"); and (3) the possibility that consumers at times lack sufficient information or expertise to make sound choices regarding financial products and services (a problem often referred to as \"asymmetric information\"). To address these risks, regulators have, among other things, restricted the activities that banks may engage in, required that banks maintain minimum levels of capital and government deposit insurance, and enacted consumer protection measures related to usury, predatory lending, home foreclosures, debt collection, and mandatory disclosures in lending. This complex regulatory apparatus has raised important issues concerning the division of authority between the federal government and the states, and the related question of how to treat cases where federal and state regulations overlap.", "This report provides an overview of the respective roles of the federal and state governments in regulating banking.

Proponents of broad preemption often cite the benefits of uniform national regulations and the concentration of expertise in federal agencies. Opponents of broad preemption, by contrast, often appeal to the importance of policy experimentation and the enhanced democratic accountability that they believe accompanies state and local regulation.", "The Supreme Court has identified two general ways in which federal law can preempt state law. Federal law can preempt state law expressly where a federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language\u2014that is, where a clause in the relevant federal law explicitly provides that it displaces certain categories of state law. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 contains an express preemption clause providing that some of the Act's provisions \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" described elsewhere in the statute.", "Federal law can also preempt state law impliedly , \"when Congress' command is . . . implicitly contained in\" the relevant federal law's \"structure and purpose.\" The Court has identified two subcategories of implied preemption. First, \"field preemption\" occurs \"where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\" Second, \"conflict preemption\" occurs where \"compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\" or where state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" In Hines v. Davidowitz , for example, the Court held that a federal law imposing registration requirements on aliens ages 14 and over\u2014but not going so far as to impose a fee for registration or require that aliens carry an identification card\u2014preempted a state statute that did impose those latter requirements. The Court reasoned that the state statute stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal statute's purpose to \"protect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system, and to leave them free from the possibility of inquisitorial practices and police surveillance. . . .\" The Court has repeatedly noted that in both implied preemption cases like Hines and express preemption cases, \"the purpose of Congress\" is the \"ultimate touchstone\" of its analysis.", "As will be discussed in more detail below, some federal banking laws expressly preempt state laws, while others do so impliedly. The OCC, an independent bureau within the Department of the Treasury that serves as the primary regulator for federally chartered banks, has promulgated broad rules that expressly preempt certain categories of state laws concerning federally chartered banks.

This system has its origins in the National Currency Act of 1863 and the NBA, enacted one year later. Since that time, banks have had the option of applying for a national charter from the OCC or a state charter from a state's primary banking regulator. Existing banks may also convert from a state charter to a national charter and vice versa.", "The considerations that lead a bank to choose a national or state charter are varied and have changed over time as the regulatory landscape has shifted. A bank may select a national charter in order to benefit from federal preemption of certain unfavorable state regulations, to secure the greater simplicity of uniform national regulation when it operates in multiple states, or because of aggressive legal actions taken by certain state regulators. In contrast, a bank may select a state charter to avoid the generally higher supervisory fees charged by the OCC or because it perceives federal regulation as being more onerous than state regulation. A bank's \"choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator,\" as the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks, and state banking authorities serve as the primary regulators for state-chartered banks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Laws Governing National Banks", "paragraphs": ["The NBA grants the OCC broad powers to regulate the organization, examination, and operation of national banks.

Along these lines, the Court has explained that national banks \"are subject to the laws of the State, and are governed in their daily course of business far more by the laws of the State than of the nation,\" because their contracts, ability to acquire and transfer property, rights to collect debts, and liability to be sued for debts \"are all based on State law.\" The OCC has attempted to synthesize various court rulings on the applicability of state laws to national banks as establishing a general principle that such laws are valid as long as they \"do not regulate the manner, content or extent of the activities authorized for national banks under federal law, but rather establish the legal infrastructure around the conduct of that business.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws Governing State Banks", "paragraphs": ["While state banking laws are by no means uniform, they typically provide state-chartered banks with the power to engage in banking activities similar to those listed in the NBA and activities that are \"incidental to the business of banking.\" Just as national banks are often subject to state law despite receiving their powers from federal law, state banks are often subject to federal laws despite receiving their powers from state law.

According to some observers, membership in the FRS entails a number of benefits, including reputational benefits, and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve's \"discount window\" to meet temporary liquidity needs.", "All states require state-chartered banks to obtain FDIC insurance. The FDIC accordingly serves as the principal federal regulator of state banks that are not members of the FRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Convergence of State and Federal Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Since the inception of the dual banking system, but particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, state regulatory agencies and the OCC have competed for bank charters. Some commentators have argued that this \"regulatory competition\" created by the dual banking system \"reduces the likelihood of unimaginative and unresponsive regulation of the banking system that could occur where there is a monopoly of regulation.\" Others, however, have criticized the dual banking system for leading to \"competition in laxity\"\u2014that is, a \"race to the bottom\" between federal and state regulators. Other critics of the dual banking system have argued that state bank access to FDIC insurance promotes \"moral hazard\" by \"creat[ing] incentives for state banking regulators to authorize certain unsound banking practices,\" and that regulatory competition between banking authorities has in fact led to \"anticompetitive restrictions on entry into the banking industry rather than regulatory forbearance.\"", "Certain state banking authorities have competed with the OCC by granting state-chartered banks powers not available to national banks, \"especially in the arena of insurance underwriting, real estate, and corporate debt/equity underwriting.\" On the other hand, certain state banks unhappy with their regulatory treatment by state authorities have converted to national charters. In 2004, for example, JPMorgan Chase & Company and HSBC Bank, two of the largest state banks at the time, converted from New York state charters to national charters.", "While this competition between state and federal regulators persists, the regulatory treatment of national and state banks has converged over time for a number of reasons. First, as noted above, all national and state banks are now required to obtain FDIC insurance, which entails regulation and oversight by the FDIC. Section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), as implemented by the FDIC's regulations, prohibits FDIC-insured state banks from engaging as a principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, absent permission from the FDIC. While the FDIC occasionally grants such permission, commentators have argued that Section 24 of FDICIA \"has had the ultimate effect of unifying the state and the federal banking systems.\"", "Second, beginning in the 1960s, many states passed statutes granting state-chartered banks the power to engage in any activities permitted for national banks (so-called \"wild card statutes\"). Such statutes are by no means uniform in their operation. While some wild card statutes are self-executing, others require the state's banking regulator to affirmatively grant state banks the power to engage in activities permitted for national banks. Some wild card statutes look to federal statutes to determine which activities qualify as activities permitted for national banks, while others look to federal statutes, OCC regulations, and judicial decisions. Finally, some wild card statutes expressly override all conflicting state laws, while others restrict their effect to activities that do not contravene state law. Despite these differences, commentators have observed that wild card statutes \"have had the effect of reducing the differences between\" state and national banks.", "Third, a number of federal statutes either explicitly or implicitly preempt state laws in ways that eliminate differential regulatory treatment for state and national banks. For example, in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Services Corporation , the Supreme Court held that the NBA grants national banks the power to \"export\" the maximum interest rates allowed by their home states, even when those rates are higher than the maximum rates established in other states in which they operate. In Marquette , the Court considered whether a national bank headquartered in Nebraska, which permitted banks to charge credit-card holders up to 18 percent interest per year on certain unpaid balances, could charge its Minnesota customers more than the 12 percent maximum interest allowable under Minnesota law. The Court held that because the Nebraska-based national bank was \"located\" in Nebraska even when it conducted business with Minnesota customers, an NBA provision allowing national banks to charge interest rates \"allowed by the laws of the State . . . where the bank is located\" permitted the bank to avail itself of the higher maximum interest rates allowed by Nebraska law even when doing business with Minnesota customers. Two years after the Marquette decision, Congress enacted legislation to extend the same power to \"export\" the maximum interest rates allowable in a bank's home state to state banks, preempting contrary state law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Branch Banking", "paragraphs": ["Branch banking represents another area in which preemptive statutes have promoted regulatory parity for state and national banks. For much of U.S. history, banks were allowed to operate only as \"unit banks\" and \"ha[ve] one, and only one, brick-and-mortar office.\" However, restrictions on intrastate bank branching have largely disappeared, and \"[n]early every state allows its banks to do business anywhere in the state.\" The federal McFadden Act of 1927 preserves competitive parity between state and national banks with respect to intrastate branching by providing that national banks can establish branches within a state to the same extent as state banks.", "Similarly, the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997 (the Riegle-Neal Amendments) preserves parity between state and national banks with respect to interstate branching. As with intrastate branching, states prohibited interstate branching for much of U.S. history. In the early 1990s, however, \"some states began to allow interstate branching, usually on a reciprocal basis.\" In 1994, Congress authorized interstate branching by both national and state banks in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the Riegle-Neal Act). The Riegle-Neal Act \"established . . . a comprehensive federal statutory scheme for interstate branching by state and national banks,\" but treated state and national banks differently with respect to the issue of which state laws governed a bank's branches. While the Riegle-Neal Act provided that the laws of a national bank branch's \"host state\" (as distinguished from the bank's \"home state\" ) applied only with respect to certain subjects, and only if those laws are not otherwise preempted by the NBA, the 1994 law contained no limitations on the applicability of host state laws to state bank branches. This differential treatment \"led to concerns that the nation's dual banking system might be jeopardized because State banks might opt to convert from state to national bank charters to avoid compliance with a multitude of different state laws.\" Accordingly, in 1997, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Riegle-Neal Amendments, which provided that the laws of a state bank branch's host state apply only to the extent that they would apply to a branch of an out-of-state national bank."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Barnett Bank and Preemption of State Interference with the Powers of National Banks", "paragraphs": ["A key issue in banking law preemption is the extent to which federal law preempts state laws that interfere with the powers granted to national banks. In 1996, in its seminal decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson , the Supreme Court held that federal banking law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere with [a] national bank's exercise of its powers.\" Barnett Bank involved a challenge to a state law that prohibited banks from selling insurance in towns with fewer than five thousand residents. The Court held that a federal statute granting national banks the authority to sell insurance in such towns impliedly preempted the state law because the state law presented an \"obstacle\" to the accomplishment of the federal statute's purpose \"to grant small town national banks the authority to sell insurance, whether or not a State grants . . . similar approval.\" In so holding, the Court reasoned that \"normally Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\" The Court also found it significant that the relevant federal statute (1) provided that national banks \"may\" sell insurance without qualification, and (2) referred to federal rules and regulations that governed such sales, \"suggest[ing] a broad, not a limited, permission.\" While the Court found that the challenged law was preempted, it cautioned that federal statutes granting certain powers to national banks will not preempt state laws where the relevant federal statutes contain \"an explicit statement that the exercise of that power is subject to state law.\"", "Lower courts have generally followed Barnett Bank 's rule that absent indications to the contrary, federal statutes and regulations that grant national banks the power to engage in specific activities preempt state laws that prohibit or \"significantly interfere[] with\" those activities. In Wells Fargo Bank of Texas N.A. v. James , for example, the Fifth Circuit held that an OCC regulation granting national banks the power to \"charge [their] customers non-interest charges and fees\" preempted a state statute prohibiting banks from charging a fee for cashing checks in certain circumstances, reasoning that the state statute \"prohibit[ed] the exercise of a power which federal law expressly grants the national banks.\" Similarly, in Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens, N.A. , the Sixth Circuit held that the OCC regulation at issue in James preempted state law conversion claims brought against a class of national banks based on fees they charged for processing garnishment orders. The Sixth Circuit reasoned that under Barnett Bank , \"the level of 'interference' that gives rise to preemption under the NBA is not very high,\" concluding that the state garnishment statute on which the plaintiff's conversion claims were based \"interfere[d] with\" national banks' ability to collect fees. The Ninth Circuit employed similar reasoning in Rose v. Chase Bank USA, N.A. , which held that an NBA provision granting national banks the power to \"loan money on personal security\" preempted a state statute imposing various disclosure requirements on credit card issuers under the Barnett Bank test. In arriving at this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that \"[w]here . . . Congress has explicitly granted a power to a national bank without any indication that Congress intended for that power to be subject to local restriction, Congress is presumed to have intended to preempt state laws.\"", "Along these lines, federal courts have adopted broad interpretations of an NBA provision authorizing national banks to dismiss officers \"at pleasure.\" In Schweikert v. Bank of America , N.A. , for example, the Fourth Circuit held that this provision preempted a state law claim for wrongful discharge brought by a former officer of a national bank. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has held that this \"at pleasure\" provision preempted a claim brought by a former officer of a national bank for breach of an employment agreement, reasoning that \"[a]n agreement which attempts to circumvent the complete discretion of a national bank's board of directors to terminate an officer at will is void as against [federal] public policy.\" And in Wiersum v. U.S. Bank, N.A. , the Eleventh Circuit relied on Barnett Bank and the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in Schweikert to conclude that the \"at pleasure\" provision in the NBA preempted a wrongful-termination claim brought by a former officer of a national bank under a state whistleblower statute.", "While federal courts have adopted expansive views of the circumstances in which state laws \"significantly interfere with [a] national bank's exercise of its powers\" under Barnett Bank , not all state laws that affect national banks have been found to be preempted. In Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA , for example, the Ninth Circuit held that certain state laws that affect the operations of national banks survive preemption under Barnett Bank . The Gutierrez litigation involved Wells Fargo's use of a method called \"high-to-low\" posting for debit card transactions, whereby the bank posted large transactions to customers' accounts before small transactions. The plaintiffs in Gutierrez brought a variety of state law claims based on the theory that Wells Fargo adopted the \"high-to-low\" method for the sole purpose of maximizing the number of overdraft fees it could charge customers. In response, Wells Fargo\u2014a national bank\u2014argued that OCC regulations preempted the state law claims.", "The Ninth Circuit held that the OCC regulations preempted some, but not all, of the plaintiffs' claims. The court held that a regulation authorizing national banks to establish \"the method of calculating\" noninterest charges and fees \"in [their] discretion\" preempted claims premised on the theory that Wells Fargo's posting method was an unfair business practice. The Court also held that claims based on the bank's failure to affirmatively disclose its use of the \"high-to-low\" method were preempted by a regulation providing that national banks may exercise their deposit-taking powers \"without regard to state law limitations concerning . . . disclosure requirements.\"", "However, the court held that claims based on misleading statements the bank had made about its posting method were not preempted, reasoning that such claims were based on \"a non-discriminating state law of general applicability that does not conflict with federal law, frustrate the purposes of the [NBA], or impair the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties.\" In arriving at this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that the claims were preempted because a prohibition on misleading statements \"necessarily touches on\" the authority of national banks to provide checking accounts, explaining that \"such an expansive interpretation . . . would swallow all laws.\" Because a prohibition of fraudulent representations did not \"subject [the bank's] ability to receive deposits, to set account terms, to implement a posting method, or to calculate fees to surveillance under a rival oversight regime, nor . . . stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the [NBA's] purposes,\" the court allowed the misrepresentation claims to proceed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Visitorial Powers: Watters and Cuomo", "paragraphs": ["A provision of the NBA providing that \"[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\" has also been at the center of two major Supreme Court decisions concerning federal preemption of state banking law. In Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A. , a 2007 case, the Court held that this provision, together with an OCC regulation providing that national banks may conduct authorized activities through \"operating subsidiaries,\" preempted state licensing, reporting, and visitation requirements for the operating subsidiaries of national banks. The case involved a suit by Wachovia Mortgage, a state-chartered entity that was also a wholly owned subsidiary of Wachovia Bank (a national bank) against the Commissioner of Michigan's Office of Financial and Insurance Services (OFIS). In the suit, Wachovia Mortgage sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the OFIS from exercising visitorial powers over it and from enforcing Michigan's requirement that mortgage lenders register with the state.", "In affirming a lower court injunction against the OFIS, the Court explained that \"in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank,\" the proper inquiry \"focuse[s] on the exercise of the bank's powers , not on its corporate structure.\" Because \"duplicative state examination, supervision, and regulation would significantly burden\" national banks' ability to engage in authorized activities, the Court reasoned that such \"state controls\" would also unacceptably \"interfere with [those] same activit[ies] when engaged in by an operating subsidiary.\" Accordingly, the Court held that the OFIS was barred from exercising visitorial powers over Wachovia Mortgage, just as it was barred from exercising such powers over Wachovia Bank. As discussed later in this report, the Dodd-Frank Act legislatively abrogated Watters 's holding that states may not examine or regulate the activities of national bank subsidiaries.", "Two years after Watters , the Court held in Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L.L.C. that the NBA's preemption provision concerning \"visitorial powers\" does not implicate judicial law enforcement actions brought against national banks. In Cuomo , the Attorney General of New York (the NYAG) had sent letters to several national banks requesting nonpublic information about their lending practices in order to determine whether the banks had violated state fair lending laws. The OCC and a banking trade group sued the NYAG to enjoin the information request, arguing that an OCC regulation preempted information requests by state law enforcement against national banks. The relevant OCC regulation interpreted the NBA's restriction of \"visitorial powers\" over national banks to the OCC as meaning that \"[s]tate officials may not . . . prosecut[e] enforcement actions\" against national banks, \"except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\"", "The Supreme Court rejected the interpretation of the NBA adopted by the OCC's regulation, drawing a distinction between (1) \"supervision,\" or \"the right to oversee corporate affairs,\" which qualify as \"visitorial powers\" that only the OCC can exercise over national banks, and (2) \"law enforcement,\" which falls outside the scope of \"visitorial powers,\" and which states can accordingly pursue against national banks. The Court explained that while the term \"visitorial powers\" includes \"any form of administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on demand,\" it does not include judicial actions to enforce state law against a national bank."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The OCC and Regulatory Preemption", "paragraphs": ["While the courts have figured prominently in disputes over implied preemption, OCC regulations that expressly preempt state law have also generated controversy. As discussed, the NBA grants the OCC broad authority to supervise and regulate national banks. While some commentators regard the OCC's authority to promulgate preemptive regulations as implicitly supported by the original text of the NBA and its legislative history, Congress formally recognized that the OCC has such authority in 1994 in the Riegle-Neal Act. Specifically, the 1994 law provides that host state laws concerning certain subjects shall apply to the branches of out-of-state national banks to the same extent as such laws apply to state-chartered banks except \"when the Comptroller of the Currency determines that the application of such State laws would have a discriminatory effect on the branch in comparison with the effect the application of such State laws would have with respect to branches of a bank chartered by the host State.\"", "The OCC has asserted what many commentators have characterized as an expansive view of federal banking law preemption. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the OCC issued a number of interpretive letters and legal opinions regarding preemption. Among other things, the OCC took the position that federal law preempted state laws that limited the ability of national banks to:", "advertise; operate offices within a certain distance from state-chartered bank home offices; operate ATM machines; engage in fiduciary activities; finance automobile purchases; sell annuities; sell repossessed automobiles without an automobile dealer license; and conduct Internet auctions of certificates of deposit.", "And in 2004, in response to a wave of state laws combating subprime and predatory lending, the OCC issued, in the words of one commentator, \"sweeping\" preemption rules that identified broad categories of state law that the NBA preempted.", "In one rule issued in 2004, which was the subject of the Cuomo litigation, the OCC construed an NBA provision providing that \"[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\" to mean that \"[s]tate officials may not . . . conduct[] examinations, inspect[] or requir[e] the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecut[e] enforcement actions\" against national banks \"except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\"", "In addition to its rule on visitorial powers, the OCC issued a final rule in 2004 that articulated a more general preemption standard under the NBA. The rule provided that \"state laws that obstruct, impair, or condition a national bank's ability to fully exercise its Federally authorized\" real estate lending, non-real estate lending, deposit-taking, or other powers \"are not applicable to national banks\" except \"where made applicable by Federal law.\" The OCC explained that it intended the phrase \"obstruct, impair, or condition\" to function \"as the distillation of the various preemption constructs articulated by the Supreme Court, as recognized in Hines [ v. Davidowitz ] and Barnett Bank [ of Marion County, N.A. v.

The OCC concluded that \"because the Dodd-Frank Act preserves the Barnett conflict preemption standard,\" its 2004 preemption rules remained consistent with applicable law. However, the OCC also recognized that in providing for preemption of state laws that \"obstruct, impair, or condition\" a national bank's powers, its 2004 preemption rules \"created ambiguities and misunderstandings regarding the preemption standard that [they] were intended to convey.\" Accordingly, the OCC proposed removing this language from its new preemption rules.", "Less than a week after the OCC issued its proposed rules, George W.

The court accordingly held that the NBA did not preempt the application of New York usury law to the debt purchasers. The Supreme Court denied the Madden defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2016, and the OCC has indicated that it does not intend to issue an interpretive opinion addressing the issue.", "It remains to be seen whether the Senate will consider the Financial CHOICE Act.
