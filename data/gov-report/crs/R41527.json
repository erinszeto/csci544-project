GINA is divided into two main parts: Title I, which prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers; and Title II, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on genetic information. Title II of GINA prohibits discrimination in employment because of genetic information and, with certain exceptions, prohibits an employer from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information. The law prohibits the use of genetic information in employment decisions\u2014including hiring, firing, job assignments, and promotions\u2014by employers, unions, employment agencies, and labor management training programs and mandates confidential treatment of any genetic information that is obtained.", "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) promulgated final regulations under Title II of GINA on November 9, 2010. The EEOC noted that the regulations closely track the statutory language but they do provide clarification regarding definitions in GINA; provide guidance regarding the exceptions in GINA to employer liability for acquiring genetic information; discuss the application of GINA to wellness programs; and discuss the interplay between GINA and other statutes. The regulations also provide specific examples to help clarify the requirements of the statute and regulations. For instance, the regulations clarify that a genetic test includes a test to determine whether an individual has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant which would indicate a predisposition to breast cancer, and would include preimplantation genetic diagnosis in embryos. The regulations also specifically state that a test for cholesterol levels is not a genetic test. Similarly, the regulations provide a definition of manifested disease, and note that when the diagnosis of a disease depends on both signs and symptoms and genetic information, the disease will be considered manifested. It was emphasized, however, that medical information is still subject to other laws, such as Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which regulates the acquisition and use of medical information.", "GINA and its regulations prohibit the collection of genetic information by employers but do provide some exceptions. The question of how the EEOC would interpret GINA's application to employer-run wellness programs was highly anticipated. In the final regulations, the EEOC concluded that inducements may be offered to encourage individuals to participate in wellness programs, but inducements may not be offered to provide genetic information. However, the EEOC does not permit a covered entity to request genetic information in order to evaluate whether an employee or applicant is able to safely and effectively perform the job. This is in contrast to the ADA as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Chevron v. Echazabal, where the Court found no violation of the ADA when an employer refused to hire an individual whose health would be endangered by the job. This issue may become more problematic as genetic information becomes more widely used.", "Generally, the EEOC GINA regulations provide significant guidance to employers, especially in the use of examples, and in the clarification of GINA's applicability to wellness programs. However, due to the lack of decided cases and the ever-changing science, there is still some uncertainty concerning GINA's exact parameters."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), referred to by its sponsors as the first civil rights act of the 21 st century, was enacted on May 21, 2008. GINA, P.L. 110-233 , prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers and employers. The sequencing of the human genome and subsequent advances raise hope for genetic therapies to cure disease, but this scientific accomplishment is not without potential problems. An employer or health insurer could decide to take adverse action based on a genetic predisposition to disease, and situations have arisen where discriminatory action based on genetic information may have occurred. In addition, there is evidence that the fear of genetic discrimination has an adverse effect on those seeking genetic testing, as well as on participation in genetic research. GINA was enacted to remedy these situations. ", "GINA is divided into two main parts: Title I, which prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers; and Title II, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on genetic information. Title I of GINA amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as the Social Security Act, to prohibit health insurers from engaging in genetic discrimination. Title II of GINA prohibits discrimination in employment because of genetic information and, with certain exceptions, prohibits an employer from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information. The law prohibits the use of genetic information in employment decisions\u2014including hiring, firing, job assignments, and promotions\u2014by employers, unions, employment agencies, and labor management training programs.", "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) promulgated final regulations under Title II of GINA on November 9, 2010.

The EEOC determined that it was not necessary to specifically include such a statement in the definition of employee. In making this determination, the EEOC observed that GINA references the definition of employer used by Title VII of the Civil Right Act of 1964 and numerous courts have held that this definition does not allow for individual liability.

For example, a genetic test includes a test to determine whether an individual has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant which would indicate a predisposition to breast cancer, and would include preimplantation genetic diagnosis on embryos. One of the examples given in the regulations of a test that is not a genetic test is a test for cholesterol levels, since a cholesterol test does not detect mutations.

A clarifying statement provides that a covered entity is not in violation of the prohibition on actions that limit, segregate, or classify employees due to genetic information if the action was required by a law or regulation mandating genetic monitoring. The GINA regulations echo the statutory language prohibiting actions that cause a covered entity to discriminate, but also include employers in this prohibition. The EEOC reasoned that although the GINA statutory language regarding employers does not include this prohibition, jurisprudence under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes employers' agents in the definition of employer. Thus, GINA would prohibit an employer from engaging in actions that would cause another covered entity acting as its agent to discriminate. To illustrate this, the EEOC gave an example of an employer who directed an employment agency to ask applicants for genetic information, thereby causing the employment agency, if they complied with the request, to be in violation of GINA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retaliation", "paragraphs": ["GINA prohibits retaliation against an individual because the individual has opposed any act or practice that is unlawful under GINA or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing concerning GINA.

First, there is a general prohibition against discrimination; second, there are prohibitions on the acquisition of information about the covered class that could result in discrimination; and third, there are confidentiality provisions. GINA's statutory language left some ambiguity concerning when the \"passive acquisition\" of information was covered. The EEOC resolved this issue by adding regulatory language defining \"request\" as including conducting an Internet search on an individual in such a way as is likely to result in obtaining genetic information; actively listening to third-party conversations; searching an individual's personal effects for the purpose of obtaining genetic information; and making requests for information about an individual's health status in a way that is likely to result in obtaining genetic information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exceptions", "paragraphs": ["The prohibition on the acquisition of information also contains exceptions, and the EEOC final regulations provide clarifying examples concerning these exceptions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadvertent Requests or Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["The statutory language of GINA provides for an exception to the prohibition on the acquisition of information when a covered entity inadvertently requests or requires family medical history of the employee, individual, union member, or a family member. The House Education and Labor Report noted that this exception \"addresses the so-called 'water cooler' problem, in which an employer unwittingly receives otherwise protected genetic information in the form of family medical history through casual conversations with a worker.\" The final regulations provide that if a covered entity inadvertently requests or requires genetic information relating to an individual or family member, the general prohibition does not apply. In its discussion of the final regulations, the EEOC notes that the statute only refers to family medical history, but states that it believes that \"it is consistent with Congress's intent to extend the exception to any genetic information that an employer inadvertently acquires.\" ", "When a covered entity requests medical information, the final regulations provide that, if a statement is provided warning individuals not to provide medical information, any information obtained is considered inadvertent.

In the proposed regulations, EEOC emphasized that such programs must be voluntary, and asked for comments concerning the appropriate level of inducement offered for participation in a wellness program. In the final regulations, the EEOC concluded that inducements may be offered to encourage individuals to participate in wellness programs, but inducements may not be offered to provide genetic information. The EEOC provides the following example in the regulations as a situation that does not violate GINA:", "A covered entity offers $150 to employees who complete a health risk assessment with 100 questions, the last 20 of them concerning family medical history and other genetic information. The instructions for completing the health risk assessment make clear that the inducement will be provided to all employees who respond to the first 80 questions, whether or not the remaining 20 questions concerning family medical history and other genetic information are answered.", "However, if the health risk assessment does not make clear which questions must be answered, it would violate GINA.", "Similarly, financial inducements may be offered to encourage participation in wellness programs for individuals who have voluntarily provided genetic information. In order to comply with GINA, these programs must also be offered to individuals with health conditions or life style choices that put them at an increased risk of developing a condition. For example, it would not violate GINA to offer $150 for participation in a weight loss program to employees who voluntarily disclose a family history of diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure, and to employees who have a current diagnosis of one of these conditions. ", "The regulations also provide that they do not limit the rights or protections available under the ADA, other civil rights laws, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

In addition, nothing in Title II is to limit the rights or protections of an individual to bring an action, or provide for enforcement of, or penalties for, any violation under Title I of GINA, certain sections of ERISA, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code.
