The PIADC has historically had security, coordination, and other challenges. The DHS has developed and implemented a multi-year Corrective Action Plan to address these issues and maintain the operation of PIADC. Extended operation and maintenance of PIADC facilities may not be as cost effective or as efficient for the research endeavor as completing and transitioning research to NBAF. The DHS spent approximately $24 million in FY2007 and $17 million in FY2008 to upgrade the facilities at PIADC. The DHS has not requested additional appropriation for upgrades since FY2008 and does not plan to in future years. The upgrades include designing a new animal wing and continuing activities described in the Corrective Action Plan . The DHS expects completion of these upgrades in FY2010. Further NBAF construction delays may require additional funds be used to support PIADC's corrective maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selling Plum Island", "paragraphs": ["The DHS proposed selling Plum Island and using the profit from such a sale to offset the construction costs of NBAF, the decontamination and remediation costs for the island, and the demolition costs for the PIADC. Under this proposal, DHS would sell Plum Island, arrange with the purchaser to allow PIADC operations to continue until NBAF construction was finished, and transfer Plum Island to the purchaser only after clean up of the island had been completed. Congress endorsed this proposal in the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 , signed into law September 30, 2008).", "Most sales of surplus property are handled by the General Services Administration (GSA), and any funds received are directed to the Treasury. In contrast, P.L. 110-329 provided authority for DHS to receive the proceeds of the sale of Plum Island. Because the DHS Secretary chose a site other than Plum Island for NBAF, Section 540 requires the Secretary to sell Plum Island through GSA. The proceeds of such a sale", "shall be deposited as offsetting collections into the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology \"Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations\" account and, subject to appropriation, shall be available until expended, for site acquisition, construction, and costs related to the construction of the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility, including the costs associated with the sale, including due diligence requirements, necessary environmental remediation at Plum Island, and reimbursement of expenses incurred by the General Services Administration which shall not exceed 1 percent of the sale price: Provided further, That after the completion of construction and environmental remediation, the unexpended balances of funds appropriated for costs in the preceding proviso shall be available for transfer to the appropriate account for design and construction of a consolidated Department of Homeland Security Headquarters project, excluding daily operations and maintenance costs, notwithstanding section 503 of this Act, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be notified 15 days prior to such transfer.", "The DHS intends to sell Plum Island in FY2011. The DHS plans to continue operating PIADC and to pay rent to the new owner of Plum Island until NBAF is ready for full operation in FY2017.", "The amount of money that might result from liquidation of the Plum Island assets is uncertain. Variations in remediation costs for environmental clean-up of the island and fluctuations in property values, for example, contribute sizeable uncertainties to any estimate of a future sale's proceeds. Additionally, rental payments for the continued operation of PIADC until NBAF completion will reduce the net proceeds of the sale. The sale might provide net funds insufficient for NBAF construction or might provide substantial surplus funds even after NBAF construction is complete. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Experience at Plum Island suggests that community concerns could affect a new relocated facility. Operation of PIADC has engendered some controversy among nongovernmental organizations and others. These groups have expressed concerns about the potential for pathogen release, illicit research, and unintended consequences. Local opposition also increased following suggestions by the federal government of upgrading PIADC biocontainment facilities from BSL-3Ag to BSL-4 to allow work on more dangerous pathogens. Those suggestions were not acted upon. Questions regarding worker safety and the potential for human infections by pathogens that affect both humans and animals have also been raised. The DHS, through informational sessions in the EIS process, has attempted to allay these concerns and has stated that community acceptance, or at least minimal community resistance, was one of the NBAF site criteria. However, continued community outreach may be a key factor in determining whether NBAF will suffer delays that have threatened construction of other high-containment laboratories."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
