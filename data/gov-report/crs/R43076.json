The 2008 farm bill governed policy for farm commodity support, horticulture, livestock, conservation, nutrition assistance, trade and international food aid, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, bioenergy, and forestry. It originally expired in 2012, but the 112th Congress did not complete action and instead extended the law for one year (P.L. 112-240), leaving consideration of a new farm bill to the 113th Congress.", "After nearly three years of deliberations, Congress completed action on a new omnibus farm bill when conferees reported a conference agreement on January 27, 2014 (the Agricultural Act of 2014, H.R. 2642/H.Rept. 113-333); the full House and Senate approved the conference agreement on January 29 and February 4, respectively. The President signed the measure into law (P.L. 113-79) on February 7, 2014.", "Within P.L. 113-79 are provisions that reshape the structure of farm commodity support, expand crop insurance coverage, consolidate conservation programs, reauthorize and revise nutrition assistance, and extend authority to appropriate funds for many U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs through FY2018, among many other provisions.", "The new 2014 farm bill restructures farm support for traditional program crops by eliminating direct payments, the counter-cyclical price (CCP) program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program. Much of the savings associated with the elimination of these farm programs was used to offset the costs of revising the remaining programs, adding permanent disaster assistance, and enhancing crop insurance.", "P.L. 113-79 also reauthorizes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) through FY2018. The new measure restricts how a household's receipt of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) benefits can affect SNAP benefits, accounting for most of the nutrition budget savings. Not adopted were House provisions to restrict categorical eligibility and change several time limit and work requirements.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that if the mandatory programs of the 2008 farm bill were to continue, they would cost $973 billion over the next 10 years (FY2014-FY2023), which served as a baseline budget for deliberations on the 2014 farm bill. The enacted 2014 farm bill is projected to spend $956 billion over the next 10 years, of which $756 billion is for nutrition assistance and $200 billion is for the agriculture portion. Compared to the baseline, the 2014 farm bill reduces projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion (-1.7%) over 10 years. This projected 10-year savings is closer to the Senate-passed bill level of $17.8 billion than the projected House-passed savings of $51.8 billion.", "Not included in the final conference agreement were a number of controversial miscellaneous provisions such as a House provision that would have prohibited states from imposing production or manufacturing standards on agricultural products from other states, and a House provision that would have repealed livestock and poultry marketing and competition rules proposed by USDA."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Chronology", "paragraphs": ["Congress periodically establishes agricultural and food policy in an omnibus farm bill. Following nearly three years of debate, Congress completed action in February 2014 on the most recent farm bill (The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-78), which succeeded the expired Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill, P.L. 110-246). The 2014 farm bill establishes policy for the next five years in its 12 titles, covering farm commodity price and income support, crop insurance, conservation, domestic food assistance, agricultural trade and international food aid, credit, rural development, research, horticulture, forestry, and bioenergy, among others. Periodic farm bills provide Congress, the Administration, and interest groups with an opportunity to reexamine agriculture and food issues more carefully, and address them more comprehensively. ", "Within the various titles of the enacted 2014 farm bill are provisions that reshape the structure of farm commodity support, expand crop insurance coverage, consolidate conservation programs, reauthorize and revise nutrition assistance, and extend authority to appropriate funds for many U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) discretionary programs through FY2018.", "Many provisions of the previous farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expired in 2012, but were extended for an additional year in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 , the fiscal cliff bill). The 112 th Congress began work on a new farm bill but did not complete action before the conclusion of the Congress, requiring new bills to be introduced in the 113 th Congress. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees marked up their respective bills in May 2013 and floor action was completed in the summer months. A conference agreement was reached in late January 2014; it was approved by both chambers within eight days and was signed into law as the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ) on February 7, 2014. ", "The Senate Agriculture Committee reported its version of the 2013 omnibus farm bill on May 14, 2013 (S. 954, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013), by a vote of 15-5. Floor action began during the week of May 20, 2013, and concluded on June 10, 2013, when the full Senate approved the measure by a vote of 66-27. While the bill was being debated in the Senate, approximately nine amendments were adopted and six were rejected. Attempts to modify the sugar program, further limit SNAP spending, eliminate crop insurance subsidies for tobacco, and require the labeling of genetically engineered foods were all defeated. More than 200 other amendments were offered to the Senate bill, but were not considered, when an agreement could not be reached on consolidating the amendments and limiting floor debate.", "On May 15, 2013, the House Agriculture Committee completed markup of its version of the bill ( H.R. 1947 , the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013) and approved the revised measure by a 36-10 vote. The bill was subsequently referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which revised the bill to ensure that certain dairy programs were subject to standard rulemaking procedures. Floor action on the House bill was conducted during the week of June 17, 2013, when numerous amendments were adopted to the committee bill. However, the amended bill was defeated by a vote of 195-234 on June 20. ", "Three weeks later, the full House debated a variation of the defeated bill that dropped all of the nutrition title but included all of the earlier adopted floor amendments to the other titles. This revised bill ( H.R. 2642 ) was approved by the House by a 216-208 vote on July 11. In order to initiate conference committee negotiations with the House, the Senate on July 18 substituted the text of H.R. 2642 with the text of S. 954 . On September 19, the House passed a stand-alone nutrition bill ( H.R. 3102 ) by a vote of 217-210. The House adopted a resolution ( H.Res. 361 ) on September 28 that combined the texts of H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3102 into one bill ( H.R. 2642 ) for purposes of resolving differences with the Senate.

A side-by-side section comprehensively compares all of the provisions in P.L. 113-79 to Senate and House versions of the farm bill\u2014including S. 954 as passed by the Senate (also referred to as the Senate amendment to H.R. 2642 ) and the House-passed version of H.R. 2642 (which includes the provisions of H.R. 3102 as a new Title IV to H.R. 2642 )\u2014as well as to relevant provisions in then-current law.", "The \"Prior Law/Policy\" column of the side-by-side tables reflects the provisions of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ), which extended most of the 2008 farm bill provisions for an additional year, as well as other relevant statutes that are revised by the 2014 farm bill.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the mandatory programs of the 2008 farm bill would have cost $973 billion if continued for the next 10 years (FY2014-FY2023). This \"baseline\" already had been reduced by $6.4 billion to reflect the effects of sequestration over the 10-year baseline.", "Compared to this post-sequestration baseline, the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) reduces projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion (-1.7%) over 10 years. (The five-year reduction through FY2018 is $5.4 billion from a five-year baseline of $494 billion.)", "P.L. 113-79 saves less than either the House-passed or Senate-passed proposals. The House-passed combination of H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3102 together would have reduced spending by $51.9 billion (-5.3%) over 10 years. The Senate-passed farm bill proposal ( S. 954 ) would have reduced spending by $17.9 billion (-1.8%) over 10 years. ", "If the baseline had not already been reduced by sequestration, the enacted 2014 farm bill could have been credited for reducing spending by $23 billion over 10 years. Similarly, the savings from each of the House and Senate proposals could have been $6.4 billion greater. But sequestration had already been factored into the baseline, so the official score of P.L. 113-79 remains as savings of $16.6 billion over 10 years.", "The net reduction is composed of some titles receiving more funding than in the past, while other titles provide offsets, some of which contributes to deficit reduction. The titles for farm commodity subsidies, nutrition, and conservation provide budgetary savings. The titles for crop insurance, research, bioenergy, horticulture, rural development, trade, forestry, and miscellaneous items receive additional funding.", "The final 2014 farm bill is projected to spend $956 billion over the next 10 years, of which $756 billion is for nutrition assistance and $200 billion is for the agriculture portion. (The five-year total is $489 billion, with $391 billion for nutrition and $98 billion for the agriculture portion). Within the agriculture portion, crop insurance outlays are projected to be $90 billion over the next 10 years, $58 billion for conservation, and $44 billion for farm commodity programs (Title I). The trade title is projected to spend $3.6 billion over the next 10 years, horticulture $1.7 billion, research $1.3 billion, and bioenergy $1.1 billion.

Since 1996, direct payments have been made to producers and landowners based on historical production of corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, rice, peanuts, and other \"covered\" crops. Direct payments lost political support in recent years because recipients did not need to suffer a loss in order to receive a payment. ", "Approximately three-fourths of the 10-year, $47 billion in savings associated with the elimination of current farm programs was used to offset the costs of revising farm programs in Title I, adding permanent disaster assistance in Title I, and enhancing crop insurance in Title XI. P.L. 113-79 provides farm programs (described below) for covered crops, but not cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy (see \" Farm Bill Title XI, Crop Insurance \"). Under P.L. 113-79 , authority is continued for marketing assistance loans, which provide additional low-price protection at \"loan rates\" specified in previous law (with an adjustment made to the cotton loan rate). As in previous farm bills as well as in the 2013 Senate farm bill, the enacted 2014 farm bill suspends permanent price support authority under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1949 until program authority expires in 2018. In contrast, the House bill would have repealed permanent law and made permanent the commodity support programs authorized in H.R. 2642 .", "P.L. 113-79 borrows conceptually from 2008 farm bill programs while enhancing price or revenue protection for producers. Producers may choose between the following two programs linked to a decline in either price or revenue (price times yield).", "It retain s a counter-cyclical price program , called Price Loss Coverage or PLC , which makes a farm payment when the farm price for a covered crop declines below its \"reference price\" set in statute (and the House bill) . To better protect producers in a market downturn, the reference prices are higher than the parameters in the expired 2008 farm bill (called \"target prices\"). The Senate farm bill would have provided slightly lower levels of fixed reference prices for rice and peanuts, and significantly lower levels for other crops by using a market-based reference price calculated as 55% of a rolling five-year average (excluding the high and low years). After significant congressional debate, P.L. 113-79 continues current policy by making payments on 85% of historical plantings (or \"base acres\"), a provision designed to minimize the program's effect on planting decisions. Base acres can be updated with plantings from 2009-2012. In contrast, the House bill would have made payments based on 85% of planted acreage to better align payments with producer risk, but critics contended that such a provision could lead to production distortions and trade disputes. It retains a revenue-based progra m, called Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), which is designed to cover a portion of a farmer's out-of-pocket loss (referred to as \"shallow loss\") when crop revenues decline . Farmers may select ARC as an alternative to PLC. Like the PLC program, ARC payments are made on 85% of base acres. (This is in contrast to both the House and Senate bills, which would have made revenue program payments on planted acreage.) Payments are triggered when actual crop revenue drops below 86% of historical or \"benchmark\" revenue (compared with 88% in the Senate bill and 85% in the House bill). Farmers can select coverage at either the county or individual farm level. These farm programs are separate from a producer's decision to purchase crop insurance. However, farmers selecting the Price Loss Coverage (but not ARC) are also eligible to purchase an additional subsidized crop insurance policy to protect against \"shallow losses\" called the Supplemental Coverage Option (see Title XI, Crop Insurance below). ", "Five disaster programs were established in the 2008 farm bill for weather-induced losses in FY2008-FY2011. P.L. 113-79 retroactively reauthorizes and funds four programs covering livestock and tree assistance, beginning FY2012 and continuing without an expiration date, as provided in the House bill (the Senate bill had authorized the programs for only FY2012-FY2018). The crop disaster program from the 2008 farm bill (i.e., Supplemental Revenue Assistance, or SURE) was not reauthorized, but elements of it are folded into the new ARC by allowing producers to protect against farm-level revenue losses. In the Miscellaneous Title (XII), P.L. 113-79 adopted the Senate bill provision to provide disaster benefits to tree fruit producers who suffered crop losses in 2012, and additional coverage levels are authorized under the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program (NAP).", "Farm commodity programs have certain limits that cap payments (in the 2008 farm bill, $40,000 per person for direct payments, plus $65,000 for counter-cyclical and ACRE payments; limits may be doubled with a spouse). There is also an eligibility requirement based on adjusted gross income (AGI, in the 2008 farm bill a maximum of $500,000 per person for nonfarm income and $750,000 for farm income). The enacted 2014 farm bill sets a $125,000 per person cap on the total of PLC, ARC, marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments. This approach differs from the House and Senate bills, which had separate $50,000 and $75,000 limits for the new counter-cyclical and marketing loan programs, respectively. Although the total limit in P.L. 113-79 is the same as in the two bills, some argue that this may allow larger payments from an individual program when payments from another program are small. P.L. 113-79 applies the $125,000 limit to the total from all covered commodities except peanuts, with a separate $125,000 limit for peanuts\u2014similar to 2008 farm bill law and the Senate proposal. Also regarding eligibility, P.L. 113-79 instructs USDA to write regulations that define \"significant contribution of active personal management\" to more clearly and objectively implement existing law. This differs from both the Senate and House bills, which would have deleted \"actively personal management\" and effectively required personal labor in the farming operation. For AGI limits, the enacted 2014 farm bill changes the AGI limit to a single, total AGI limit of $900,000. The AGI limit was $750,000 in the Senate bill and $950,000 in the House bill. P.L. 113-79 does not cap total farm program spending, unlike the House bill's cap of $16.96 billion for FY2014-FY2020 for combined payments under Price Loss Coverage and Revenue Loss Coverage.", "For dairy policy, P.L. 113-79 makes significant changes, including as in both bills the elimination of the dairy product price support program, the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, and export subsidies. These are replaced by a new program, which makes payments to participating dairy producers when the national margin (average farm price of milk minus an average feed cost ration) falls below a producer-selected margin ranging from $4.00 per hundredweight (cwt.) to $8.00/cwt. No premium is charged for the minimum $4.00/cwt. margin protection; however, premiums are charged for coverage at higher margins\u2014the premium schedule differentiates for annual milk production of 4 million or fewer pounds and for production greater than 4 million pounds. The final law removes a provision in S. 954 that would have subjected participating producers to a separate program to reduce incentives to produce milk when margins are low\u2014the House bill had specifically excluded this provision. In addition, the final bill adopts a provision from the House bill that requires USDA to adhere to standard rulemaking procedures and to determine the market impacts of the new program during the rulemaking process. Separately, federal milk marketing orders have permanent statutory authority and continue intact. However, the Senate bill only included two additional provisions: one that would have required USDA to use a specified pre-hearing procedure to consider alternative formulas for Class III milk product pricing, and a second that would have required USDA to analyze and report on the potential effects of replacing end-product pricing with alternative pricing procedures. P.L. 113-79 is silent on this matter.", "The objective and structure of the sugar program are left unchanged from prior law in P.L. 113-79 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farm Bill Title II, Conservation12", "paragraphs": ["Prior to enactment of the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ), the agricultural conservation portfolio included over 20 conservation programs. The Conservation title of P.L. 113-79 reduces and consolidates the number of conservation programs, while also reducing mandatory funding over the 10-year baseline by close to $4 billion. ", "Many of the larger existing conservation programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), are reauthorized, while smaller and similar conservation programs are \"rolled\" into them. In response to reduced demand and as a budget saving measure, the largest conservation program, CRP, is reauthorized with a reduced acreage enrollment cap using a step-down approach from the current 32 million acres to 24 million by FY2018. CRP also is amended to include the enrollment of grassland acres similar to the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), which is repealed. EQIP, a program that assists producers applying conservation measures on land in production, is reauthorized in the 2014 farm bill with a 5% funding carve-out for wildlife habitat practices (similar to the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, WHIP, which is repealed). Funding for EQIP is reduced by a total of almost $500 million over 10 years, halfway between the Senate's proposed reduction of $1 billion and the House bill's proposal of none. CSP, another working lands program, is reauthorized at a reduced enrollment level of 10 million acres annually, down from 12.769 million acres annually under current law. ", "As in the House- and Senate-passed bills, P.L. 113-79 creates two new conservation programs\u2014the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)\u2014out of several of the existing programs. Conservation easement programs, including the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Farmland Protection Program (FPP), and GRP, are repealed and consolidated to create ACEP. ACEP retains most of the program provisions in the current easement programs by establishing two types of easements: wetland reserve easements (similar to WRP) that protect and restore wetlands, and agricultural land easements (similar to FPP and GRP) that prevent non-agricultural uses on productive farm or grasslands. The Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP), Chesapeake Bay Watershed program, Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI), and Great Lakes Basin program are repealed (as in both the House and Senate bills) and consolidated into the new RCPP. RCPP will use partnership agreements with state and local governments, Indian tribes, farmer cooperatives, and other conservation organizations to leverage federal funding and further conservation on a regional or watershed scale.", "The most contentious provision in Title II was the Senate-passed bill's inclusion of the federally funded portion of crop insurance premiums to the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer is found to produce an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land without implementing an approved conservation plan or qualifying exemption, or converts a wetland to crop production. This prerequisite, referred to as conservation compliance, has existed since the 1985 farm bill and previously affected most USDA farm program benefits, but has excluded crop insurance since 1996. The House-passed bill offered no comparable provision; however, P.L. 113-79 includes the majority of the Senate-passed provision, with some changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farm Bill Title III, Trade13", "paragraphs": ["Title III of the enacted 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) deals with statutes concerning U.S. international food aid and agricultural export programs.

In addition, it places greater emphasis on improving the quality of food aid products (i.e., enhancing their nutritional quality) and ensuring that sales of agricultural commodity donations do not disrupt local markets. In this regard, an annual report to Congress is required to address how funds are allocated to and used by eligible organizations as well as the rate of return on aid funds\u2014defined as the sum of the proceeds from monetization of food aid commodities relative to the total cost of procuring and shipping the commodities to the recipient country's local market. Special attention is to be given when the rate of return is below 70%.", "The enacted 2014 farm bill repeals the specified, annual dollar amounts for nonemergency food aid (i.e., the \"safe box\") required in current law. Instead, it provides that not less than 20%, nor more than 30% of funds be made available to carry out nonemergency food aid programs, subject to the requirement that a minimum of $350 million be provided for nonemergency food aid each fiscal year. P.L. 113-79 creates a new local and regional purchase program in place of the expired local and regional procurement (LRP) pilot program of the 2008 farm bill and raises the authorized appropriations for LRP to $80 million annually for FY2014 through FY2018.", "P.L. 113-79 reauthorizes funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee program. The value of U.S. agricultural exports that can benefit from export credit guarantees remains at $5.5 billion annually. To address differences that have arisen over how the United States might comply with the WTO cotton case won by Brazil, the final law grants flexibility to the Secretary of Agriculture to make changes to the credit guarantee program to meet the terms agreed upon by both countries. This program is also amended in three ways to address in part Brazil's criticism of how it is administered. P.L. 113-79 also reauthorizes through FY2018 CCC funding of $200 million annually for the Market Access Program (MAP), which finances promotional activities for both generic and branded U.S. agricultural products. It also provides CCC funding of $34.5 million annually through FY2018 for the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP), a generic commodity promotion program, and CCC funding of up to $10 million a year through FY2018 for the Emerging Markets Program (EMP), to carry out technical assistance activities that facilitate U.S. farm exports and to address technical barriers to trade in emerging markets.", "The enacted 2014 farm bill also requires the Secretary, in consultation with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and House and Senate Appropriations Committees, to propose a plan to reorganize the international trade functions of USDA, to report to the congressional committees on the plan 180 days after the farm bill's enactment, and to implement the reorganization plan not later than one year after the report is submitted.

The final law reauthorizes SNAP and related programs for five years; CBO estimates that the Nutrition title in P.L. 113-79 will reduce spending by $8.0 billion over 10 years (FY2014-FY2023). The SNAP provisions alone are estimated to reduce spending by slightly more than $8.6 billion over 10 years. Certain other Nutrition provisions are estimated to increase spending, which together result in the total estimated reduction of $8.0 billion. ", "Farm bill conferees were faced with significant differences in the SNAP provisions in the Senate- and House-passed bills. Over the 10-year budget window (FY2014-FY2023), CBO estimated that the Senate's Nutrition title would have reduced spending by approximately $4 billion and the House's Nutrition title would have reduced spending by approximately $39 billion. The House bill would have reauthorized SNAP and related programs for three years, while the Senate would have reauthorized the programs for five years. ", "Although the Nutrition title of the enacted 2014 farm bill contains a number of provisions that change aspects of SNAP and related nutrition programs, it largely retains the provisions in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and other nutrition program authorizing statutes. For example, most eligibility and benefit calculation rules in SNAP do not change under P.L. 113-79 . While various changes in the Nutrition title are estimated to reduce or increase spending on the nutrition programs, most provisions are estimated to have little or no budgetary impact. ", "The budgetary impact of the Nutrition title in P.L. 113-79 (as compared to the Senate and House bills) is largely the result of changes to SNAP eligibility and benefit calculation rules. In particular, it is the result of the final law excluding two House SNAP provisions that were estimated to make the bill's greatest reductions in SNAP spending (ending broad-based categorical eligibility and ending the availability of labor-market based waivers from the time limit for certain able-bodied adults). Major issues that have potential to impact households' eligibility and benefit amounts include the following. ", "P.L. 113-79 amends how Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) payments are treated in the calculation of SNAP benefits. Both the Senate and House had included such changes, with the House version of this change estimated to affect a greater share of participants. The final agreement, for the most part, includes the House version. According to information from June 2012, this change to benefit calculation is expected to reduce household benefit amounts in approximately 17 states. The House and Senate had both proposed to disqualify certain ex-offenders from receiving SNAP benefits. P.L. 113-79 modifies that policy by requiring the disqualification of only such offenders who are not complying with the terms of their sentence. P.L. 113-79 includes policies related to the SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) program, including a pilot project authority and related funding ($200 million over FY2014 and FY2015) for states to implement and USDA to evaluate a variety of work programs for SNAP participants. The agreement includes the House bill's provisions that would expand reporting measures for all E&T programs. P.L. 113-79 does not include the House's expansion of the time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents or the House's work-related policies that may incentivize states to reduce their caseloads. P.L. 113-79 does not include any changes to broad-based categorical eligibility. The House bill would have eliminated broad-based categorical eligibility, which would have impacted the eligibility of SNAP participants in 43 states. P.L. 113-79 does not include the House provision to give states the option to administer drug testing as part of their eligibility determination processes.", "Since SNAP provides benefits redeemable for SNAP-eligible foods at SNAP-eligible retailers, much of SNAP law pertains to retailer authorization and benefit issuance and redemption.
