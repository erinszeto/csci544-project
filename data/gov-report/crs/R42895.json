Of particular interest were EPA's proposed regulations on the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from power plants.", "Reducing GHG emissions to address climate change is a major goal of President Obama, but Congress has been less enthusiastic about it. In the absence of congressional action, the President has directed EPA to promulgate GHG standards using existing authority under the Clean Air Act. This authority has been upheld on at least three occasions by the Supreme Court, but it remains controversial in Congress.", "EPA's most recent GHG actions have involved fossil-fueled (coal, oil, and natural gas) power plants, which EPA refers to as electric generating units (EGUs). On June 18, 2014, the agency proposed GHG emission standards for existing EGUs. These plants are the source of one-third of the nation's GHG emissions, so it is difficult to envision a regulatory scheme that reduces the nation's GHG emissions without addressing their contribution. At the same time, affordable and reliable electric power is central to the nation's economy and to the health and well-being of the population.", "Thus, the effects of the proposed rule on the electric power system are of considerable interest. Even before proposal of the existing power plant standards, the House had passed legislation (H.R. 3826) that would effectively have prohibited EPA from promulgating or implementing power plant GHG emission standards. On September 18, 2014, the House passed the same language a second time, in H.R. 2. The Senate did not consider either bill.", "Although it has not finalized the power plant GHG regulations as of this writing, EPA has implemented permit and Best Available Control Technology requirements for new stationary sources of GHGs under a separate Clean Air Act provision, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. Minimum thresholds have exempted smaller pollution sources from this program, and few facilities have needed to obtain permits. Nevertheless, EPA's authority to implement these requirements was challenged in court. In a June 23, 2014, decision, the Supreme Court largely upheld EPA's authority.", "Besides addressing climate change, EPA has taken action on a number of other air pollution regulations, often in response to court actions remanding previous rules. Remanded rules included the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and Clean Air Mercury Rule\u2014rules designed to control the long-range transport of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from power plants through cap-and-trade programs. Other remanded rules included hazardous air pollutant standards for boilers and cement kilns.", "The agency has also developed revisions of several existing air standards\u2014in general, the Clean Air Act mandates that existing standards be reviewed periodically and revised if appropriate. On March 3, 2014, EPA revised regulations that limit the sulfur content of gasoline, in conjunction with tighter (\"Tier3\") standards for motor vehicle emissions. The agency has also proposed revised standards for wood and pellet stoves and proposed standards for other types of wood heaters for the first time.", "EPA is also reviewing ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The agency proposed revisions to the ozone NAAQS on December 17, 2014. NAAQS serve as EPA's definition of clean air for six widespread pollutants, and drive a range of regulatory controls.", "The cost-effectiveness of some of these regulations and/or whether the agency has exceeded statutory authority in proposing and promulgating them are among the issues that have been raised by some in Congress. Others in Congress have supported EPA, noting that the Clean Air Act, often affirmed in court decisions, has authorized or required the agency's actions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["With the 113 th Congress divided like the 112 th into a Republican-controlled House and a majority-Democratic Senate, and the President having been re-elected, environmental issues, including those related to air quality, remained stalemated in Congress. Congressional interest in air quality issues was dominated by efforts to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from promulgating and implementing new emission control requirements. Often under court order, EPA has used authorities Congress gave it in the Clean Air Act amendments of 1970, 1977, and 1990 to address long-standing issues posed by emissions from various sources. EPA's regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from both mobile and stationary sources and on conventional and hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric power plants, cement kilns, and boilers have been of particular interest, as have the agency's efforts to revise ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. Particularly in the House, efforts to restrain agency regulatory actions have occupied a prominent place.", "The House also considered broader legislation designed to address regulation in general\u2014bills such as the REINS Act ( H.R. 367 / S. 15 in the 113 th Congress), which would require congressional approval before regulations classified as major rules could take effect, or the Energy Consumers Relief Act ( H.R. 1582 / S. 1363 in the 113 th Congress), which would prohibit EPA from promulgating energy-related regulations estimated to cost more than $1 billion if the Secretary of Energy determines that the regulations will cause significant adverse effects to the economy.

Of the six gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), produced by combustion of fossil fuels, is by far the most prevalent, accounting for nearly 85% of annual emissions of the combined group when measured as CO 2 equivalents.", "Members from both sides of the aisle, including a majority of the House in the 112 th and 113 th Congresses, have expressed concerns about EPA proceeding with GHG regulations that could have major economic impacts.

The agency made this endangerment finding in December 2009, and proceeded to promulgate GHG emission standards for new 2012-2016 cars and light trucks, May 7, 2010. ", "The prospect of GHG standards for motor vehicles has not been particularly controversial. In May 2009, President Obama reached agreement with major U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers and other stakeholders regarding the substance of GHG emission and related fuel economy standards. The auto industry supported a national agreement, in part, to avoid having to meet standards on a state-by-state basis; thus, it has not supported efforts to block EPA's motor vehicle GHG standards. A second round of standards for cars and light trucks, promulgated in October 2012, was also preceded by an agreement with the auto industry and key stakeholders.

Power plants are the largest source of U.S. GHG emissions, accounting for one-third of the U.S. total, and petroleum refineries are the second-largest industrial source of GHG emissions. ", "EPA has not fulfilled the terms of the two consent agreements. The agency has proposed the standards for new and existing power plants, but other than that, has not yet taken the agreed-upon actions. ", "The agency first proposed the power plant New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) on April 12, 2012. The Clean Air Act requires that proposed NSPS be finalized within a year of proposal, but the agency received more than 2.6 million public comments\u2014the most ever for a proposed EPA rule\u2014and it delayed promulgation beyond the statutory deadline. Of particular concern were the proposed setting of a single standard applicable to both coal-fired and natural gas-fired sources; the reliance on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology as the means by which coal-fired plants would comply with the standard; and the cost and technical feasibility of CCS technology. In general, critics complained that given the cost and unproven nature of CCS, the NSPS would effectively prohibit the construction of new coal-fired power plants. (For information on the New Power Plant Carbon Rule, see CRS Report R43127, EPA Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Power Plants: Many Questions, Some Answers .)", "On June 25, 2013, the President gave new impetus to EPA's GHG regulatory efforts. In a major speech and in a more detailed Climate Action Plan released the same day, the President directed EPA to re-propose GHG standards for new power plants by September 20, 2013, and finalize them \"in a timely fashion after considering all public comments, as appropriate.\" More importantly, he directed the agency to propose GHG emission standards for existing power plants by June 2014, with promulgation by June 2015. ", "The emission standards for existing power plants were released June 2, 2014, and appeared in the Federal Register June 18. The proposal would set state-specific goals for CO 2 emissions from fossil-fuel power plants. EPA established different goals for each state based on four \"building blocks\": improved efficiency at coal-fired power plants; substitution of natural gas combined cycle generation for coal-fired power; zero-emission power generation (from increased renewable or nuclear power); and demand-side energy efficiency. Two sets of goals were proposed: an interim set, which would apply to the average emissions rate in a state in the 2020-2029 time period; and a final state-specific goal for the years 2030 and beyond. In general, states that currently rely on coal-fired power to a great extent would be allowed higher emission rates, while those with idle natural gas capacity or state renewable power requirements would need to meet lower emission rate goals. ", "Publication of the proposal in the Federal Register began a comment period, which ran through December 1, 2014. The agency also held four public hearings on the proposal in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC.

(For additional detail, see CRS Report R41563, Clean Air Issues in the 112 th Congress .)", "Legislation was also considered in the 113 th Congress: on March 6, 2014, by a vote of 229-183, the House passed H.R. 3826 , which would have prohibited EPA from promulgating or implementing GHG emission standards for fossil-fueled power plants until at least six power plants representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation units at different locations across the United States have demonstrated compliance with proposed emission limits for a continuous period of 12 months on a commercial basis. Projects demonstrating the feasibility of carbon capture and storage that received government financial assistance could not be used in setting such standards, and the standards would not take effect unless Congress enacted new legislation setting an effective date. The House also incorporated the language of H.R. 3826 in H.R. 2 , which passed the House, 226-191, on September 18, 2014. Additional bills were introduced to prevent EPA from setting standards for existing power plants.", "EPA's GHG regulations have also been challenged in court. On June 26, 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed challenges to four agency regulations: the GHG endangerment finding, emission standards for light duty vehicles, and two rules related to the permitting of GHG emissions from large stationary sources. Subsequently, the Supreme Court agreed to review one aspect of the D.C. Circuit ruling: \"[w]hether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\" In a decision handed down June 23, 2014, the court generally held that EPA's motor vehicle GHG standards did trigger permitting requirements for stationary sources, although it put some limits on the sources that would be required to obtain permits ( Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA ).

Bush Administration regulations addressing these emissions were vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in two 2008 decisions ( North Carolina v. EPA and New Jersey v. EPA ). As a result, EPA has developed new regulations to address the court's concerns. It promulgated regulations addressing SO 2 and NOx on August 8, 2011, and for power plant emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants on February 16, 2012. ", "Coal-fired power plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the United States. In 2005, they accounted for 10.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions (70% of the U.S. total), 52 tons of mercury emissions (46% of the U.S. total), and 3.6 million tons of nitrogen oxides (19% of the U.S. total). Power plants are considered major sources of fine particles (PM 2.5 ), many of which form in the atmosphere from emissions from a wide range of stationary and mobile sources. In addition, they account for about one-third of U.S. anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, in the form of carbon dioxide.", "Under the Clean Air Act, however, power plants have not necessarily been subject to stringent requirements: emissions and the required control equipment has varied depending on the location of the plant, when it was constructed, whether it has undergone major modifications, the specific type of fuel it burns, and, to some extent, the vagaries of state and EPA enforcement policies. More than half a dozen separate Clean Air Act programs could potentially be used to control emissions, which makes compliance strategy complicated for utilities and difficult for regulators. Because the cost of the most stringent available controls, for the entire industry, could range into the tens of billions of dollars, utilities have fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulations affecting them, particularly with respect to plants constructed before the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed. This group, which includes about one-third of coal-fired capacity, are generally referred to as \"grandfathered\" plants. ", "As discussed below under \" Air Quality Standards ,\" new ambient air quality standards for ozone, fine particles, and SO 2 will be taking effect in the next few years. Emissions of NOx and SO 2 will have to be reduced further to meet these standards. (NOx contributes to the formation of ozone and fine particles; SO 2 , besides being a regulated pollutant in its own right, is among the sources of fine particles.) ", "A long-running controversy over the interpretation of New Source Review requirements for existing power plants (which require the installation of Best Available Control Technology whenever an existing power plant undergoes major modifications) has exerted pressure for a more predictable regulatory structure, as well.", "Thus, some in industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the last three Administrations have said that legislation addressing power plant pollution in a comprehensive (multi-pollutant) fashion would be desirable. Such legislation would have addressed the major pollutants on a coordinated schedule and would have relied, to a large extent, on a system such as the one used in the acid rain program, where national or regional caps on emissions are implemented through a system of tradable allowances. Despite many hearings, introduced bills, and a few markups, neither the House nor the Senate has considered such legislation. This has led both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations to consider what could be done under existing CAA authority."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SO2 and NOx: The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)", "paragraphs": ["Unable to obtain congressional approval of its multi-pollutant bill (the \"Clear Skies\" bill), the Bush Administration's EPA announced on March 10, 2005, that it would use existing CAA authority to promulgate final regulations similar to those in the bill for utility emissions of SO 2 and NOx in 27 eastern states and the District of Columbia. ", "The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) established cap-and-trade provisions for SO 2 and NOx. A separate regulation, the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), promulgated at the same time, established a cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions. CAIR covered only the eastern half of the country, but since most of the grandfathered generation capacity is located there (in the East, Midwest, and South), EPA projected that nationwide emissions of SO 2 would decline 53% by 2015 and NOx emissions 56%, as compared to nationwide emissions in 2001. The agency also projected that the rule would result in $85 billion-$100 billion in health benefits annually by 2015, including the annual prevention of 17,000 premature deaths. CAIR's health and environmental benefits would be more than 25 times greater than its costs, according to EPA.", "CAIR was generally supported by environmentalists and by the regulated community. But a variety of petitioners, including the state of North Carolina and other downwind states, which argued that the rule was not strong enough to address pollution from upwind sources, and some individual utilities that felt they were unfairly treated by the rule's emission limits (\"budgets\"), challenged the rule in the D.C. Circuit, and the court vacated it July 11, 2008. A unanimous court found that although EPA had established a \"significant contribution\" made by power plants to nonattainment of standards and failure to maintain standards in downwind states, as required by Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, the agency's methodology for establishing emission budgets for each state was unrelated to the state's contribution to the nonattainment and maintenance problems in specific downwind states. The court also found that the choice of 2015 for a second phase compliance deadline, based on technological and economic feasibility, ignored EPA's statutory mandate. It found the fuel adjustment factors in the rule (which set more stringent requirements for natural gas- and oil-fired plants than for coal-fired ones) to be arbitrary and capricious. It concluded: \"CAIR's flaws are deep. No amount of tinkering ... will transform CAIR, as written, into an acceptable rule.\" On December 23, 2008, however, the court modified its decision, allowing CAIR to remain in effect until a new rule was promulgated by EPA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule", "paragraphs": ["On July 6, 2011, EPA finalized a replacement for CAIR, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, generally pronounced as \"Casper\").

", "The CAIR Phase 1 rules have had a substantial effect. In 2010, EPA reports, SO 2 emissions from fossil-fueled power plants in the lower 48 states (at 5.1 million tons) were 49% below 2005 levels. NOx emissions from the same sources declined to 2.1 million tons in 2010, 42% less than in 2005. ", "CSAPR would build on these reductions. As promulgated, it would have established a second and third phase of reductions in 2012 and 2014, with particular emphasis on SO 2 \u2014emissions of which would decline to 2.4 million tons in the covered states (73% below 2005 levels) in 2014. The rule covers 28 Eastern, Midwestern, and Southern states and the District of Columbia.", "CSAPR is a modified cap-and-trade rule. It sets emission caps in each of the covered states and allows unlimited trading of allowances within the individual states. Interstate trading would be allowed so long as a state remains within 18%-21% of its emissions caps. Limiting interstate trading was intended to address the D.C. Circuit's North Carolina ruling, which found CAIR's unlimited interstate allowance trading program unlawful. ", "To hasten implementation of CSAPR, EPA promulgated a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for each of the states: the FIPs specified emission budgets for each state based on controlling emissions from electric power plants. States may develop their own State Implementation Plans and may choose to control other types of sources if they wish, but the federal plan was to take effect until the state acted to replace it.", "EPA estimated that CSAPR would cost the power sector $800 million annually in 2014 (on top of $1.6 billion already being spent to comply with CAIR), but it expected the benefits of the combined spending to be 50 to 120 times as great\u2014an estimated $120 billion to $280 billion annually. The most important benefit would be 13,000 to 34,000 fewer premature deaths annually. Avoided deaths and other benefits would occur throughout the East, Midwest, and South, according to EPA, with Ohio and Pennsylvania benefitting the most.", "Criticism of the Cross-State rule initially focused on the short time frame for implementation, and the adequacy of the emission \"budgets\" for some of the covered states. Questions regarding the adequacy of the compliance time frame focused on Phase 1 of the rule, which was to take effect in 2012, just five months after the rule's promulgation. EPA maintained that the deadline was reasonable because no new equipment needed to be installed to meet the 2012 requirements. Compliance could be achieved, according to the agency, by running existing pollution control equipment more frequently or increasing power generation at cleaner generation units. (In fact, EPA data for 2012 show that\u2014despite CSAPR being stayed, as discussed below\u2014emissions of SO 2 and NOx declined by 27% and 13%, respectively, compared to 2011, largely as a result of utilities switching to natural gas generation.) ", "A second issue concerned the adequacy of the emissions budgets for individual states. Particular controversy centered on Texas, which was included in the final rule, but not in the proposed version.

According to EPA, power plants are the largest emitters of many of these pollutants, accounting for about 50% of the nation's mercury emissions, 62% of its arsenic emissions, and 82% of its hydrochloric acid emissions, for example. The MATS rule is also projected to reduce emissions of fine particulates (PM 2.5 ); although PM 2.5 is not listed as a hazardous air pollutant, EPA believes that the MATS rule's effect on PM 2.5 will lead to the avoidance of up to 11,000 premature deaths each year. ", "In proposing the standards, EPA noted that while the requirements are stringent for those facilities lacking controls, 56% of existing coal-fired power plants already were equipped with controls that would allow them to meet the standards. Thus, the standards are expected to level the playing field, bringing older, poorly controlled plants up to the standards capable of being achieved by a majority of the existing units. In this respect, the proposed standards reflect the statute's requirement that existing sources of HAPs should meet standards based on the current emissions of the best performing similar sources. ", "The agency also concluded that some plants would be retired by 2015, rather than invest in control technologies. In all, it said, coal-fired generation capacity would decline less than 2% as a result of the MATS rule. Coal-fired capacity is, of course, simultaneously being buffeted by market forces, principally the low cost of natural gas, and there are other proposed and promulgated rules (under the Clean Water Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act) that might increase future costs of operation. (See \" Cumulative Impacts of EPA Rules ,\" below.) As a result, more than that 2% of coal-fired generation is being retired. ", "In its Regulatory Impact Analysis, EPA projected the annual cost of compliance with the MATS rule at $9.6 billion. The average consumer would see an increase of 3.1% in the retail price of electricity in 2015, according to the agency; applied to the average residential electric bill, households might expect an increase of $3-$4 per month in the cost of electricity due to the rule. These costs will go largely to the installation of scrubbers and fabric filters. In most cases, the fabric filters will be coupled with activated carbon injection or dry sorbent injection. Mercury and other HAPs become attached to the carbon or sorbent after it is injected into the flue gas, and the fabric filter collects the particles, removing them from the plant's emissions.", "This is not complicated or new technology. Other types of facilities (notably solid waste incinerators) have used this technology for the past two decades to reduce their mercury emissions by 95% or more. Moreover, as a result of state-level pollution control regulations, a growing percentage of coal-fired plants do the same. EPA estimates that about one-fifth of U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity would have either activated carbon or dry sorbent injection in 2015 without the rule. ", "The benefits of the rule are estimated by EPA at $37 billion to $90 billion annually\u20144 to 9 times as great as the costs\u2014due primarily to the avoidance of 4,200 to 11,000 premature deaths each year. Other benefits, only some of which were given dollar values, include the annual avoidance of 4,700 nonfatal heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks, and developmental effects on children, including effects on IQ, learning, and memory.", "One of the key issues raised by opponents of the rule was whether the three-year compliance window provided by CAA Section 112 would be sufficient for the hundreds of EGUs affected by the rule to install needed equipment and come into compliance, and thus whether the reliability of the nation's electric power supply could be harmed by the rule. Although EPA believed that most units would be able to comply with the MATS rule within the three-year statutory deadline, in response to industry comments on the proposed rule, EPA and the White House added provisions to the final rule to make additional time available for compliance where necessary. The final rule was accompanied by a presidential memorandum directing the agency to make full use of the Clean Air Act's authority to grant additional time to those facilities that needed it. In general, this meant that the agency would approve state permitting actions that provide an additional year (four years instead of three) for compliance if it is \"necessary for the installation of controls.\" In the Preamble to the final rule, EPA discussed at some length its interpretation of the phrase \"necessary for the installation of controls,\" making it clear that it intended to broadly interpret the phrase in order to make additional time available where needed. EPA also issued an enforcement policy that described how units could obtain a fifth year for compliance under the agency's authority in Section 113 of the Clean Air Act.", "EGUs, in most cases, do not appear to need the available extra time. A survey of state and local air permitting authorities by the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, released October 9, 2014, finds that of the 1,400 EGUs affected by MATS, only 145 have requested additional compliance time.

Cumulatively, many in the industry and other opponents of these regulations have referred to these rules as an impending \"train wreck\" for coal-fired power plants. They maintain that compliance will be difficult and costly within the mandated timeframes, and that, as a result, sections of the country depending on coal-fired power could experience electricity reliability problems as plants are retired or taken off-line for retrofit of pollution controls.", "Others in the industry and in various think tanks have concluded that this is unlikely to be the case. They note that the studies sponsored by EEI and by coal-reliant utilities were generally written before EPA proposed or promulgated any of the actual regulations, and the studies often assumed far more stringent requirements than EPA actually proposed or promulgated. While it is true that many coal-fired units would have to be taken out of service for pollution control equipment to be installed, the next few years would be an opportune time to do so, as there is currently substantial excess generating capacity in the electric power industry in most regions. This reserve margin will continue to be available over the next 5-10 years: as a result of the recession, the slow pace of economic recovery, and other factors, demand for electricity is growing slowly. ", "Many observers note, too, that EPA regulation is only one element of the situation facing aging coal-fired power plants, many of which are more than 40 years old and have few pollution controls. Equally important is competition from more efficient natural gas combined cycle units, which have taken over a larger share of the electric power market as the price of natural gas has declined. Over the last two decades, more than 80% of new generating capacity has come from these gas-fired units, which are relatively cheap to build and are cleaner and more efficient to operate than many coal-fired units. Observing the inroads being made by gas-fired generation, many industry observers conclude that portions of the electric power industry are simply experiencing a transition to more efficient power generation sources.

The Tier 2 standards were finalized in February 2000, and they were phased in between Model Years 2004 and 2009. Having determined that further emission reductions from motor vehicles are essential to attainment of ambient air quality standards in numerous areas, EPA proposed Tier 3 standards May 21, 2013. Final standards were signed on March 3, 2014, and were published in the Federal Register on April 28.", "As with the Tier 2 standards, the Tier 3 standards include changes to both vehicle emission limits and fuel formulation rules, lowering the allowable sulfur content of gasoline. Removing sulfur from gasoline improves the performance of existing emission controls and facilitates the use of new technology. The Tier 3 standards lower allowable sulfur from 30 parts per million (ppm) to a maximum of 10 ppm, and would require reductions in light duty vehicle emissions of 70%-80%. Requirements are to be phased in generally between Model Years 2017 and 2025. In addition to the light duty vehicle emission and gasoline standards, the rule extends the required useful life of emission control equipment from 120,000 miles to 150,000 miles, and sets standards for heavier duty gasoline-powered vehicles.", "In letters to the President before the standards' proposal, several Senators of both parties asked that the Administration delay the EPA rulemaking over concerns that the new fuel standards would raise the price of gasoline; but EPA maintains that the rule as promulgated will add less than a penny to the price of a gallon. The cost estimate is disputed by petroleum refiners: they argue that some refineries will find it more difficult than others to reduce sulfur to the 10 ppm standard, and could face cost increases of as much as nine cents a gallon. To address these concerns, the final rule allows a three-year delay in compliance for small refiners. It also includes averaging, banking, and trading programs that will give the refining industry flexibility in meeting the standards.", "Other stakeholders, including the auto industry, are generally in support of the new standards. Auto manufacturers already face more stringent requirements in California, and fear having to meet a patchwork of standards in different states. They also note that lower sulfur fuel is needed to support the lean-burn technologies that they will use to meet already promulgated fuel efficiency and GHG standards.", "The Tier 3 standards are also supported by environment and public health groups, and by a number of governors and other state and local officials, because they will help nonattainment areas comply with ambient air quality standards. Without tighter standards on vehicles and gasoline, ozone nonattainment areas in about half the states might have to impose more controls on local sources of ozone precursors and particulates.

Nevertheless, the goal of clean air continues to elude many areas, in part because scientific understanding of the health effects of air pollution has caused EPA to tighten standards for most of these pollutants.

Following the withdrawal, EPA proceeded with implementation of the 2008 standards, designating nonattainment areas in May and June of 2012. The vast majority of areas designated nonattainment for the 2008 standard ( Figure 1 ) are areas that had already been designated nonattainment for the previous (1997) standard, but implementation of new, more stringent standards meant that State Implementation Plans and the pollution control measures that they specify could need revision.

EPA estimates the cost of meeting a 70 ppb standard in all states except California at $3.9 billion annually in 2025; the cost of meeting a 65 ppb standard in the same states is estimated at $15 billion annually. Because most areas in California would have until the 2030s to reach attainment, EPA provided separate cost estimates for California ($0.80 billion to $1.6 billion annually in 2038).
