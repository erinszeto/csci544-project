Historically, electric utilities have been regarded as naturalmonopolies requiring regulation at the state and federal levels. The Energy Policy Act of 1992(EPACT, P.L. 102-486 ) removed a number of regulatory barriers to electricity generation in an effortto increase supply and introduce competition, but further legislation has been introduced and debatedto resolve remaining issues affecting transmission, reliability, and other restructuring concerns.", "In part, the electricity section of the conference report and S. 2095 would repealthe Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and establish mandatory reliability standards.Standard market design (SMD), a proposed system to provide uniform market procedures forwholesale electric power transactions, would be remanded to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC); no rule would be allowed before the end of FY2006. The Department ofEnergy (DOE) would identify \"transmission corridors\" that require new construction or upgrading.The bills would grant eminent domain authority to the federal government for construction ofinterstate power lines on these transmission corridors if the states did not act in time.", "(For a discussion of the policy context and current law, see CRS Report RL32178 , Summaryof Electricity Provision in the Conference Report on H.R. 6.

The H.R. 6 conference report and S. 2095 would amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the requirement that reformulatedgasoline (RFG) contain 2% oxygen to reduce automotive emissions, a requirement which promptedthe widespread use of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and, to a lesser degree, ethanol. Instead,the bills would establish a new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline contain renewablefuels such as ethanol. The bills would require that 3.1 billion gallons of renewable fuel be used in2005, increasing to 5.0 billion gallons by 2012 (as compared to 2.1 billion gallons used in 2002). However, concerns have been raised that this requirement could significantly raise the pump pricefor gasoline in some areas.", "Because of concerns over drinking water contamination by MTBE (a major competitor withethanol), the bills would ban the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel, except in states that specificallyauthorize its use, not later than December 31, 2014. The ban has two possible exceptions. First, EPAmay allow MTBE in motor fuel up to 0.5 percent by volume, in cases that the Administratordetermines to be appropriate; and second, the President may make a determination, not later thanJune 30, 2014, that the restrictions on the use of MTBE shall not take place. The bills would alsoauthorize $2.0 billion to assist the conversion of merchant MTBE production facilities to theproduction of other fuel additives. Further, the bills would preserve the reductions in emissions oftoxic substances achieved by the RFG program.", "One of the most controversial provisions in the H.R. 6 conference report is theestablishment of a \"safe harbor\" from product liability lawsuits for producers of MTBE andrenewable fuels. The safe harbor provision -- which was excluded from S. 2095 --would protect anyone in the product chain, from manufacturers down to retailers, from liability forcleanup of MTBE and renewable fuels or for personal injury or property damage based on the natureof the product. (That legal approach has been used in California to require refiners to shoulderliability for MTBE cleanup.) The safe harbor would be retroactive to September 5, 2003. Prior to thatdate, five lawsuits had been filed. After that date, at least 150 suits were filed, on behalf of 210communities in 15 different states.", "(For additional information, see CRS Report RL32865(pdf) , Renewable Fuels and MTBE: AComparison of Selected Legislative Initiatives ; CRS Report RL30369, Fuel Ethanol: Backgroundand Public Policy Issues ; and CRS Report RL32787 , MTBE in Gasoline: Clean Air and DrinkingWater Issues .)", "Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy. One of the first initiatives designed to have a significanteffect on oil demand was passage of corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE) in theEnergy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA, P.L. 94-163 ). In the years since, there havebeen periodic calls for toughening or broadening the CAFE standards -- especially as consumerdemand has turned more to light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).", "A final rule mandating higher CAFE standards for light-duty trucks was issued April 1, 2003,by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but congressional interest in theissue continues. The bill reported from conference and S. 2095 would require a CAFEstudy, would prescribe several considerations that must be weighed in determining maximumfeasible fuel economy, would authorize $2 million annually during FY2004-FY2008 for NHTSArulemakings and CAFE analysis, and would extend the existing fuel economy credit for themanufacture of alternative-fueled vehicles.", "(For additional information, see CRS Issue Brief IB90122, Automobile and Light Truck FuelEconomy: The CAFE Standards .)", "Nuclear Accident Liability. Reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act nuclear liabilitysystem is one of the top nuclear items on the energy agenda. Under Price-Anderson, commercialreactor accident damages are paid through a combination of private-sector insurance and a nuclearindustry self-insurance system. Liability is capped at the maximum coverage available under thesystem, currently about $10.9 billion. Price-Anderson also authorizes the Department of Energy toindemnify its nuclear contractors. The limit on DOE contractor liability is the same as forcommercial reactors, except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of a decline inthe number of covered reactors.", "The H.R. 6 conference agreement and S. 2095 would provide a20-year extension of Price-Anderson to the end of 2023. The nuclear industry contends that thesystem has worked well and should be continued, but opponents charge that Price-Anderson'sliability limits provide an unwarranted subsidy to nuclear power. The conference report would alsoauthorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue new regulations on nuclear powerplant security and would require force-on-force security exercises.", "Another nuclear provision in the bills is a $1.1 billion authorization for a nuclear-hydrogencogeneration project at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In the taxtitle, the conference agreement -- but not S. 2095 -- would provide a tax credit of 1.8cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity generated by new nuclear power plants, if the plants wereplaced in service by 2020 and did not exceed a total capacity of 6,000 megawatts.", "(For more information, see CRS Issue Brief IB88090, Nuclear Energy Policy .)", "Renewable Energy and Efficiency. The H.R. 6 conference report and S. 2095 would legislate new energy efficiency standards for several consumer andcommercial products and appliances.

The congressional debate over whether to open the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas leasing has continued for more than 30 years. H.R. 6 as passed by the House would have authorized oil and gas exploration,development, and production in ANWR, with a 2,000-acre limit on production and support facilities.The Senate-passed bill did not include ANWR provisions. The Administration strongly urged thatthe House ANWR language be included in the conference bill. However, once it became apparentthat there were insufficient votes in the Senate to pass an energy bill with ANWR provisions, themanagers decided to leave ANWR out of the final conference bill and S. 2095 .", "Proponents of exploring ANWR point to advances in exploration and drilling technology andmethods that have significantly reduced the extent of surface disturbance caused by oil and gasactivities. While opponents concede this may be so, they argue that the bill does not imposeadequate requirements in this regard, that surface disturbance represents only one of manyenvironmental impacts, and that considerable risk to the environment remains during all phases ofdevelopment. Some opponents, citing ANWR's pristine character, argue that its ecology and habitatshould not be disturbed under any circumstances.", "(For additional information, see CRS Issue Brief IB10136, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge(ANWR) , and CRS Report RL31115 , Legal Issues Related to Proposed Drilling for Oil and Gas inthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .)", "Domestic Energy Production.

Price-Anderson authorizes DOE toindemnify its contractors for the entire amount, so that damage payments for nuclear incidents atDOE facilities would ultimately come from the U.S. Treasury. However, the law also allows DOEto fine its contractors for safety violations, and contractor employees and directors can face criminalpenalties for \"knowingly and willfully\" violating nuclear safety rules. However, Section 234A of theAtomic Energy Act specifically exempts seven non-profit DOE contractors and their subcontractors.

For the purposes of those payment limits, a nuclear plant consisting ofmultiple small reactors (100-300 megawatts, up to a total of 1,300 megawatts) would be considereda single reactor (Sec. 608) . Therefore, a power plant with six 120-megawatt modular reactors wouldbe liable for retrospective premiums of up to $95.8 million, rather than $574.8 million. The liabilitylimit on DOE contractors would be set at $10 billion per accident, also to be adjusted for inflation,under the conference agreement (Sec. 604) .", "The liability limit and maximum indemnification for DOE contractors for nuclear incidentsoutside the United States would be raised from $100 million to $500 million (Sec. 605) .

Circuit Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction overdisputes involving \"unreasonable delay\" of a natural gas pipeline project certificated by FERC. Unreasonable delay would mean the failure of a permitting agency to take action within a year afterthe date of filing for the permit in question, or within 60 days after the issuance of a FERCcertificate. There is no explicit timeline in existing law for issuance of ancillary permits andlicenses, and that would consolidate authority in one court. This fast-tracking measure wouldaddress delays occurring after FERC had issued a certificate giving a pipeline project the go-ahead.The provision is directed at delays by other agencies in issuing environmental permits and otherapprovals needed to begin construction of a certificated project.", "Section 1443: Attainment Dates for Downwind Ozone Nonattainment Areas. Thissection, which was not in the House or Senate versions of the bill but was added during theconference, would extend Clean Air Act deadlines for areas that have not attained ozone air qualitystandards if upwind areas \"significantly contribute\" to their nonattainment. Under the 1990 CleanAir Act Amendments ( P.L. 101-549 ), ozone nonattainment areas were classified in one of fivecategories: Marginal, Moderate, Serious, Severe, or Extreme. Areas with higher concentrations ofthe pollutant were given more time to reach attainment. In return for the additional time, they wererequired to implement more stringent controls on emissions. Failure to reach attainment by thespecified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to the next higher category and theimposition of more stringent controls. Areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, classified asSerious, were required to reach attainment by 1999. If they did not do so, the law required that theybe reclassified (or \"bumped up\") to the Severe category, with a new deadline of 2005, and morestringent controls.", "For a variety of reasons, EPA has generally not reclassified areas when they failed to reachattainment by the statutory deadlines. In several cases, the agency granted additional time to reachattainment on the grounds that a significant cause of the area's continued nonattainment waspollution generated outside the area and transported into it by prevailing winds. EPA was sued overits failure to bump up five of these areas; in the first three cases decided (Washington, D.C., St.Louis, and Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas), the agency lost. As a result, EPA has taken steps toreclassify the three areas.", "The conference bill would roll back these reclassifications and extend attainment deadlinesin areas affected by upwind pollution to the date on which the last reductions in pollution necessaryfor attainment in the downwind area are required to be achieved in the upwind area. While this datemight vary, it would appear to be 2004, 2005, or 2007 in most areas affected by the current standard. The language in the conference bill may give EPA flexibility to extend the deadlines beyond thosedates, however, and it would also apply to the agency's new standard for average ozone levels duringan eight-hour period. Deadlines for attainment of the 8-hour ozone standard have not yet beenestablished, so it is difficult to say how this section might affect them.", "Section 1444: Energy Production Incentives. Congress may regulate interstate commerceunder Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 (the Commerce Clause) of the Constitution. The states may notunduly burden interstate commerce even in the absence of federal regulation. However, Congressmay expressly authorize the states to take an action that would otherwise be an unconstitutionalburden on interstate commerce. State tax incentives that offer benefits solely to energy producedwithin the state may, depending on their design, raise constitutional concerns. The conference billwould expressly authorize the states to offer certain tax incentives that may otherwise be animpermissible burden on interstate commerce. Under the bill, the states would be allowed to providetax incentives for the in-state production of (1) electricity from in-state coal burned at a power plantusing clean coal technology, (2) electricity from renewable sources, and (2) ethanol.", "Section 1445: Use of Granular Mine Tailings. This section, which was added inconference, amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA, 42 U.S.C. 6961 et seq.) and affects onlythe Tar Creek Mining District. Located in northeastern Oklahoma, Tar Creek is a former lead andzinc mining area of approximately 40 square miles and is one of the largest Superfund hazardouswaste cleanup sites. The mine tailings (residue, referred to as \"chat\") are deposited in hundreds ofpiles and ponds in the area, and contain lead and other heavy metals. Residential communities arelocated among the piles, some of which are nearly 200 feet high, and approximately 25% of thechildren living on the site have elevated lead concentration levels in their blood, according to aMarch 2000 EPA report. (14) ", "The conference bill would direct the EPA Administrator to establish criteria for the safe andenvironmentally protective use of the granular mine tailings for cement or concrete projects, and forfederally funded highway construction projects. The criteria would include an evaluation of whetherto establish numerical standards for the concentration of lead and other hazardous substances in thetailings, and EPA would be required to consider their current and past use as an aggregate forasphalt, as well as the environmental and public health risks and benefits of their use intransportation projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Title XV -- Ethanol and Motor Fuels", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Subtitle A -- General Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Section 1501: Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established the ReformulatedGasoline (RFG) program. Among its provisions is a requirement that RFG contain oxygen. The twomain ways to meet the requirement are the use of MTBE and ethanol. However, MTBE (methyltertiary butyl ether) has been found to contaminate groundwater, and there is interest in banning thesubstance (see Sec. 1504). Because some states have acted to limit the use of MTBE, and becauseof the potential federal ban, there is interest in eliminating the oxygen standard as well (see Sec.1506). ", "The ethanol industry has benefitted significantly from the oxygen requirement, and some areconcerned about the future of ethanol in the absence of the requirement. Further, proponents of thefuel see ethanol use as a way to limit petroleum consumption and dependence on foreign oil. Thus,the interest in establishing a renewable fuels standard. However, opponents of ethanol have raisedconcerns that the fuel is too costly, that the efficiency of the ethanol fuel cycle is questionable, andthat the potential for groundwater contamination by ethanol-blended fuels has not been fully studied.", "Section 1502: Fuels Safe Harbor . This section would provide a \"safe harbor\" for renewablefuels and fuels containing MTBE (i.e., such fuels could not be deemed defective in design ormanufacture by virtue of the fact that they contain renewables or MTBE). The effect of thisprovision would be to protect anyone in the product chain, from manufacturers to retailers, fromliability for cleanup of MTBE and renewable fuels or for personal injury or property damage basedon the nature of the product (a legal approach that has been used in California to require refinersto shoulder liability for MTBE cleanup). Were liability for manufacturing and design defects ruledout, plaintiffs would need to demonstrate negligence in the handling of such fuels to establishliability -- a more difficult legal standard to meet. ", "The conference version provides a safe harbor for renewable fuels, MTBE, and fuelscontaining them, as did the House bill. The Senate bill did not include MTBE, or fuels containingit, in the safe harbor. The conference version also differs from the House- and Senate-passed billsin setting an effective date of September 5, 2003, for the safe harbor, rather than the date ofenactment. This effective date would protect oil and chemical industry defendants from defectiveproduct claims in about 150 lawsuits that were filed in 15 states after that date.
