A similarly complex organization, DHS was the product of legislative compromises, and it was anticipated that congressional overseers, as well as department officials, would monitor the management and operations of DHS with a view to adjusting its structure as conditions warranted. In this regard, Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to reorganize functions and organizational units within DHS, subject to specified limits. Secretary Chertoff made use of this authority to implement some of his 2SR plans. For a period of 12 months after the effective date of the Homeland Security Act, Section 1502 vested the President with temporary authority to prescribe a reorganization plan for DHS, and subsequent modifications of that plan. In late January 2003, as components of DHS were being transferred to the department's operational control, President George W. Bush modified his original reorganization plan for DHS to reconfigure the functions of certain border security agencies into two new components\u2014the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2014within the department's Border and Transportation Security Directorate (BTS).", "When it began operations, DHS was largely organized like a hand\u2014the palm being the office of the Secretary/Deputy Secretary with the thumb and fingers being individual directorates for (1) management, (2) science and technology, (3) information analysis and infrastructure protection, (4) border and transportation security, and (5) emergency preparedness and response. In addition, however, approximately two dozen other units within the department, but not located within one of the directorates, reported directly to the Secretary. These included program entities, such as the United States Coast Guard and United States Secret Service, and units within the office of the Secretary, such as the Office of International Affairs and Office of State and Local Government Coordination, as well as some Assistant Secretaries. At the time of its creation, DHS had about 170,000 employees, only 18,000 of whom worked in the Washington, DC, area, indicating that the new department had a considerable field organization.", "In one of his first actions as Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge's successor, Michael Chertoff, on March 2, 2005, the day before he was sworn in as Secretary, announced in testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security that he was \"initiating a comprehensive review of the Department's organization, operations, and policies.\" This effort, he said, would begin \"within days.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2SR Initiative", "paragraphs": ["In his July 13, 2005, remarks concerning the results of the 2SR initiative, Secretary Chertoff explained that the work of that effort had been conducted utilizing \"18 action teams\u2014involving more than 250 DHS staff\u2014to evaluate specific operational and policy issues.\" The participants were asked \"how would you solve a particular problem,\" and \"how would you take the best solutions and implement them aggressively.\" He noted, as well, that those immediately directing the 2SR effort also \"actively sought opinions from hundreds of public and private partners at the federal, state, local, tribal and international levels.\" From these deliberations and consultations the following six-point agenda resulted.", "1. Increase preparedness, with particular focus on catastrophic events.", "2. Strengthen border security and interior enforcement and reform immigration processes.", "3.

Improve DHS stewardship, particularly with stronger financial, human resource, procurement and information technology management.", "6.

Most can be accomplished administratively\u2014a few require legislation.\" He then announced \"organization changes that include four important areas of focus: ... (1) formation of a new, department-wide policy office; (2) significant improvements in how DHS manages its intelligence and information sharing responsibilities; (3) formation of a new operations coordination office and other measures to increase operational accountability; and (4) an important consolidation effort that integrates the Department's preparedness mission.\" These initiatives are discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy", "paragraphs": ["Secretary Chertoff \"proposed creation of a central policy office led by an Under Secretary for Policy,\" which \"will bring together our international affairs staff, a significant and new strategic planning capability, DHS-wide policy development assets, a senior policy advisor focused on refugee asylum policies, and enhanced private sector liaison resources. Collectively,\" he continued, \"the Policy Directorate will strengthen the Department's ability to develop and plan vital policies.\" Such an office, he noted, \"is not a new idea\u2014it builds in part upon the foundational work of the Border and Transportation [Directorate] policy staff, which is to be folded into the new policy directorate.\"", "The authors of an August 17, 2004, Heritage Foundation report were among the first to propose an Under Secretary of Policy for DHS and a consolidation of the department's policy analysis and development offices under the direction of such an officer. The recommendation was reiterated in more elaborate form in a December 13, 2004, Heritage Special Report on DHS reform. At a January 26, 2005, hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the chair of the panel, Senator Susan Collins, observed that \"there seemed to be unanimity on the need for an Under Secretary for Policy.\"", "Shortly after the Senate committee hearing, when the justification for the DHS Office of the Secretary and Executive Management budget request was unveiled, a proposed Office of Policy, Planning and International Affairs (OPPIA) was revealed. Headed by an Assistant Secretary, the new entity was to result from an expansion of the department's existing Office of International Affairs, and was described in the following terms.", "The Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs will be responsible for both strategic policy development and oversight of all program policy efforts in the Department, including various economic, regulatory, legislative, foreign and policy analysis functions which are critical to forming Departmental policies. This office oversees the Policy Review Board, which evaluates, promotes, and tracks developing policies throughout the Department. The Policy Review Board will be the vehicle by which senior leadership within the Department can assess proposals for major policy initiatives, ensure these initiatives are consistent with strategic goals and priorities, enhance inter-departmental engagement in policy development and provide clear leadership on policy initiatives.", "House appropriators recommended $8.7 million for OPPIA, which the House subsequently approved. Senate appropriators recommended $7.25 million for OPPIA, and indicated an expectation that it would assume the functions of the Operational Integration Staff, which assists the DHS leadership with coordination and integration of cross-organizational element missions, operational activities, and programs across the department's headquarters directorates and direct reporting agencies. The Senate later approved this funding for OPPIA, but it did not appear that either DHS or House appropriators expected the new policy office to assume the functions of the Operational Integration Staff.", "In compliance with Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act authorizing him to reorganize functions and organizational units within DHS, subject to specified limits, Secretary Chertoff sent a July 13, 2005, letter to Congress \"with notification of the reallocation of functions and the establishment, consolidation and alteration of organizational units within the Department of Homeland Security,\" and indicating he intended \"to implement these changes on October 1, 2005.\" He noted the effort to establish OPPIA under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary, and indicated he had \"also asked Congress for legislation that would elevate this Assistant Secretary to an Under Secretary within the Department.\" The Under Secretary would head the Directorate for Policy, when established. He also identified various \"existing organizational units that ... will be relocated to this new centralized policy office, including the Office of International Affairs, the Special Assistant to the Secretary for Private Sector Coordination, the Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office and elements of the Border and Transportation Security Office of International Enforcement, the Homeland Security Advisory Committee, and the Office of Immigration Statistics.\" He added that \"a strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator will be established within the new policy apparatus.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intelligence", "paragraphs": ["In his July 13, 2005, 2SR remarks, Secretary Chertoff announced \"that the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer,\" who \"will head a strengthened Information Analysis division that will report directly to me,\" and \"will ensure that intelligence is coordinated, fused and analyzed within the Department so that we have a common operational picture. It will also provide,\" he continued, \"a primary connection between DHS and others within the intelligence community\u2014and a primary source of information for our state, local, and private sector partners.\"", "When DHS was chartered with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) was vested, among other duties, with responsibility \"[t]o access, receive, and analyze law enforcement information, intelligence information, and other information from agencies of the Federal Government, State and local government agencies (including law enforcement agencies), and private sector entities, and to integrate such information in order to (A) identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to the homeland; (B) detect and identify threats of terrorism against the United States; and (C) understand such threats in light of actual and potential vulnerabilities of the homeland.\" However, several weeks after the Homeland Security Act was signed into law, this provision was undermined. In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush announced he was instructing the leaders of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), DHS, and DOD \"to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center [TTIC], to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location.\" TTIC had the potential for at least paralleling IAIP if not usurping its role. A little over a year later, in an April 13, 2004, letter to Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin jointly signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, and TTIC Director John O. Brennan, the relationship between TTIC and IAIP was explained as follows.", "TTIC has the primary responsibility ... for terrorism analysis (except information relating solely to purely domestic terrorism) and is responsible for the day-to-day terrorism analysis provided to the President and other senior policymakers. ... IAIP has the primary responsibility for matching the assessment of the risk posed by identified threats and terrorist capabilities to our Nation's vulnerabilities [and] ... for providing the full range of intelligence support ... to the DHS Secretary, other DHS leadership, and the rest of DHS.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 transferred TTIC to the newly created National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), which was designated \"the primary organization ... for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the United States Government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism, excepting intelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic terrorists and domestic counterterrorism,\" and, among other duties, conducting \"strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities, integrating all instruments of national power, including ... homeland security ... activities,\" and assigning \"roles and responsibilities as part of its strategic operational planning duties to lead Departments or agencies, as appropriate, for counterterrorism activities that are consistent with applicable law.\"", "\"Following the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC),\" it was observed in a recent report by the House Committee on Appropriations, \"IAIP has seen the scope of its national intelligence mission reduced,\" and DHS was directed \"to review the mission and functions of IAIP in light of the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the creation of the NCTC and the TSC, and provide a report ... on the future role IAIP will have in the intelligence community.\" In a counterpart report, the Senate Committee on Appropriations concurred, and directed IAIP and DHS \"to undertake a review of IAIP's resource requirements based on a comparative review of IAIP's intelligence responsibilities, as defined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, with those following the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\" and submit the findings of this review to the committee.", "In his July 13, 2005, reorganization notification letter to Congress, Secretary Chertoff stated that \"the Department has more than 10 different intelligence offices, including those in Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), United States Coast Guard (USCG), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\" The largest intelligence office, he noted, was in IAIP. To accomplish the department's intelligence and related functions more effectively, he proffered, \"I will be elevating the Information Analysis resources, presently part of the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP), to be a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary.\" He also indicated that \"the Information Analysis unit should be a DHS-wide analytic entity that is empowered to coordinate activities and fuse information from all intelligence offices in DHS.\" Secretary Chertoff expressed his intent to designate the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis as the Chief Intelligence Officer, and \"the renamed Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) will provide intelligence information in support of the Department and will disseminate information and intelligence to our State and local partners.\"", "Regarding the relationship of the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer and IA with the larger intelligence community, Secretary Chertoff, testifying at a July 14 hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, suggested that they would become better participants in the intelligence community by having more to contribute as a result of gathering and integrating intelligence from all of the department's components. He reiterated that comment at a July 25 hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, saying:", "From our standpoint, our chief intelligence officer I think is going to have a couple of powerful tools in dealing with the rest of the community. First of all, that person will be able to speak for all of the intelligence components within DHS. And, second, that person is going to be able to bring to the table something that I don't think we have fully brought to the table, which is our own intelligence collection capability.", "At that same hearing, the Secretary also said the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer would be one of the two officials at DHS who would be part of the intelligence community, the other presumably coming from the U.S. Coast Guard. Asked if DHS would have a presence at the NCTC, he stated \"I most definitely anticipate and want to have DHS play a role in NCTC,\" and indicated that for this to happen is \"really just a question of finding the space and handling the logistics\" at the NCTC facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operations", "paragraphs": ["In his July 13, 2005, 2SR remarks, Secretary Chertoff indicated that, with the elimination of the BTS Directorate and vesting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with a more independent status within DHS, \"seven primary operational components will have a direct line to the Secretary\": the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection Bureau (CBP), U.S. Secret Service (USSS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau (ICE), FEMA, and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). However, he continued\u2014\"to improve our ability to coordinate and carry out operations\u2014we will establish a new Director of Operations Coordination,\" who \"will work with component leadership and other federal partners to translate intelligence and policy into actions\u2014and to ensure that those actions are joint, well-coordinated and executed in a timely fashion.\"", "Secretary Chertoff stated in his July 13, 2005, reorganization notification letter to Congress his intention to establish administratively within DHS an Office of Operations Coordination (OOC), headed by the Director of Operations Coordination, who will report directly to the Secretary. He explained that, in the original design of DHS, \"the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security (BTS) was intended to perform much of the operational coordination role envisioned for\" OOC, but noted that \"BTS has authority over only a portion of the Department's major operational components, requiring additional coordination at the Secretary's level.\" Creating OOC \"to facilitate the Secretary's coordination role will eliminate an inefficient, two-step process. Accordingly,\" he continued, \"I have asked Congress for legislation that would eliminate the position of Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["The fourth and final structural realignment area discussed by Secretary Chertoff in his July 13, 2005, 2SR remarks concerned restructuring the department regarding its preparedness responsibilities. Calling DHS an \"all hazards\" department, he noted that this concept included \"not only fighting the forces of terrorism, but also fighting the forces of natural disasters.\" The Secretary said he intended \"to consolidate the Department's existing preparedness efforts\u2014including planning, training, exercising and funding\u2014into a single directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness.\" Under this arrangement, he explained, FEMA, standing outside the new directorate, \"will be a direct report to the Secretary\u2014but it will now focus on its historic and vital mission of response and recovery.\" The new directorate \"will support FEMA with training resources and will continue to rely on FEMA's subject matter expertise and the expertise of our other components in promoting preparedness,\" he said.", "The Secretary also indicated that he intended to appoint a Chief Medical Officer, who would be located within the new Preparedness Directorate. \"This position,\" he said, \"will be filled by an outstanding physician who will be my principal advisor on medical preparedness and a high-level DHS representative to coordinate with our partners at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture and state governments.\" Secretary Chertoff had plans, as well, for another position within the Preparedness Directorate. \"To centralize the coordination of the efforts to protect technological infrastructure,\" he announced, \"we will create the new position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security within the Preparedness Directorate.\"", "Elaborating in his July 13, 2005, reorganization notification letter to Congress, the Secretary explained that the \"Administration's original vision for the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP&R) stressed the need for consolidating preparedness, response and recovery into a single directorate,\" but, he noted, DHS's preparedness programs \"are presently spread among three separate components, complicating management of these functions.\" Consequently, he wrote, \"I intend to separate preparedness resources from response and recovery and combine them in the IAIP Directorate, which will be renamed the Directorate for Preparedness.\" This reorganization, in the Secretary's view, would not require any congressional action. Under this arrangement, separating preparedness from response and recovery, portions of FEMA\u2014the U.S. Fire Administration, \"the hazardous materials training and assistance program, the chemical stockpile emergency preparedness program, the radiological emergency preparedness program and the BioShield program\"\u2014would be transferred to the Preparedness Directorate.", "Discussing the proposed Preparedness Directorate, the relationship between it and FEMA, and the future of FEMA at a July 14 hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Secretary Chertoff said:", "... the idea here is not to decouple the skills of FEMA from preparedness. It is to allow FEMA to pursue its core mission as a direct report to the secretary and then look to the preparedness directorate to draw on FEMA's skill set and the other skill sets in equal measure, in order to make sure it's covering the entire gamut of preparedness from prevention through response and recovery.", "A few days later, at a July 25 hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the Secretary again turned to the new role envisioned for FEMA.", "What the restructuring proposes to do is to take out of FEMA a couple of elements that were really not related to its core mission, that were more generally focused on the issue of preparedness in a way that I think was frankly more of a distraction to FEMA than an enhancement to FEMA. ... [W]e want to make sure that FEMA was, as an operational agency, capable of focusing on its core mission, that it was a direct report to the secretary so that it gets the direct attention that it needs. And we wanted to make sure the leadership of FEMA was not torn between its need to focus on the FEMA role the additional, rather more strategic, preparedness functions, which [I] think that we are now seeking to unify and put together in a coordinated fashion.", "He also offered the following statement regarding the intent in creating the new directorate: \"What our Preparedness Directorate will do is it will bring to the table all of these very critical functions which are part of preparedness efforts\u2014prevention, protection and response and recovery.\" Reiterating, he said: \"What I want to do is make sure that when we do preparedness policymaking, everybody is at the table.\"", "Turning to the role of the proposed Chief Medical Officer. The Secretary said:", "The idea with a chief medical officer is precisely to give us somebody who owns the entirety of this system, of response with respect to health issues. That would be prevention, protection and response and recovery, because in many cases, particularly dealing with biological threats, response and recovery is a very, very important element of our defense strategy. ... So he's going to be someone who's acutely aware of the interface between first responders and the health recovery system in the emergency type of environment ... someone who is going to apply the science of medicine and other scientific disciplines to the reality of dealing with a threat or a hazard in an emergency type of situation.", "Finally, the proposed Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST), headed by an Assistant Secretary, would have two principal areas of responsibility: (1) the cyber security component \"will be responsible for collecting, analyzing and coordinating access to information related to potential cyber terrorist threats and will coordinate Department-wide activities on cyber threats with cyber infrastructure\"; (2) the telecommunications component \"will also support telecommunications infrastructure to meet mission-critical national security and emergency preparedness communications needs for Federal, State, local and tribal governments as well as private industry.\" OCST is a somewhat more elaborate version of a model recently proposed in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 ( H.R. 1817 ) to better address cyber security threats and establishes a professionally attractive and authoritative leadership position for the entity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Entities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the four principal areas of structural realignment discussed in Secretary Chertoff's 2SR remarks of July 13, 2005, some other aspects of his planned reorganization of DHS have been revealed, but not always with details. For instance, in his July 13, 2005, reorganization notification letter to Congress, the Secretary indicated he was shifting the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center from BTS \"to be a free standing entity reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary.\" Another entity, the Federal Air Marshal Service, \"will be transferred from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to TSA effective October 1, 2005,\" the date Secretary Chertoff set for implementing his reorganization of the department. To better provide \"timely and complete responses to Congressional reporting requirements and informational inquiries from Members of Congress and state and local elected officials,\" the Secretary planned to \"merge the Offices of Legislative Affairs and those intergovernmental coordination resources of the State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness Office\" into a \"new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (OLIA) ... headed by an Assistant Secretary who will report directly to the Secretary.\" The Office of Security, which initially reported to the Under Secretary for Management, but was then redirected in the spring of 2003 to report to the Deputy Secretary, would be returned to its original reporting status \"in order to integrate security concerns more effectively with management functions across the Department.\"", "In congressional testimony shortly after his 2SR remarks of July 13, Secretary Chertoff offered some further comments on these and other new arrangements, as well as on some other new entities, within DHS. Appearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on July 14, he commented on the proposed relocation of the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC) to the Preparedness Directorate, with the result that ONCRC, instead of reporting directly to the Secretary, would report through the Under Secretary for Preparedness. Commenting that ONCRC's \"function of preparedness for the Capital ... needs to be very closely linked with preparedness in general,\" the Secretary explained the relocation, saying:", "... what this does is it enhancing [sic] the ability of the National Capital to participate in our preparedness planning and including the biopreparedness planning, using the perspective that he has, you know, drawn from the unique challenges that you face in this particular city, given the fact that it's the seat of government.", "So I actually don't view it as diminishing the role of that office, but actually as enhancing its ability to touch and influence many of the preparedness functions that we need to use that will be of direct significance to protecting the Capital of the country.", "Asked about a proposed Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), the Secretary indicated that the new entity would report directly to him, thereby giving it \"stature to attract people ... that would not just be DHS people, but would be senior people from Department of Energy and other interested departments.\" He said he had spoken with the Secretary of Energy about creating DNDO, and proffered that both of them were \"very committed to making this work\" and that \"the president is personally interested in this as well.\"", "In testimony before the House Committee on Homeland Security on July 25, Secretary Chertoff commented briefly on plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). Concerning the first of these, he said: \"I think part of the consideration of putting FPS in ICE was that FPS does have a law enforcement or police function, and ICE is a law enforcement organization.\" Regarding the latter, he indicated that \"it was our judgment that particularly because we were going to move FAMS out of ICE and back to TSA, that would enable the leadership of ICE to focus a little bit more on FPS.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rejected CBP-ICE Merger", "paragraphs": ["A reorganization proposal which did not materialize in Secretary Chertoff's 2SR plans was the suggested merger of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The House Committee on Homeland Security also considered the matter, but came to no conclusion and, instead, included a provision in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 ( H.R. 1817 ) requiring the Secretary to review and evaluate the current organizational structure of CBP and ICE and submit a report of findings and recommendations to Congress within 30 days after the enactment of the legislation. At the time the committee reported the authorization bill, Secretary Chertoff's 2SR initiative had been underway for two months.", "In his July 14 testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Secretary Chertoff was asked about the CBP-ICE merger proposal.

Putting together a tool that allows us to do that\u2014which is what we've recommended\u2014I think will address the problems that have been identified.", "The Secretary offered a very similar explanation at the July 25 hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Saying \"we actually took a very close look at this,\" and again acknowledging he \"was privy to some of the factual findings that the inspector general made when we considered this,\" Secretary Chertoff offered \"what our thinking was.\"", "First of all, part of our proposed restructuring involves having a common department-wide policy and planning shop and operations shop, which gives us not only the ability to unify operations and policy between CBP and ICE, but across the department, including, for example, Coast Guard, which often intersects with them as you get into maritime areas, and therefore should be part of the same coordination function.", "* * * * * * *", "It seemed to me that you are dealing with functionally different issues when you are dealing with CBP, which deals principally with inspection and with border patrol agents, and on the other hand you have your detention and removal folks and your investigators at ICE, and those are different functions.", "* * * * * * *", "So, given the upside of a merger, and considering the possible downside, including the huge cost that's involved any time you do a massive reorganization, I think it was our judgment that the case had not been made that a merger would cure the issues that have to be addressed. There is no question there are issues of coordination and finance that have to be addressed, and we are addressing them, but I think at this point I'm confident that what we're doing will remedy the existing problems.", "In mid-September, the Washington Times disclosed that a draft report, prepared by the DHS Inspector General at the request of Senator Susan Collins, chair of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, recommended that CBP and ICE be merged into a single entity.

Your list of legislative changes is very narrow.", "I think you're pushing the boundaries on that. And I hope you will work with the committee so that we can draft a more comprehensive reauthorization bill. I think many of the changes you're proposing really should be done by law and not just administratively. So, that's an issue we'll be pursuing with you.", "The issue underlying the comment made by Senator Collins involved Secretary Chertoff's interpretation of his reorganization authority. His interpretation was seemingly revealed in the text of a footnote in his July 13, 2005, reorganization notification letter to Congress, which stated: \"Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides broad reorganization authority and permits the Secretary to alter or consolidate existing organizational units, to establish new organizational units or to allocate or reallocate functions within the Department.\" Senator Collins' comment suggested that she did not regard the reorganization authority conveyed at Section 872 to be broad in scope, or at least not as broad as the Secretary was asserting. Moreover, the expressed agreement with her closing comments by Senator Joseph Lieberman, the ranking minority member of the committee, appeared to imply that he, too, did not regard the Secretary's reorganization authority to be broad.", "Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act (HSA) provides that the \"Secretary may allocate or reallocate functions among the officers of the Department, and may establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue organizational units within the Department, but only ... after the expiration of 60 days after providing notice of such action to the appropriate congressional committees, which shall include an explanation of the rationale for the action,\" and subject to certain limitations specified in the section. These limitations include no abolition of \"any agency, entity, organizational unit, program, or function established or required to be maintained by the [Homeland Security] Act\" or \"by statute.\" Noting that the term \"organizational units\" is not defined in the act, a CRS legal analysis of the section is instructive regarding its scope.", "[I]n applying canons of statutory construction to the HSA, it appears Congress intended an organizational unit to be something smaller than an agency or other statutorily created entity. In the limitation provision of \u00a7872(b)(1), for example, Congress placed the term organizational units after the terms agency and entity , but before the terms program and function . This placement suggests Congress may have intended an organizational unit to be smaller than an agency and entity on the general assumption that things of a higher order are named at the beginning of an enumeration and that Congress does not intend to be superfluous. In \u00a7471(b) of the HSA, Congress again suggests that an organizational unit may be a small administratively created structure. Section 471(b) authorizes the Secretary (through the President's Reorganization Plan) to reorganize the functions or organizational units within the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Because the provision places an organizational unit within the Bureau, it appears Congress intended the term to be something smaller than a bureau.", "The definition of the term organizational units , in essence, affects the Secretary's authority to reorganize DHS. Because \u00a7872(a) only allows the Secretary to establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue organizational units within the Department, it might be argued that the Secretary is only allowed to establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue units smaller than an agency, entity, or bureau. An office , advisory committee , or laboratory , for example, might arguably qualify as something smaller than an agency, entity, or bureau. Changes to structures other than organizational units would apparently need to be categorized as a reallocation of functions among the officers of the Department or be conducted pursuant to new legislative action to avoid an unauthorized action.

It may, for example, lay out a highly specified organizational framework, or it may delegate to the President or the agency head the creation of most positions and distribution of most functions, responsibilities, and authority. Usually, Congress establishes the top three or four levels of a department's hierarchy in law. By statutorily establishing leadership positions, Congress determines the shape of the leadership hierarchy for the department as well as a system of accountability to elected officials.", "The Constitution also provides Congress with considerable discretion over which officers of the United States will be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate (PAS positions), and which may be appointed by the President alone (PA positions), the courts, or agency heads. Congress has often created departmental leadership positions as PAS positions; this approach has several institutional advantages for Congress. For example, it often allows Senators to have a role in the selection of the nominee and in determining the fitness of the selected individual for the role to which he or she has been nominated. In addition, confirmation hearings provide Senators with an opportunity to conduct oversight over agencies and programs, and to extract a pledge that the nominee will appear before committees of Congress when summoned. This commitment may not be necessary, under most circumstances, to obtain testimony. An argument could be made that Congress has the authority to call most officers with operational duties, regardless of appointment status, before its committees. As a practical matter, however, the commitment obtained at the time of confirmation may make this process easier for Congress. Absent such a commitment, an Assistant Secretary, for example, may defer to an Under Secretary when requested to appear before a congressional committee.", "In some cases, Congress has elected to assign appointment authority to the President alone. Most of the positions to which appointments are made in this way are in the White House Office. These are generally positions in close proximity to the President, whose incumbents are often privy to confidential policy discussions conducted by leaders of agencies in the Executive Office of the President. By and large, officials appointed in this manner act as advisers, rather than implementing the law. Although PA positions are unusual outside of that context, the Homeland Security Act created seven such positions in the new department. As a result, Congress may have less influence regarding the kinds of individuals appointed to fill these positions and the ways in which they address their responsibilities.", "In other cases, Congress has assigned appointment authority to the Secretary.
