Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress substantially increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Congress began reversing those increases in light of the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in 2012, and budgetary constraints. Congress halted further reductions in Army and Marine Corps end-strength in FY2017, providing slight end-strength increases for both Services that year. In FY2018 and FY2019, Congress again provided slight end-strength increases for the Marine Corps, while providing a more substantial increase for the Army. However, the Army did not reach its authorized end-strength of 483,500 in FY2018 or its authorized end-strength of 487,500 in FY2019, primarily due to missing enlisted recruiting goals. End-strength for the Air Force generally declined from 2004 to 2015, but increased from 2016 to 2019. End-strength for the Navy declined from 2002 to 2012, increased in 2013 and remained essentially stable through 2017; it increased again in 2018 and 2019.

The administration's proposed decrease for the Army reflects the challenges the Army is facing in recruiting a sufficient number of new enlisted personnel to expand its force.

The implementation plan details how DOD is to reform the MHS to a \"streamlined organizational model that standardizes the delivery of care across the MHS with less overhead, more timely policymaking, and a transparent process for oversight and measurement of performance.\" Congress later revised the MHS reform mandate by further clarifying certain tasks relating to the transfer of MTFs, the roles and responsibilities of the DHA and the service surgeons general, and by extending the deadline for implementing reform efforts to September 30, 2021. DOD later revised its plan to accelerate certain tasks.", "On October 1, 2019, the military services transferred the administration and management of their U.S.-based MTFs to the DHA.

In the past few decades there have been rapid changes to certain laws and policies regarding diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in particular authorizing women to serve in combat arms occupational specialties and the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. Some of these changes remain contentious and face continuing legal challenges.

Following that effort, in 2012, DOD developed and issued a five-year Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan . In 2013, as part of the FY2013 NDAA ( P.L. 112-239 ), Congress required DOD to develop and implement a plan regarding diversity in military leadership. The House bill includes several provisions that would address diversity and inclusion, while the Senate bill has none. Section 526 of the House bill would require DOD to design and implement a five-year strategic plan that is consistent with the 2018 National Military Strategy beginning on January 1, 2020.

The enacted provision does not define extremist activity or specify the frequency for such survey questions. ", "DOD has recently initiated a number of shifts in policy with regard to individuals who identify as transgender. Current policy, which went into effect on April 12, 2019, disqualifies any individual from appointment, enlistment, or induction into the service if they have a history of cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery. The policy also disqualifies individuals with a history of gender dysphoria unless they were stable in their biological sex\u00c2\u00a0for 36 consecutive months prior to applying for admission into the Armed Forces. However, the policy allows for transgender persons to \"seek waivers or exceptions to these or any other standards, requirements, or policies on the same terms as any other person.\" Those individuals in the service who initially seek military medical care after the effective date of the policy may receive counseling for gender dysphoria and may be retained without a waiver if (1) a military medical provider has determined that gender transition\u00c2\u00a0is not medically necessary to protect the health of the individual; and (2) the member is willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards associated with his or her biological sex. Section 597 of the House bill would have required DOD to submit an annual report on the number of servicemembers who sought a waiver prior to accession or while in service on the basis of a transgender-related condition. Section 596 of the enacted bill adopts the House provision and includes clarifying language as to how data elements should be reported. It also requires DOD to protect personally identifiable and health information of members. This reporting requirement expires in 2023.

While some of these standards are specified in law (e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7504), DOD and the Services generally establish these standards through policy and regulation. The Services may require additional qualification standards for entry into certain military occupational specialties (e.g., pilots, special operations forces). By law, qualification standards for military career designators are required to be gender-neutral. Section 530B would require that service entry standards account only for the ability of an individual to meet gender-neutral occupational standards and could not include any criteria relating to the \"race, color, national origin, religion, or sex (including gender identity or sexual orientation) of an individual.\" This provision was not adopted.

In 2019, the Marines graduated the first gender-integrated boot camp class at Marine Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina. In a statement to Congress, Lieutenant General David Berger noted that there were no significant variations in the performance of gender-integrated units relative to gender-segregated units.

Eligible recipients receive monthly payments for no less than 12 months and no more than 36 months at the same rate as dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC). While in receipt of transitional compensation, dependents are also entitled to military commissary and exchange benefits, and may receive dental and medical care, including mental health services, through military facilities as TRICARE beneficiaries.

In recent years, the MoH review process has been criticized by some as being lengthy and bureaucratic, which may have led to some records being lost and conclusions drawn based on competing eyewitness and forensic evidence. Reluctance on the part of reviewing officials to award the MoH retroactively or to upgrade other awards is generally based on concern for maintaining the integrity of the award and the awards process. This reluctance has led many observers to believe that the system of awarding the MoH is overly restrictive and that certain individuals are denied earned medals. As a result, DOD periodically reviews inquiries by Members of Congress and reevaluates its historical records. Systematic reviews began in the 1990s for World War II records when African-American units remained segregated and whose valorous unit and individuals' actions, along with others, may have been overlooked. That effort resulted in more than 100 soldiers receiving the MoH, the majority of which were posthumously awarded. On January 6, 2016, DOD announced the results of its year-long review of military awards and decorations. This included review of the timeliness of the MoH process and review by all the military departments of the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, and Silver Star Medal recommendations since September 11, 2001, for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Bush awarded the MoH posthumously to Corporal Freddie Stowers, who became the first African-American recipient from WWI after the Army's review of his military records. Later, the FY2015 NDAA ( P.L. 113-291 ) authorized posthumous award of the MoH to Private Henry Johnson, an African-American veteran, and Sgt. William Shemin, a Jewish-American veteran, for valor during WWI. Proponents of the Pentagon review in Section 583 point to similar reviews for minority groups who served in other conflicts from World War II to the present. Some were later awarded the MoH, the majority of which were posthumously awarded. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \"a remote possibility exists\" that one of the veterans honored under Section 583 could have a surviving widow who could potentially receive expanded health benefits or increased survivor benefits.

The FY2018 NDAA ( P.L. 115-91 ) permanently authorized a payment called the called the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) to such surviving spouses, to offset that reduction. The SSIA payment is adjusted annually to account for cost-of-living increases. In the past, to avoid the offset, some survivors have used the authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71448(d)(2) to transfer the SBP benefit to dependent children. Section 630A of the House bill would have repealed the offset as well as the authority to provide the annuity to dependent children. Surviving spouses who had transferred the benefit would not have been able to have their eligibility for the benefit restored. Retroactive payments would not be authorized under this provision. SBP is also paid from the MRF. CBO estimates that the repeal would increase federal spending by $5.7 billion over a period of 10 years. Approximately 65,000 surviving beneficiaries are eligible to receive both SBP and DIC. Section 622 of the enacted bill phases out the requirement for an SBP-DIC offset over a period of three years, and repeals the optional SBP annuity for dependent children.", "References: CRS Report RL34751, Military Retirement: Background and Recent Developments , by Kristy N.

Congress has required additional study, data collection, and reporting to determine the scope of the issue, expand protections and support services for victims, make substantial changes to the military justice system, and take other actions to enhance sexual assault prevention and response. Sexual assault and related sex offenses are crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and are prosecutable by court-martial. DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) oversees sexual assault policy and produces an annual report on sexual assault estimated prevalence rates and actual reporting. In FY2018, estimated sexual assault prevalence rates across DOD's active duty population were 6.2% for women and 0.7% for men. These estimated prevalence rates were higher for active duty women than the FY2016 of 4.3% while the rate for men remained close to the FY2016 rate of 0.6%.", "Discussion: The following discussion is split into four topic areas:", "Reporting and Accountability; Prevention and Response; Victim Services and Support; and Military Justice and Investigations.", "In March 2019, following a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the Acting Secretary of Defense established the Sexual Assault Accountability and Investigation Task Force (SAAITF). This task force made several recommendations for legislative action, some of which are reflected in sections of the House and Senate bills.", "Reporting and Accountability . Several provisions in the House and Senate bills would have offered support to congressional oversight. In the FY2015 NDAA, Congress called for the establishment of a 20-member Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces (DAC-IPAD). The committee was established in 2016 and has since produced several studies. Section 548 of the House bill and Section 533 of the Senate bill would have extended the term of the DAC-IPAD for an additional five years. The House provision would have also expanded the scope of the committee's research to include exploring the feasibility of incorporating restorative justice models into the UCMJ. Section 535 of the enacted bill adopts the Senate provision and expands the scope of research as proposed in the House bill.", "Section 535 of the Senate bill would have required the committee to review and assess the relationship between race and ethnicity and the investigation, prosecution, and defense of sexual assault. In May 2019, the GAO reported that \"Blacks, Hispanics, and male servicemembers were more likely than Whites and female servicemembers to be the subjects of recorded investigations in all of the military services, and were more likely to be tried in general and special courts-martial.\" GAO also reported that differences in how the Services record information on race and ethnicity make it difficult to identify disparities. Section 540A of the House bill would have required DOD to conduct a review of racial, ethnic, and gender disparities across the entire military justice system (see also the \" Diversity and Inclusion \" section of this report). Section 540I of the enacted bill adopts the House provision and requires the DAC-IPAD to conduct the review for each fiscal year in which the committee assesses completed court-martial cases.", "Both bills (House Section 549 and Senate Section 534) would have required the Secretary of Defense to establish a 20-member \"Defense Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct\" with expertise in areas such as organizational culture, suicide prevention, implementation science, and the continuum of harm. This provision was adopted in the enacted bill. Section 540M of the enacted bill adopts a Senate provision requiring a GAO report on Armed Forces implementation of statutory requirements for sexual assault for FY2004\u00e2\u0080\u0093FY2019.", "Prevention and Response. Section 521 of the Senate bill would have required the Secretary of Defense and Secretaries of the military departments to promulgate policies \"to reinvigorate the prevention of sexual assault involving members of the Armed Forces.\" Elements of the required policy would include, (1) education and training on the prevention of sexual assault; (2) promoting healthy relationships; (3) empowering and enhancing the role of noncommissioned officers in the prevention of sexual assault (4) fostering social courage to promote interventions to prevent sexual assault; (5) addressing behaviors across the continuum of harm; (6) countering alcohol abuse, including binge drinking; and (7) other matters as the Secretary of Defense deems appropriate. The enacted bill adopts this provision.", "Senate Section 530 and House Section 550O would have ensured that Catch a Serial Offender (CATCH) Program information is not subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. According to SAPRO, \"CATCH allows sexual assault victims (Service members and adult dependents) to discover if the suspect in their restricted report may have also assaulted another person (a \"match\" in the CATCH website), and, having that knowledge, decide whether to convert their restricted report to unrestricted to initiate an investigation of the serial offender suspect.\" A sexual assault victim may submit a confidential restricted report and receive counseling and other services without notifying his or her commander or military investigative authorities. The report may later be converted to an unrestricted report , which does initiate an investigation. Section 530 would ensure that restricted reports to, or by the CATCH program, would not affect the report's status as restricted and thus would maintain victim confidentiality. Section 530 of the enacted bill adopts the Senate provision.", "Victim Services and Support . Both bills included provisions that would have expanded or enhanced the Special Victim Counsel (SVC) program. An SVC is a judge advocate or civilian attorney who meets special training requirements and provides legal assistance to victims of sexual assault throughout the military justice process. Based on victim surveys, there is substantial confidence and satisfaction with SVC services and support. Sections 541 and 542 of the Senate bill would expand SVC services to include cases of retaliation and would authorize services for military-affiliated victims of domestic violence when resources are available. House Section 542 would also expand SVC services to victims of domestic violence, establish minimum staffing levels, and require the creation of SVC paralegal positions. Sections 541 and 548 of the enacted bill adopt the Senate provisions and includes an amendment requiring specialized training in domestic violence for specified legal counsel and a report to Congress on resources needed to carry out the program. ", "Both House and Senate bills would have also ensured that an SVC would be made available to a requesting victim within a certain amount of time\u00e2\u0080\u009348 hours in the House bill (Section 550A), and 72 hours in the Senate version (Section 543). Section 542 of the enacted bill adopts the Senate provision for a 72-hour window. Finally, similar provisions in both bills (House Section 550C and Senate Section 544) would have required SVC training on state-specific criminal justice matters. Section 550C of the enacted bill adopts the House provision and adds \"protective orders\" to the list of topics for training.", "Another aspect of victim protection and support that appeared in both bills is the requirement for development of a safe to report policy (House Section 550 and Senate Sections 527 and 528). This policy, which has been implemented in some form at the military service academies, is intended to remove disincentives for alleged victims to report sexual assault incidents by protecting cadets and midshipmen from punishment for minor collateral misconduct violations that might be uncovered during an investigation. In response to the House provision, the Administration stated that such a policy \"would provide blanket immunity [to the alleged victim] and might have the effect of undermining the validity of a victim's allegations. Specifically, under this provision, victims might be subjected to allegations that the report was made merely to escape disciplinary or punitive action.\" It is not clear from existing data how prevalent it is for misconduct investigations to lead to sexual assault allegations or vice versa. However, survey data suggests that collateral misconduct may reduce reporting of sexual assault. According to active duty survey data for 2018, 34% of women and 26% of men who experienced a sexual assault did not report the assault because they \"thought they might get in trouble for something they had done or would get labeled a troublemaker.\" The final bill did not adopt the safe to report provision.", "Section 558 of the House bill would have required the Secretary of Defense to draft regulations on the consideration of a transfer of a military service academy student who is the victim of a sexual assault or related offense to another service academy. Section 555 of the enacted bill adopts the House provision and includes an amendment expanding options available to include enrollment in a Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (SROTC) program. Regular active duty members who are victims of sexual assault have the ability to request a permanent change of station, or a change of unit or duty assignment at the same installation; however, there are generally no regulations that provide for transfer to another service (e.g., from the Navy to the Army). Service academy cadets and midshipmen may be offered the opportunity to change units (i.e., companies or squadrons) within the same academy; however, cross-service transfers are rare. The military service academies all have similar entry requirements based on physical, mental and moral standards; however, there are certain curriculum and military education requirements that are specific to the individual academies for each academic year and summer training period. As such, considerations for transfer may include the ability of the individual to qualify under another academy's standards and complete all requirements for commissioning within the four-year program, or the necessity of waivers for certain requirements . ", "Finally, Section 550P in the House bill and Section 531 in the Senate bill would have addressed continued confidentiality of restricted reports if a sexual assault allegation is inadvertently disclosed to a third party who would normally be a mandatory reporter (e.g., commanding officers, supervisors, and law enforcement). Mandatory reporters are individuals who, when they receive information that a sexual assault has occurred, must report that information to military criminal investigative services. The enacted bill adopts the Senate provision.", "Military Justice and Investigations . Several provisions in the House and Senate bills sought to make changes to how disposition decisions are made in sex-related cases for military service academies and the total force. Section 538 of the House bill would have established a four-year pilot program at the military service academies, This pilot would have required the Secretary of Defense to establish an Office of the Chief Prosecutor, at the grade of O-7 or above, for the independent review and disposition of certain sex-related ( special victim ) offenses. Those who argue for taking decision-making outside of the chain of command contend that independent prosecutors are better equipped to make disposition decisions and that such an endeavor could improve victim confidence in the investigative and judicial process. For the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u00932018 academic program year at the service academies, there were 67 unrestricted reports alleging sexual assault by or against cadets, midshipmen, or prep school students, and 55 investigations initiated during the APY. The Administration opposed this pilot program contending that it would, \"outsource authority for discipline,\" and \"undermines commander accountability and the chain of command relationship.\" The provision was not adopted.", "Since 2012, DOD policy has required that all unrestricted reports of adult sexual assault offenses be reviewed by a special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) for the initial disposition decision. Section 522 of the Senate bill would codify the requirement that only a SPCMCA in the grade of O-6 or above may have disposition authority for certain sex-related offenses. In addition, it would require that only a SPCMCA or higher in the victim's chain of command may make disposition decisions with regard to any collateral misconduct by the victim. This provision was not adopted. ", "House Section 540 and Senate Section 523 were similar provisions that would require training for those responsible for the disposition of sexual assault cases on the exercise of such authority. Section 540C of the House bill and Section 525 of the Senate bill would have required uniform training for commanders on their role in each stage of the military justice system with regard to sexual assault cases. The enacted bill adopted these provisions.", "Section 539 of the House bill would have required that commanders take timely disposition action on nonprosecutable sex-related offenses, following a determination that there is insufficient evidence to support prosecution for a sex-related offense in a general or special court-martial. Under this provision, a commanding officer would receive the investigative materials within seven days of the nonprosecutable determination and would be required to take other judicial, nonjudicial, or administrative action on the case within 90 days. The Administration objects to this provision on the basis that it could be inconsistent with statutory requirements for higher-level review of certain non-referral dispositions and that the 90-day deadline could potentially immunize misconduct if command action is not taken within that timeframe. Section 540C of the enacted bill adopts the House provision with an amendment requiring a policy to ensure the timely disposition of alleged sex-related offenses that a court-martial convening authority has declined to refer for trial by a general or special court-martial, due to a determination that there is insufficient evidence to support prosecution.", "Several provisions in the bills also addressed victim consultation and notifications during investigative and judicial processes. Section 550B of the House bill and Section 526 of the Senate bill were identical provisions that would have require commanders to notify victims on a monthly basis on any final determinations (i.e., administrative, nonjudicial punishment, or no further action) made with respect to a case that is not referred to court-martial. The enacted bill adopted this provision. ", "The FY2015 NDAA ( P.L. 113-291 \u00c2\u00a7524) required that DOD officials ask victims about their preference regarding the prosecution venue\u00e2\u0080\u0093whether they prefer prosecution by court-martial or in a civilian court of jurisdiction. A March 2019 report by the DOD Inspector General found that in approximately 27% of the cases reviewed, victims were denied the opportunity to state their preference. In the remaining cases there was insufficient documentation to ascertain whether the victims were consulted as required by law. Sections 534 and 547 of the House bill and Section 524 of the Senate bill included provisions that would have required documentation of the consultation with the victim on the prosecution venue. Section 538 of the enacted bill adopts House provision 534 and requires implementation no later than 180 days after enactment.", "An April 2019 report by DOD's SAAITF recommended making sexual harassment a criminal offense for uniformed personnel by adding a specific punitive article to the UCMJ, to \"make a strong military-wide statement about the seriousness of these behaviors and the military's zero tolerance policy for them.\" Section 529 of the Senate bill would have require DOD to submit a report within 180 days of enactment on recommended legislative and administrative actions required to establish a separate punitive article for sexual harassment in the UCMJ. Section 540E of the enacted bill adopts the Senate provision.", "References: See also CRS Report R44944, Military Sexual Assault: A Framework for Congressional Oversight , by Kristy N.

DOD's occupational and environmental health programs typically require military and civilian personnel to receive occupation- or mission-specific exposure or injury prevention education, operational risk management training, personal protective equipment, exposure assessments, and medical prophylactics or treatment, if necessary. ", "DOD policies also require exposure assessments and screenings for certain hazardous substances or potentially harmful environments, such as lead, hexavalent chromium, cadmium, open air burn pits, radiation, blast pressure injuries, and noise. DOD primarily documents exposures in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS), an electronic \"information management system for longitudinal exposure recordkeeping and reporting.\" DOD epidemiologists, public health practitioners, and occupational safety experts use DOEHRS data to conduct medical surveillance, inform future prevention measures, and develop improved personnel protective equipment. DOD medical personnel can use DOEHRS data when evaluating, diagnosing, or treating patients exposed to a hazardous substance or environment. In addition to DOEHRS, DOD can also document certain exposures in legacy electronic health record systems, paper medical records, or the individual longitudinal exposure record (ILER). The VA also utilizes DOD's exposure data when considering presumptive service connection for a veteran's claim for disability compensation, or providing ongoing medical care. ", "While DOD's occupational and environmental health programs screen, document, and track servicemember or civilian employee exposure to certain substances, all potentially hazardous substances are not covered under these programs.

The bill also requires DOD health care providers to: (1) use standardized questions when assessing for deployment-related exposures, (2) include detailed diagnosis codes in a servicemember's medical record, and (3) have access to information contained in the Airborne and Open Burn Pit Registry (i.e., Burn Pit Registry).", "Lead Exposure. Section 703 of the enacted bill adopts Senate Section 703, which requires DOD to offer lead level screening and testing to potentially exposed children. DOD is to implement this requirement by establishing clinical practice guidelines that take into account recommendations published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on lead level screening and testing in children. The provision directs the sharing of test results with the child's parent or guardian. Test results with \"abnormal\" or \"elevated\" blood lead levels are to be disclosed to the local health department, or the CDC and an \"appropriate authority\" of the host nation, if residing overseas. DOD is required to report to Congress, by January 1, 2021, the number of children screened, found to have elevated blood lead levels, and provided treatment for lead poisoning. The provision also tasks GAO to report to Congress on the effectiveness of DOD's lead screening, testing, and treatment program for children.
