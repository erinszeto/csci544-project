{"id": "R45005", "title": "Wildfire Management Funding: Background, Issues, and FY2018 Appropriations", "released_date": "2018-01-30T00:00:00", "summary": ["The federal government's wildfire (or wildland fire) management responsibilities are fulfilled primarily by the Forest Service (FS, in the U.S. Department of Agriculture) and the Department of the Interior (DOI). These responsibilities include prevention, detection, response, and recovery related to fires that begin on federal lands. These responsibilities are accomplished through activities such as preparedness, suppression, fuel reduction, and site rehabilitation, among others. There are several ongoing concerns regarding federal wildfire management. These concerns include the total federal costs of wildfire management, the strategies and resources used for wildfire management, and the impact of wildfire on both the quality of life and the economy of communities surrounding wildfire activity. Many of these issues are of perennial interest to Congress, with annual wildfire management appropriations being one indicator of how Congress prioritizes and addresses certain wildfire management concerns.", "Congress provides annual appropriations to both FS and DOI for these activities through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, although the bulk of the appropriations go to FS. Wildfire activities are funded in two accounts for each agency: Wildland Fire Management (WFM) and Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) reserve accounts. Over the past 10 years (FY2008-FY2017), Congress has appropriated an average of $3.72 billion annually, with $4.18 billion combined to both FS and DOI in FY2017. The Administration requested a combined $3.72 billion in FY2018, a 12% decrease from FY2017 enacted levels. On September 14, 2017, the Housed passed H.R. 3354, an omnibus measure covering all 12 appropriations bills, including the FY2018 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill. This bill would provide $3.85 billion combined for wildfire purposes, an 8% decrease from FY2017 enacted levels and 3% above the Administration's requested levels.", "The Administration's FY2018 request also proposed restructuring FS and DOI's appropriations accounts, in some identical ways (e.g., eliminating funding for both the FLAME suppression accounts) but also in some different ways (e.g., moving funding for hazardous fuels management). These budget restructuring proposals may provide some benefits for FS or DOI, such as providing agency funds designated for the same activity in one account each instead of across two accounts. Restructuring the budget may have some potential drawbacks as well. For example, changing accounts may complicate analysis to inform future appropriations decisions or hinder the ability to evaluate FS's and DOI's performance.", "Congress is debating several issues related to federal funding for wildfire management. These issues include the level of federal spending on wildland fire management as well as the effectiveness of that spending (e.g., whether the funding is allowing agencies to meet wildfire management targets). In some years, Congress also faces requests from the agencies for additional appropriations during severe fire activity. Congress has frequently provided additional funding for wildfire management above the level in the annual appropriations bill, usually for suppression purposes. The recurring need for supplemental funds raises questions about the accuracy of the budgeting process for wildfire funding and how the agencies estimate wildfire suppression funding requirements, among other issues.", "This report provides an overview of the accounts that fund wildfire management activities and historical wildfire management appropriations data, as well as information on FY2018 appropriations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Wildfire (or wildland fire), an unplanned and unwanted fire, can have beneficial and harmful impacts on human, historical, cultural, and ecological resources. Wildfires can reduce fuel loads, increase ecosystem health and functioning, and restore fire-adapted ecosystems. At the same time, wildfires can damage timber resources and soils and degrade water quality and watershed functions. Wildfires also can damage communities, destroy homes, and lead to loss of human life.", "Wildfire management is a series of coordinated activities undertaken by federal, state, and local authorities to prepare for, resolve, and recover from wildfire events. These activities generally are categorized as fuel reduction, preparedness, suppression, and site rehabilitation. A number of federal, state, and local agencies can and do respond to wildfires. States are responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on nonfederal (state, local, and private) lands, except for lands protected by federal agencies under cooperative agreements. The federal government is responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on federal lands. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (FS) carries out wildfire response and management across the 193\u00a0million acres of national forests and national grasslands. The Department of the Interior (DOI) carries out wildfire management and response on more than 400 million acres of national parks, wildlife refuges and preserves, Indian reservations, and other public lands. Sometimes more than one agency may respond, depending on where the fire occurs and spreads, the potential threats, and the expertise required. In these cases, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) coordinates the national mobilization of resources for wildfire and other incidents throughout the United States.", "Both FS and DOI receive annual discretionary appropriations for wildfire management activities through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills. Wildfire management funding for DOI is provided to the Office of Wildland Fire (a department-level office), which then allocates the funding to four DOI agencies\u2014Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), National Park Service (NPS), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).

Since then, wildfire appropriations have varied between a low of $2.9 billion in FY2012 and a high of $5.2 billion in FY2008 (as measured in constant FY2017 dollars). The majority of wildfire management appropriations go to FS. From FY1994 to FY2017, FS received around 71% of the total wildfire management appropriations annually on average and DOI received 29%. FS has received a slightly larger share more recently, though, receiving 76% annually on average over the past 10 years (while DOI's share has decreased to 24% over that time period).

For example, over the past 10 years, wildfire appropriations have made up approximately 50% of the agency's discretionary funds, on average (see Figure 2 ), although not all of those funds counted against discretionary spending limits. In comparison, wildfire appropriations account for about 8% of DOI's total discretionary appropriations, on average.", " Table 1 displays annual total wildfire management appropriations for the past 10 years, from FY2008 to FY2017.

Programs within these accounts generally correspond to the different categories of wildland fire management activities. The WFM appropriation is distributed among two programs: Fire Operations and Other Fire Operations . The Fire Operations program receives the bulk of the WFM appropriation and funds two activities: preparedness and suppression. The Other Fire Operations program funds hazardous fuels reduction activities, joint fire research and science programs (e.g., NIFC operations), and programs to provide financial and technical assistance for state and volunteer wildfire management.", "Prior to FY2017, appropriations to FS and DOI wildfire accounts typically were designated by Congress to remain available until expended, meaning those funds were \"no-year\" appropriations (i.e., appropriations without fiscal year limitations) available in future years.

FS also uses suppression funds for emergency stabilization and initial site rehabilitation activities (called burned area emergency response). DOI also uses some suppression funds for emergency stabilization, but DOI also receives funds for burned area response within its Other Fire Operations program. In addition, DOI's Other Fire Operations program includes appropriations for fuels management, joint fire science activities, and funds for facilities construction and maintenance.

FS uses preparedness funds to establish and maintain web-based decision support tools; manage and modernize aviation assets; and conduct predictive services analysis, among other things. DOI uses preparedness funds to prepare and execute fire management plans and cooperative agreements; provide infrastructure support; manage firefighting assets; support NIFC; and more. ", "Congress appropriated a combined total of $1.42 billion for preparedness activities in FY2017 ($1.08 billion for FS; $333 million for DOI), nearly level to the $1.41 billion appropriated in FY2016. Over the past 10 years (FY2008-FY2017), funding for the DOI preparedness activity has been $294 million on average annually. Funding fluctuated at or below $290 million until FY2015 and has increased annually for the past three fiscal years. Appropriations for FS preparedness has averaged $901 million annually over the past 10 years, although FS preparedness funding increased by close to 50% from FY2011 ($674 million) to FY2012 ($1.0 billion). This increase was mostly due to a restructuring of the preparedness and suppression activities, which included shifting aviation and other changes to the preparedness activity. Since the budget restructuring, FS preparedness appropriations have averaged $1.05 billion annually (FY2012-FY2017)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fire Operations: Suppression", "paragraphs": ["Suppression is the work associated with extinguishing or confining a fire. Resolution of an active wildfire may include activities ranging from immediate and aggressive measures to suppress a wildfire (e.g., personnel and large air tanker response for a wildfire moving quickly toward a populated area), to immediate but less intense measures (e.g., monitoring a grassland wildfire where there is no immediate threat to humans). Funds for suppression typically are provided through two accounts in annual Interior appropriations laws: the WFM account and the FLAME account. If the funding in the WFM suppression activity and the FLAME account is exhausted during any given fiscal year, FS and DOI are authorized to transfer funds from their other accounts to pay for continued suppression activities. This practice is sometimes referred to as fire borrowing or fire transfers . Congress also may provide additional funds for suppression activities through emergency or supplemental appropriations. Suppression funding data are thus presented in this report in three different sections corresponding to the three different funding sources: WFM suppression, FLAME, and supplemental appropriations. They are collectively discussed in the \" Total Suppression Appropriations \" section of this report.", "WFM suppression appropriations are used primarily for wildfire response. Some items covered by the FS suppression activity are firefighter salaries, aviation asset operations, and incident support functions. The FS suppression activity also covers personnel and resources for the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) program. Items covered by the DOI suppression activity include selected personnel expenses above what is covered by the preparedness subaccount, temporary emergency firefighters, aircraft flight operations and support, and initial emergency stabilization activities. FS and DOI also may assist each other with suppression activities, on a reciprocal non-reimbursement basis up to $50 million annually. Both FS and DOI typically request and receive appropriations for suppression funds based on the average of the previous 10 years of suppression obligations.", "The suppression activity received $1.64 billion in FY2017 ($1.25 billion for FS; $395 million for DOI), an increase of more than $540 million from FY2016 levels ($1.10 billion combined). This nearly 50% increase was primarily because Congress appropriated the full 10-year suppression obligation average entirely in the WFM suppression activity in FY2017. Previously, Congress had appropriated about 70% of the 10-year obligation average in the WFM suppression activity, and the remaining 30% was appropriated in the FLAME account.

This increase was largely in response to the severity and cost of the 2015 fire season. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $407.0 million to the FLAME accounts ($342.0 million to FS; $65.0 million to DOI). Congress designated the FY2017 FLAME funds as emergency requirements, consistent with the direction in Section 502(d) of the FLAME Act.

Issues under debate include the level of federal spending on wildfire management as well as the effectiveness of that spending (e.g., whether the funding is allowing agencies to meet wildfire management targets). Wildfire spending has increased considerably since the 1990s (see Figure 1 ). A significant portion of that increase is related to rising suppression costs, even during years of relatively mild wildfire activity, although the costs vary and are difficult to predict in advance. Congress also is debating the level of appropriations dedicated for certain wildfire management activities. Questions include whether the rising cost of suppression should compete with funding other agency programs and activities and whether investing more in hazardous fuel reduction activities may help to reduce wildfire costs in the future. ", "In the past, when wildfire suppression funding was exhausted during a fiscal year, the agencies sometimes have had to transfer funds from non-wildfire management suppression accounts. This practice may impact the performance of the activities under those other accounts. In such cases, Congress faces a decision as to whether to reimburse the accounts from which funding was transferred or to otherwise provide supplemental appropriations. The reimbursement or supplemental appropriation often is provided in the following fiscal year. Fire transfers often may disrupt the regular budget cycle and complicate discussions about how much suppression funding is needed for the current fiscal year.

Three of the five occasions occurred after the establishment of the FLAME accounts (FY2013, FY2014, and FY2016). This may lead to questions regarding the structure of wildfire funding and wildfire suppression budgeting methods. Wildfire suppression funding estimates depend on multiple factors (e.g., weather, fuel load, nearby dwellings, access to wildfire site). Various reasons have been given as to why suppression estimates have at times not accurately forecasted suppression expenses, with estimates typically underestimating suppression spending. Wildfire suppression is complicated, and both the efficiency of resources used for wildfire suppression and the federal protocol for wildfire management have an impact on wildfire suppression costs. ", "Analyzing trends in wildfire management funding could provide insights useful to Congress during these debates. However, analyzing wildfire funding trends over time\u2014particularly prior to FY2001\u2014is challenging for many reasons. The agencies' account structures have changed over time, with different activities funded through different programs and new accounts created. For example, after the establishment of the FLAME account in FY2010, appropriations that previously had gone entirely to WFM suppression were dispersed between two different accounts. A further complication is that costs for one wildfire season (i.e., a calendar year) often extend into appropriations for two fiscal years, and sometimes appropriations are enacted in one fiscal year to cover costs incurred in previous fiscal years."], "subsections": []}]}}
