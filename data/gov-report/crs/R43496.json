On December 19, 2013, Target confirmed that some 40 million credit and debit card account numbers had been stolen. On January 10, 2014, Target announced that personal information, including the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of up to 70 million customers, was also stolen during the data breach. A report by the Senate Committee on Commerce in March 2014 concluded that Target missed opportunities to prevent the data breach.", "Target. To date, Target has reported data breach costs of $248 million. Independent sources have made back-of-the-envelope estimates ranging from $240 million to $2.2 billion in fraudulent charges alone. This does not include additional potential costs to consumers concerned about their personal information or credit histories; potential fines or penalties to Target, financial institutions, or others; or any costs to Target related to a loss of consumer confidence. The breach was among the largest in U.S. history.", "Consumer concern over the scale of this data breach has fueled further congressional attention on the Target breach and data security and data breaches more broadly. In the wake of Target's revelations, between February 3 and April 2, 2014, Congress held seven hearings by six different committees related to these topics. In addition to examining the events surrounding the Target breach, hearings have focused on preventing such data breaches, improving data security standards, protecting consumers' personal data, and notifying consumers when their data have been compromised.", "Other financial data breaches. In addition to Target, there have been data breaches at Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, Sony, and Adobe. Payment card information was obtained at Adobe and Home Depot. Hackers downloaded a wide range of company confidential information at Sony, and they obtained contact information in the JPMorgan Chase breach.", "Policy options discussed in these hearings include federal legislation to require notification to consumers when their data have been breached; potentially increase Federal Trade Commission (FTC) powers and authorities over companies' data security; and create a federal standard for the general quality or reasonableness of companies' data security. The hearings also broached the broader question of whether the government should play a role in encouraging or even requiring companies to adopt newer data security technologies.", "None of the legislation introduced in the 113th Congress that addressed these various issues became law. In 2014 and 2015, the Obama Administration encouraged Congress to pass legislation on data security and data breach notification. Attorney General Eric Holder issued a public statement in the wake of the Target breach on February 24, 2014, that urged Congress to pass a federal data breach notification law, which would hold entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe. The FTC also called on Congress to pass a federal data security law, including data breach notification and to increase the commission's explicit statutory authority over data security issues.", "Key questions. This report answers some frequently asked questions about the Target and selected other data breaches, including what is known to have happened in the breach, and what costs may result. It also examines some of the broader issues common to data breaches, including how the payment system works, how cybersecurity costs are shared and allocated within the payment system, who bears the losses in such breaches more generally, what emerging cybersecurity technologies may help prevent them, and what role the government could play in encouraging their adoption. The report addresses policy issues that were discussed in the 113th Congress to deal with these issues.", "Updating.

In the four-party system, the issuing bank, not the payment card company, bears the credit risk. Thus, the issuing bank, not the payment card company, in a four-party payment system, has potential exposure to the costs of payment card fraud.

In practice, the payment card issuers do not charge a cardholder for fraudulent transactions. The breached organization frequently absorbs all of the fraudulent charges and provides free credit monitoring; consumers are to identify the fraudulent transactions and notify the card issuer.

These contracts allocate liability, the right to indemnification for breaches, and set certain duties and standards for cybersecurity protections, such as in the individually negotiated \"representations and warranties\" sections of such contracts. ", "Generally, the issuing financial institution pays the cost of card reissuance and for fraudulent charges made on compromised cards. Banks may sue the retailer for employing inadequate data security systems. A number of smaller financial institutions have filed class action lawsuits against Target under Minnesota state law, which reportedly has strict standards on data breach notification and minimum cybersecurity standards. (Target is headquartered in Minnesota.) The financial institutions claim damages, among other things, for costs associated with notifying customers of issues related to the Target data breach, closing out and opening new customer accounts, reissuing cards, and refunding customer losses resulting from unauthorized charges.

Maxx was discovered in late 2006 and involved about 45 million debit and credit cards. To cover the eventual expenses of the breach, T.J. Maxx set aside $5 million in FY2007 and $198 million in FY2008, for a total of $203 million. By way of comparison, T.J. Maxx's profit was $1.4 billion in FY2007 and $1.6 billion in FY2008.", "In sum, courts have been called upon to play key roles in deciding who should bear losses from data breaches like Target's. This is often done on a case-by-case basis, and often litigated under a variety of state laws. This has led to a lack of uniformity in the outcomes. ", "This situation has led to calls from some academics and media observers for Congress to examine the issue of who ultimately is responsible for the losses and who is in the best position to prevent losses. Some have also called on Congress to craft policy solutions allocating liability to those best able to minimize the threat of cybercrime and thereby protect consumers at the least cost. Because of the shared responsibility for cybersecurity over consumers' data, however, it may not be easy to determine which parties are in fact in the best position to minimize the threat of cybercrime and protect consumers. This is because customers' data are necessarily shared by retailers, payment card companies, payment processors, and financial institutions. Because breaches may occur at any point along this chain, deciding who should bear the cost of cybersecurity may not be straightforward. ", "To date, congressional hearings on the Target breaches have tended to focus more on policy solutions, such as notifying consumers that data breaches have occurred, and increasing or clarifying the FTC's authority to sanction lax data security practices.

Generally speaking, however, a data security breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) that could compromise the confidentiality or integrity of data. \"Data breach notification\" involves mandating that the company holding the PII notify those whose PII was compromised. Currently, only a few specific sectors of the private-sector economy are required by federal law to notify consumers when a data breach may have compromised their personal information, or PII. These include certain financial institutions covered by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain health care entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). There is no comprehensive federal law governing the protection of data held by private actors. However, certain sectors are subject to cybersecurity obligations that may include data security. Nor is there any comprehensive federal law requiring notification of breaches of such private data. ", "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, currently 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have passed laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Three states have not passed such laws: Alabama, New Mexico, and South Dakota. California in 2002 became the first state to pass such a law. ", "Businesses have complained about the patchwork of numerous, separate data breach notification laws they are required to comply with, citing burdensomeness and inefficiency. Business groups representing the financial and retail sectors, such as the Financial Services Roundtable and the National Retail Federation, have recently called for passage of a federal data breach notification law. Some state regulators, state attorneys general, and certain consumer groups have voiced concerns that a federal law could preempt state laws and prevent states from mandating stricter notification standards. A stronger federal data breach notification law, by contrast, appears to be more attractive to consumer groups. A number of businesses have called for enactment of a federal notification law as it may result in cost savings, by potentially eliminating the need to comply with 47 individual state laws. In addition, the executive branch has voiced support for a federal data breach notification law. Recent media reports have suggested that bipartisan consensus may be building around the necessity of a federal data breach notification law, although details remain divergent between various bills and proposals. ", "Generally, data breach notification laws include several components and address topics such as (1) which entities must comply with the law; (2) what information is being protected, and how a security breach or data breach is defined; (3) what degree of actual harm must occur, if any, for notice to be triggered; (4) how and when must notice be delivered; (5) are there any exceptions or safe harbors; (6) to what degree does this preempt state law and how does the law relate to other federal laws; and (7) what penalties, enforcement authorities, and remedies for those harmed does it create.", "The data breach notification bills introduced in the 113 th Congress ( S. 1897 , S. 1193 , S. 1927 , S. 1976 , S. 1995 , H.R. 1468 , and H.R. 3990 ) addressed these elements in various ways.

", "Currently, the FTC relies on its statutory powers under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to pursue data security violations. First, if a company makes materially misleading statements or omissions relating to an entity's data security practices and such statements or omissions are likely to mislead reasonable consumers, the FTC has argued that a company has engaged in unfair and deceptive practices prohibited by Section 5. The company can agree with the FTC, negotiate a consent agreement with the FTC, or deny the FTC's claim. In this latter situation, the FTC could sue the company, alleging they engaged in unfair and deceptive practices prohibited under Section 5. The FTC has reported that it has settled more than 30 matters on these grounds alone, in challenging companies' express or implied claims that they provided reasonable security for personal data. Second, if a company's data security practices either \"cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers nor are outweighed by benefits to consumers or to competition,\" the FTC has argued that those practices can be found to violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC stated that it has settled more than 20 cases based on such allegations that a failure to reasonably safeguard consumer data was an unfair trade practice.", "Despite the FTC's total of 50 settlements broadly related to data security since 2001, the Federal Trade Commission Act does not contain explicit statutory power for the FTC to levy civil penalties specifically for unfair or deceptive trade practices related to data breaches. The remedies agreed to in the settlements include the company agreeing to cease the unfair or deceptive trade practice but not paying extra penalties. For example, the FTC reached a data security settlement with TRENDnet, which involved a video camera designed to allow consumers to monitor their homes remotely. While TRENDnet marketed the cameras for in-home monitoring and claimed in product descriptions that the cameras were \"secure,\" TRENDnet allegedly had software that left them open to online viewing by anyone with the cameras' web addresses, resulting in hackers posting 700 consumers' live feeds on the Internet. Pursuant to a settlement with the FTC, TRENDnet must maintain a comprehensive security program, obtain outside audits, notify consumers about the security issues and about software updates to correct them, and provide affected customers with free technical support for two years. But the FTC does not possess explicit statutory powers to impose monetary penalties or punitive fines on companies, such as TRENDnet or others, for unfair or deceptive trade practices related to a data breach. The FTC has asked Congress to pass legislation making explicit its authority in this area. The agency argues that having the explicit authority to impose fines or penalties as a result of an unfair or deceptive trade practice due to a data breach could provide a more useful deterrent effect. The FTC has also requested that it be given express statutory authority to issue rules and regulations and jurisdiction over non-profit companies, which may also store consumers' personal data.", "The validity of the FTC's authority to pursue a company's data breach practices has recently been challenged in federal court. Some had predicted that the outcome of the court case could have affected the FTC's current enforcement authority over data security. In June 2012, following intermittent data breaches between 2008 and 2010, the FTC sued Wyndham hotel chains for allegedly misrepresenting the security measures the company took to protect consumers' personal information. In response, Wyndham filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in 2013. Wyndham claimed that \"Section 5's prohibition on 'unfair' trade practices does not give the FTC authority to prescribe data-security standards for the private sector, particularly through selective enforcement actions that seek to impose after-the-fact Section 5 liability without any fair notice as to what the Commission believes Section 5 prohibits or requires.\" Some had predicted that, if the court had ruled in Wyndham's favor, then, barring any legislative action by Congress, future such lawsuits by the FTC over data security could become more problematic for the independent agency. However, on April 7, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey denied Wyndham's motion to dismiss the FTC's lawsuit, ruling that the FTC had adequately stated claims that Wyndham engaged in unfair and deceptive practices.", "Several bills introduced in the Senate in the 113 th Congress could have affected the FTC's powers.

S. 1976 would have provided the FTC with explicit authority to promulgate \"information security\" regulations that could extend to certain non-profits.

Such critics advocate that in addition to data breach notification, the federal government might create standards for what represents a minimum acceptable level of data security. One study noted that a lack of clarity in terms of what precautions businesses should take to protect consumers' personal information has resulted in a patchwork of state data security standards. Though the FTC has proposed some generic guidelines, the agency arguably does not have authority to promulgate official regulations which could detail such standards more fully. ", "Creating a federal standard for data security has both proponents and opponents in Congress. On the one hand, critics voice concerns that a federal standard would be too rigid for such a rapidly evolving, technology-driven field as data security. They fear that a federal standard could be burdensome and could lag behind new technological trends or even discourage businesses from adopting newer technologies to prevent fraud. On the other hand, proponents of creating federal data security standards argue that such a standard need not be specific nor advocate particular technologies. According to this argument, the federal statute could, for example, consist of a mandate that an organization employ a level of data security that is \"reasonable\" for the size and complexity of its data operations, for the cost of available tools to reduce vulnerabilities, and for the volume and sensitivity of consumer information it holds.", "Bills in both the Senate and the House appear to create differing types of federal standards for data security, along with other changes, such as data breach notification.

For institutions that are registered investment advisers, investment companies, or broker-dealers, that regulator would be the Securities and Exchange Commission. For institutions that are futures commission merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, or introducing brokers, the regulator would be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

While the financial sector is considered to be part of the U.S. \"critical infrastructure,\" the retail sector is not. Thus, the \"merchants\" sector discussed in this report on the Target breach are not included in this voluntary framework. Target, however, owns a bank and after its data breaches used this to become the first retailer to join the financial services information sharing and analysis sector (FS-ISAC). The NIST framework is discussed in more detail in the CRS Legal Sidebar National Institute of Standards and Technology Issues Long-awaited Cybersecurity Framework . The impact of the NIST framework remains to be seen. Being voluntary, the framework contains no direct means to enforce compliance.

This is problematic as customer PII is shared by these companies and must be protected through the payment chain. To use a simple analogy, in a house shared by several roommates, each wants to see the house kept clean, but no one wants to clean the living room. Similarly, customer information is often protected by each of these parties to the payment system at different points along the way, including by the merchant, the payment card company, the issuing and acquiring banks, and the payment processor. This creates a similar problem of participants trying to shift the costs of cyber protection to the other participants. How cybersecurity costs are allocated relates to the question of whether retailers, banks, and payment card companies have been willing to pay for, and adopt, new data security technology quickly enough.

Witnesses at times criticized parties representing merchants, banks, or payment card companies for inadequate payment card security, resulting in what the media called \"finger-pointing.\" Yet it is unclear whether a superior legislative solution to this shared property problem exists. Currently, a web of negotiated agreements allocates liability for customer breaches among the various parties. Merchant trade groups, however, have complained that excessive market power of payment card companies, such as MasterCard and Visa, has forced an undue share of the costs of cybersecurity protections on the merchants, and that they also bear an unduly high share of the penalties and indemnifications to payment card companies and banks for breaches, while payment card companies are not spending enough to upgrade security technology, including moving from magnetic stripe and signature to Chip and PIN. Banks, meanwhile, have complained that they pay most of the costs to reissue cards and reimburse for fraudulent charges and that often such breaches result from merchants' security errors.", "Could a legislative solution better allocate such costs compared with individually negotiated contracts? A 2010 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia discussion paper interviewed many payment system participants and found that, while merchants have a vested interest in protecting data to uphold their reputations and brands, as well as to avoid chargebacks, some did not feel they had ownership over the fraud mitigation system with which they contractually have to comply. One concern voiced by banks and payment card companies was that if data security were to become a competitive factor, information sharing and cooperating on data security might be more difficult. Consumers might view competition for superior data security as desirable. While the article raised questions such as to whether the costs of payment card fraud and of avoiding such fraud are borne by the appropriate parties in the payment system, it concluded only that, \"The answers to these questions are not simple.\"", "A number of Members of Congress participating in the Target hearings raised the question of why the United States still had not moved to a Chip and PIN system (see \" What Industry Best Practices Have Been Adopted? \" for more information), as this technology is widely believed to make breaches more difficult. Senator Warren pressed industry representatives to explain why they had not yet adopted this Chip and PIN technology, and she suggested that government action might be warranted to encourage adoption of new technology. Senator Durbin stated that retailers and customers were actually paying one cent for each transaction to cover anti-fraud and security costs of payment cards, and questioned whether the technology upgrades were being adopted quickly enough, in light of this. But, while Members raised the question often of why more advanced technology had not yet been adopted in America, in contrast to the European Chip and PIN standard, they generally stopped short of advocating that the federal government mandate any specific technology upgrades or changes at this point in time.
