Data on CECs that would help determine their risk to humans and aquatic life or other aspects of the environment are often limited. Increased monitoring and detections of one particular group of chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has recently heightened public and congressional interest in these CECs and has also prompted a broader discussion about how CECs are identified, detected, and regulated and whether additional actions should be taken to protect human health and the environment.

Under the CWA, a primary mechanism to control contaminants in surface waters is through permits. The statute prohibits the discharge of pollutants from any point source (i.e., a discrete conveyance) to waters of the United States without a permit. The CWA authorizes EPA and states to limit or prohibit discharges of pollutants in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits they issue. These permits incorporate technology-based and water-quality-based requirements.", "The CWA authorizes EPA and states to address CECs through technology-based effluent limitations using national Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards (ELGs) or by setting technology-based effluent limits in NPDES permits on a case-by-case basis. The CWA requires EPA to publish ELGs, which are the required minimum standards for industrial wastewater discharges. The CWA also requires EPA to annually review all existing ELGs and to publish a biennial plan that includes a schedule for review and revision of promulgated ELGs, identifies categories of sources discharging toxic or nonconventional pollutants that do not have ELGs, and establishes a schedule for promulgating ELGs for any newly identified categories. In cases where EPA has not established an ELG for a particular industrial category or type of facility, or where pollutants or processes were not considered when an ELG was developed, the permitting authority (EPA or states) may still impose technology-based effluent limits on a case-by-case basis.

Under the CWA, one of the primary mechanisms to protect or improve surface water quality is to limit or prohibit discharges of contaminants, including CECs, in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. The CWA authorizes EPA and delegated states to set limits or prohibit discharges of pollutants in permits through technology-based effluent (i.e., discharge) limitations and standards and through water-quality-based effluent limitations, which are established through water quality standards and criteria. Technology-based effluent limitations are specific numerical limits (i.e., maximum allowable levels of specific pollutants) that represent the minimum level of control that must be established in a permit. In cases where technology-based effluent limitations are not adequate to meet applicable water quality standards, the permits also incorporate water-quality-based effluent limitations.

As outlined in the strategy, EPA considers four main factors when prioritizing existing ELGs for possible revision: (1) the amount and type of pollutants in an industrial category's discharge and the relative hazard to human health or the environment, (2) the availability of an applicable and demonstrated wastewater treatment technology, process change, or pollution prevention measure that can reduce pollutants in the discharge and the associated risk to human health or the environment; (3) the cost, performance, and affordability or economic achievability of the wastewater treatment technology, process change, or pollution prevention measure; and (4) the opportunity to eliminate inefficiencies or impediments to pollution prevention or technological innovation or promote innovative approaches.

These analyses evaluate discharge monitoring reports and EPA's Toxic Release Inventory to rank industrial categories according to the total toxicity of their wastewater. In 2012, the Government Accountability Office recommended that the annual review include additional industrial hazard data sources to augment its screening-level reviews.

EPA is authorized to revise the list of hazardous substances subject to these criteria as may be appropriate.

CERCLA authorizes federal actions to respond to a release, or substantial threat of a release, of a hazardous substance into the environment in coordination with the states. CERCLA similarly authorizes response actions for releases of other pollutants or contaminants that may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare. CERCLA also establishes liability for response costs and natural resource damages but only for hazardous substances and not for other pollutants or contaminants.", "CERCLA response authority is available for releases of pollutants or contaminants but without liability to require a potentially responsible party to perform or pay for response actions. Designating a CEC as a toxic pollutant or hazardous substance under the CWA would have the effect of establishing liability for their release as a hazardous substance under CERCLA. However, releases in compliance with a CWA permit would be exempt from liability under CERCLA as a \"federally permitted release\" based on the premise that the permit requirements would mitigate potential risks.", "CWA Section 311 also establishes liability for releases of hazardous substances, but CERCLA liability and enforcement mechanisms are broader than the CWA. In practice, CERCLA has been the principal federal authority used to respond to discharges of hazardous substances into surface waters and to enforce liability, although the enforcement authorities of CWA Section 311 remain available to EPA.

Observers note that in the coming years, other CECs will likely emerge and prompt similar calls for immediate action to protect public health and the environment. Many observers argue that federal actions to address CECs currently tend to be reactive rather than proactive. Many of these observers assert that more focus and attention is needed on assessing the toxicity of chemical substances before they are introduced into commerce. Congress is currently considering legislation to improve federal coordination and responses to CECs.", "Specific to the CWA, some observers advocate for oversight to identify and address potential gaps or barriers in CWA authorities and processes that make it difficult for EPA and states to quickly respond when CECs are detected. Other observers assert that EPA could better use its existing authorities to address CECs. For example, EPA has not updated its ELGs for certain industrial categories in decades. Accordingly, some observers assert that various ELGs do not reflect advancements in science or technology that could lead to new effluent limitations for CECs. Similarly, some stakeholders assert that EPA could better prioritize which CECs warrant water quality criteria development. EPA's ability to address these and other recommendations depends on the availability of resources, treatment technologies, and scientific and economic data. Moving forward, Congress may be interested in evaluating EPA appropriations for the CWA programs that support EPA's efforts to address discharges of CECs. Congress may also be interested in overseeing the Administration's implementation of these programs."], "subsections": []}]}}
