Over the next few years, Medicaid expenditures are expected to increase significantly due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) Medicaid expansion. The federal government is paying the vast majority of the costs associated with the ACA Medicaid expansion due to the enhanced federal matching rates available to states that choose to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion.", "Spending on managed care and long-term services and supports comprises more than half of Medicaid expenditures on benefits. Per-enrollee Medicaid expenditures for individuals with disabilities and the elderly are significantly higher than per-enrollee expenditures for adults and children, due in part to the higher utilization of long-term services and supports among individuals with disabilities and the elderly.", "Medicaid expenditures are influenced by economic, demographic, and programmatic factors.

For instance, federal disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding to states cannot exceed a state-specific annual allotment.

In addition, the federal share for most Medicaid administrative costs does not vary by state and is generally 50%.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended) included a couple of FMAP exceptions, such as the newly eligible federal matching rates and the expansion state federal matching rates.

The expansion state federal matching rate is available for coverage of individuals in expansion states who were eligible for Medicaid on March 23, 2010, and are in the new eligibility group.

However, with the exceptions to the FMAP added by the ACA, the federal share of Medicaid expenditures has increased. In FY2014, the federal share of Medicaid expenditures was 60% on average.

The amount of budget authority provided in appropriations acts for Medicaid is based on budget projections for meeting the funding needs of the program.

Federal statute allows as much as 60% of the state share to come from local government funding. Federal regulations also stipulate that the state share not be funded with federal funds (Medicaid or otherwise). In state fiscal year 2013, on average, 73% of the state share of Medicaid expenditures was financed by state general funds, and the remaining 27% was financed by other state funds. ", "A few funding sources have received a great deal of attention over the past couple decades because states have used these funds in financing mechanisms designed to maximize the amount of federal Medicaid funds coming to the state. For example, some states have used financing mechanisms that involve the coordination of fund sources, such as provider taxes and intergovernmental transfers, and payment policies, such as DSH and supplemental payments, to draw down federal Medicaid funds without expending much, if any, state general funds.
