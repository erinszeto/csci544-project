The appropriation included an additional $80 million in unobligated funds \"rescinded\" from past appropriations. Overall, P.L. 109-54 provided more funding for EPA than the Administration's FY2006 request of $7.52 billion, but less than the FY2005 appropriation of $8.03 billion. Among individual programs, funding decreased for some activities and increased for others, compared with the FY2006 request and the FY2005 appropriation.", "At the end of the first session, the 109th Congress enacted a government-wide rescission in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2006 (P.L. 109-148, H.R. 2863). This rescission reduced FY2006 funding for EPA and all other federal agencies by 1%, except for the Department of Veterans Affairs and excluding \"emergency\" spending. P.L. 109-148 also reallocated $8 million in emergency funds to EPA for responding to leaking underground tanks in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Administration had recommended $15 million for this purpose in October 2005, as part of a $17.1 billion reallocation of emergency funds. The law did not include the $166 million rescission for EPA's clean water State Revolving Fund (SRF) that the Administration also had proposed in October, as part of a $2.3 billion rescission affecting numerous federal agencies.", "In the debate over the Interior bill, considerable attention focused on the adequacy of federal assistance to states to support the clean water and drinking water SRFs. States use these funds to issue loans to communities for constructing and upgrading wastewater and drinking water infrastructure to meet federal requirements. Prior to the two rescissions noted above, P.L. 109-54 provided $900 million for the clean water SRF, an increase above the Administration's request of $730 million, but a decrease below the FY2005 appropriation of $1.09 billion. P.L. 109-54 also provided $850 million for the drinking water SRF, which was the same as the Administration had requested and similar to the FY2005 appropriation, prior to the two above rescissions.", "Other prominent issues in the debate over FY2006 appropriations for EPA included the adequacy of funding for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the Superfund program, the cleanup of commercial and industrial sites referred to as brownfields, EPA's homeland security activities, \"congressional project priorities\" or earmarks, and EPA's use and consideration of intentional human dosing studies for determining potential human health risks from exposure to pesticides.

Annual appropriations provide the funds necessary for EPA to carry out its responsibilities under these laws, such as the regulation of air and water quality, use of pesticides and toxic substances, management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and cleanup of environmental contamination. EPA also awards grants to assist state, tribal, and local governments in controlling pollution in order to comply with federal laws.

The Superfund account in EPA's budget funds the agency's efforts to remove contamination that presents an immediate risk, and to remediate contamination for which there is a potential pathway of exposure. This account also funds EPA's efforts to enforce CERCLA and to require potentially responsible parties (PRPs), including federal facilities, to remediate contamination. The Superfund account pays for the cleanup when there is no financially viable party at private sector sites. The costs of remediation at federal facilities are paid by the federal agency that caused the contamination, rather than out of the Superfund account.", "Among the major concerns associated with the Superfund account is whether the funding level is adequate to meet cleanup needs and protect human health and the environment. The pace of cleanup has been an ongoing issue. Some Members of Congress have asserted that steady funding for the Superfund program is sufficient to meet cleanup needs. Other Members, states, environmental organizations, and communities have countered that more funding is needed to maintain an adequate pace of cleanup. Completing the construction of cleanup remedies at a site is often used as a measure of the pace of cleanup, because in many cases, construction of such remedies must be finished before operation can begin to treat or contain waste as a means to prevent exposure. EPA reported that the FY2006 request would have allowed the construction of 40 remedial actions to be completed at Superfund sites in FY2006, lower than the annual average of about 67 over the past five years.", "The most recent estimate of funding needs for the Superfund program was released in 2001 in a study by Resources for the Future (RFF), a private organization.

RFF estimated that between $14 billion and $16 billion in total funding would be necessary from FY2000 through FY2009 to meet cleanup needs, based on the number of NPL sites and severity of contamination at that time. At a minimum, RFF projected that annual expenditures of $1.5 billion would be necessary through FY2006 to maintain an adequate pace of cleanup. Annual appropriations in recent years have been around $1.25 billion, prior to transfers.

Three dedicated taxes (on petroleum, chemical feedstocks, and corporate income) historically provided the majority of funding for the Superfund program. However, these taxes expired at the end of 1995, and the remaining revenues were essentially expended by the end of FY2003. Since then, Congress has funded the program with general Treasury revenues. Some Members advocate reinstating the Superfund taxes, and argue that the use of general Treasury revenues to fund cleanup costs undermines the \"polluter pays\" principle, spreading cleanup costs across all taxpayers.

Of particular interest were concerns about the adequacy of health safety standards for human research subjects and general ethical questions with respect to EPA's use of data from such studies. P.L. 109-54 included provisions directing EPA to complete relevant rulemaking according to specific congressional recommendations and banned the use of FY2006 funds to consider or to conduct human dosing studies in the agency's review of pesticides until a final rule is issued.", "Throughout the debate, there were varying levels of interest in specific funding for other EPA activities as well. The ability to increase funding for projects or add new projects in FY2006 ultimately was affected by competing priorities of Congress to allocate limited funding to numerous federal agencies within the Interior appropriations bill, where EPA's funding now falls. EPA's funding was moved from the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development (VA-HUD), and Independent Agencies to that of the Interior subcommittees beginning with the FY2006 appropriation. This was the result of a reorganization during the first session of 109 th Congress that included the elimination of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations subcommittee."], "subsections": []}]}}
