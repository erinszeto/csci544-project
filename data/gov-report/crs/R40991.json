The use of private security contractors (PSCs) to protect personnel and property in Iraq and Afghanistan has been a subject of debate in the press, in Congress, and in the international community. While PSCs are widely viewed as being vital to U.S. efforts in the region, many Members are concerned about transparency, accountability, and legal and symbolic issues raised by the use of armed civilians to perform security tasks formerly performed by military personnel, as well as the adverse impact PSCs may be having on U.S. counterinsurgency efforts.", "Contractors working for the U.S. military, the State Department, or other government agencies during contingency operation in Iraq and Afghanistan are non-combatants who have no combat immunity under international law if they engage in hostilities, and whose conduct may be attributable to the United States. Contractors who commit crimes in Iraq or Afghanistan are subject to U.S. prosecution under criminal statutes that apply extraterritorially or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or by means of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA). Section 552 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 (P.L. 109-364) makes military contractors supporting the Armed Forces in Iraq subject to court-martial jurisdiction, although the military trial of a civilian contractor would likely be subject to legal challenge on constitutional grounds. Despite congressional efforts to expand court-martial jurisdiction and jurisdiction under MEJA, some contractors may remain outside the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, civil or military, for improper conduct in Iraq or Afghanistan.", "This report discusses the legal framework that applies to PSCs in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Rather than relying on the U.S. Armed Forces to provide protection from insurgents and other risks inherent in such an environment, the State Department, USAID, and, reportedly, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have outsourced a variety of security services. The Department of Defense (DOD) also employs civilian contractors to perform certain security services. The use of private security contractors (PSCs) to provide security for personnel and property in Iraq and Afghanistan has been a subject of debate in the press, in Congress, and in the international community. Due to a spate of high-profile incidents involving contractors allegedly shooting civilians, using excessive force, committing other crimes, or otherwise behaving in a manner that may be offensive to the local population, there is concern that the reliance on contractors may be undermining U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some have questioned whether the legal framework is adequate to cover the activities of armed civilians performing roles that in previous conflicts were assigned to soldiers, or whether such activities could run counter to international law.", "Congress has, over the past decade, enacted legislation to close jurisdictional gaps that have made prosecution of civilian employees difficult for crimes they commit overseas. As a result, there is statutory authority to subject civilian contractor personnel to prosecution in federal and sometimes military court in many cases, largely depending on the type and seriousness of the offense alleged, where the offense occurred, the nationality of the perpetrator or victim, and the nature of the contract employment and government agency (or armed force) affiliation. The bases of jurisdiction, which remain relatively untested by the courts, may not have closed all of the gaps, and in cases they do cover, may affect agency responsibility for investigating and prosecuting the crimes as well as the venue for prosecution. While some contractor personnel have been subject to prosecution in the United States for crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq and Afghanistan, it appears that many more investigations into possible criminal conduct have not resulted in charges, at least not yet.", "The foreign affairs implications of these issues are illustrated by the Iraqi reaction to the 2007 incident at Nisoor Square involving Blackwater Worldwide private security guards on contract with the State Department, who reportedly opened fire in the crowded traffic circle in the belief that they were engaged in a firefight with insurgents. Outrage among the Iraqi population over the incident, which resulted in the deaths of 17 civilians, spurred the Iraqi government to revoke Blackwater's operating license (the company has since changed its name to Xe Services) and to negotiate an end to the immunity from Iraqi legal processes such contractors previously enjoyed. News of the dismissal of the criminal indictments against five contract employees in connection with the incident appears to have further strained U.S.-Iraq relations, with Iraqi officials calling the outcome \"unacceptable\" and vowing to seek redress. The United Nations Working Group on the use of mercenaries released a statement calling on the United States and Iraq \"to cooperate to ensure that the Nissour Square incident is fully remedied and, in relation to the crimes that may have been committed, those responsible fully held accountable as appropriate.\"", "This report discusses the legal framework that applies to contractor personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, including matters peculiar to private security contractors.

Under the authority of international law, contractors and other civilians working with the military are civilian non-combatants whose conduct may be attributable to the United States or may implicate the duty to promote the welfare and security of the local population.

The status of armed contract personnel under humanitarian law falls into a grey area. While civilians accompanying the armed forces in the field are generally entitled to treatment as prisoners of war (POW) if captured by an enemy state during an international armed conflict (a war between two or more states), they are considered civilians (non-combatants) who are not authorized to take a direct part in hostilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Can Contractors Be \"Combatants\"?", "paragraphs": ["A critical question appears to be whether the duties of contractors amount to \"taking an active part in hostilities.\" In an international armed conflict or occupation, only members of regular armed forces and paramilitary groups that come under military command and meet certain criteria (carry their weapons openly, distinguish themselves from civilians, and generally obey the laws of war) qualify as combatants for purposes of treatment in case of capture. Because contract employees fall outside the military chain of command, even those who appear to meet the criteria as combatants could be at risk of losing their right to be treated as POWs if captured by the enemy. Contractors who take a direct part in hostilities may nonetheless be considered combatants for the purposes of distinguishing such persons from civilians, who are protected from direct attack. If the conflict in question is a non-international armed conflict (i.e., an armed conflict where a party is a non-state actor) within the meaning of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (CA3), customary international law would no longer distinguish between \"unlawful\" and \"lawful combatants\" or establish a right to POW status. Contractors captured by enemy forces who had engaged in hostilities would be entitled to the minimum set of standards set forth in CA3, but their right to engage in hostilities in the first place would likely be determined in accordance with the prevailing local law.", "After conducting a series of conferences with legal representatives of various nations and non-governmental institutions, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) produced a report providing \"interpretive guidance\" regarding the definition of \"direct participation in combat.\" Noting that the questions of whether an individual is entitled to POW status and whether an individual is entitled to be protected from direct attack are separate, the report discusses whether contractors should be considered civilians or members of armed forces for the purposes of protection from attack. It concludes that \"all armed actors [in an international armed conflict] showing a sufficient degree of military organization and belonging to a party to the conflict must be regarded as part of the armed forces of that party.\" Such membership would be determined based on whether an individual serves a \"continuous combat function,\" that is, whether the person's role in the organization ordinarily involves direct participation in hostilities. Such a role would involve acts that meet the following criteria:", "a threshold of harm likely to result from the act affecting the adversary's military operations or capacity, or inflicting death, injury or destruction on protected persons or objects; direct causation between the act (or the military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part) and the expected harm; and a belligerent nexus between the act and the hostilities ongoing between the parties to an armed conflict.", "In the case of private contractors on the battlefield, the ICRC advises that such determinations should be made \"with particular care and due consideration for the geographic and organizational closeness\" of such personnel to the armed forces and the hostilities. Under the ICRC view, contractors who are not authorized to act as combatants by a party to the conflict but nevertheless participate directly in hostilities would continue to be considered civilians for the purposes of international humanitarian law, but would lose their protection against direct attack for such time as they do so. Contractors and other civilian employees who have for all practical purposes been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to the conflict by being assigned to perform a \"continuous combat function\" would be considered members of an organized armed force who are not entitled to protection under the principles of distinction. Under this view, private security personnel under contract with the State Department assigned to protect embassy personnel from enemy attacks would likely be considered combatants, as would private security providers assigned to protect military supply convoys from insurgents because their purpose, although defensive in nature, would affect hostilities and could require engagement with enemy forces.", "The Geneva Conventions and other laws of war do not appear to forbid the use of civilian contractors in a civil police role in occupied territory, in which case contractors might be authorized to use force when absolutely necessary to defend persons or property. It may sometimes be difficult, however, to discern whether civilian security guards are performing law-enforcement duties or are engaged in combat. If their activity amounts to combat, they would become lawful targets for enemy forces during the fighting, and, if captured by an enemy government (if one should emerge), could potentially be prosecuted as criminals for their hostile acts. Contract personnel who intentionally kill or injure civilians could be liable for such conduct regardless of their combatant status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Are They \"Mercenaries\"?", "paragraphs": ["Mercenaries are persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict but participate in combat primarily for personal gain. They may be authorized to fight by a party to the conflict, but their allegiance to that party is conditioned on monetary payment rather than obedience and loyalty. For this reason, mercenaries are sometimes treated as \"unlawful combatants\" or \"unprivileged belligerents,\" even though their employment is not strictly prohibited by international law. As discussed above, they may not qualify for POW treatment under the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW), and those meeting the definition of \"mercenary\" under the 1977 Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions are explicitly denied combatant status. Because mercenaries are not entitled to combat immunity, they may be tried, and if found guilty, punished for their hostile actions (including by the death penalty), even if such actions would be lawful under the law of war if committed by a soldier. Soldiers with a nationality other than that of the party on whose side they fight are not automatically considered mercenaries. Article 47 of Protocol I defines a mercenary as follows:", "2. A mercenary is any person who: (a) Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; (d) Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; (e) Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and (f) Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.", "Under this definition, it appears that contractor personnel who are not U.S. nationals, the nationals of other coalition allies or nationals of the host country, and who were hired to\u2014and in fact do\u2014take part in hostilities might be considered to be mercenaries, assuming the definition in Protocol I applies as customary international law in the context of the current hostilities. On the other hand, what constitutes \"direct participation in an armed conflict\" is not fully settled, and some of the other requirements are inherently difficult to prove, particularly the element of motivation. There is no distinction based on the offensive or defensive nature of the participation in combat.", "The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) has taken an interest in the role of mercenaries in armed conflicts and in 1987 appointed a special rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination. The mandate of the special rapporteur was later expanded to cover \"the impact of the activities of private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination.\" A UNCHR working group on the use of mercenaries, established in 2005 to take the place of the special rapporteur, concluded that some private security companies operating in zones of armed conflict are engaging in \"new forms of mercenarism.\" The working group has expressed concern about the role of private security contractors in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and has urged the international community to adopt regulations for their use.", "The working group drafted a new International Convention on the Regulation, Oversight and Monitoring of Private Military and Security Companies. The draft convention emphasizes that states should have an effective monopoly on the use of force, and that states are responsible under international law for their use of force whether on their own territory or beyond, and whether conducted by national armed forces or private armed groups operating under the state's license or contract. It declares that \"[n]o State Party can delegate or outsource fundamental State functions to non-State actors,\" and requires states parties to establish rules regarding the use of force, authorities and responsibilities of state bodies empowered to use coercive and combative measures (including \"special operations\") within the framework of domestic and international law.", "The convention does not attempt to establish a binding regulatory framework itself, but would require states parties to adopt their own contracting and licensing procedures for the use, import, or export of private military and security services, in furtherance of the goals set forth in the convention. States parties would undertake also to prohibit, at least partially, the transfer of the right to use force or to carry out special operations to private actors, and to prohibit private military and security companies from directly participating in armed conflicts, military actions or terrorist acts, especially for the purpose of overthrowing a government, changing international boundaries by force, violating the territorial sovereignty of another state, displacing residents of any territory or controlling its natural resources. Further obligations would include measures to prevent private companies from using or trafficking in weapons of mass destruction or illicit weaponry and components, establish jurisdiction and criminalize violations set forth under the convention and provide redress for victims. Private military and security companies would be prohibited under the convention from arbitrarily or abusively using force, and would be permitted to use force only as a measure of last resort.", "The convention would also create a UN Committee on the Regulation, Oversight and Monitoring of Private Military and Security Companies, to be composed of up to fourteen experts nominated by states parties. States would submit periodic reports on the legislative, judicial, administrative or other measures they have taken to implement the Convention, to which the Committee would add its observations or request additional information. The Committee would provide interpretive guidance on international law applicable to the provision of private military and security services and make confidential inquiries into incidents if warranted. States parties would be able to refer complaints about the compliance of other states parties to the Committee for review. In such a case, the Committee would appoint a five-person ad hoc Conciliation Commission to help the parties reach an amicable resolution. Parties could also authorize private victims or victims' groups to bring petitions to the Committee.

The Document does not take a position on whether such companies and their personnel are \"armed forces\" or \"combatants,\" but states that such status determinations are made under humanitarian law on the basis of \"the nature and circumstances of the functions in which they are involved.\" It also posits that the superiors of private security personnel, whether military or contractor, may be liable for crimes under international law committed by personnel under their effective authority and control, but that such superior responsibility \"is not engaged solely by virtue of a contract.\"", "Part II of the Montreux Document provides detailed lists of \"good practices\" recommended for adoption by contracting states, territorial states, and home states, as well as by the companies themselves. Contracting states are urged to evaluate whether their legislation and procurement regulations are adequate to ensure accountability, particularly if the companies are to be employed in an area where law enforcement or regulatory capacities are compromised. In particular, contracting states are advised to provide for criminal and civil jurisdiction over the activities of private military and security companies and their personnel abroad, and to cooperate with the territorial state in conducting any investigation that may become necessary.", "In a nutshell, contracting states should:", "Determine which services may or may not be contracted out to private military and security companies (PMSC), taking into account factors such as the likelihood of PMSC personnel becoming involved in direct participation in hostilities. Assess the capacity of the particular PMSC to carry out its activities in conformity with relevant law, perhaps by considering the company's work history, employer references, ownership structure, and results of employees' background checks. Provide adequate resources and expertise for selecting and overseeing PMSCs. Consider terms of contracts necessary to ensure compliance with legal responsibilities and accountability. Ensure transparency and supervision in the selection and contracting of PMSCs through legislative oversight and public disclosure of PMSC contracting regulations and practices, information about specific contracts, and incident reports or complaints involving such contractors, including measures taken to address any proven misconduct.", "Territorial states are likewise advised to evaluate their domestic legal framework applicable to the conduct of PMSCs. The authors acknowledge that territorial states in armed conflict face particular challenges and consider it may be appropriate for them to rely on information provided by the contracting state concerning a particular PMSC. Nevertheless, the territorial state is advised to enact licensing requirements to be enforced by an adequately resourced central authority. The territorial state is counseled to establish requirements regarding the carrying and use of weapons and reporting of incidents, among other regulations.", "Home states, in evaluating their domestic legal frameworks, are advised to consider licensing or regulatory regimes to control and monitor exports of security services that do not unnecessarily duplicate the regimes of contracting or territorial states, and to focus instead on areas of specific concern for them. The Document recognizes the PMSCs as are not per se bound to respect international law, which is binding only on parties to a conflict and individuals, not corporate entities.

Such contractors are considered civilians accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces during contingency operations and are not authorized to use deadly force against enemy armed forces other than in self-defense. However, in June, 2006, DOD published a rule amending the DFARS to create an exception for private security contractors, who are authorized to use deadly force \"only when necessary to execute their security mission to protect assets/persons, consistent with the mission statement contained in their contract.\" The rule explained that", "it is the responsibility of the combatant commander to ensure that the private security contract mission statements do not authorize the performance of any inherently Governmental military functions, such as preemptive attacks, or any other types of attacks.

A contractor protested the terms of a pair of solicitations for contracts involving cargo transportation in Iraq on the basis that they included requirements for armed security escorts. The prospective bidder challenged the security requirements as running afoul of the Anti-Pinkerton Act as well as relevant DOD instructions regarding contractors accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces overseas. Specifically, the protestor contended that the statements of work (SOW) required performance of security services that would constitute the provision of \"quasi-military armed forces for hire\" and require civilian contractors to engage in combat. The Comptroller General denied the protest, relying on an earlier interpretation that \"a company which provides guard or protective services does not thereby become a 'quasi-military armed force,' even if the individual guards are armed....\" With respect to the charge that the work involved the \"uniquely governmental\" function of engaging in combat, the decision noted DOD regulations and DFARS provisions that would permit the contracting of armed security services but prohibit such contractors from engaging in direct combat or offensive operations. It appears that neither the Department of Defense nor the Government Accountability Office (GAO) regards the government use of armed security escorts in Iraq as violating any restrictions on government contracting.

In section 861 of the 2008 NDAA, P.L. 110-181 ,Congress required the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding matters relating to contracts in Iraq or Afghanistan, including delineating responsibility for investigating and referring possible violations of the UCMJ or MEJA. Section 854 of the FY2009 NDAA, P.L. 110-417 , expands the MOU requirements to include reporting requirements for contractors of allegations of offenses in violation of the UCMJ or MEJA committed by or against contractor personnel, a delineation of responsibility for victim and witness protection and other assistance to contractor personnel in connection with such crimes, and provisions for ensuring contractor personnel are aware of their responsibility to report such crimes and where to turn to for assistance.

The appellate court disagreed and upheld the conviction. The court did not adopt the interpretation used by the district court and urged by the government, which would have included any land or building where a military mission takes place (interpreting \"mission\" to mean \"a team of military specialists\"). Instead, the court found that a \"mission\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07(9) refers to a place possessing sufficient qualities of a permanent base, and suggested some relevant factors, including", "the size of a given military mission's premises, the length of United States control over those premises, the substantiality of its improvements, actual use of the premises, the occupation of the premises by a significant number of United States personnel, and the host nation's consent (whether formal or informal) to the presence of the United States.", "Applying these factors, the court concluded the firebase qualified as a military installation and that Congress had intended to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to assaults committed there.

Although federal jurisdiction is established for these crimes when they are committed by or against U.S. nationals or U.S. servicemembers, the statute does not appear to cover foreign nationals who commit war crimes in connection with U.S. contingency operations overseas, even if they are employed by the U.S. government or U.S. government contractors.", "Other criminal proscriptions with extraterritorial reach include assaulting, killing or kidnapping an internationally protected person, or threatening to do so.

There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over murder where both the perpetrator and victim are U.S. nationals, but prosecution requires that the Attorney General or his designee give approval, which requires that the foreign country where the murder took place has not prosecuted the suspect for the same conduct and that the suspect is no longer present in that country and the country lacks the ability to lawfully secure the person's return.", "Extraterritorial jurisdiction may be found to be implied in statute, especially where the statute's main purpose is to protect federal officers, employees and property, or to prevent the obstruction or corruption of the overseas activities of federal departments and agencies. Some statutes apply to conduct where foreign commerce is affected, although that jurisdictional basis alone may be insufficient to demonstrate that Congress meant to reach conduct overseas.

Since that time, three contractors employed by Special Operations Consulting Security Management Group, Inc., were indicted for allegedly kidnapping a foreign national at gunpoint while working at Camp Al-Asad Air Base, Iraq. In December, 2008, in the first case implementing the MEJA amendment to permit prosecution of non-DOD contractors, five Blackwater Worldwide employees under contract with the State Department were charged with manslaughter in connection with the 2007 incident at Nisoor Square in Baghdad, while a sixth pleaded guilty. The defendants sought a dismissal of charges, arguing that MEJA doesn't apply to them as contractors working for the State Department in support of its mission. The judge declined to dismiss the prosecution on that basis, but indicated that he would consider evidence at trial related to how the contractors' employment supported the Department of Defense's mission overseas. Before the case reached trial stage, however, the judge dismissed all of the indictments because the prosecution had built its case on compelled statements that are entitled to immunity under the Fifth Amendment.", "A few successful prosecutions involving DOD contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan under MEJA have been reported.

Another contractor employee was prosecuted for abusive sexual contact involving a female soldier that occurred at Talil Air Force Base, Iraq, in 2004. A contractor employee was indicted for assaulting another contractor with a knife in 2007. A contractor employee pleaded guilty to manslaughter for the shooting of an Afghan civilian detainee who had set fire to another U.S. employee.

Additionally, if offenses by contractor personnel can be characterized as violations of the law of war, the UCMJ may extend jurisdiction to try suspects by court-martial or by military commission.", "Prior to the FY2007 NDAA, the UCMJ covered civilians serving with the Armed Forces in the field only in \"time of war.\" As a reflection of the constitutional issues that arise whenever civilians are tried in military tribunals, as reaffirmed by a series of Supreme Court cases beginning in 1957 with Reid v. Covert , courts interpreted the phrase \"in time of war\" to mean only wars declared by Congress. In Covert , a plurality of the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that Congress's power to regulate the land and naval forces justifies the trial of civilians without according the full panoply of due process standards guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court has also found that former servicemembers who have severed all ties to the military cannot be tried by court-martial for crimes they committed while on active duty.", "The trial of any civilian contractor by court-martial would likely be subject to challenge on constitutional grounds. Congress's authority to \"make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" empowers it to prescribe rules for courts-martial that vary from civilian trials and are not restricted by all of the constitutional requirements applicable to Article III courts. In addition to the express exception in the Fifth Amendment regarding the right to presentment and indictment in \"cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger,\" the Supreme Court has found implicit exceptions to other fundamental rights as they pertain to servicemembers. Statutes relating to courts-martial have withstood objections based on due process. While the UCMJ offers soldiers procedural protections similar to and sometimes arguably superior to those in civilian courts, courts have been reluctant to extend military jurisdiction to civilians.", "On the other hand, the Covert Court distinguished the peacetime courts-martial of civilian spouses at issue from Madsen v. Kinsella , in which a military spouse was tried by military commission in occupied Europe, on the basis that", "[that case] concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces. In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with Army or not.", "If Madsen remains valid, if and for so long as the United States is considered an \"occupying power\" in non-U.S. territory overseas, it may be acceptable under the Constitution to subject DOD contractors there to military jurisdiction.", "Further, the Covert plurality held open the possibility that civilians who were part of the armed services could be tried by court-martial during wartime. While the Court has suggested in dicta that courts-martial are never proper for the trial of civilians, it has never expressly stated that the Constitution forbids military jurisdiction over civilians who might properly be said to be \"in\" the Armed Forces during war. Lower courts addressed the issue during World War II, and upheld courts-martial of civilian employees of the U.S. Army in Eritrea. Merchant seamen were sometimes tried by court-martial by the Navy. One such conviction was overturned by a federal court on habeas corpus review because the offense charged, striking a superior officer, was essentially a military charge. However, another court upheld the conviction of a merchant seaman for the military charge of desertion.", "Assuming the Constitution permits the trial of civilians accompanying the Armed Forces in wartime, a particular case will also have to satisfy the statutory requirements of the UCMJ. To determine whether a civilian contractor who is suspected of having committed an offense is subject to prosecution under the UCMJ, it will be necessary to determine whether he is \"serving with or accompanying an armed force\" that is operating \"in the field.\" The phrase \"serving with or accompanying\" the forces was historically construed to require that the civilian's \"presence [must be] not merely incidental to, but directly connected with or dependent upon, the activities of the armed forces or their personnel.\" Courts have found that military jurisdiction over a civilian \"cannot be claimed merely on the basis of convenience, necessity, or the non-availability of civil courts.\"", "The phrase \"in the field\" means serving \"in an area of actual fighting\" at or near the \"battlefront\" where \"actual hostilities are under way.\" Whether an armed force is \"in the field\" is \"determined by the activity in which it may be engaged at any particular time, not the locality where it is found.\" Therefore, it appears that contractors will not be subject to military jurisdiction merely because of their employment in Iraq or Afghanistan. They might, however, be subject to jurisdiction even if the conduct occurs outside of those countries, so long as it occurs away from a permanent garrison and there is sufficient connection to military operations ongoing in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere.", "Other likely issues include whether civilian contractors may be prosecuted for military crimes, such as disrespect of an officer or failure to obey a lawful command, or whether non-judicial punishment will be available to discipline contract employees. Some of the standard punishments courts-martials ordinarily adjudge would not be available in the case of civilians, such as a dishonorable discharge or reduction in rank, and possibly forfeiture of pay. Appellate review over civilian cases may be effectively restricted by these sentencing considerations. For example, the government may appeal an adverse ruling (not amounting to a finding of not guilty) on an interlocutory basis only in cases in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, and defendants are entitled to appeal only if the sentence \"extends to death, dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for one year or more.\" Appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces is limited, which in turn limits access to the Supreme Court. On the other hand, there does not appear to be a means of compelling continued employment in order for a civilian to undergo court-martial proceedings; if misconduct by a contract employee results in his or her immediate dismissal by the contractor, military jurisdiction may also cease.", "DOD issued guidance in March 2008 for implementing the law. Secretary Gates, citing \"a particular need for clarity regarding the legal framework that should govern a command response to any illegal activities by Department of Defense civilian employees and DOD contractor personnel overseas with our Armed Forces,\" instructed the Secretaries of the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the commanders of the regional combatant commands that the exercise of jurisdiction over civilians must be based on military necessity and supported by circumstances that meet the interests of justice. Such circumstances include those where U.S. federal criminal jurisdiction does not otherwise apply or is not being pursued, or where the conduct in question is adverse to a significant military interest of the United States. For conduct that occurs within the United States, or in cases where the offender was not at all pertinent times outside the United States, the Secretary of Defense is the sole authority for convening a court-martial or initiating non-judicial punishment.", "For covered civilians outside the United States, commanders of geographic combatant commands may initiate disciplinary proceedings or delegate such authority to subordinate commanders who possess general court-martial convening authority. These convening authorities are required, prior to initiating court-martial or non-judicial proceedings, to follow the notification procedures outlined in DOD Instruction 5525.11 (MEJA implementation) to give the Department of Justice the opportunity to take action. The memorandum gives the Justice Department fourteen calendar days (or longer, if DOJ determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant more time to complete its determination) to advise DOD as to whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction. If the period of review passes without an indication that DOJ intends to exercise jurisdiction, DOD may notify DOJ that it intends to authorize the appropriate commander to initiate disciplinary action at his or her command discretion. If DOJ elects to exercise jurisdiction, the commanders are not authorized to initiate disciplinary action, unless U.S. federal criminal jurisdiction of the case is later terminated. Military commanders are authorized to investigate and exercise other law enforcement authorities with respect to violations by civilians while DOJ makes its determination in order to be prepared to take appropriate action if DOJ declines jurisdiction."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["According to many analysts and policymakers, private security contractors, by providing security for reconstruction and stabilization efforts, contribute an essential service to U.S. and international efforts to bring peace to Iraq and Afghanistan.
