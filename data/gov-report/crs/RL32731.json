The Navy had proposed retiring the Kennedy and reducing the size of the carrier force from 12 ships to 11 as part of its proposed FY2006 and FY2007 budgets. Until mid-2005, the Kennedy was homeported in Mayport, FL. Prior to the proposal to retire the Kennedy, the Navy's plan was to maintain a 12-carrier force and keep the Kennedy in operation until 2018. The issue for the 109th Congress was whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposal in the FY2006 and FY2007 budget submissions to retire the Kennedy and reduce the carrier force to 11 ships.", "In acting on the proposed FY2006 defense budget, the 109th Congress passed a provision that amended 10 U.S.C. 5062 to require the Navy to maintain a force of not less than 12 operational carriers.

Specifically, Section 1011 prevented the Navy from retiring the Kennedy until it certified to Congress that it had received formal notices from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and NATO that these organizations did not desire to maintain and operate the ship. The provision requires, upon retirement of the ship, that while the ship is in the Navy's custody and control, the Navy maintain the ship in a condition that would allow for it to be reactivated in response to a national emergency. The provision requires, as a condition for transferring custody and control of the ship to another party, that the transferee return the ship to the Navy upon request of the Secretary of Defense in time of national emergency. The provision does not appear to require the transferee, while it has custody and control of the ship, to maintain the ship in a condition that would allow for it to be reactivated by the Navy in response to a national emergency.", "In light of Section 1011 and the Kennedy's retirement, one potential issue for the 110th Congress concerns the Navy's future plans for the home port facility at Mayport. One potential option would be to qualify Mayport for homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier\u2014a process that could take a few years\u2014and then transfer one of the Navy's nuclear-powered carriers there. Another potential option would be to transfer one or more conventionally powered non-carrier ships, rather than a nuclear-powered carrier, to Mayport\u2014a step that could be taken in the near term. A third potential option would combine the previous two by homeporting one or more additional conventionally powered ships at Mayport until Mayport is qualified for homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier and a nuclear-powered carrier takes their place.", "This report will no longer be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The conventionally powered aircraft carrier John F.

Table 1 shows the year-by-year funding changes for FY2006-FY2011 of retiring the Kennedy in FY2006, as estimated in PBD 753 . As shown in the table, retiring the Kennedy was estimated to produce a steady-state savings of roughly $300 million per year starting in FY2008, including roughly $200 million per year for crew pay and allowances, and roughly $100 million per year in ship operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.", "In February 2006, the Navy estimated that overhauling the Kennedy and keeping it in service during the five-year period FY2007-FY2011 would cost more than $2 billion.", "The Kennedy was originally scheduled for a $350-million overhaul that was to begin at its home port of Mayport, FL, on May 2, 2005, shift to the government-operated Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Norfolk, VA, on June 17, 2005, and be finished there on August 18, 2006. In light of the proposal to retire the Kennedy, the Navy said it wanted to use the $350 million to finance other Navy needs. On April 1, 2005, the Navy announced that it had canceled the overhaul.", "Navy officials said in early 2005 that following its retirement, the Kennedy would be placed in preservation (\"mothball\") status to preserve the option of reactivating it at some point. The ship might be reactivated, they said, if a conventionally powered carrier were needed to succeed the conventionally powered Kitty Hawk (CV-63) as the carrier that is forward-homeported in Japan (see section below on carrier home ports). On October 27, 2005, however, the Navy announced that it intends to use one of its Nimitz (CVN-68) class nuclear-powered carriers to replace the Kitty Hawk as the Japan-homeported carrier when the Kitty Hawk retires in 2008. A Navy spokesman said the decision to replace the Kitty Hawk with a nuclear-powered carrier was a mutual agreement between the United States and Japan. In November 2005, it was reported that the Navy had selected the George Washington (CVN-73) as the carrier to replace the Kitty Hawk in Japan in 2008. The Navy publicly confirmed this on December 2, 2005.", "In February 2006, the Navy announced that it had restricted the Kennedy from conducting flight operations with fixed-wing aircraft due to newly discovered corrosion problems with the ship's arresting gear mounts.

In 1991, the ship completed an extensive service life extension program (SLEP) overhaul that was intended to extend its service life from about 30 years to about 45 years. The ship is scheduled to be retired in 2008, at age 47. The carrier force is to be maintained at 11 ships by the commissioning in 2008 of the George H. W. Bush (CVN-77), which was procured in FY2001. CVN-73 is to be transferred to Japan in 2008 to succeed the Kitty Hawk as the Japan-homeported carrier.", "The Enterprise , the Navy's next-oldest carrier, entered service in November 1961, seven months after the Kitty Hawk. In 1994, the ship completed a nuclear refueling complex overhaul (RCOH) that was intended to extend its service life by about 20 years, to 2013. The ship is scheduled to be replaced in 2015 by CVN-78, a new carrier that the Navy plans to procure in FY2008. Unlike the Navy's newer Nimitz-class carriers, each of which is powered by two nuclear reactors, the Enterprise is powered by eight nuclear reactors, making the Enterprise's reactor plant more complex and expensive to maintain, at least in the view of some observers, than the reactor plants of the Nimitz-class ships.", "The Kennedy , the Navy's third-oldest carrier, entered service in 1968. Unlike the Kitty Hawk, which was given an extensive SLEP overhaul, the Kennedy was given a less extensive (but still fairly substantial) complex overhaul (COH) that was completed in 1995. Prior to the proposal to retire the Kennedy in FY2006, the Kennedy was scheduled to retire in 2018, at age 50, and be replaced in 2019 by CVN-79, an aircraft carrier that the Navy wants to procure in FY2012.

Past shorthand descriptions of the Navy were often been based on the number of carriers in the fleet. The 600-ship Navy planned by Reagan administration in the 1980s, for example, was often referred to as a 15-carrier Navy. Observers have noted over the years that when a crisis occurs overseas, one of the first questions asked by U.S. leaders has often been, \"Where are the carriers?\"", "Carrier-based aircraft are capable of performing various missions. Since the end of the Cold War, Navy carriers and their air wings have spent much of their time enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq and conducting land-attack operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Carriers and their air wings are considered particularly useful in situations where U.S. access to overseas air bases is absent or restricted\u2014a circumstance that some observers believe has become more likely since the end of the Cold War. Carriers can also be used for other purposes. In 1994, a carrier was used to transport a helicopter-borne Army unit to the vicinity of Haiti, and in 2001-2002, a carrier was used to embark helicopter-borne special operations forces that were used in Afghanistan. Carriers have also been used in disaster-relief operations, such as the one for assisting countries affected by the December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Given their ability to embark different combinations of aircraft, carriers are considered to be highly flexible naval platforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Home Ports", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 2006, the Navy's 6 Pacific Fleet carriers were homeported at San Diego, CA (2 ships), Bremerton, WA (1 ship), Everett, WA (1 ship), Yokosuka, Japan (1 ship), and Newport News, VA (1 ship). The ship homeported at Newport News, the Vinson, is there for a refueling complex overhaul. The Navy's 6 Atlantic Fleet carriers were homeported at Norfolk, VA (6 ships, including the Kennedy). Until mid-2005, the Kennedy was homeported at Mayport, FL.", "The final report on the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), submitted to Congress in February 2006, directed the Navy to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable carriers (and also 60% of its submarines) in the Pacific to support engagement, presence, and deterrence. Following completion of its RCOH, the Carl Vinson is to be homeported at one of four Pacific-fleet home ports: Bremerton, WA, San Diego, CA, Pearl Harbor, HI, or Guam. The Navy reportedly plans to select the ship's home port in April or May of 2007. Some informed observers reportedly think the Navy may be less inclined to select Pearl Harbor, and more inclined to select Bremerton, because Bremerton could accommodate the ship with less need for construction or renovation of facilities.", "The Kennedy, whose crew numbered about 2,900, contributed, by one estimate, about $250 million each year to the local Mayport economy.", "As of September 30, 2006, Mayport was the home port for 18 Navy ships\u2014four cruisers, three destroyers, and 11 frigates. Mayport currently is not qualified to serve as the home port for a nuclear-powered carrier, but some studies on what it would take to qualify Mayport as a nuclear-carrier home port have been undertaken in recent years. Mayport is near the naval air station at Jacksonville, FL, where some of the Navy's aircraft are based, and to the naval aviation depot at Jacksonville, which repairs some of the Navy's planes.", "The Navy has forward-homeported a carrier at Yokosuka (pronounced yo-KOS-ka) since the early 1970s. The forward homeporting of a carrier in Japan reduces considerably the total number of carriers needed in the force to maintain day-to-day deployments of carriers in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. The Kitty Hawk is the third Navy carrier to be homeported there. All three have been conventionally powered. (The other two have since been retired.) In light of anti-nuclear sentiments in Japan that date back to the U.S. use of two nuclear weapons against Japan in World War II, some observers believed that a Navy proposal to homeport one of its nuclear-powered carriers there could meet with public opposition. Other observers, however, believe that Japanese views on the issue have begun to change in a way that would reduce public opposition. The Navy's announcement that a nuclear-powered carrier would succeed the Kitty Hawk as the next Japan-homeported carrier generated some concern and opposition in Japan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for 109th Congress", "paragraphs": ["DOD's proposal in FY2006 and FY2007 to retire the Kennedy and reduce the carrier force to 11 ships raised potential issues for the 109 th Congress concerning the appropriate size of the carrier force, the Navy's selection of the Kennedy as the carrier to retire, and carrier homeporting arrangements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Size of Carrier Force", "paragraphs": ["The appropriate size of the carrier force is a frequent, even classic, topic of debate in military force-structure planning. Over the years, as strategic, technological, and budgetary circumstances have evolved, some observers have argued in favor of a force of 12 or more carriers, while others have argued for a force of 11 or fewer carriers.", "Supporters of maintaining a force of 12 or more carriers could argue the following:", "During the past half century, carrier force has never dropped below 12 ships, illustrating the enduring need for a force of at least that many ships. After experimenting with an \"11+1\" carrier force in FY1995-FY2000 (11 fully active carriers plus one operational/reserve training carrier), DOD returned to a force of 12 fully active carriers, suggesting that DOD was dissatisfied with a force of less than 12 fully active carriers. If the carrier force were reduced in to 11 ships in 2007, as the Navy proposes, then the Navy projects that it will fall further, to 10 ships, in 2013, when the Enterprise retires, and not get back to 11 ships until 2015, when CVN-78 enters service. Even if an 11-carrier force would be operationally acceptable, a 10-carrier force would not be. To avoid dropping to a 10-carrier force during this period, the Navy needs to maintain a 12-carrier force through at least 2013. The Navy further projects that the size of the carrier force will increase from 11 ships to 12 ships in 2019, when CVN-79 enters service, and be maintained at 12 ships through at least 2036. This suggests strongly that Navy actually prefers a carrier force of 12 ships, not 11. Since the end of the Cold War, carriers have been kept very busy and have proven their value in numerous operations. In an era of uncertain U.S. access to overseas air bases, the value of carriers as sovereign U.S. bases that can operate in international waters, free from political constraints, is particularly significant. The increasing number of targets that can be attacked each day by a carrier air wing is making carriers even more cost effective as U.S. military platforms, which argues in favor of retaining them in the U.S. force structure, not retiring them.", "Supporters of reducing the carrier force to 11 or fewer carriers starting in FY2006 could argue the following:", "Due to changes over time in factors such as carrier missions, the technologies that are available to carriers and their air wings for performing missions, and policies for basing and deploying carriers, historical figures for carrier force size are not a precise guide to whether a future carrier force size would be adequate for performing its required missions. The increasing number of targets that can be attacked each day by a carrier air wing will make it possible to conduct future contingency operations with fewer carriers than were required in the past, reducing the number of carriers needed for warfighting purposes. The Navy's recently implemented Fleet Response Plan (FRP) has increased the Navy's ability to surge carriers to respond to overseas contingencies, which likewise reduces the number of carriers needed for warfighting purposes. The Navy's ability to base tactical aircraft at sea will be augmented in future years by the Navy's planned LHA(R)-class amphibious assault ships, which can be viewed as medium-sized aircraft carriers. The first LHA(R) is to be procured in FY2007. Keeping the carrier force at 12 ships rather than reducing it to 11 would add to Navy funding requirements and thereby require offsetting reductions to other DOD programs, such as Navy, Air Force, or Army procurement programs, or other elements of DOD force structure. Those offsetting reductions could pose greater operational risks than reducing the carrier force to 11 ships. The Navy can manage the projected reduction to a 10-carrier force in 2013 and 2014 by scheduling maintenance and taking other actions so as to maximize the operational availability of the 10 carriers it will have during this period.", "At hearings on the proposed FY2006 defense budget, DOD and Navy officials argued that an 11-carrier force is acceptable in light of the increasing capabilities of carrier air wings, the increased deployability of Navy carriers under the FRP, the aviation capabilities of the Navy's planned LHA(R) ships, and operational risks of cutting other DOD programs to pay for keeping the carrier force at 12 ships. The Navy testified that with a 12-carrier force, the Navy, under the FRP, could surge six carriers within 30 days and another two carriers within 60 days after that\u2014a capability referred to as \"6+2.\" With an 11-carrier force, the Navy testified, that would change to either 6+1 or 5+2. The Navy's FY2007 budget states that an 11-carrier force can support 6+1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier to Be Retired", "paragraphs": ["If a carrier was to be retired in the near term so as to reduce the carrier force to 11 ships, a second potential issue for the 109 th Congress was whether that carrier should be the Kennedy or another ship. Potential alternatives to the Kennedy included the Kitty Hawk, the Enterprise, and the Vinson.", "Supporters of retiring the Kennedy rather than the Kitty Hawk, Enterprise, or Vinson could argue the following:", "The Kennedy did not receive a full service life extension program (SLEP) overhaul at about age 30, so keeping it in service in coming years could become increasingly difficult and expensive. The Kitty Hawk, in contrast, received a full SLEP overhaul at about age 30, giving it a firmer engineering foundation for being operated to about age 45. As mentioned in the Background section, the Navy in February 2006 announced that it had restricted the Kennedy from conducting flight operations with fixed-wing aircraft due to newly discovered corrosion problems with the ship's arresting gear mounts. The Navy also stated that two of the ship's four aircraft catapults are operating under waivers that are scheduled to expire in June, and that four of its eight boilers are operating under waivers that are scheduled to expire in September and cannot be renewed. Retiring the Kitty Hawk and shifting the Kennedy to Japan to replace the Kitty Hawk there would mean, at least for some time, that all the Atlantic Fleet carriers would be based in a single area (the Norfolk-Newport News, VA, area), which might not be prudent in light of the potential ability of terrorists to make a catastrophic one-time attack on a U.S. home port somewhere. Shifting a nuclear-powered carrier to Japan to replace the Kitty Hawk there would take time and money, given the need to qualify Yokosuka as a nuclear-carrier home port. The conventionally powered Kennedy is less capable than the nuclear-powered Enterprise and Vinson. The Navy invested more than $2 billion for the Enterprise RCOH; retiring the Enterprise in the near term rather than in 2014 would not realize a full return on this investment. Retiring the Vinson and not performing the RCOH now scheduled for the ship would significantly reduce the work load at Northrop Grumman's Newport News (NGNN) shipyard, the yard that would perform the work, which would increase the cost of other work being done at the yard (including construction of new carriers and construction of new attack submarines) due to reduced spreading of fixed costs and other factors at NGNN. Increases in costs for other work being done at NGNN would offset, perhaps significantly, the savings associated with avoiding the Vinson RCOH and the Vinson's annual personnel, operation, and maintenance costs.", "Supporters of retiring the Kitty Hawk, Enterprise, or Vinson rather than the Kennedy could argue the following:", "The Kitty Hawk is generally no more capable than the Kennedy, and is about 6\u00bd years older than the Kennedy. Since the Kitty Hawk is currently scheduled to be retired in 2008, about four years from now, retiring it in the near term would not represent much of a change from current life-cycle plans for the ship. The Kennedy, in contrast, had been scheduled to remain in service until 2018, 14 years from now, so retiring it in FY2006 would involve a significant change from current life-cycle plans for the ship. The Kennedy's current maintenance issues, including those relating to its arresting gear mounts, catapults, and boilers, can be addressed in an overhaul. The Kennedy could be shifted to Yokosuka to replace the Kitty Hawk there. The first carrier homeported at Yokosuka, the Midway (CV-41), did not receive a full SLEP overhaul, but careful maintenance on the ship during its stay at Yokosuka permitted it to remain in operation to age 46. In the meantime, Mayport, FL could be qualified as quickly as feasible as a nuclear-carrier home port. A nuclear-powered carrier could then be transferred there so as to once again divide Navy's Atlantic Fleet carriers between two ports rather than concentrating them at a single home port. Since the Kitty Hawk is currently scheduled to be retired in 2008, retiring the Kitty Hawk in the near term might only accelerate a plan that the Navy may already have for taking these actions. Compared to the two-reactor propulsion plants on the Navy's Nimitz-class carriers, the eight-reactor propulsion plant on the Enterprise can be more difficult and expensive to maintain. Although the Enterprise was given an RCOH with the intention of keeping it in service until 2014, retiring it in the near term would give the Navy an all-Nimitz-class nuclear-carrier fleet, streamlining nuclear-carrier logistics and reducing nuclear-carrier support costs. Retiring the Vinson in the near term would avoid a $2.27-billion cost in FY2006 and FY2007 to complete funding for the Vinson's RCOH. It would also eliminate the annual personnel, operation, and maintenance costs for the Vinson, which might be comparable to, or even greater than, those of the Kennedy. Equipment purchased with the $861.5 million in FY2005 and prior-year funding for the Vinson RCOH could be used, where possible, for the RCOH on the next Nimitz-class ship.", "At hearings on the proposed FY2006 defense budget, DOD and Navy officials noted that the Kennedy has not been fully modernized and argued that the additional warfighting capability provided by the Kennedy is marginal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Homeporting Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["A third potential issue for the 109 th Congress raised by the proposal to retire the Kennedy concerned carrier homeporting arrangements.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees by March 1, 2007, that examines options for maintaining the USS John F.

In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services in March 2006, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) emphasized that the decision by the QDR followed a rigorous evaluation of future force structure requirements by the Navy, and that 11 aircraft carriers are sufficient to ensure the Navy's ability to provide coverage in any foreseeable contingency with persistent combat power. The committee is further aware that advances in ship systems, aircraft, and precision weapons, coupled with fundamental changes to fleet maintenance and deployment practices implemented by the Navy, have provided today's aircraft carrier and associated air wings substantially greater strike capability and greater force availability than possessed by the fleet during previous quadrennial defense reviews.", "The Navy has reported on revisions to its method and frequency of deployments for vessels. Under the new concept, referred to as the ''Fleet Response Plan,'' the Navy has reduced forward presence requirements in order to increase surge capability in response to national security demands. Under this approach, with 12 aircraft carriers in the fleet, the Navy proposed to have six carrier strike groups available for a crisis response within 30 days and two more carrier strike groups available in 90 days, referred to as \"6 plus 2.\" At a force structure of 11 aircraft carriers, this becomes \"6 plus 1\" or \"5 plus 2,\" which the Navy determined supports the National Military Strategy with acceptable risk.", "In certain cases, the success of the Fleet Response Plan relies on the timeliness of the decision to surge-deploy the naval forces, and with smaller force levels and reduced forward presence, the Fleet Response Plan approach may increase risk if we do not have the level of insight into the threat necessary for timely action. Further, the Navy's long-term plan for aircraft carrier force structure declines to 10 carriers in 2013, when the USS Enterprise is scheduled to retire. That carrier would be replaced by CVN-21 in 2015, which has yet to start construction. The Navy believes that they can manage this gap through a number of added measures, but if there are any delays in delivering CVN-21, this gap will increase.", "The committee maintains its concern, expressed in the Senate report accompanying S. 1042 ( S.Rept. 109-69 ) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, regarding the declining size of the naval force and the reduction to the number of aircraft carriers. The committee agrees, however, with the Navy's determination that it is not feasible to maintain 12 operational aircraft carriers by restoring the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) to a deployable, fully mission-capable platform. The committee believes that it is vital to the national security of the United States that a fleet of at least 11 aircraft carriers be maintained to support the National Military Strategy, and has taken extraordinary action to support the CNO's force structure plan by authorizing increased procurement for shipbuilding and, specific to aircraft carriers, by authorizing additional advance procurement and incremental funding for the construction of the first 3 CVN-21 class aircraft carriers.", "Further, recognizing the increased need for timeliness of surge operations that today's smaller force structure places on the Fleet Response Plan, the committee reaffirms the judgment that the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Clark, provided in testimony before the Committee on Armed Services in February 2005, that the Atlantic Fleet should continue to be dispersed in two homeports.
