{"id": "R42864", "title": "Rising Economic Powers and U.S. Trade Policy", "released_date": "2012-12-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["A handful of developing countries are becoming major players in the global economy due, in part, to their large populations, rising trade flows, and rapidly growing economies. These evolving economies are likely to be of increasing interest to the 113th Congress. Led by China, these rising economic powers (REPs) include Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. Based on purchasing power parity estimates, China, India, Brazil, and Russia are now among the 10 largest economies in the world and Mexico (#11), Indonesia (#15), and Turkey (#16) are not far behind. With large economies and rising shares of world trade flows, the REPs have greater involvement in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations and dispute settlement cases, have protested with greater frequency U.S. economic and trade policies, and are more able and willing to deflect or reject U.S. trade and market access demands.", "Although they have made great economic strides, any of these REPs could stumble if they do not take steps to improve their business climates by undertaking a range of trade, regulatory, and structural reforms. At the same time, other large developing countries that have enormous economic potential, such as Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, and Vietnam, could rise if they successfully address underlying political and economic challenges.", "U.S. exports to the REPs and other developing countries have become an increasingly important source of growth for the U.S. economy. If the United States is to maximize its export potential and boost its living standards, U.S. exporters and investors may need to have better access to the REP markets. Trade and investment barriers remain considerably higher in most of the REPs than in the United States and other advanced countries. Efforts have stalled in these countries to reduce their barriers further, and several REPs have reactivated industrial policies or found ways to take advantage of gaps in the world trade rules to promote home companies at the expense of foreign companies.", "The United States' ability to persuade these emerging economic powers to embrace the principles of free and fair trade is constrained by growing differences over the role of the state in economic activity. The more interventionist practices and philosophies of REP governments coincide with a desire to maintain \"policy space\" to promote development of their economies via policies that often appear to violate the letter or spirit of WTO rules and obligations. Persuading the REPs that a strengthened multilateral trading system is squarely in their national economic interests and a way to move their domestic economic reforms forward remains a challenge.", "As global power and prosperity is reconfigured, U.S. trade policymakers face a number of overlapping and complex issues relating to the role of future trade liberalizing negotiations, U.S. leverage in influencing REP economic reforms, and the management of the global trading system. Given the checkered history of the Doha Round, future progress on trade liberalization within the WTO may require new approaches. Principles that have guided multilateral trade negotiations in the past, such as unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) and special and differential treatment (S&D), may need to be reexamined. Similarly, if the United States wishes to negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with large and more significant trading partners, it may need to consider deviations from its standard FTA template. At the same time, ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and a potential comprehensive U.S. FTA with the European Union (EU) could serve as incentives for the REPs to view multilateral or bilateral negotiations more favorably.", "In an era in which global trade leadership is shifting and uncertain, the WTO's dispute settlement understanding (DSU) has become a key forum for managing trade relations. The DSU, despite weaknesses, is a way to engage the REPs directly about their responsibilities for upholding a system of multilateral trade rules.", "The 113th Congress may review U.S. trade relations with the REPs, particularly if President Obama should ask for a renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2013. Some observers maintain that U.S. trade leadership is bolstered when the President has TPA and a mandate from Congress to negotiate new trade agreements. In trying to tie the REPs with their very different state-led economic models into the more market-oriented WTO system, U.S. trade negotiators may need considerable resources, incentives, flexibility, and leverage."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For much of the post-World War II era, developing countries were relatively minor players in the world economy. Accounting for 80% of the world's population but less than 20% of the world's output two decades ago, developing countries throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East were often dismissively referred to as the Third World. At the time, these countries generally exported raw materials, and few ever expected them to be able to export sophisticated manufactured goods to the industrialized world or to become significant world importers. ", "Developing country economic prospects began to change in the 1980s with the spectacular success of four Asian countries\u2014Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. Dubbed the \"Asian tigers,\" these countries adopted export-led growth strategies that helped boost annual per capita incomes by between 5% and 6% over the entire decade. This success, which also involved the use of industrial policies to develop their manufacturing sectors, helped shift the focus of other developing countries from production for domestic and regional markets to production for world markets. ", "This reorientation in thinking accelerated dramatically in the early 1990s with the advance of globalization. Bolstered by the fall of communism, the beginnings of the information technology (IT) revolution, sharply declining transportation costs, the freer movement of capital and technology from developed to developing countries, and economic reforms, economic growth in developing countries began to take off, reaching practically every region of the world and encompassing dozens of developing countries.", "China led the way with average annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth increases of nearly 10% from 1979 to 2011. Its share in global GDP increased from 1.5% in 1990 to 9.5% in 2010. Growth in a handful of developing countries with very large populations, such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Mexico, was also stronger than it had been in previous periods for various reasons. These other developing countries increased their share of global GDP from 15% to 22% over the same period, enabling developing countries as a group with now 83% of the world's population (5.1 billion people) to expand their share of global output to almost 33% today. During this same period, the size of the global economy more than doubled, increasing from $28 trillion in 1990 to $68 trillion in 2010.", "Projections abound that a handful of developing countries will continue to gain shares of global output vis-\u00e0-vis the advanced countries, and in the process change the face of the global economy. A World Bank study projects that by 2030, developing countries will contribute about 50% of global output (with China contributing 20%) and two-thirds of global economic growth (with China contributing 25%). ", "Long-term projections, however, can be far off the mark. Some of these countries may falter as aging populations, rising labor costs, corruption, environmental challenges, failure to innovate or reform more deeply, or infrastructure deficiencies limit them from growing as rapidly as predicted, while other developing countries currently not on anyone's radar screen could turn their economic and political fortunes around. ", "Nevertheless, there is widespread consensus that in addition to China, many of these other larger populous developing countries will continue to experience faster economic growth than the advanced economies, as they have over the past decade, thus continuing the shift of relative economic wealth to a handful of developing countries. Reasons for this assessment include both a continuing large potential for \"catch-up\" gains in output and productivity that these developing countries possess, combined with continuing slow growth in advanced economies due to deleveraging and the impact of high debt burdens. ", "Despite likely gains in economic power, the living standards (as measured by per capita income levels) of the rising powers are likely to remain well below the levels in advanced countries due to their huge populations and still high poverty rates. But still \"developing\" countries are becoming significant forces in the world economy for the first time in hundreds of years, creating uncertainties regarding their role in the global economy.", "These rising countries present the United States with both opportunities and challenges. On the opportunity side, rising imports from these economies offer U.S. consumers an expanding choice of products at lower prices, raising real incomes and contributing towards higher standards of living. Many of the imports are also intermediate goods used in the production of U.S.-produced goods, lowering costs and, thereby, helping to maintain the competitiveness of U.S. firms in the global economy. As their economies grow, the REP s are also providing U.S. exporters and investors with robust new markets\u2014their successful growth strategies are expected to create billions of new \"middle-class\" consumers and unleash billions of dollars in infrastructure spending over the next few decades for which U.S. exporters of goods and services can compete. ", "At the same time, many U.S.-based firms and workers are competing now with an expanded pool of lower-wage labor, much of it located in the REPs. Such competition can nudge U.S.-based firms to reduce costs by adopting labor-saving technology, to move production overseas, or to shut operations that may no longer be competitive. Even firms and workers in high-end service sectors are feeling the pressure of competition from these countries.", "U.S. relations with the REPs, thus, are affecting U.S. economic welfare in fundamental ways. From the perspective of U.S. trade policy, efforts to reduce the trade and investment barriers of the REPs that are impeding U.S. producers and workers from maximizing the benefits of participation in the global economy are likely to be a high priority. But the views and practices of the REPs regarding the role of the state in economic activity, which may differ sharply from U.S. perspectives and actions, make the elimination of trade barriers and the negotiation of new world trade rules more difficult. For their part, the REP s are also protesting U.S. policies on trade remedies, high tariffs on apparel and other import-sensitive items, pricing of medicines, agricultural subsidies and quotas, the temporary entry of foreign workers, and monetary expansion (so-called quantitative easing). In addition, they are making their concerns heard in international institutions, particularly the WTO.", "How the REP s evolve may also affect the nature and integrity of the world trading system. U.S. trade policy officials have generally assumed that as the REPs gain weight in the international trading system, they will become more responsible stakeholders by sharing not only the benefits but the costs of system maintenance and by embracing the principles of free and fair trade with limited government intervention. As China and other developing economies with heavy state involvement in guiding economic activity evolve, it is not certain that they are going to accept this place in the liberal international economic order that the United States and Britain jointly constructed in the aftermath of World War II.", "The rise of China and other developing countries has also coincided with a weakening of the WTO-centered multilateral trade order. Bilateral and regional preferential trade agreements have proliferated and WTO-sponsored multilateral trade liberalization negotiations have stalled. In this environment, questions arise over how the world trade order will be kept and how new rules will be established. ", "These profound changes in the global economy raise a number of questions that the 113 th Congress may wish to consider in its oversight of U.S. trade policy. First, what kinds of trade negotiations can best be utilized to open up REP markets in a way that provides for more balanced and mutually beneficial relationships? Second, in what ways can the United States best influence the REPs to adopt more market-oriented trade and economic policies or reduce barriers to U.S. exports and investment? Third, how can the United States best influence China and the other REPs to become responsible stakeholders in the world trading system? ", "This report is organized into four parts. Part one summarizes the key observations of the report. Part two discusses the key characteristics of the REPs and their reform challenges. Part three analyzes the relationship between U.S. trade interests and the REP s . Part four considers a range of U.S. trade policy responses to challenges raised by the REPs , including the role of Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Observations", "paragraphs": ["The key observations of the report are summarized below.

They accounted for 47% of U.S. exports in 2011, up from 20% in 2000. Their share of U.S. imports has risen from 23% in 2000 to 36% in 2011. If the REPs continue to grow rapidly and open their economies further to trade, these trends could accelerate in the future. REP Trade Barriers: If the United States is to maximize its export potential and boost its living standards, exporters and investors will need to have better access to REP markets. REP trade and regulatory barriers on multiple fronts\u2014tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and restrictions on services and investment\u2014remain considerably higher than in the United States and most other advanced countries. Many of these barriers are denying U.S. producers and workers the extension of comparative advantage, particularly in the areas of services, foreign investment, intellectual property, and government procurement, not only in REP markets, but also in third country markets. A number of these barriers are inadequately covered or difficult to enforce under current WTO rules. REP Interventionist Policies: The ability of the United States to persuade the REPs to embrace the principles of free and fair trade is constrained by growing differences over the role that the state should play in economic activity. While the rules-based GATT/WTO trading system favors commercial outcomes to be determined by market forces, most REP governments play a much larger role in their economies than does the U.S. government. As the 2008 global financial crisis may have weakened the case for free market approaches, some of these countries may now feel more willing to entertain market-distorting practices and take advantage of gaps in the rules .REPs as \"Responsible Stakeholders\" : As the REPs have benefitted greatly from participation in the global economy, many observers hoped that over time they would assume greater responsibility for the maintenance of the trading system. But decisions by Brazil, China, and India not to make concessions that could have facilitated the conclusion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations reflected policy calculations driven primarily by national interests and challenges. How to persuade these countries that a strengthened multilateral trading system is squarely in their national economic interests and a way to move domestic economic reforms forward remains a challenge. China, the largest exporter of manufactured goods and the second-largest economy in the world, is the REP looked to the most for providing leadership of the global trading system, but India and Brazil are not far behind."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Trade Policy Response", "paragraphs": ["Changing Context for U.S. Trade Policy: With the REPs accounting for a rising share of global GDP and trade, U.S. trade policymakers face very different conditions than those that prevailed in the second half of the last century. Support for multilateralism is weaker, bilateral and regional preferential agreements have proliferated, and priorities for trade liberalization and economic reforms are evolving as complex, new policy issues come to the fore. In this environment, questions arise over how the world trade order will be kept, how new rules will be established, and how the United States can best respond to the opportunities and challenges posed by the rise of the REPs . T rade Policy Goals and the REPs : Trade expansion promotes higher U.S. living standards, but all companies and workers do not gain equally. Today's more open global economy, which has intensified competition for low-skilled workers and pressures for automation, may be responsible for a number of contemporary economic concerns, such as job insecurity and income stagnation. These trends feed into growing public pressures for greater reciprocity in U.S. trade relations with the REPs , and raise questions concerning the role of trade negotiations and export promotion in achieving U.S. trade policy goals. Trade Policy Strategy towards the REPs . The REPs still depend on access to advanced country markets and they may not easily ignore requests for reciprocal negotiations. Nor are the REPs likely to ignore the potential discriminatory effects of preferential trade agreements negotiated by the United States with other large and significant trading partners. In negotiating with the REPs, U.S. trade policymakers may wish to consider putting U.S. trade barriers on the table. Multilateral Negotiations: Given that the REPs did not use their growing influence to insure a successful conclusion of the Doha Round, further progress on trade liberalization within the WTO may require alternatives to existing multilateral processes and practices. Principles that have guided multilateral trade negotiations in the past, such as unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) and special and differential (S&D) treatment, may need to be reexamined. Currently, 47 advanced and advanced developing countries are exploring a potential plurilateral agreement on services under the WTO umbrella (where some but not all WTO members are members), and other plurilaterals on foreign investment and state-owned enterprises have been proposed. Such agreements could help end simplistic distinctions between developed and developing countries which many of the REPs have tried to perpetuate. Strengthening WTO Dispute Settlement: In an era in which both global economic power and trade leadership are in transition, the WTO's dispute settlement understanding (DSU) has become a linchpin for maintaining global economic order. For the United States and other advanced countries, the DSU is a way to engage the REPs directly about their responsibilities for upholding a system of multilateral trade rules. For the REPs , the DSU provides a way to challenge advanced countries' market access barriers and measures that some deem to be protectionist, such as extensive use of trade remedy laws. The DSU, however, does have weaknesses (e.g., cases can take three years to complete and remedies are not retrospective) which U.S. trade policymakers could try to address. Bilateral and Regional FTA Negotiations and Other Bilateral Initiatives: Increasingly, U.S. trade policy (as well as the trade policies of the other major trading countries) is becoming dominated by bilateral and regional negotiations to establish free trade agreements (FTAs). These agreements offer opportunities between pairs or groups of countries to reduce trade barriers and construct new rules in an effort to forge more integrated economies. U.S. FTAs since NAFTA went into effect in 1994 have been concluded with relatively small trading partners (South Korea excluded). These have been comprehensive in scope and have comprised high standards. For a number of reasons, the United States has not concluded FTAs with large and more significant trade partners, such as China, India, or Brazil, that could offer greater economic advantages. If the United States wishes to move in this direction, deviations from its standard FTA template may need to be considered. At the same time, ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and a potential comprehensive U.S. FTA with the European Union (EU) could serve as incentives for the REPs to view higher standard multilateral or bilateral negotiations more favorably. In addition, other bilateral initiatives, such as cabinet-level working groups and trade and investment framework agreements, are or could be additional approaches used to elevate U.S. government attention and resources devoted to these key countries. Unilateral Initiatives to Encourage REP Reforms: U.S. unilateral initiatives traditionally took the form of threats to restrict a trading partner's access to the large U.S. market in order to influence trade barrier reductions. In today's more interdependent and rules-based world economy, unilateral initiatives take the form more of \"carrots\" or incentives than \"sticks\" or sanctions. Possible unilateral initiatives include measures that strengthen the U.S. economy so that it sets an example for the rest of the world, as well as U.S. proposals that resonate with the REPs ' evaluation of their own economic self-interest. Congressional Role: Congress plays a large role in the development and administration of U.S. trade policy. The 113 th Congress may consider a number of questions relating to the future direction of U.S. trade relations with the REPs , particularly if President Obama should ask for a renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2013. Some observers maintain that U.S. trade leadership is bolstered when the President has TPA and a mandate from Congress to negotiate new agreements. In trying to induce the REPs with their very different state-led economic models into strengthening the market-oriented WTO system, U.S. trade negotiators may need considerable resources, flexibility, and leverage to engage them more successfully."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Who Are the Rising Economic Powers?", "paragraphs": ["Predictions abound that a small group of the over 140 countries now classified by the World Bank as \"developing\" will be the growth engine of the global economy and will continue to gain global output vis-\u00e0-vis the advanced countries. Outside of the largest developing countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, there has been less consensus on which countries to flag for special consideration.", "Past attempts to identify the rising economic powers from the developing world have adopted many different monikers\u2014emerging markets, Big Emerging Markets , BRICs , Near-BRIC s , Next-11 , and Pivotal Powers \u2014often driven by different objectives, such as generating interest in new investment opportunities. (See Appendix A for a summary of these past efforts.) This report focuses on countries that are not only up and coming, located throughout the world, and providing expanding markets, but are also playing an increasingly large role in determining the shape of the global trading system. ", "Most predictions mapping out the rise of specific developing countries use a simple methodology that incorporates data on labor force and capital stock growth combined with more subjective evaluations on how individual governments will cope with a range of political and economic challenges. To the extent that the underlying political and institutional dimensions are given more weight, projections regarding the rise of any one country are probably going to be less firm than the fact that the greatest potential for high rates of economic growth (and a continuing shift of economic power) rests with a small group of developing countries (see Appendix B for more detail on the methodology behind the economic projections).", "There are large differences among the universe of rising developing countries, giving scope for varied groupings and categories. The likely uneven rise of developing countries is an important consideration for prioritizing U.S. trade interests and concerns. While this report focuses primarily on seven large, populous rising economic powers\u2014China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey\u2014some of these countries' economic prospects could easily decline if fundamental challenges are not addressed. Simultaneously, a number of large developing countries, such as Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, and Vietnam, could emerge as global economic forces over time if their geopolitical conditions are dramatically altered and economic deficiencies addressed. These long-shot or turnaround economies have the size to exert influence if they break out of their economic doldrums and political constraints. In addition, nearly a dozen or so fast-growing developing countries, such as Colombia, Poland, and Malaysia, are providing rapidly growing commercial opportunities for U.S. traders, consumers, and investors, although these countries may not have the size to become forces in the global economy. (See Appendix C for a discussion of these two alternative country groupings.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defining Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["There are significant differences among the seven countries dubbed as rising economic powers ( REPs) in this report. These include political systems, per capita income levels, approaches to economic development, and trade patterns. Perhaps most importantly, China and Russia tend to be authoritarian states, while Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey are committed to democratic institutions. Furthermore, of these latter five states, Mexico is a bit different given its strong economic links with the United States through NAFTA and its close proximity to the United States. But the one characteristic they all share is a large economy in absolute terms. ", "As shown in Table 1 , all seven are currently ranked among the top 21 largest economies in the world in 2010 based on GDP calculations in nominal dollars\u2014with China #3, India #8, Brazil #9, Mexico #13, Russia #17, Turkey #18, and Indonesia #21. Projecting out 40 years to 2050 (see Figure 4 ), one recent study predicts that all the REPs will rise in the rankings with China overtaking the United States as the largest economy in the world. Turkey is projected to gain the most in rankings (6 spots), followed closely by India, Mexico, and Indonesia (5 spots each).", "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP). Measuring national wealth in PPP terms tends to increase the GDP of developing countries by taking into account that many non-tradable goods such as haircuts, meals, medical care, and housing tend to cost less in developing countries. One PPP GDP ranking (see Table 2 ), estimates that China, India, Russia, and Brazil were among the 10 largest economies in the world in 2011 and projects that by 2020, China will have the largest economy in the world and India the second largest, with the Russian (#6), Brazilian, (#7), and Mexican economies (#8) also among the top 10.", "Aggregate GDP\u2014the size of a country's economy (whether measured in constant dollars or calculated based on PPP)\u2014captures the potential impact of a country on the international trading system and its ability to resist unilateral pressure from another country. A country with a large economy tends to have important trading relationships with more countries (i.e., global trading relationships) and is increasingly part of global supply chains involving multinational companies. As shown in Table 3 , the seven REPs that are the primary focus of this report have gained dramatic shares of world exports, rising from 7% in 1990 to 20.6% in 2011. By 2016, the REPs are projected to account for nearly 25% of global exports.", "With large economies and trade flows, these countries have greater involvement in WTO negotiations and dispute settlement processes, as well as greater autonomy in applying the rules and obligations of the WTO system domestically. The REPs have also protested with greater frequency U.S. policies and practices that they deem are detrimental to their own national economic interests. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, REP leaders have criticized U.S. economic policies and reliance on free market orthodoxy more vociferously. While their protests and criticisms have not been followed by changes in U.S. trade or economic policies, the REPs arguably have become more able to deflect U.S. trade and market access demands.", "Large populations and growing economies are the driving force in positioning the REPs higher in the global GDP rankings. As shown in Figure 5 , the seven REPs in 2011 accounted for 48% of the world's population (3.34 billion out of 6.97 billion people) and 23% of the world's GDP ($16.4 trillion out of $69.9 trillion). The fact that China has the world's largest population, India the second largest, and Brazil the fifth largest has helped make these three the second-, third-, and eighth-largest economies in the world (according to PPP calculations), respectively. At the same time, per capita incomes of the REPs in 2011 (see Table 4 ) were approximately one-fifth the per capita income levels in the high income countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ($8,144 versus $38,667), indicating that reaching the much higher OECD living standards with their large populations may be a stretch in the near term. ", "With the exception of Mexico from 2003 to 2008 and Russia from 2008 to 2011, the REPs have been growing faster than the advanced high income OECD countries by a considerable margin. In the aggregate, they grew three times faster than the high income OECD countries from 2003 to 2008 (6.4% compared to 2.1%) and 23 times faster from 2009 to 2011 (4.6% compared to 0.2%).

Ruchir Sharma, author of Breakout Nations, argues that this was a golden period that is unlikely to be repeated, while some other analysts are much more optimistic that some developing countries, particularly China, India, and Brazil, can continue to grow at the historically rapid rates of the last decade and remain growth engines of the global economy.", "The case for slower growth is based on two major factors. The first is that advanced countries, hamstrung by high consumer and government debt, likely will be growing at much lower rates in the foreseeable future. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), for example, projects that in 2013 advanced countries will grow at only one-third the rate of emerging markets and developing countries (2% versus 6%). If growth slows in advanced countries, they could buy less from the developing world, much of which is highly dependent on exports for its growth. ", "A second factor is that the richer a country becomes, the harder it is to grow rapidly. In the case of middle-income countries, World Bank research determined that only 13 of the 101 countries deemed middle income (currently defined as any country with a gross national income per capita between $1,006 and $12,275) in 1960 had advanced to high income by 2011. To make this transition up the value-chain, governments can no longer simply borrow technology or add more capital and labor, but must find ways to foster private sector development and innovation.", "Economic history, thus, suggests that there is nothing inevitable in the continued rise of any of the REPs or any other developing country. Every individual developing country may have great economic potential, but there is no easy path for continued high growth. Continued high growth requires ongoing efforts and reforms to address economic challenges, which constantly change as countries hit different income levels. ", "The magnitude of the reform challenges for the REPs is captured by World Bank estimates of a country's openness or receptivity to business operations. As shown in Table 5 , the REPs ' rates are quite low, with the business climates of Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and India comparable to countries such as Bangladesh (#122), Uganda (#123), and Swaziland (#124). The United States' business environment was rated the fourth-best in the world.", "To improve their business climates and reinvigorate their economies, the REPs could undertake a range of trade, regulatory, and structural reforms. By reducing tariffs, quotas, and foreign investment restrictions, the REPs could open their economies at the border to more international competition. Trade-related reforms encompassing services regulation, regulation of food-safety and technical standards, intellectual property protection, public procurement, customs administration, and competition rules could also increase competition. Structural reforms to address corruption, labor and product market restrictions, and other regulatory barriers could also help free the economies of the REPs from government intervention. Overall, the resulting intensified competition could help improve worker productivity, economic growth, and living standards.", "All these reforms tend to be politically sensitive because they affect government-business relations, as well as entrenched political and vested business interests. A political determination to overcome special interests that stand to be disadvantaged by the reforms, thus, may be important for most of these reforms to be initiated and implemented. A country's economic future in this sense depends substantially on its politics. In situations where there is growing political will to initiate domestic reforms, the scope for international negotiations and solutions could increase substantially. ", "While the reforms are primarily a matter of unilateral action, some trade specialists believe that action in one country can create a situation where REP governments would want to emulate reforms of the others to stay competitive.

But today it faces formidable challenges in continuing on this path. Its main reform challenge may be to make the economy more consumption and less investment driven. To rebalance the economy, China will need to undertake various competition-enhancing reforms, ranging from public sector and financial sector reforms to secure private property rights, deregulation of internal trade, market pricing for internal inputs, and better provision of health, education, pensions, and social security. A number of other measures could be taken to bolster the private sector at the expense of China's still large state-owned or state-controlled companies. These could include limits on industrial policy activism, better enforcement of intellectual property rights, and accelerated services liberalization. Rebalancing will likely encounter resistance from powerful vested interests as they may challenge the heart of the Communist party's grip on power. Not only party members, but vested interests in the state-owned companies, military, banks, and family clans would likely resist the reforms in order to preserve their positions of power and wealth. Other key risks to achieving stable long-term economic growth include pervasive corruption, environmental degradation, and an aging population.

In 2008, just as the Western financial crisis was beginning, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao articulated his view of state capitalism: \"The complete formulation of our economic policy is to give full play to the basic role of market forces in allocating resources under the macroeconomic guidance and regulation of government. We have one important piece of experience of the past thirty years, that is to ensure that both the visible hand and the invisible hand are given full play in regulating market forces.\" As a practical matter, this model defies easy description. On the one hand, China is still nominally communist, with five-year plans and a sometimes heavy-handed involvement or control of a dozen or so of the most important and strategic sectors. On the other hand, the state sector is shrinking and the conventional wisdom is that China will not keep growing at sustainable levels unless it becomes less state-directed. Russia practices a highly interventionist form of state capitalism. The Kremlin relies on both direct government control and intervention in key sectors and control of politically connected businessmen to further both the interests of the state and those who run it. The country's vast oil and gas reserves are used as a key tool to promote financial and political independence and promote Russia as a great power abroad. At the same time, the Russian model also allows many large segments of the domestic economy to remain relatively open for private (including foreign) investment. Consumer driven sectors like retail, construction, real estate, and wireless telecommunications are mostly free of direct political interference. In some sectors, political officials have found that consumer demand is best fueled by free markets. Brazil's economy is market based, although significant state involvement continues to shape economic activity through industrial policies and ownership of major enterprises. The government is also the primary source of capital and long-term local currency financing and often attempts to influence some of the largest private companies, known as national champions, to invest domestically in strategic sectors such as natural resources and telecommunications. In Brazil it can be said that there is very little controversy over the government playing a large role as an investor, provider of social welfare, and driver of economic growth. India combines a state-dominated economic model of an earlier era and one driven by private enterprise. India still uses five-year economic plans that are created, implemented, and monitored by a state planning commission.

In particular, there is concern that a leadership vacuum could lead to economic and political conflict in the years ahead if the WTO system is not strengthened.", "Many observers assumed that because the REPs have benefitted enormously from participation in the existing global trading system, they would over time become responsible stakeholders (sharing not only the benefits of the global trading system but the responsibility of system maintenance) as they gain weight and power in the global economy. Some assumed that as responsible stakeholders the REPs would pursue a path of greater openness and actively promote and embrace the principles of free and fair trade with limited government intervention. As responsible stakeholders, it was also expected that they would work to break the stalemate in the Doha Round and not to stand aside and let it fail. ", "These expectations have not yet been realized. Some observers believe that the REPs , led by China, India, and Brazil, have preferred the status quo to co-leadership of the global trading system, protection of their domestic markets to market openings, and manipulation of current rules to designing new rules. Other REPs , such as Indonesia and Turkey, which could play a constructive supporting role have also been either obstructionist or defensive in the Doha Round. ", "While many of the leaders of the REPs argue that they do show trade leadership by defending what they perceive as their national interests, others disagree and point to factors that may be inhibiting the REPs from exercising leadership. For example, while each of the REPs has a large GDP, they are all relatively poor in terms of GDP per capita. This perhaps creates a gap between the world's expectations about their ability to shoulder important roles and responsibilities in global governance and their perceptions of their own capabilities to do so. The REPs also face formidable challenges at home, including weak national institutions and governance by elites prone to corruption, which may curb any appetite for global leadership and keep their leaders focused on domestic issues. ", "One hope for REP leadership rested in the rise of the G-20 as the primary forum for addressing global economic issues. Created in 2008 in response to the global crisis, the G-20 was credited with facilitating an effective response by the rising powers in keeping the world economy afloat. China and India, in particular, both adopted large spending programs to keep their own economies from declining, which, in turn, had some positive effects on the world economy. But the G-20 has become less effective since the crisis, and cooperation remains elusive. Collective pledges, such as on concluding the WTO Doha Round, have not been implemented. Soft cooperation may be the best that can be hoped for as deep-seated differences among G-20 members on underlying economic policies prevent hard coordination on rebalancing the global economy and implementing policies to prevent a future crisis. ", "As the REPs focus on dealing with internal challenges to economic growth, greater enthusiasm and a stronger commitment to the principles of WTO membership could be helpful as they attempt to overcome vested interests and protectionist pressures at home.

Its rise to prosperity has depended on an open world trading system to generate growth and demand. Assuming it becomes the largest trading country (both goods and services) and largest economy in the world in the decades ahead, its need for stable rules, open markets for its exports, and access to raw materials and intermediate inputs that are not produced domestically will only grow. China's large state-owned companies also want opportunities to invest abroad. These stakes in an open world trading system ought to provide an incentive for China to provide more active leadership in strengthening the rules of the trading system, especially if it is threatened by protectionism. Moreover, its regime's claim to legitimacy hinges on the country's continuing welfare and prosperity.", "China's movement toward responsible stakeholder status could also be bolstered by internal forces pushing Chinese authorities to reduce control over the economy. The World Bank, for instance, recently concluded that China will not keep growing at sustainable levels and will not avoid the trap that most middle-income economies fall into unless its economy becomes less state-directed. SOEs still account for a significant amount of Chinese industrial production and put a heavy strain on China's economy. Government support of unprofitable SOEs, half of which reportedly lose money, diverts resources from potentially more efficient and profitable enterprises. Accordingly, a less directed economy or an economy in which the private sector and markets gain the upper hand would be consistent with movement towards responsible stakeholder status\u2014a China that is more integrated into the rules and norms of the global trading system.

Moreover, China's leaders have for three decades defied the predictions of critics that central planning cannot work efficiently. China's continued growth, despite a recent slowing, has led some in China to conclude that China's state dominance in key industrial and service sectors should and will continue. The challenge is that genuine integration into the global economic order would demand significant modifications to the Chinese political economy and how China is ruled. Such modifications could change the dynamics of how the country is run or even weaken the relevance of the Communist Party. While its leaders may recognize that they (via the state) misallocate capital on a massive scale, they may do so in large part to keep a hold on power. Under this view, it is hard to see China taking on a global trade leadership role given that most incentives will be in promoting the power interests of the Party elites.

Most notably, the traditional structure of postwar multilateralism has weakened; bilateral and regional preferential trade agreements have proliferated; and priorities for trade liberalization and economic reforms are in flux during a period of heightened economic uncertainty.

While firms and industries that are competitive may gain by increasing exports or by expanding their operations overseas, some segments of the economy that are unable to survive increased competition could lose through worker layoffs and plant closures. In addition, there are growing concerns that today's more open global economy, which allows millions of low-wage workers around the world to compete with American labor, and digital machines to replace many forms of human labor, is responsible for a number of contemporary economic concerns. These concerns include income stagnation for the majority of American workers and increased job insecurity, particularly among lower-skilled workers.

But they do recognize that trade policy alone cannot address many of the challenges U.S. companies and workers face in an increasingly global economy. These experts generally argue that U.S. policy must address those displaced by trade by providing them with better education and training necessary to compete in a globalized economy. Such policies, they argue, are necessary not only to improve U.S. living standards, but also to limit, if not reverse, the decline in popular support for foreign trade.", "In addition to recognizing the domestic aspects of the labor market challenges, U.S. trade policymakers are also subject to growing public pressures for greater reciprocity in U.S. trade relations with the REPs. Polling data reflect an American public that is increasingly skeptical of the benefits of globalization in general and free trade agreements in particular. More concern about the U.S. ability to compete for trade and investment is directed at the REPs than with advanced trading partners such as Japan or the European Union. These attitudes stem both from concerns of U.S. stakeholders about jobs, import competition, and wage stagnation and from the tendency of the REPs to keep their markets relatively more closed than the U.S. economy to promote home companies and industries.

On the one hand, it may help U.S. policymakers to have better information on and understanding of the factors driving REP policies, particularly how their trade policies are influenced by domestic growth and development priorities. In many cases, REP trade policy concerns and obligations tend to be subordinated to powerful elites and domestic concerns. Yet, the REPs still depend on access to the U.S. and other advanced country markets, and, thus, cannot easily ignore requests for reciprocity or threats of market closure.

Some of these positions relate to multilateral trade agreements and others to the template or formula the United States has used in negotiating bilateral and regional agreements. To better match their rising economic importance, policymakers may also wish to consider the resources and level of attention the U.S. government devotes to these countries.

The United States and Europe, for the most part, have shared similar interests in encouraging the big emerging economies, such as China, India, and Brazil, to open their import markets further for services and manufactured goods, while retaining some measure of protection for their own agricultural sectors. Developing countries sought the reduction of U.S. and European agricultural tariffs and subsidies, non-reciprocal market access for manufacturing sectors, and protection for their services sectors. In the past they might have taken any deal offered by the West because they were not obligated to make any significant concessions, today, countries like India and Brazil now hold out for the deal of their choice. This resolve may have been bolstered by a view by some that they made greater commitments in the 1990s Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations than the advanced countries. Moreover, the rising powers may believe that they do not have much to gain by giving up protection of their markets for goods and services because U.S. and European markets are already quite open.

Another diplomat described this process as \"the elephants hiding behind the mice.\" Under this perspective, the fact that these rising and heavily populated economic powers, for the most part, will have low per capita incomes for many decades raises serious concerns that they will continue to resist supporting the open trading system from which they have accrued substantial economic benefits.

Unconditional MFN thwarts discrimination between alternative foreign suppliers and thereby promotes both economic efficiency and harmonious relations between states. Whatever its virtues, unconditional MFN creates an open door for \"free riders\" and an exit path from reciprocity, especially when concessions among a few countries are extended without cost to all WTO members, as they were for much of the history of the GATT and WTO.

If these two countries were to agree to high standards and comprehensive WTO-plus provisions that allowed more competition in product and labor markets, and gave liberalized restrictions on foreign investment in return for greater access to the U.S. market, China may feel greater pressure to liberalize its economy over time or join the negotiations out of fear that foreign investment could be diverted.

This group was dubbed the \"Next Eleven,\" or N-11 for short, and included Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam.", "The so-called CIVETS group of countries\u2014Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa\u2014was touted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in 2009 as the next generation of \"tiger\" economies (even though they are named after a shy feline mammal). The appeal of these countries is that they all have large, young populations with an average age now of 27 and reasonably sophisticated financial systems, and export a variety of products. ", "In January 2011 President Obama announced a National Export Initiative (NEI) aimed at doubling U.S. exports over five years. In addition to China, India, and Brazil, this effort identified Colombia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam as \"next tier\" emerging markets, as well as the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.", "In 2011, Jim O'Neil, the head of the Goldman Sachs research team, maintained that the term \"emerging markets\" could no longer be applied to the four BRICs or to four of the N-11 : Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, and Turkey. Instead, this group of countries with largely sound debt and deficit positions, strong trading networks, and large labor forces were dubbed \" Growth Markets .\"", "Citibank analysts in 2011 identified Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Nigeria, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam as the countries with the most promising growth prospects and investment opportunities. Dubbed 3G or Global Growth Generators , these 11 countries were identified base on a weighted average of factors such as savings rates, demographic prospects, health, education, quality of institutions and policies, and trade openness.", "Rejecting a primarily quantitative approach for singling out and ranking countries in terms of their economic potential, Oxford Analytica in 2012 identified six countries\u2014Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Mexico\u2014as candidates for the status of Pivotal Powers. In a world of increasingly fragmented power, this report argued that these are \"countries that by virtue of their strategic location, size of population, economic potential, policy preferences, and political weighting are destined to shape the contours of geopolitics in key regions of the world and constitute important nodes of economic growth.\"", "In November 2012, the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) and Center for New American Security released a new report, Global Swing States: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and the Future of the International Order. In this report, the authors examined how the United States and Europe can partner with these countries to support a new international order.", "Appendix B. Methodology for Economic Projections", "While the countries identified as rising economic powers have varied, the selection criteria have relied in substantial part on three factors\u2014population or labor force size, capital stock, and what economists call total factor productivity. Of these factors, some projections place more weight on demographics given that only countries with large populations can hope to be one of the largest economies. Others have emphasized underlying political and institutional characteristics that influence total factor productivity as far more important in whether countries rise or fall in the global economic GDP rankings.", "The United Nations predicts the global population will reach 9.2 billion in 2050, a large jump from the estimated 6.8 billion in 2009 and 2.5 billion in 1950. During this same period, the global labor force is expected to expand by nearly 1.3 billion. Developing regions will see their workforces expand by 1.5 billion people\u2014more than the current population of developed countries\u2014while the labor force will shrink by over 100 million in developed areas. Developing Africa and Asia will contribute the most to the increase, adding 1.4 billion workers to the global labor force. By contrast, Europe's working-age population will decline by more than 110 million. ", "Research that weights population size and labor force growth as the most critical factors contributing to economic growth tends to argue that the world's most populated countries should have the largest economies when the productivity of their workers (the more a group of workers can produce with a given set of inputs from time to materials) increases rapidly. Critically, the countries that are playing an increasingly large role in the world economy, displacing many 20 th century powers in the GDP rankings, have large populations, large markets, and a growing middle class. Demographics matter because they define a country's economic ability to become a large economic power even if living standards are relatively low. They also enable countries to project power, and, if they are able, to set and implement an agenda for others to follow.", "As worker productivity is enhanced by additions of machinery, physical capital stocks are the second key driver of growth. These stocks, in turn, are a function of savings rates and rising incomes. Having a high savings pool is important because this finances the investment that leads to future growth. In advanced countries, savings as a share of GDP are declining as populations age. In many developing countries, capital stocks are predicted to rise substantially as the working population ages. ", "What economists call total factor productivity (TFP) is the third driver of economic growth and may be the most important. This is the extra growth that occurs when labor and capital are added together in an efficient and optimum manner. Rising TFP can come from a variety of factors including political stability, good governance, sound institutions, exposure to new technologies, and the right economic and financial policies. While there are no precise formulas to stimulate growth, some of the key ingredients are thought to include policies that allow the free flow of goods, money, and people; policies that encourage savings and banks to funnel money into productive investments; and policies that stabilize the economy with low inflation and low budget and trade deficits. Additionally, the rule of law and protection of property rights is required to attract technology transfers and innovation. Top quality education and training systems are also widely viewed as key components. But there appears to be no magic formula, only a long list of ingredients that offer no real insight into how these factors will or will not combine to produce growth in any given country at any given time.", "Given that TFP is substantially about policies and institutions, the past may not be a good guide to the future. As the factors undergirding TFP are inherently unpredictable, long-term forecasts of economic growth are bound to be uncertain as well. China and India, for example, could falter for any number of reasons. China faces internal imbalances, a rapidly aging population, rising wages, and social unrest, among other challenges. India, for its part, must deal with endemic corruption, weak infrastructure, and excessive regulations if it is to reach its economic potential. Conversely, countries such as Iran and Nigeria that now are seeming long-shots to play a large role in the global economy could conceivably address internal political challenges, adopt outward-looking economic reforms, engage with the rest of the world, enter a path of sustained growth, and rise in the global GDP rankings. ", "Appendix C. Alternative REP Groupings", "As discussed in the report, there are large differences among the universe of rising developing countries, giving scope for varied groupings and categories. While this report focuses on seven countries identified as REPs , it is important to flag other countries that are capable of playing a much larger role in the global economy if they are able to overcome political and institutional constraints. These potential \"turnaround\" or \"long-shot\" countries include Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam. There are also at least nine fast-growing developing countries or emerging markets that are providing attractive commercial opportunities, but that are unlikely to become regional or global economic powers because of their relatively smaller populations. This group includes Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Venezuela. ", "Long-Shot or Turnaround Economies ", "There are a number of populous developing countries that have enormous economic potential, but must overcome fundamental political and economic obstacles if they are to break out of their economic doldrums. Among the countries that could turn their economic fortunes around with better governance and other institutional and policy reforms are Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam. As shown in Table C-1 , these six countries all have large populations ranging from 75 million in Iran to over 160 million in Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan. But they currently have shaky and small economies amounting to only $200 billion-$480 billion in GDP. They also have very low per capita incomes, ranging from a little over $1,000 in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Vietnam to an estimated $4,500 in Iran. ", "Some of the economic potential and challenges facing several of these countries are highlighted below:", "Egypt arguably has the size, history as a Middle Eastern power, and ambition to become a rising economic power. Some of its advantages include the largest population (82 million) in the Middle East and North Africa, well-educated elite, and a sizeable middle class, plus a strategic location on a critical waterway. Its economy has suffered because of its political instability, an unsettled transition to democracy, and legal uncertainties. If new leadership adopts pro-growth policies, opens the economy further to trade and investment, and increases the role of the private sector in the economy, its growth prospects could improve immeasurably. However, the country's new leaders will need to ensure that the benefits of growth are widely distributed to stave off further political conflict. Iran , a current U.S. adversary, is a country of immense commercial and economic potential. Its population of 75 million makes it the second-most populous country in the Middle East and North Africa, after Egypt. It has a vibrant, well-educated, and entrepreneurial middle class with some of the highest labor participation rates of women in the region. Two-thirds of Iranians are under the age of 33 and one-half under the age of 21. Expatriates of Iranian descent, located mostly in the United States and Europe, have an estimated $1 trillion in assets and could potentially mediate between Iran and global capital and trade markets if the geopolitical environment dramatically improved. From 2003 to 2008, Iran averaged 5.3% growth and maintained a stable macroeconomic environment. Affected by increased international isolation, economic growth in past years (2009-2011) has dropped to just over 3%. Absent a more moderate and responsible leadership and a lifting of international sanctions, rapid growth will likely remain elusive. Nigeria aspires to become Africa's most powerful and influential country and one of the world's top 20 economies by 2020. It has been growing 7% per year for much of the past decade and its GDP could overtake South Africa's in the very near future. Nigeria's demographic profile lies at the root of its rising economic status. With a population currently estimated at around 170 million but expected to exceed 300 million by the middle of the century, it is Africa's biggest domestic market by far. Its relatively youthful and rising middle class, entrepreneurial culture, and appetite for consumer goods add to its huge economic potential. But its economic management and governance; high unemployment rate; low development indicators, such as infant mortality and literacy; and political conflict and instability in parts of the country remain serious challenges. Progress has been slow in lessening the economy's overreliance on oil, harnessing vast natural gas reserves, reviving its agricultural sector, eliminating a chronic infrastructure deficit, tackling endemic graft and corruption, and overhauling dysfunctional institutions. Success in any one of these areas could herald the birth of a continental power.", "Emerging Markets ", "There are a number of other developing countries that are providing rising living standards and significant new trade and investment opportunities. All have adopted outwar- looking trade and economic policies and are well positioned for continued future growth. With populations under 100 million, however, none are large enough to become global or even regional economic powers. Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Venezuela are selected countries that can be placed in this long-standing category of emerging markets. ", "As shown in Table C-2, these emerging markets have GDPs ranging from a low of $215 billion (Czech Republic) to a high of $577 billion (Saudi Arabia). With populations generally under 50 million (Thailand at 69 million being the exception), most of these countries will be hard pressed to break the $1 trillion GDP threshold any time soon. While Thailand, with a per capita income of $4,972, is the poorest emerging market, it may also have the greatest upside potential for growth.", "On average, these emerging markets grew two to four times faster than advanced countries from 2003 to 2008. Over the most recent three-year period (2009-2011), Argentina, Colombia, Malaysia, Poland, and Saudi Arabia have experienced growth rates averaging 3.3% to 6.3%, thus surpassing the advanced countries' negligible growth of two-tenths of one percent by wide margins. South Africa and Thailand, which grew by 1.5% and 1.9% respectively, also grew significantly faster than the advanced countries. Only the Czech Republic, adversely affected by the Euro zone crisis, and Venezuela, adversely affected by economic mismanagement, performed the same or worse than the advanced countries.
