The movement of air pollutants across state lines, known as interstate transport, has made it difficult for some downwind states to attain federal ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) standards, partly because states lack authority to limit emissions from other states.", "The Clean Air Act's \"Good Neighbor\" provision (Section 110(a)(2)(D)) seeks to address this issue and requires states to prohibit emissions that significantly contribute to another state's air quality problems. It requires each state's implementation plan (SIP)\u2014a collection of air quality regulations and documents\u2014to prohibit emissions that either \"significantly contribute\" to nonattainment or \"interfere with maintenance\" of federal air quality standards in another state. The act also authorizes states to petition EPA to issue a finding that emissions from \"any major source or group of stationary sources\" violate the Good Neighbor provision (Section 126(b)).", "EPA and the states have implemented regional programs to address interstate ozone and PM2.5 transport and comply with the Good Neighbor provision. These programs set emission \"budgets\" for ozone and PM2.5 precursor emissions\u2014specifically, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) as PM2.5 precursors and seasonal NOx emissions as an ozone precursor. The current program\u2014the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)\u2014focuses on limiting interstate transport of power sector SO2 and NOx emissions to eastern states.", "Power sector emissions in CSAPR states are below emission budgets as a result of regulatory and market factors (see figure). Annual SO2, annual NOx, and ozone season NOx emissions from CSAPR sources decreased 77%, 41%, and 15%, respectively, between 2009 and 2016.", "EPA has concluded that regional SO2 and NOx programs have reduced interstate transport of PM2.5 and ozone. The Energy Information Administration's national-scale analysis identifies market and regulatory factors contributing to emission reductions. It is unclear whether emissions will remain well below budgets, given recent prices of ozone season NOx allowances (i.e., authorization for each ton emitted) and the supply of banked allowances for future use in lieu of emission reductions.", "Research indicates that ozone transport harms air quality in downwind states. However, stakeholder views vary regarding the extent to which interstate transport impacts air quality. Some note that some coal-fired power plants do not fully use already-installed pollution controls. Several states have sought additional upwind reductions in ozone precursors through Section 126(b) petitions. Others have questioned the feasibility of achieving additional reductions in ozone precursors, raising concerns about emissions from international or natural sources.", "EPA recently proposed to determine that CSAPR fully addresses Good Neighbor obligations for the 2008 ozone standard but has not yet made a \"Good Neighbor\" determination for the more stringent 2015 ozone standard. The agency has therefore not yet determined whether and how it will update the CSAPR budgets with respect to the 2015 ozone standard.", "Members of Congress may have an interest in better understanding how EPA and states implement the Clean Air Act's Good Neighbor provision, particularly as EPA continues its assessment of Good Neighbor obligations under the 2015 ozone standard.", "The following issues, among others, may inform deliberations about interstate air transport. First, the extent to which existing programs will improve air quality in areas not meeting the 2015 ozone standard is to be determined. CSAPR has not addressed NOx emissions from nonpower sector sources, such as large industrial boilers. EPA concluded that industrial sources have potential to cost-effectively reduce NOx emissions but is less certain about the structure of potential NOx control strategies. Second, some have questioned whether additional regulatory incentives are necessary to fulfill Good Neighbor obligations, particularly given current NOx allowance prices. These prices are below the marginal abatement cost, which may result in higher emissions. Third, EPA's current air quality initiatives may indirectly affect its Good Neighbor assessments. EPA recently sought comment on potential flexibilities for the development of Good Neighbor SIPs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The movement of air pollutants across state lines, known as interstate transport, has posed a decades-long challenge to air quality protection. The Clean Air Act (CAA) assigns responsibility to states to limit emissions from sources within their borders as needed to attain federal health-based air quality standards. A state's air quality, however, may be affected by emissions from upwind sources located in a different state. Hence, controlling emissions within the border of a state may not be sufficient to attain the air quality standard. The downwind state lacks authority to limit emissions from the sources in the upwind state(s) but is nonetheless responsible for attaining the federal standards.", "Interstate transport has made it difficult for some downwind states to attain federal standards for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). Both of these pollutants are formed by precursor emissions that can travel long distances. Specifically, sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) contribute to the formation of PM 2.5 in the air. NO x and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight to form ground-level ozone, the main component of smog. Studies have shown that these precursor emissions, as well as ozone and PM 2.5 , are regional pollutants, meaning that they can travel hundreds of miles through the atmosphere. For example, Bergin et al.'s study of the eastern United States concluded that regional transport affected air quality in most eastern states. They attributed an average of 77% of each state's ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations to emissions from upwind states. ", "These regional emissions are associated with health impacts and are therefore of concern. For example, research shows that ground-level ozone is associated with aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, heart attacks, and premature death. Studies have also linked exposure to particulate matter to respiratory illnesses, such as aggravated asthma, as well as heart attacks and premature death. ", "The CAA's \"Good Neighbor\" provision recognizes such interstate issues and requires states to prohibit emissions that significantly contribute to air quality problems in another state (Section 110(a)(2)(D)). It requires each state's implementation plan\u2014a collection of air quality regulations and documents\u2014to include adequate provisions to prohibit emissions that either \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment or \"interfere with maintenance\" of federal air quality standards in another state. ", "Since the 1990s, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states have implemented various regional programs to address interstate air transport. Many of these programs have since concluded. The current program\u2014the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, pronounced \"Casper\")\u2014is an emissions trading program for 28 states in the eastern part of the United States. EPA established CSAPR to limit interstate transport of power sector SO 2 and NO x emissions and help states comply with the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 standards as well as the 1997 and 2008 ozone standards. ", "EPA has attributed emission reductions to CSAPR and the agency's other emissions trading programs, such as the Acid Rain Program: annual SO 2 emissions from power plants participating in CSAPR were 1.2 million tons in 2016, an 87% reduction from 2005 levels. CSAPR power plants also emitted 420,000 tons of NO x in the 2016 ozone season, roughly an 80% reduction from the 1990 ozone season NO x emissions.", "Emissions reduction progress notwithstanding, some areas of the country do not meet federal air quality standards for pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. In 2018, EPA designated 52 areas with approximately 200 counties or partial counties as \"nonattainment\" with respect to the 2015 ozone standard.", "Members of Congress representing both downwind and upwind states may have an interest in how EPA and states implement the CAA's Good Neighbor provision, particularly as states begin to develop plans for nonattainment areas to come into compliance with the 2015 ozone standards. Some downwind states with nonattainment areas have attributed their ozone violations\u2014at least in part\u2014to emission sources from upwind states. Downwind states have also expressed concerns that transported air pollution contributes to harmful human health impacts and adversely affects economic growth. For example, a Maryland state agency reported that transport of emissions from upwind states has required Maryland's sources to compensate with \"deeper in-state emissions reductions,\" thereby adding economic costs to the state's business community. Upwind states have disagreed with the approach used by EPA to determine whether emissions from upwind sources contribute to downwind air quality problems. For instance, Ohio's state environmental agency described EPA's transport approach as \"deeply flawed,\" concluding that it would place \"an unfair amount of responsibility\" on upwind power plants to reduce emissions. ", "To assist Members and staff in understanding interstate transport issues, this report presents background information about the CAA's interstate transport provision, provides a brief history of regional programs leading up to CSAPR, discusses key aspects of the CSAPR program and program results, summarizes the status of Good Neighbor determinations with respect to ozone standards, and concludes with issues for congressional consideration. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The CAA requires EPA to establish national standards for air pollutants that meet the criteria in Section 108(a)(1). These pollutants\u2014the \"criteria pollutants\"\u2014are those that EPA has determined \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare\" and whose presence in \"ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" EPA must design two types of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the criteria pollutants. Primary NAAQS must protect public health with an \"adequate margin of safety,\" and secondary NAAQS must \"protect public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects.\" The NAAQS are concentration standards measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume, parts per billion (ppb) by volume, and micrograms per cubic meter of air (\u00b5g/m 3 ). The NAAQS do not set direct limits on emissions but rather define what EPA considers to be clean air for the pollutant in question. ", "Section 109(d) of the act requires periodic NAAQS reviews. Every five years, EPA must review the NAAQS and the science upon which the NAAQS are based and then revise the NAAQS if necessary. This multi-step process is rarely completed within the five-year review cycle and is often the subject of litigation that results in court-ordered deadlines for completion of NAAQS reviews. Since January 1997, EPA has completed at least one review for each of the six criteria pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide), with standards being made more stringent for five of the six. Most of the revisions finalized in this time period were for the ozone and particulate matter standards. ", "The CAA assigns responsibility to states to establish procedures to attain and maintain the NAAQS within their borders. In particular, the act requires each state to submit a new or revised state implementation plan (SIP) to EPA within three years of a NAAQS promulgation or revision. This SIP submission, also known as an \"infrastructure SIP,\" outlines how the state will implement, maintain, and enforce the NAAQS . The infrastructure SIP allows EPA to \"review the basic structural requirements of [a state's] air quality management program in light of each new or revised NAAQS.\" Examples of the basic structural requirements include enforceable emission limits, an air monitoring program, an enforcement program, air quality modeling capabilities, and \"adequate personnel, resources, and legal authority.\"", "The state's SIP must also address its interstate transport obligations under the CCAA. EPA refers to this section of the SIP submission as the \"Good Neighbor SIP.\" The Good Neighbor SIP must prohibit \"certain emissions of air pollutants because of the impact they would have on air quality in other states.\" Specifically, the state's Good Neighbor SIP must prohibit sources in that state from \"emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will \u2026 contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance\" of a NAAQS in another state. ", "EPA reviews SIPs to ensure they meet statutory requirements. The agency also has authority to require states to revise their SIPs. Furthermore, the act requires EPA, under certain conditions, to impose sanctions and to issue a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if a state fails or declines to submit or implement an adequate SIP. ", "Recognizing ongoing challenges with ozone transport, the 1990 CAA Amendments established regional planning provisions specific to ozone. For example, CAA Section 184 created a multi-state ozone transport region, known as the Ozone Transport Region (OTR), and established the northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) to advise EPA about ozone controls in the OTR. The OTR is comprised of 12 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, certain counties in Northern Virginia) and Washington, DC. The CAA required states in the OTR to impose controls on sources in all specified areas, regardless of attainment status. Such controls included enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs and reasonably available control technology for sources of VOCs.", "In addition, CAA Section 176A allows EPA to establish transport regions to address regional pollution problems contributing to violations of a primary NAAQS. The agency must establish a commission, comprised of EPA and state officials, for each transport region that makes recommendations to EPA on appropriate mitigation strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing the Good Neighbor Provision", "paragraphs": ["The CAA provides two independent statutory authorities to facilitate compliance with the Good Neighbor provision: (1) the SIPs process under Section 110 and (2) a petition process under Section 126(b). While these authorities are separate, they each address the same objective\u2014that is, the Good Neighbor provision in Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i). The remainder of this section describes how these authorities may be used to enforce the Good Neighbor provision. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SIPs Process", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, a state's SIP must prohibit sources in that state from \"emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will \u2026 contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance\" of a NAAQS in another state. If EPA finds an existing SIP inadequate, it must require the state to revise the SIP. This procedure is known as a \"SIP call\" and it can be issued to multiple states at the same time. Specifically, EPA must issue a SIP call whenever the agency determines that the SIP is \"substantially inadequate to attain or maintain\" a particular NAAQS, to ensure that the state's sources do not contribute significantly to a downwind state's nonattainment, or if it is otherwise inadequate to meet any CAA requirement. EPA can also issue a SIP call if states do not meet the CAA Section 184 requirements of the OTR. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 126(b) Petitions", "paragraphs": ["Under CAA Section 126(b), any state or political subdivision can petition EPA to issue a \"finding that any major source or group of stationary sources emits or would emit any air pollutant in violation\" of the Good Neighbor provision. Section 126(b) requires EPA to make a decision within 60 days. If EPA grants the petition, the sources identified in the petition must cease operations within three months unless they comply with emission controls and compliance schedules set by EPA. ", "While Section 126(b) and a SIP call each enforce the Good Neighbor provision, they differ in their implementation. First, a state or political subdivision must initiate the 126(b) petition, whereas EPA initiates the SIP call. Second, unlike a SIP call, the 126(b) petition is limited to a \"major source or group of stationary sources\" and cannot be used to address minor or mobile sources. Third, EPA may directly regulate upwind sources when it grants a 126(b) petition, whereas a SIP call results in direct EPA regulation only if EPA issues a FIP in response to a state's failure to respond adequately to the SIP call. ", "EPA's review of 126(b) petitions has sometimes coincided with the agency's SIP call process. For example, in 1998, EPA coordinated its review of eight 126(b) petitions when it promulgated a SIP call. EPA acknowledged the distinction between the CAA authorities for the 126(b) petition process and the SIP call but coordinated the two actions because they were both designed to reduce ozone transport in the eastern United States.", "States have also submitted 126(b) petitions ahead of the deadlines for Good Neighbor SIPs. For example, in 2011, EPA granted a 126(b) petition from New Jersey, finding that a coal-fired generating station in Pennsylvania contributed significantly to nonattainment with the SO 2 NAAQS in New Jersey. Some considered EPA's approval of this petition to reflect a more expansive interpretation of Section 126 in which 126(b) petitions are not necessarily limited to the time frame of Good Neighbor SIP updates. Whereas EPA had previously considered 126(b) petitions several years after revising a NAAQS\u2014and after making attainment and nonattainment designations for revised standards\u2014EPA approved New Jersey's 126(b) petition before Pennsylvania was required to complete its Good Neighbor SIP for the 2010 revision to the SO 2 NAAQS. EPA promulgated an emissions limit for the generating station that would reduce its SO 2 emissions by 81% and set a compliance deadline of three years. In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld EPA's interpretation of Section 126, concluding that the CAA allows EPA to make a Section 126 finding independently of the Section 110 SIP process. ", "States have continued to submit Section 126(b) petitions related to ozone interstate transport. For example, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York have submitted 126(b) petitions related to compliance with the 2008 and/or 2015 ozone NAAQS. As of July 2018, EPA has denied the petition from Connecticut and has proposed to deny petitions from Delaware and Maryland. Among the various reasons for denying Connecticut's petition, EPA found that the petition did not reflect current operations at the named source\u2014a power plant located in Pennsylvania. In particular, EPA stated that the air quality modeling in Connecticut's petition was based on 2011 emissions data and therefore did not account for subsequent NO x reductions, noting that the named source \"primarily burned natural gas with a low NO x emission rate in the 2017 ozone season.\" In addition, EPA conducted its own analysis using the agency's current multi-step framework for determining what constitutes a significant contribution. The agency's analysis did not identify additional \"highly cost-effective controls available at the source and thus no basis to determine that [the named source] emits or would emit in violation of the good neighbor provision with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS.\" While EPA \"expects the facility to continue operating primarily by burning natural gas in future ozone seasons,\" others have expressed concern that there is no \"enforceable requirement prohibiting\" the named source from switching back to coal. ", "Similarly, in June 2018, EPA proposed to deny petitions from Delaware and Maryland, in part because EPA found \"several elements of the states' analyses \u2026 insufficient to support the states' conclusions.\" For example, EPA said that Delaware's petitions did \"not provide any analysis indicating that Delaware may be violating or have difficulty maintaining the 2008 or 2015 ozone NAAQS in a future year associated with the relevant attainment dates.\" EPA also noted that Delaware used 2011 emissions data, which EPA characterized as \"generally higher than, and therefore not representative of, current and future projected emissions levels at these [named sources] and in the rest of the region.\" Delaware has disagreed with EPA's proposed denial on various grounds. Among other things, Delaware stated that EPA has not \"shown valid modeling or justification that Delaware will attain the 2015 ozone standard by its 2021 Marginal nonattainment deadline.\" In particular, EPA's projections analyzed the year 2023, which is the attainment deadline for areas designated as moderate nonattainment with respect to the 2015 ozone standard. ", "Finally, EPA proposed to deny Maryland's petition, in part because the agency disagreed with Maryland that NO x limits for 36 named sources should be based on the respective units' lowest observed emissions rates. Specifically, Maryland's petition concluded that the 36 named sources were operating pollution controls \"sub-optimally based on a comparison of their lowest observed NO x emissions rates between 2005 and 2008, which Maryland describes as the 'best' observed emissions rates, to emissions rates from the 2015 and 2016 ozone seasons.\" EPA disagreed that the lowest historical NO x emissions rate is representative of \"ongoing achievable NO x rates\" in part because over time, some NO x controls (e.g., selective catalytic reduction [SCR] systems) \"may have some broken-in components and routine maintenance schedules entailing replacement of individual components.\" EPA stated that in a 2016 rulemaking addressing regional ozone transport, the agency determined that the \"third lowest fleetwide average coal-fired [power plant] NO x rate\" for power plants using SCR to be \"most representative of ongoing, achievable emission rates.\" Maryland has disagreed with EPA's proposed denial, noting that it will \"testify in opposition to the proposal and use all available tools, including litigation.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interpreting \"Significant Contribution\"", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement of the CAA's interstate transport provisions hinges on a key test in Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)\u2014whether one state \"significantly contributes\" to a violation of the NAAQS in another state. The CAA does not, however, define what constitutes a significant contribution. Instead, this phrase has been interpreted through EPA rulemakings addressing interstate air pollution. The agency's interpretation has been contentious at times, given that it \"inherently involves a decision on how much emissions control responsibility should be assigned to upwind states, and how much responsibility should be left to downwind states.\" Stakeholders have challenged the legality of EPA's interpretations over the years.", "The regulatory actions and litigation have led to EPA's establishment of the current framework to address the Good Neighbor provision for ozone and particulate matter. The framework establishes a screening threshold\u2014interstate pollution that exceeds 1% of the NAAQS\u2014to identify states with sources that may contribute significantly to air quality problems in downwind states. Upwind states that exceed this threshold for interstate pollution are evaluated further\u2014considering cost and air quality factors\u2014to determine whether emission reductions are needed. EPA has clarified that it generally uses this framework to determine what constitutes a significant contribution when evaluating Good Neighbor SIPs and when evaluating a 126(b) petition. See \" Framework to Assess Good Neighbor Provision \" for detailed discussion of the framework."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Programs Addressing Interstate Pollution", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to the CAA, EPA and states have implemented various market-based programs that target regional emissions of SO 2 and NO x from power plants. One type of market-based program, known as emissions trading, sets a limit (or \"cap\") on total emissions within a defined geographic area or economic sector and requires covered entities to surrender an allowance for each unit\u2014typically a ton\u2014of emissions. Such programs are also known as \"cap-and-trade.\" ", "Under an emissions cap, covered entities with relatively low emission-reduction costs have a financial incentive to reduce emissions because they can sell unused allowances to entities that face higher costs to reduce their facility emissions. The requirements vary by each program. For example, policymakers may decide to distribute the emission allowances to covered entities at no cost (based on, for example, previous years' emissions), sell the allowances (e.g., through an auction), or use some combination of these strategies. In addition, some programs may permit covered entities to \"bank\" or save surplus allowances for future use while others may not.", "The remainder of this section presents a brief history of the interstate transport programs implemented prior to 2015, given their cumulative impact on regional emission reductions.

Specifically, the ARP targets SO 2 emissions through cap-and-trade and addressed NO x emissions through an emissions-rate-based program. Since its inception over two decades ago, the ARP has achieved notable reductions in these regional pollutants at lower-than-predicted costs. The market-based program also served as the basis for subsequent programs addressing interstate pollution. ", "Under Title IV of the CAA, EPA implemented the ARP in two phases. The first phase\u20141995 to 1999\u2014included 110 high-emitting coal-fired power plants, which had been identified in the statute and spanned 21 eastern and midwestern states. The second phase began in 2000 and included more coal-fired power plants as well as those firing oil and natural gas, accounting for nearly all fossil-fueled power plants in the lower 48 states. EPA set the annual SO 2 emissions cap at 9.97 million allowances in 2000 and decreased it in subsequent years. The ARP remains in effect today. The annual SO 2 cap\u20148.95 million tons of SO 2 per year\u2014has not changed since 2010. The annual cap is roughly half of the SO 2 emitted by the power sector in 1980. ", "EPA distributed SO 2 allowances based on statutory formulas and accounted for historical emission rates and fuel consumption. The \"existing\" power plant units\u2014those in operation prior to November 15, 1990\u2014received allowances for free. The \"new\" power plant units\u2014those commencing operations after November 15, 1990\u2014generally did not receive free allowances and had to purchase them on the market. At the end of each year, covered power plants have to surrender one allowance for each ton of SO 2 emitted. Unused allowances can either be sold or banked for use in later years. The market value of unused allowances, therefore, serves as an incentive for power plants to \"reduce emissions at the lowest cost.\" ", "The NO x portion of the ARP does not involve cap-and-trade but follows a more traditional regulatory approach. It is implemented through boiler-specific NO x emission rates. This program has provided power plants with some compliance flexibility, for example, by allowing the use of emissions rate averaging plans for units under common control, provided they meet certain conditions. According to one analysis of the ARP, the NO x portion \"helped demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of NO x controls,\" and by 2000, it \"encouraged the installation of advanced NO x combustion controls, such as low-NO x burners, and the development of new power plant designs with lower NO x emission rates.\" ", "While the ARP reduced SO 2 and NO x emissions from the power sector, additional reductions were needed to meet ambient air quality standards under the CAA and to address the statute's Good Neighbor provision.

EPA established the NBP under the NO x SIP Call, which required a number of eastern and midwestern states, plus the District of Columbia, to revise their SIPs to address regional ozone transport. The NO x SIP Call set a NO x ozone season budget for each state and required upwind states to adopt SIPs that would reduce NO x emissions to a level that would meet the budgets.", "In the NO x SIP Call, EPA observed that \"virtually every nonattainment problem is caused by numerous sources over a wide geographic area,\" leading the agency to conclude that \"the solution to the problem is the implementation over a wide area of controls on many sources, each of which may have a small or unmeasurable ambient impact by itself.\" Ultimately, EPA expected that this would \"eliminat[e] the emissions that significantly contribute to nonattainment or interference with maintenance of the ozone NAAQS in downwind states.\" ", "EPA based the NOx SIP Call in part on recommendations from the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), a group created by EPA and the 37 easternmost states.

Under the NO x SIP Call, states could require their sources to comply with the emissions budget or participate in a regional cap-and-trade program.

The agency noted that emissions vary year-to-year due to variables such as weather, electricity demand, and fuel costs. For example, EPA attributed the NO x reductions between 2007 and 2008 primarily to lower electricity demand. However, analysis of the entire NBP period\u20142003 to 2008\u2014shows a reduction in ozone season NO x emissions despite a slight increase in demand for electricity. EPA reported that the average NO x emission rate for the 10 highest electricity demand days (i.e., hot days when use of air conditioning is high) decreased in each year of the NBP.

EPA reported that the average SO 2 emissions rate for units subject to either the CSAPR or ARP decreased 81% compared to 2005 rates. Most of the reductions were from coal-fired units.

EIA reported a 73% reduction in national power sector SO 2 emissions from 2006 to 2015, which it described as \"much larger\" than the 32% reduction in coal-fired generation in that same period. EIA attributed the national SO 2 reductions to (1) changes in the electricity generation mix (e.g., less coal-fired generation and more natural-gas-fired generation), (2) the installation of pollution control technologies at coal- and oil-fired plants (in particular, to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics rule), and (3) lower use of the most-polluting power plants (e.g., retirements of coal-fired units). Another EIA analysis reported that the eastern region of the United States\u2014which includes all of the CSAPR states except Texas\u2014had the largest share of capacity retirements between 2008 and 2017 compared to the rest of the continental United States.

Power sector compliance strategies (e.g., use of installed control technologies, switching to lower emitting fuels, or retiring higher emitting units) are also relevant to ozone season allowance prices.

One brokerage firm reported that by May 2018\u2014the start of the 2018 ozone season\u2014NO x allowance prices ranged from $150 to $175 per ton, suggesting that the availability of allowance prices at such low prices \"could lead to some decisions not to run some pollution controls at maximum output. This would, in turn, lead to higher emissions.\" ", "The brokerage firm reported the marginal cost of ozone season NO x reductions to be about $300 per ton, though EPA considered higher marginal costs to develop the CSPAR Update emission budgets. Specifically, EPA considered several cost thresholds\u2014ranging from $800 per ton to $6,400 per ton\u2014and based the CSAPR Update emission budgets on reductions that could be achieved at $1,400 per ton. EPA concluded that a $1,400 per ton threshold would maximize the incremental benefits\u2014the emission reductions and corresponding downwind air quality improvements\u2014compared to other marginal cost thresholds.
