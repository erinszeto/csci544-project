The final level of appropriations ultimately available to EPA and other federal departments and agencies in FY2013 includes the application of an across-the-board rescission required by P.L. 113-6 and the executive branch calculations of the automatic spending reductions triggered by sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240). Section 1113 of P.L. 113-6 required federal departments and agencies funded in Division F of the law to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to identify the allocations of FY2013 enacted funding by program, project, or activity within each statutory appropriations account, including the application of rescissions and sequestration, within 30 days of enactment.", "In its FY2013 Operating Plan submitted to the committees on May 7, 2013, EPA reported a total enacted FY2013 post-sequestration funding level of $7.90 billion, $443.4 million (5.3%) less than the President's FY2013 request and $548.3 million (6.5%) below the FY2012 enacted level. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2), provided another $577.3 million (post-sequestration) to EPA in FY2013 for water infrastructure, cleanup, and other recovery efforts in areas of states affected by Hurricane Sandy, for a combined agency total of $8.48 billion.", "Prior to the enactment of P.L. 113-6, EPA and other federal departments and agencies had operated under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175, H.J.Res. 117), enacted September 28, 2012, in the 112th Congress. With a few exceptions, P.L. 112-175 generally had provided FY2013 appropriations for EPA and most other federal departments and agencies apportioned at 0.612% above the FY2012 enacted levels. Although not enacted, Title II of H.R. 6091, the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013, as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations on July 10, 2012, had included $7.06 billion for EPA for FY2013.

EPA reported an additional $577.3 million (post-sequestration) in supplemental funding for the agency, increasing the total FY2013 enacted discretionary appropriations for EPA to $8.48 billion.

This latter category of funding constitutes a very small portion of EPA's annual funding. The vast majority of the agency's annual funding consists of discretionary appropriations.

The BCA also tasked a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan for Congress and the President to enact by January 15, 2012. Because deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by that date, an automatic spending reduction process established by the BCA was triggered. This process consists of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, initially scheduled to begin on January 2, 2013. The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding at a percentage to be determined, under terms specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended by the BCA.", "The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ), enacted on January 2, 2013, made a number of significant changes to the procedures in the BCA that took place in FY2013. First, the date for the joint committee sequester to be implemented was delayed until March 1, 2013. Second, the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion. Third, statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 (and FY2014) were lowered.", "Pursuant to the BCA, as amended by the ATRA, President Obama ordered that the joint committee sequester be implemented on March 1, 2013. The accompanying OMB report estimated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in FY2013 from each account containing non-exempt funds. The sequestration was to be applied at the program, project, and activity (PPA) level within each account. Because the sequestration was implemented at the time that a temporary continuing resolution was in force, the calculations required to determine the amount of the reduction were based on the annualized level of the part-year appropriations provided by the FY2013 Continuing Resolution ( P.L. 112-175 ). Therefore, the effect of these reductions on the discretionary budgetary resources available to EPA and other federal departments and agencies at the account and PPA level was dependent on the amounts provided for the full year, as subsequently specified in P.L. 113-16 .
