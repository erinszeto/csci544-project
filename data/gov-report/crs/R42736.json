In addition, several smaller programs aid the U.S. dairy sector with market promotion, research, price reporting, risk management, and disaster assistance.", "In recent years, dairy producers have argued that a simple price-based system fails to reflect the sharp increases in milk production costs (particularly for corn used as feed) that have occurred since the mid-2000s. In response to producer concerns and to the volatile dairy price and margin developments of the past decade, both the Senate-passed (S. 954) and the House-passed (H.R. 2642) 2013 farm bills propose restructuring the traditional set of dairy programs by replacing DPPSP, MILC, and DEIP with a new income support program\u2014a dairy margin insurance program\u2014based on the monthly difference (i.e., the margin) between the national average farm all-milk price and a formula-derived estimate of feed costs. In addition, the Senate bill (unlike the House bill) includes a second program linked directly to margin insurance\u2014the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP)\u2014which, under certain conditions, would reduce payments to participating producers for their milk marketings, when the margin falls below proposed statutory thresholds, as an incentive to restrain growth in milk marketings during periods of low margins.", "The House bill (unlike the Senate bill) also proposes to repeal permanent farm law (based on 1938 and 1949 legislation) and replace it with many of the farm programs in the current bill including the dairy margin insurance program.

The program is countercyclical, in that government purchases occur when product prices are low, and cease as product prices rise above support levels. Also, when purchases exceed certain statutory levels, USDA is required to make temporary price adjustments (reductions) to avoid the accumulation of excess government inventories. The DPPSP expires December 31, 2013, and would be eliminated and replaced with new policy under both the Senate- and House-passed farm bills. ", "Since the mid-1990s, the annual farm price of milk has trended higher, albeit subject to an increasingly volatile pattern ( Figure 1 ), whereas the federal support rate has been flat at $9.90 per cwt. Volatile milk prices have made planning more difficult and have made dairy producers more vulnerable to unexpected or sustained increases in the cost of feed (the major cost component of dairy production). Analysts at the Dairy Policy Analysis Alliance (DPAA) have noted:", "The ability of price supports to maintain an effective price floor diminished as the support price was lowered and as dairy product manufacturers became increasingly reluctant to sell product to the government. In some cases, price supports have impeded U.S. dairy exports, distorted domestic markets, and constrained dairy product innovation.", "Milk producers have argued since the early 1990s that support levels have become too low, relative to market prices and costs of production, to provide meaningful support. More recently, milk producers contend that support based strictly on the price of milk fails to account for the sharp escalation of feed costs that has occurred since 2006 ( Figure 2 ).", "Since the emergence of the U.S. ethanol industry as a major source of corn demand in 2006, U.S. feed grain markets have surged to new price levels that are two to three times above the levels that persisted during the previous four decades. Rising feed costs are of particular concern to dairy producers because they represent a substantial portion of the cost of milk production\u2014in 2011, feed costs accounted for 80% of operating costs and 54% of total costs of milk production (compared with 71% and 37% shares during the 2000-2004 period)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program", "paragraphs": ["First established by the 2002 farm bill and reauthorized in 2008, MILC provides farm income support by giving participating dairy farmers nationwide a government payment whenever the farm price of milk used for fluid consumption (Class I) falls below a target price (adjusted for feed costs) for Class I farm milk sold to processors in the Boston market ( Figure 3 ).

Thus, the per unit payment rate would rise with rising feed costs. MILC payments were made on the first 2.985 million lbs. of annual milk production per farm (equivalent to annual production from about 150 dairy cows). The MILC production limitation effectively limited MILC protection to about 30% of U.S. milk production. As a result of this payment limitation, the MILC program has not been popular among large dairy producers and has generated strong opposition from regions with predominantly larger herds. ", "Most MILC payments occurred during the 2002 farm bill period (FY2002-FY2007) due to sustained low milk prices. In 2004, milk prices rose briefly, temporarily ending MILC payments, before restarting again in 2006. In 2007, milk prices rose sharply as part of a widespread commodity boom that lasted through most of 2008. In 2009 the U.S. dairy industry was especially hard hit by a combination of low milk prices and high feed costs that put exceptional financial pressure on many dairy producers and generated large MILC payments ( Table 7 ). Milk prices recovered through 2010, but by early 2012, the incorporation of feed-cost adjustments driven by high corn prices pushed the MILC-adjusted price trigger above the price of Boston Class I milk, once again triggering MILC payments.

Ten FMMOs are currently in operation today, down from a peak of 83 in 1962. Nine states have their own separate internal marketing orders that are state-regulated. FMMOs are designed to provide both price support and market stability for dairy producers. Producers delivering milk to FMMOs are affected by two fundamental FMMO provisions: classified pricing of milk according to end use, and pooling of receipts to pay all farmers within an FMMO a blended or weighted-average price. ", "Within each FMMO, dairy processors or handlers (i.e., milk buyers) are required to pay a minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use\u2014for fluid consumption (Class I) or for manufactured products such as yogurt, ice cream, and sour cream (Class II), cheese and whey (Class III), and butter and powdered milk (Class IV). This is referred to as \"classified pricing.\" ", "An end-product price formula uses the wholesale prices of storable dairy products (butter, cheddar cheese, whey, and powdered milk) to calculate the value of milk components\u2014protein, butterfat, non-fat solids, and other solids. Another formula adjusts for processing costs (referred to as the make allowance) and for the yield of milk components in the end products. Finally, a constructed price for fluid milk (Class I) is derived that varies by zone. Within each FMMO, the value of all milk sales are \"pooled\" to generate a uniform average price\u2014the blend price\u2014paid to all dairy farmers that deliver milk within that FMMO. The farm price of approximately two-thirds of U.S. milk production is regulated under FMMOs. State marketing orders account for approximately another 20% of milk production, such that very little milk in the United States escapes classified pricing and pooling, and there is substantial room for federal orders to expand if states elect to give up their control.", "FMMOs are permanently authorized, and are therefore not subject to reauthorization in periodic omnibus farm bills. FMMOs are established and amended through a formal public hearing process that allows interested parties to present evidence regarding marketing and economic conditions in support of or in opposition to instituting or amending an order. Most changes are made administratively by USDA through the rulemaking process and approved by farmers in a referendum, although other legislation can address issues related to the FMMO system. ", "The Senate-passed S. 954 would require USDA to use a specified pre-hearing procedure to consider alternative formulas for Class III milk product pricing (Sec. 1462), and to analyze and report to Congress the potential effects of replacing the use of end-product price formulas with other pricing alternatives (Sec. 1481). In addition, S. 954 (Sec. 1476) would provide an option for the Federal Milk Marketing Order Review Commission\u2014established by the 2008 farm bill (Sec.\u00a01509) to conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of FMMO and non-FMMO systems\u2014to obtain funding from sources other than annual appropriations.

In contrast, H.R. 2642 does not include DMSP or any payment reductions or supply restrictions in response to low margins or in association with receipt of margin insurance payments. 2. Margin insurance under S. 954 includes two sequential programs: a catastrophic margin insurance, BMP, which provides protection at $4.00/cwt. and requires an annual registration fee; and additional elective buy-up coverage, SMP, which offers coverage in $0.50/cwt. increments from $4.50/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. 3. H.R. 2642 folds the two margin insurance programs of S. 954 \u2014BMP and SMP\u2014into a single margin protection program with no annual registration fee. H.R. 2642 uses an almost identical premium rate structure as S. 954 ( Table 3 ), but with: a. $4.00/cwt. margin protection free on the first 4 million lbs. of annual milk marketing; b. slightly higher premiums at $4.00/cwt. to $5.00/cwt. margin protection for milk marketings in excess of 4 million lbs.; and c. sharply lower premiums at $7.00/cwt. margin protection for all milk marketings (i.e., less than and greater than 4 million lbs.). 4. As a result of their different premium structure, S. 954 tends to favor participation at a $6.50/cwt. margin protection level; whereas H.R. 2642 favors participation at a $7.00/cwt. margin protection level. 5. S. 954 requires USDA to use NASS full-month, all-milk price estimates in calculating margins, thus prohibiting the use of preliminary NASS price estimates, which are available a month in advance of the full-month price estimate and which would expedite margin payments. H.R. 2642 is silent on this instruction. 6. H.R. 2642 allows for annual updating of the production history base for each year of the farm bill (i.e., brings annual production growth under the program). S. 954 fixes the BMP base for the life of the farm bill, but allows the SMP production base to be updated each year. 7. S. 954 offers BMP margin payments on 80% of the BMP fixed production history, and on a participant election of from 25% to 90% of the SMP production history base. H.R. 2642 contracts the coverage percent election to a range of 25% to 80% of the production history base. 8. H.R. 2642 places no limit or cap on the size of the potential per-unit payment rate (defined as the difference between the all-milk price and the formula-defined feed-cost ration). In contrast, S. 954 excludes the potential for a negative margin in instances where the feed-cost ration exceeds the all-milk price. 9. Under S. 954 a dairy operation may only participate in DPMPP or the existing Livestock Gross Margin (LGM) dairy program, but not both. H.R. 2642 is silent regarding participation in both DPMPP and LGM. 10. H.R. 2642 ends the MILC program immediately, whereas S. 954 extends it for about nine months (through June 30, 2013), while a dairy producer is deliberating whether to participate in DPMPP or not\u2014once a DPMPP participation decision is made, MILC is no longer an option for a producer. 11. H.R. 2642 requires that USDA announce the establishment and retroactive availability of a DPMPP program within 30 days of the next farm bill being signed into law. S. 954 has no retroactive option, but requires that USDA establish and implement a DPMPP program within 120 days of being signed into law. 12. S. 954 mandates a USDA study of the impact of DMSP program on the economic impact throughout the dairy product value chain, and on the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry in international markets. H.R. 2642 has no similar provision. 13. S. 954 exempts DPMPP and DMSP from standard rulemaking procedures. H.R. 2642 , via an amendment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee, removes this exemption and requires USDA to determine the market impacts of the new program during the rulemaking process. 14. Unrelated to the newly proposed programs, H.R. 2642 makes no changes to Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs). In contrast, S. 954 mandates a pre-hearing procedure to consider alternative formulas for Class III milk product pricing, and mandates a study of the effects of replacing end-use milk pricing with other alternatives. 15.

It is assumed that this latter cost estimate is representative of the dairy proposal in the House-passed H.R. 2642 .", "According to CBO, replacing current dairy policy with the new dairy proposals of the House and Senate would result in projected additional budgetary outlays above baseline over the 5-year (FY2014-FY2018) and 10-year (FY2014-FY2023) periods of: ", "$28 million and $302 million, respectively, under S. 954 , $44 million and $436 million, respectively, under H.R. 1947 (as reported by the House Agriculture Committee), and $23 million and $421 million, respectively, under a version of H.R. 1947 as amended by the proposed Goodlatte-Scott amendment ( H.Amdt. 228 to H.R. 1947 ) without the supply restrictions proposed under DMSP of S. 954 . ", "A CBO score of the program details of Title I in House-passed H.R. 2642 was not yet available as of the date of this report. Instead, the CBO score of the dairy proposal for H.R. 1947 inclusive of the Goodlatte-Scott amendment, which eliminates DMSP, is cited above and in Table 7 .", "Appendix A. Debate Over the Market Stabilization Proposal", "What Is DMSP's Intended Purpose?", "The DMSP market stabilization proposal is being debated by dairy producer groups, which generally support it, and dairy processors and certain consumer groups who oppose it. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the largest U.S. dairy producer organization, is a principal proponent of the dairy market stabilization concept. NMPF describes the purpose and need for DMSP as follows: ", "What is the purpose of the DMSP? The purpose of the DMSP is to reduce margin volatility for dairy producers. The DMSP acts as an early warning system that sends strong and timely signals to producers participating in the margin protection program that small temporary adjustments in their milk production need to be made to stave off long-term reductions in their overall margins. The DMSP is designed to act swiftly and infrequently to address brief market imbalances.", "Why is any type of supply management needed in the U.S. dairy industry? The DMSP does not fit the traditional definition of a supply management program. However, market stabilization is part of this proposal because there are times when imbalances occur in the marketplace that negatively impact dairy farmer margins. In 2009, dairy farmers did not overproduce their way into extremely low margins, but demand, both domestically and internationally, collapsed with the global recession. The low milk prices combined with high feed costs resulted in the lowest margins most producers have ever experienced. Situations like this ultimately correct themselves, but without timely and effective intervention, they can drag on too long and drag down too many farmers along the way.", "Alternate Viewpoints", "The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), representing the nation's dairy manufacturing and marketing industries and their suppliers, is a principal opponent of the dairy market stabilization program. IDFA argues: \"A new government \"Dairy Stabilization\" program would routinely increase our domestic prices above international prices and make our dairy industry less competitive.... Government supply management programs thwart export growth. That's why no other U.S. commodity has limits on production.\" ", "During the House Agriculture Committee markup of H.R. 1947 in the 112 th Congress, Representatives Goodlatte and Scott first introduced their amendment (No. 085) to remove the market stabilization program from the dairy subtitle D while retaining the dairy producer margin protection program. In a \"Dear Colleague\" letter dated July 10, 2012, they argued:", "A government supply management program arbitrarily penalizes consumers and dairy product manufacturers who respond to consumer demands, by uniformly requiring milk supply contraction and raising milk prices above not [sic] market clearing levels. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program, which our amendment eliminates, is the only U.S. commodity program that would allow this level of government market intervention in domestic commodity supply decisions.", "A major concern expressed by urban constituencies in regard to domestic milk supplies is that a \"supply management\" program would potentially both limit the volume of milk supply available to consumers and raise the price for the milk that is available.", "Appendix B. Historical Dairy Supply Management Programs", "The goal of dairy supply management programs is generally to enhance and stabilize farm-level milk prices by controlling the amount of milk marketed or to mitigate the increased production that would be stimulated by policy that supports diary product markets at a higher-than-market-equilibrium price. Unlike Canada and the European Union (EU), the United States has never implemented a mandatory dairy supply management program; however, the 1990 farm bill had a requirement that USDA implement a supply management program if federal dairy product purchases exceeded 7\u00a0billion lbs.\u2014this requirement was never implemented. Since the mid-1980s there have been two government-sponsored and one industry-sponsored major voluntary supply management dairy programs in the United States, all funded in part through dairy farmer assessments.", "U.S. Government-Sponsored, Voluntary Supply Management\u00a0Programs", "In the mid-1980s Congress authorized two voluntary dairy supply management programs\u2014the 1984-85 Milk Diversion Program and the 1987 Dairy Termination Program (Whole Herd Buyout) . Under the Milk Diversion Program, dairy farmers who reduced milk marketings 5% to 30% from a base level were paid $10/cwt. on the reduced marketings. The Milk Diversion Program cut milk production sharply in 1985, but had no long-term effect. Under the 1987 Dairy Termination Program, the government accepted bids from dairy farmers who were willing to slaughter all their dairy cattle and remain out of the dairy business for at least five years. The Whole Herd Buyout Program was more successful in moderating milk production trends, but the induced slaughter of dairy cows negatively affected beef markets. ", "Novakovic and Stephenson have pointed out that, in contrast to the Milk Diversion Program and Dairy Termination Program, which rewarded farmers for cutting back on milk production, the DMSP program punishes farmers for increasing milk marketings relative to a base.", "U.S. Industry-Sponsored Supply Management Programs", "An industry-sponsored voluntary supply management program\u2014 Cooperatives Working Together (CWT) \u2014was initiated in 2003 by the National Milk Producers Federation and remains ongoing. Participating dairy farmers commit 2\u00a2 per cwt. of milk marketed. Presently, participants in CWT include dairy farmers from every state, producing almost 70% of the nation's milk. CWT funds have been used for both herd retirement (the last round was conducted in 2010) and export assistance.", "Foreign Government-Sponsored Mandatory Supply Management\u00a0Programs", "Canada and the EU have used marketing quotas which explicitly specify the maximum amount of milk that individual dairy farmers can sell and usually apply stiff economic penalties to any sales in excess of the assigned farm quota. The EU will gradually increase its dairy quotas until an entire phase-out of its milk quota system in April 2015 in accordance with implementation of its 2009 Health Check. Canada continues to maintain its milk quota system.", "Potential Problems Associated With Supply Management Programs ", "Potential problems associated with voluntary supply management programs are adequate participation and funding (which is linked directly to participation), free riders (i.e., nonparticipants benefit fully from the success of any supply management program but without the supply limits), and some export market issues. Since CWT dairy product export support varies with market conditions, exports under this program may not be viewed as a reliable source by less price sensitive markets. In addition, there is some uncertainty about whether CWT export subsidies are compatible with World Trade Organization obligations."], "subsections": []}]}}
