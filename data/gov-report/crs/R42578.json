The failure of Congress and the President to enact deficit reduction legislation by that date triggered an automatic spending reduction process established by the BCA, consisting of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps that were scheduled to begin on January 2, 2013. However, prior to that date, Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA, P.L. 112-240 ), which made several substantive changes to the BCA, including a delay of the scheduled BCA sequester until March 1, 2013, and a reduction of the total amount scheduled to be sequestered.

The majority of DOT's budget was exempted from sequestration per Section 255 of P.L. 99-177 as amended, so the overall reduction in DOT funding was closer to 2%, though because of the exclusions the impact was uneven, with affected accounts being reduced by 5%. Nearly all of HUD's budget is non-exempt discretionary funding, and thus was subject to a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013.

This included a proposed restructuring of some surface transportation programs with overall funding roughly at the level provided in FY2012, plus a $50 billion supplemental appropriation requested for FY2012 to provide an immediate boost to transportation infrastructure improvement and job creation. This up-front additional funding was described as an alternative to the typical surface transportation reauthorization funding plan, in which funding levels gradually increase over an authorization period of several years. This proposal would have front-loaded a large increase in funding in the first year of the Administration's proposed six-year surface transportation reauthorization plan. The Administration had made a similar proposal in its FY2012 budget request\u2014restructuring the DOT surface transportation program structure, and requesting an additional $50 billion in up-front funding\u2014which Congress did not support.

For several years, expenditures from the fund have exceeded revenues; for example, in FY2010, revenues were approximately $35 billion, while authorized expenditures were approximately $50 billion. Congress transferred a total of $34.5 billion from the general fund of the Treasury to the highway trust fund during the period FY2008-FY2010 to keep the trust fund solvent. In January 2012 the Congressional Budget Office projected that the trust fund would become insolvent around the end of FY2013, given current revenue and expenditure levels. The MAP-21 legislation enacted in 2012 authorized additional transfers from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund to keep the fund solvent through FY2014.", "One reason for the shortfall in funding in the highway trust fund is that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, while improved fuel efficiency and inflation have reduced the amount of fuel consumed and the value of the tax revenues. The tax is a fixed amount assessed per gallon of fuel sold, not a percentage of the cost of the fuel sold. That means that whether a gallon of gas costs $1 or $4, the highway trust fund receives the same amount from each gallon sold (18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline, 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel). Meanwhile, the capacity of the federal gas tax to support transportation infrastructure has been diminished by inflation (which has reduced the purchasing power of the revenue raised by the tax) and increasing automobile fuel efficiency (since more efficient vehicles are able to travel farther on a gallon of fuel, increasing efficiency reduces the amount of tax generated by each mile of vehicle travel). The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that gasoline consumption will be relatively flat during the period 2013 to 2022, as continued increases in the fuel efficiency of the U.S. passenger fleet will offset increases in the number of miles people will drive. It forecasts highway trust fund revenues of $41 billion in FY2022, well short of even the current annual level of authorized expenditures from the fund.", "A host of reports produced by the Department of Transportation, congressionally created commissions, and nongovernmental groups generally assert that the nation is not spending enough to maintain its existing transportation infrastructure, let alone to make desired improvements. These reports call for considerably higher levels of spending on transportation infrastructure, by both the federal government and the states.", "A dilemma faced by Congress is how to provide the additional funding needed to maintain the current level of transportation infrastructure spending, let alone to support significant increases in that funding. While raising the federal gas tax is seen as the simplest and most efficient way to provide significantly increased funding for transportation infrastructure in the near future, there appears to be little support in Congress or in the Administration for raising the gas tax during the current period of economic difficulty. Even if there were support for higher gas taxes, increases in vehicle fuel efficiency resulting from previously enacted legislation and greater use of electric vehicles are likely to constrain motor fuel consumption, leaving in question the longer-term viability of motor fuel taxes as the principal source of surface transportation funding.", "As it did last year, the President's FY2013 budget proposed to change the name of the highway trust fund to the transportation trust fund and to increase authorized expenditures from the fund to a total of $476 billion over the next six years. This money would have gone to increasing the funding levels of existing surface transportation programs, and the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts transit construction program would have been added to the programs financed by the fund. This proposal reflected, in part, a recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to expand the highway trust fund to cover rail infrastructure\u2014but the commission also recommended increasing the gas tax by 15 cents per gallon by 2015, and thereafter limiting expenditures from the fund to match its revenues.

Supporters contend that subsidizing air service to smaller communities promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics of the program note that the subsidy cost per passenger is relatively high, that many of the communities in the program have very few residents flying out of their airports, and that some of the airports receiving EAS subsidies are little more than an hour's drive from major airports.", "The Administration requested $114 million for the EAS program. This appeared to be a cut from the FY2012 enacted figure of $143 million, but in fact the Administration's request represented an increase over the FY2012 figure.

Thus, the total funding provided for the EAS program in FY2012 was $193 million (the $143 million appropriation added to the $50 million mandatory funding). The Administration's FY2013 request proposed to increase the mandatory funding from $50 million to $100 million; added to the $114 million discretionary funding requested, that would have provided a total of $214 million for the EAS program. This would have been an 11% ($21 million) increase over FY2012.", "Both the House-passed bill and the Senate Committee on Appropriations' bill supported the Administration request.

They contend that, by providing a lower share of federal funding (and thus requiring a higher share of local funding), this provision tilts the playing field toward highway projects when communities are considering how to address transportation problems. Advocates of this provision note that the demand for New Starts funding greatly exceeds the amount that is available, so requiring a higher local match allows FTA to support more projects with the available funding. They also assert that requiring a higher local match likely encourages communities to scrutinize the costs and benefits of major proposed transit projects more closely."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Title II: Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [" Table 6 presents an account-by-account summary of FY2013 appropriations for HUD compared to FY2012."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Budget Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF)", "paragraphs": ["FHA's single-family mortgage insurance program is intended to be self-financing.

The budget estimated that this money would be needed to make a required transfer of funds from the MMIF's secondary reserve account to its primary reserve account, in order to account for an increase in the estimated future losses expected to occur over the life of the loans insured by FHA. The anticipated need for these funds did not mean that FHA was currently out of money; at the time, FHA had about $33 billion in reserves that it could use to pay claims, and those funds would have had to be exhausted before any additional funds from Treasury would have been spent. Rather, the budget included these funds because it was estimated that the funds that FHA had on hand would not be enough to cover all of its expected future losses on insured loans. Any funds drawn from Treasury would have been held in reserve to pay for these expected future losses.

Different totals may be published by the committees in their tables and press releases, reported in the press or by advocates, and even presented in this report, all of which may be correct. This is possible because the THUD appropriations bill includes different types of funding mechanisms and savings mechanisms, which can result in different figures being reported for the same programs, depending on how the numbers are being presented. The following section of this report explains the different types of funding often included in the THUD appropriations bill.", "Most of the programs and activities in the THUD bill are funded through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. This is the amount of new funding allocated each year by the appropriations committees. Appropriations are drawn from the resources of the general fund of the Treasury. For some accounts, the appropriations committees provide advance appropriations , or regular appropriations that are not available until the next fiscal year.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters. These funds are sometimes provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular annual appropriations. Although emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund, they may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency.", "In addition to appropriations, much of the Department of Transportation's budget is derived from contract authority . Contract authority is a form of budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, in contrast to \"regular\" (or discretionary) budget authority, which is based on the resources of the general fund of the Treasury. Contract authority for DOT is generally derived from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriation act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of providing regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees collected by federal agencies.", "When the Appropriations Committee subcommittees are given their \"302(b) allocations\"\u2014that is, when the total amount that the Appropriations Committee has to spend for a fiscal year is divided among the subcommittees\u2014that figure includes only net discretionary budget authority (non-emergency appropriations, less any offsets and rescissions); contract authority from trust funds is not included. This can lead to confusion, as the annual discretionary budget authority allocations for THUD are typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of contract authority, or offset in some way.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which was enacted into law ( P.L. 112-25 ) on August 2, 2011, following negotiations over raising the ceiling on the national debt, established overall limits, or caps, on the amount of total federal discretionary appropriations that can be provided for each of FY2012 through FY2021. Within these annual spending limits, decisions about the actual amount of appropriations for individual programs or agencies will continue to be made through the regular appropriations process. Under the law, these limits are to be enforced through a sequestration process involving the cancellation of budgetary resources (i.e., spending cuts). This means that if the limits are breached, spending for each non-exempt program will be cut by a uniform percentage.", "Allocation Across Agencies", "Once the THUD subcommittees receive their 302(b) allocations, they must decide how to allocate the funds across the different agencies within their jurisdiction. As shown in Figure A-1 , when it comes to net discretionary budget authority (appropriations, less any offsets), the vast majority of funding allocated by the appropriations committee generally goes to HUD (about two-thirds in FY2012). However, as shown in Figure A-2 , when taking into account contract authority\u2014which, as noted earlier, is not allocated by the appropriations committees\u2014the total resources available to DOT are greater than the resources available to HUD.", "Impact of Offsets", "Besides the level of the 302(b) allocation, one of the most important factors in determining how much in new appropriations the THUD subcommittee will provide in each year is the amount of savings available from rescissions and offsets. Each dollar available to the subcommittee in rescissions and offsets serves to reduce the \"cost\" of providing another dollar in appropriations. As shown in Table A-1 , in FY2012, without rescissions and offsets, it would have \"cost\" the THUD Subcommittee an additional $6 billion to provide the same amount of appropriations.", "In any given year, the amount of these \"budget savings\" can be higher or lower, meaning that the \"cost\" of providing the same level of appropriations may be higher or lower."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}]}}
