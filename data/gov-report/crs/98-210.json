First, some members of the military construction subcommittees believe that militaryconstruction has been chronically underfunded.

Although this 3% goal is below theaverage for public facilities nationwide, actual DOD funding has typically run at 1to 2% of plant replacement value. For example, the Air Force testified on March 11,1998 to the House National Security Subcommittee for Military Installations andFacilities that the Air Force could manage to budget only 1% for real propertymaintenance. Thus, facility proponents welcome congressional additions.

Inrecent years, Congress has added as much as $401.8 million (FY1995) for NationalGuard and Reserve construction projects. (See Table 5.) ", "Third, often Congress has different priorities from the Administration. Congressional military construction subcommittees -- authorization as well asappropriations subcommittees -- have often taken issue with Administration militaryconstruction priorities. In the 1990s, for example, the committees frequently reducedamounts requested for construction overseas -- on the grounds that troop levelsabroad should be reduced and that allied burden-sharing contributions shouldincrease -- and reallocated the funds to domestic projects. In addition, congressionalcommittees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements, such asday care centers and barracks renovation.

Senator McCain, in particular, objected tothe provision of substantial amounts for projects that the Administration had notrequested. He argued that such projects largely represent \"pork barrel\" spending, andcome at the expense of higher priority defense programs. In Senate floorconsideration of the military construction bill that year, the managers accepted aMcCain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects. Hisamendment included a provision that any added project should be on the military listsof critical yet unbudgeted projects. The McCain amendment was not incorporatedinto the final conference version of the bill, however, and the conference agreementprovided over $900 million for unrequested construction projects.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 ( P.L. 103-337 ), however, incorporated Senator McCain's criteria as a sense of the Senate provision, providingthat the unrequested projects should be:", "1. essential to the DOD's national security mission, ", "2. not inconsistent with planned base closures,", "3. in the services' Future Years Defense Plans (see above),", "4. executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated, and", "5. offset by reductions in other defense accounts, through advice from theSecretary of Defense.", "The purpose of these criteria is to help Congress rate the relative importance of different projects. Though a sense of the Senate provision does not have the forceof law, the McCain criteria have been cited repeatedly in Senate authorization andappropriations debates for FY1996 and FY1997. The criteria were also cited in theHouse FY1997 debates by members of the \"porkbusters\" coalition. In practice,debates have focused on justifying projects according to the first four criteria, whileignoring the offset requirement.

If the project can meet those criteria, the militaryconstruction authorizing and appropriations committees may add the project.", "The FY1998 Line Item Veto. Debate over whether congressionally added projects are pork or important to theDOD mission contributed to the President's first use of his line item veto authority (5) in October 1997.

First, the datashowed that 33 of the 38 projects were in the Pentagon's FYDP. Second, some ofthe projects did have design work in progress and so it appeared that the informationthat the President received on design work was inaccurate. Many of the projectsappeared to be \"executable\" in FY1998.

(13) Duringthe FY1998 review of the defense budget, both the House and Senate rejectedlegislation to approve more military base closures. Instead, the Congress passedSection 2824 of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 105-56 ),which required the Pentagon to report the costs and savings from previouslyapproved domestic military base closures.", "The required report, entitled \" The Report of the Department of Defense on Base Realignment and Closure \" was released by the Pentagon in April 1998.

Senator Burns noted that45% of the Army's FY1999 BRAC funding ($489M) is for studies, clean-up andrestoration of BRAC facilities and that these costs are a growing concern to him. Senator Burns said that the subcommittee will look at where the clean-up money isgoing, how it is being spent and to what degree military construction facilities arecleaned when they are turned over to the private sector.", "Use of Advanced Procurement for Army Military Construction. This year, the Congress will consider the Army'sproposal to use advanced procurement procedures for military construction. Thiswill be an exception to current practices for defense funding.", "When Congress appropriates money for defense programs, it generally pays all the costs up front in one fiscal year. This practice is known as full funding. It wasmandated by Congress in the 1950s to give full visibility to the cost of weaponsprocured. Therefore, all the money estimated at the time to complete the entireproject -- such as production of 21 Trident missiles, overhaul of an aircraft carrier,or construction of an ammunition depot -- is approved as a single package by theCongress. Often, the procurement of these weapons systems can span many years.", "As an exception to this practice, Congress sometimes provides funding for advance procurement of \"long-leadtime\" weapons components, such asnuclear-power plants for Navy warships.

Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army(Installations, Logistics and Environment) Alma Moore stated at the House NationalSecurity Committee hearing on February 26, 1998 that with advance appropriations,the contract will not define the work to be performed by the contractor, but only limitthe work by the amount appropriated in a given year.

", "The Army has been the executive agent of the Department of Defense chemical demilitarization (chem demil). The Pentagon decided, in response to its DefenseReform Initiative, that the Army now has total responsibility for chemicaldemilitarization. Therefore, a total of $125 million was transferred from the DODmilitary construction budget to the FY1999 Army military construction budget forsix chem demil military construction projects.", "The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee rejected the transfer of chem demil from the Office of Secretary ofDefense (OSD) to the Army in their FY1999 defense authorization bills.
