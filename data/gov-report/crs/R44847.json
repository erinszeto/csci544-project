OIA combines the unique information collected by DHS components as part of their operational activities (e.g., at airports, seaports, and the border) with foreign intelligence from the IC; law enforcement information from federal, state, local, and tribal sources; private sector data about critical infrastructure and key resources; and information from domestic open sources to develop homeland security intelligence.

Immediately after the attacks of September 11, 2001, investigators highlighted a number of obstacles to information sharing among the nation's intelligence and law enforcement communities, and called for related reforms. In the decade following 9/11, a number of laws and executive orders included provisions designed to improve the FBI's counterterrorism efforts. For example, the IRTPA of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) directed the FBI Director \"to develop and maintain a specialized and integrated national intelligence workforce consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists who are recruited, trained, and rewarded in a manner which ensures the existence within the FBI of an institutional culture with substantial expertise in, and commitment to, the intelligence mission of the Bureau.\" ", "The FBI Intelligence Branch \"oversees intelligence policy and guidance.\" It includes the Directorate of Intelligence, \"the FBI's dedicated national intelligence workforce.\" The directorate has \"clear authority and responsibility for all Bureau intelligence functions\" and includes intelligence elements and personnel that reside at FBI Headquarters and in each FBI field division. Such elements play a role in much of the investigative work that the FBI pursues. For example, intelligence is central to FBI efforts to thwart national security threats. Such activity is broadly managed by the FBI National Security Branch which includes: ", "The Counterintelligence Division. It focuses on preventing theft of sensitive information and advanced technologies. The Counterterrorism Division. It oversees counterterrorism investigations and the JTTFs located in FBI field divisions. The High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group.

Authorization for such activities is typically obtained via a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a specialized court created to act as a neutral judicial decision maker in the context of FISA.

This network is interspersed with hundreds of large electric power transformers whose function is to adjust electric voltage as needed to move power across the network. High voltage (HV) transformer units make up less than 3% of transformers in U.S. power substations, but they carry 60%-70% of the nation's electricity. Because they serve as vital transmission network nodes and carry bulk volumes of electricity, HV transformers are critical elements of the nation's electric power grid.

However, HV transformers are considered by many experts to be among the most vulnerable to intentional damage from malicious acts. Security analysts have long asserted that a coordinated and simultaneous attack on multiple HV transformers could have severe implications for reliable electric service over a large geographic area, crippling its electricity network and causing widespread, extended blackouts. Such an event could have severe electric reliability consequences, demonstrated in recent grid security exercise, as well as serious economic and social consequences. A handful of recent physical attacks on individual transformer substation\u2014most notably a 2013 attack on an HV transformer substation in Metcalf, CA\u2014did not cause widespread blackouts, but did highlight the physical vulnerability of HV transformer substations and drew the attention of both the media and federal officials to the utility industry's substation security efforts.", "Over the last decade or so the electric utility industry and government agencies have engaged in a number of initiatives to secure HV transformers from physical attack and to improve recovery in the event of a successful attack. These initiatives include coordination and information sharing, spare equipment programs, and grid security exercises, among other measures.

As of December 2016, NERC had received initial risk assessments and security plans from transmission owners and operators subject to the standard and was in discussions with FERC officials about how best to audit them. While NERC's physical security standard was viewed by many as an important step in improving grid security, some policymakers have advocated additional measures to facilitate grid recovery in an emergency.

", "DHS has sought a blanket extension for all ports, citing numerous challenges to implementing the 100% scanning requirement at overseas ports. In a report to Congress on the program, CBP identified three main obstacles to implementing 100% scanning at all foreign ports. First, 100% scanning requires significant host state and private sector cooperation, but some foreign governments and business groups do not support 100% scanning. Second, 100% scanning would be logistically difficult. Initial pilots were deployed in relatively low-volume ports with natural chokepoints, but many cargo containers pass through large volume ports with more varied port architectures. Third, 100% scanning would be costly. In February 2012, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that 100% scanning at foreign ports would cost an average of $8 million per shipping lane to implement, or a total of about $16.8 billion for all 2,100 shipping lanes. Port operators and foreign partners also absorb additional costs associated with fuel and utilities, staffing, and related expenses. In a letter requesting renewal of the two-year extension, then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson stated,", "I have personally reviewed our current port security and DHS's short term and long term ability to comply with 100% scanning requirement. Following this review, I must report, in all candor, that DHS's ability to fully comply with this unfunded mandate of 100% scanning, even in the long term, is highly improbable, hugely expensive, and in our judgment, not the best use of taxpayer resources to meet this country's port security and homeland security needs.", "In an October 2015 hearing, DHS officials reiterated their opposition to a 100% scanning strategy in favor of a risk-based and layered security strategy. Major U.S. trading partners also oppose 100% scanning. The European Commission has determined that 100% scanning is the wrong approach, favoring a multilayered risk management approach to inspecting cargo. CBP has tested the feasibility of scanning all U.S.-bound containers at several overseas ports and identified numerous operational, technical, logistical, financial, and diplomatic obstacles, including opposition from host government officials. In a July 2016 hearing, DHS officials restated their opposition to pursuing a 100% scanning strategy. One-hundred-percent scanning conflicts with DHS's general approach to risk management, which seeks to focus scarce inspection resources on the highest-risk containers. By scanning a smaller number of containers, DHS may be able to devote additional resources to each individual scan. This alternative approach is considered important because reviewing the scans is labor-intensive, and scanning fewer containers may allow DHS to subject individual scans to greater scrutiny, and to maintain a lower threshold for opening containers with questionable scanning images.", "If illicit cargo is estimated to be limited to less than 1% of incoming containers, as CBP believes to be the case, an alternative enforcement strategy may be to focus on a smaller set of only the likeliest containers. This approach would emphasize risk-based scanning along with investment in CBP intelligence to improve targeting, and/or increase CBP personnel, which would allow ports to conduct a larger number of targeted special enforcement operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)", "paragraphs": ["[author name scrubbed], Specialist in Transportation Policy ( [email address scrubbed] , [phone number scrubbed])", "In January 2007, TSA and the Coast Guard issued a final rule implementing the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) at U.S. ports.

The card was authorized under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA; \u00a7102 of P.L. 107-295 ). As of October 2015, the population of TWIC holders was approximately 2.1 million.

The security threat assessment uses the same procedures and standards established by TSA for truck drivers carrying hazardous materials, including examination of the applicant's criminal history, immigration status, and possible links to terrorist activity to determine whether a worker poses a security threat. A worker pays a fee of about $130 that is intended to cover the cost of administering the cards. The card uses biometric technology for positive identification. Terminal operators were to deploy card readers at the gates to their facilities, so that a worker's fingerprint template would be scanned each time he or she enters the port area and matched to the data on the card.", "Finding a card reader that worked reliably in a harsh marine environment has proven difficult. On August 23, 2016, the Coast Guard issued a final rule requiring that only the highest-risk maritime facilities install card readers, generally facilities handling dangerous cargoes in bulk or large passenger vessels (> 1,000 passengers). This limited the facilities required to have card readers to about 525 facilities (about 16% of the roughly 3,200 maritime facilities regulated under MTSA). Other facilities, including those handling containerized cargo, would continue to use the TWIC as a \"flash pass,\" but the biometric data on the card would not be used to positively identify the worker. Potential problems with this approach were highlighted by the February 2016 announcement that federal investigators uncovered a \"document mill\" producing fraudulent TWIC cards in Los Angeles. The final rule becomes effective on August 23, 2018. Currently, the Coast Guard performs spot checks with hand-held biometric readers while conducting port security inspections.", "GAO and Inspector General audits have been highly critical of how the TWIC has been implemented.

This audit was discussed at a hearing by the House Subcommittee on Government Operations on May 9, 2013, and by the House Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security on June 18, 2013. Another 2013 GAO audit examined TSA's Adjudication Center (which performs security threat assessments on TWIC applicants and other transportation workers), and recommended steps the agency could take to better measure the center's performance. A 2011 GAO audit found internal control weaknesses in the enrollment, background checking, and use of the TWIC card at ports, which were said to undermine the effectiveness of the credential in screening out unqualified individuals from obtaining access to port facilities. Similarly, a 2016 Inspector General audit found that TSA appears to be more concerned with customer service in administering the cards (e.g., issuing them in a timely manner) than a careful scrutiny of applicants. For instance, it found that applicants believed to be providing fraudulent identification documents were nevertheless issued a TWIC.

Explosives screening technologies at passenger screening checkpoints primarily consist of whole body imaging systems known as Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT); advanced technology X-ray imagers for carry-on items; and explosives trace detection (ETD) systems used to test swab samples collected from individuals or carry-on items for explosives residue. In its FY2017 budget request, TSA indicated that it intends to procure AIT and ETD systems in small numbers, while it intends to acquire more than 300 advanced technology X-ray imagers for carry-on items, upgraded with multi-view capabilities or automated explosives detection capabilities.", "The use of AIT has raised a number of policy questions. Privacy advocates have objected to the intrusiveness of AIT, particularly when used for primary screening. To allay privacy concerns, TSA eliminated the use of human analysis of AIT images and does not store imagery. In place of human image analysts, TSA has deployed automated targeting recognition (ATR) software that generates generic avatar images indicating locations of possible threat items. Another concern raised about AIT centered on the potential medical risks posed by backscatter X-ray systems, but those systems are no longer in use for airport screening, and current millimeter wave systems emit nonionizing millimeter waves are not considered harmful. ", "The effectiveness of AIT and ATR has been brought into question. In 2015, the DHS Office of Inspector General completed covert testing of passenger screening checkpoint technologies and processes to evaluate the effectiveness of AIT and ATR. In congressional testimony, DHS Inspector General John Roth revealed that the covert testing consistently found failures in technology and procedures coupled with human error that allowed prohibited items to pass into secure areas. Even prior to the revelations of weaknesses in passenger checkpoint screening technologies and procedures, the use of AIT was controversial. Past legislative proposals specifically sought to prohibit the use of whole body imaging for primary screening (see, for example, H.R. 2200 , 111 th Congress). Nonetheless, primary screening using AIT is now commonplace at larger airports. Checkpoints at many smaller airports have not been furnished with AIT equipment or other advanced checkpoint detection technologies.

The most visible DHS initiative to address the threat was the multiyear Counter-MANPADS program carried out by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate. The program concluded in 2009 with extensive operational and live-fire testing along with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of two systems capable of protecting airliners against heat-seeking missiles. The systems have not been deployed on commercial airliners in the United States, however, due largely to high acquisition and life-cycle costs. MANPADS are mainly seen as a security threat to civil aviation overseas, but a MANPADS attack in the United States could have a considerable impact on the airline industry. While major U.S. airports have conducted vulnerability studies, efforts to reduce vulnerabilities of flight paths to potential MANPADS attacks face significant challenges because of limited resources and large geographic areas where aircraft are vulnerable to attack.
