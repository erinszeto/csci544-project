Concomitant with the promise of potential benefits, such advances may pose new risks and raise ethical concerns. For example, a Chinese researcher recently claimed that he had created the first genetically engineered human babies. According to the researcher, he used CRISPR-Cas9 to disable a gene that will make it harder for the twin girls, who were born in November 2018, to contract human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The as yet unsubstantiated claim has sparked outrage and ethical debates by the international scientific community and others. Prior use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human embryos was generally limited to non-viable embryos, in part, to address ethical concerns such as the fact that the genetic change would affect not only the immediate patient, but also future generations who would inherit the change.", "Additionally, CRISPR-related approaches (gene drives) are being considered to reduce or eliminate the mosquito that serves as the primary vector for the transmission of Zika or malaria, thereby improving public health.

These characteristics led Science magazine to name CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology \"Breakthrough of the Year\" in 2015. Many in the scientific, engineering, and business communities believe that CRISPR-Cas9 may offer revolutionary advances in the investigation, prevention, and treatment of diseases; understanding of gene function; improving crop yields and developing new varieties; production of chemicals used in biofuels, adhesives, and fragrances; and control of invasive species. ", "CRISPR is an acronym for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" which are unique DNA sequences found in some bacteria and other microorganisms. These sequences, along with the genes that are located next to them, known as CRISPR-associated or Cas genes, form an immune system that protects against viruses and other infectious DNA. The CRISPR system identifies, cuts, and destroys foreign DNA. Researchers have identified five different types of CRISPR systems. The most studied CRISPR system is associated with the Cas9 protein and is known as CRISPR-Cas9. During 2012 and 2013, researchers modified CRISPR-Cas9 to serve as an effective and efficient technology for editing the genomes of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Since then, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to modify the genomes of a variety of species\u2014ranging from mice and fruit flies to corn and yeast. Many in the scientific community believe CRISPR-Cas9 has shifted the paradigm with its simplicity and low cost relative to other methods of gene editing\u2014removing barriers to widespread adoption and creating new research opportunities. This report focuses on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a gene editing technology, which is sometimes referred to as CRISPR in the report. However, other CRISPR systems are currently in development and use. ", "Despite this promise, technical challenges to realizing the full potential of CRISPR-Cas9 remain. Researchers largely agree that efficiently delivering the technology to particular cells, tissues, or organs, and reducing off-target activity (i.e., the number of unintended genetic changes) are among the most pressing challenges. Off-target activity may increase the risk of cancer, and thus improved delivery and specificity are especially important for the development of gene therapy applications. Scientists are investigating ways to overcome these challenges and improve CRISPR-Cas9.

The invention of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s allowed scientists to insert new DNA into genes in a directed way, but inserting a specific gene or sequence within the genome remained technically challenging and imprecise. ", "Gene editing is a newer technique that is used to make specific and intentional changes to DNA. Gene editing can be used to insert, remove, or modify DNA in a genome. All gene editing technologies involve an enzyme known as a nuclease for cutting the DNA, in addition to a targeting mechanism that guides the enzyme to a specific location on the DNA strand (i.e., a gene within the genome). Gene editing has traditionally involved the insertion, removal, or modification of a single gene, but with CRISPR-Cas9 multiple genes can be targeted simultaneously. Such multi-gene editing is generally referred to as genome editing.

Generally, the guide RNA targets and binds to a specific DNA sequence, and the attached Cas9 enzyme cleaves both strands of DNA at that site. This cut can be used to insert, remove, or edit the DNA sequence. The cut is then repaired and the changes incorporated ( Figure 1 ). This specificity of modification is one feature that differentiates CRISPR-Cas9 from predecessor genome editing systems. ", "Scientists can create a guide RNA corresponding to almost any sequence within an organism's genome. This flexibility allows for the potential application of the technique to a very wide range of genomes, including microorganisms, animals, or plants. If the sequence of the desired target or gene (and its function) is known, in theory, CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to alter the function of a cell or organism. ", "The basic CRISPR-Cas9 technology, specifically the Cas9 nuclease, has also been adapted by researchers to allow for additional modifications to the genome beyond the cutting of both strands of the DNA. For example, researchers have adapted Cas9 so that it can be used to change a single base in a gene (base editing), cut a single strand of DNA, or activate or repress the expression of a gene (i.e., increase or decrease the production of a molecule, typically a protein)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Gene Drives?", "paragraphs": ["CRISPR-Cas9 has led to recent breakthroughs in gene drive research. A gene drive is a system of biasing inheritance to increase the likelihood of passing on a modified gene. Offspring inherit one copy of each gene from its parents. Normally, this limits the total incidence of mutations over generations ( Figure 2 ). Gene drive components cause the modified DNA to copy itself into the DNA from the unmodified parent. The result is the preferential increase in a specific trait from one generation to the next and, in time, possibly throughout the population. CRISPR-Cas9 has allowed researchers to more effectively insert a modified gene and the gene drive components. Gene drives have been suggested as a way to eliminate or reduce the transmission of disease, eradicate invasive species, or reverse pesticide resistance in agriculture. The self-propagating nature of gene drives is also accompanied by concerns (described later in the report)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CRISPR-Cas9 Market Projections, Investments, and R&D Spending", "paragraphs": ["CRISPR-Cas9 technology is still in its infancy, with many of the hoped-for applications potentially years in the future.

These scientists published results of an experiment that attempted to modify the genetic make-up of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9. This experiment attempted to modify a gene for beta-thalassemia, a fatal blood disorder. In April 2016, a second team of Chinese researchers published results of a study that used CRISPR-Cas9 to try to introduce a mutation that confers HIV-resistance into non-viable human embryos. Neither of these studies demonstrated a high success rate, nor an ability to precisely direct editing of the host genome.

This research has subsequently generated debate in the scientific community, as the results\u2014and specifically the claim that the embryo preferentially used self-directed as opposed to template-directed repair to replace the faulty gene\u2014were called into question by some in the scientific community. Although the researchers did further testing of the embryos to resolve some of the questions, the study has yet to be replicated, and reproduction of this type of study will likely be slower due to the restrictions on federal funding of research in human embryos.

The concerns of scientists and others have been, to some extent, borne out by the recent unverified claim of the birth of children with CRISPR modified DNA. In addition, the initial Chinese study prompted discussion about how existing law and regulation in the United States would apply to the conduct of this type of research, its clinical testing in humans, and specifically its applications in human embryos.

Conversely, the modification of somatic cells using CRISPR-Cas9 for the purposes of treating or curing disease primarily raises issues of safety rather than of ethics. Specifically, with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, scientists are concerned, among other things, with the accuracy of the initial cut in the DNA; with the integration of the replacement genetic material being incorporated at the site of the cut; and with \"off-target\" activity (meaning unintended cuts and/or integration of replacement genetic material at additional unintended sites in the host genome). These problems have been shown to be fairly common in early research using CRISPR-Cas9. However, ethical issues could be raised secondary to safety concerns that were not adequately addressed prior to use of the technology in humans, and there may be differing perspectives on whether a safety concern has been adequately addressed, potentially compounding any ethical concerns.", "Ethical considerations with respect to the use of CRIPSR-Cas9 arise predominantly with respect to the potential use of the technology to modify human embryos.

Bioethicists, scientists, and others have debated the ethics of introducing changes to the human germline beginning with the advent of recombinant DNA technology and in the context of first human gene therapy and then human gene transfer research. Generally, the ethical concerns have centered on three main issues or variants of these issues: ", "that the technology could create inherent inequities due to differential access by those with resources and those without; that changes to the germline would be passed on to future generations and therefore might alter the genetic makeup of the population in unintended or unforeseen ways and without the permission of those affected; and that modification might be used for enhancement purposes rather than only for curing or treating disease or restoring lost function. ", "Research that does not intend to modify human embryos, but rather that uses CRISPR-Cas9 to study genes involved in early development, may avoid some of these ethical quandaries. In addition, scientists have conducted some of the early research using CRISPR-Cas9 to modify non-viable embryos in an attempt to mitigate some of the ethical concerns with this type of research. ", "The publication of the first study using CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryos prompted the debate over germline modification to re-emerge in the scientific community, intensified by the perception that the new technology may be promising in ways not previously seen with respect to its ease of use and precision of editing. In response to this and other related research, members of the scientific community gathered at the International Summit on Human Gene Editing in December 2015\u2014co-hosted by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the United Kingdom's Royal Society\u2014to \"discuss the scientific, ethical and governance issues associated with human gene-editing research.\" ", "At the conclusion of the International Summit, the members of the organizing committee released a statement related to both basic research on and clinical use of gene editing (whether for therapy or research, and whether somatic or germline). The summit participants were supportive of basic research, including research using human embryos that would not be used to establish a pregnancy.

CRISPR-Cas9 permits the introduction or deletion of genetic sequences with much greater precision than traditional plant and livestock breeding techniques or earlier methods of genetic engineering (GE). Plant biotechnologists see the CRISPR-Cas9 technology as offering the capacity to engineer changes in major food crops by substituting existing plant DNA sequences with desired ones, or by enhancing or suppressing particular gene expression. Conventional plant breeding for desired traits often involves cross-breeding with related wild species of the target plant. However, this approach also introduces genes that are not wanted. CRISPR-Cas9 allows the breeder to take only the gene of interest from the wild species and insert it at a precise location in the target organism to produce a new plant variety. In addition, this precision also reduces the plant breeding cycle by years through eliminating the time-consuming backcrossing procedure in conventional plant breeding and older GE techniques.", "Through more precisely altering DNA, CRISPR-Cas9 and other genome engineering technologies have the potential to provide a level of control over plant genetic material that is unprecedented. Future crops created through these technological systems could include those with higher degrees of plant-pest control, plants with new and enhanced nutritional characteristics, and varieties that could be grown on marginal lands or in poor quality soils. Transgenesis\u2014the introduction of foreign DNA into a plant genome\u2014has characterized most commercial plant biotechnology innovation over the past 25 years. Most of the global acreage planted to GE crops today is in corn, cotton, soybean, and canola production. Pest resistance and/or herbicide tolerance traits are the dominant features engineered into these GE crops. While CRISPR-Cas9 permits similar transgenic manipulation, it does so with greater precision in the genome, and can involve more than a single gene insertion. New genetic variation can be created by identifying the precise DNA sequence modifications that are wanted in the cultivated variety, and then introducing them via the CRISPR-Cas9 system. By controlling the specific genetic variation introduced into the cultivated plant, CRISPR-Cas9 opens up a fundamentally new method of creating novel plant cultivars. For example, in 2014, Chinese researchers published a paper claiming the development of a strain of wheat that is resistant to powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. CRISPR has also been used to modify the genes of a variety of other agricultural products, including rice, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, oranges, and tomatoes.

The genus Agrobacterium was long on the APHIS list of regulated items because of its natural ability to invade a plant and introduce its own DNA.

Potential social and environmental issues were noted in passing (e.g., weed and pest resistance, safety questions), but the technology's impressive promise and the fact that other countries were pushing ahead aggressively with development (e.g., Japan, Germany) left such issues largely in the background at the time. However, as products reached the market these issues resurfaced. Some issues remain unresolved as demonstrated by current debate over whether GE foods should be labeled for consumers. CRISPR-Cas9 is unlikely to escape similar social and ethical concerns as its use increases and evolves. For example, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to create \"gene-drive\"\u2014a method for spreading modified traits through wild populations over a few generations\u2014has already sparked debate (discussed in more detail in \" Gene Drives and Environmental Concerns ,\" below).

On July 25, 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that organisms obtained by mutagenesis are GMOs and are in principle within the scope of the obligations laid down in the GMO Directive, which governs the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. While conventional mutagenesis techniques with a long safety record and used in a range of applications are not subject to the GMO Directive, the Court considers that risks posed by new mutagenesis techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 might prove similar to risks from transgenesis. The Court considers that excluding organisms created from new mutagenesis techniques would compromise the objectives of the GMO Directive to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment, and would also fail to respect the precautionary principal which the Directive seeks to implement.

Given the dominance of a few agro-food corporations in seed development, questions related to who owns the raw material produced through gene editing and how the genome editing of global food crops is to be shared may be expected to continue. Agricultural productivity depends in part on the availability of biodiversity for the development of improved cultivars. Because genes can receive intellectual property protection, the emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 suggests that whole genomes could one day receive intellectual property protection as well. The objectives of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA), which was ratified by the U.S. Senate in September 2016, are the conservation and sustainable use of all plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of their use. The purpose of the Multilateral System of the PGRFA is to facilitate access to plant genetic resources to ensure food security and fair distribution of the benefits from their use.

Specifically, FDA and USDA are required to examine environment risks under processes defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), while EPA is required to conduct an ecological risk assessment process under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. \u00a7136 et seq.). ", "NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. An EIS provides a description of the proposed action and the existing environment, as well as analysis of the anticipated beneficial and adverse environmental effects of all reasonable alternatives.", "NEPA requires some level of analysis when environmental impacts are uncertain or thought not to be significant. Projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA). An EA is a concise public document that analyzes the environmental impacts of a proposed federal action and provides sufficient evidence to determine the level of significance of the impacts. It is followed by either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a decision to prepare an EIS. ", "Judicial interpretation of NEPA ultimately determined that the act did not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other considerations. Rather, the courts determined, NEPA requires only that the agency take a \"hard look\" at a project's environmental consequences before taking action. If the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated, the agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other benefits outweigh the environmental costs.", "According to the National Academy of Sciences:", "Some of the key strengths of [the] NEPA process are that it is a standard approach required by legislation, supports the collection of large amounts of information about a proposed activity, it has clear reporting requirements, and includes provisions for public input. The NEPA process is also widely recognized by the stakeholder community. The disadvantage of the NEPA process, however, is that it is a regulatory process and not a decision science approach. Neither an EA nor an EIS requires a clear formulation of the problem that provides a quantitative cause-effect model. Analyses conducted as part of the NEPA process are not required to be probabilistic or report quantitatively on uncertainty. These gaps would make it very difficult to [a] create testable hypothesis to conduct further research on gene-drive modified organisms and inform decision making.", "In contrast, according the National Academy of Sciences, ecological risk assessment allows for the quantification of probable outcomes and the ability to trace cause-effect pathways. Both of these, in addition to the ability of ecological risk assessment to identify sources of uncertainty, likely make it a more thorough tool for supporting public policy decisions about the use of gene drive technologies. However, some in industry may argue that the NEPA process is sufficient and that requiring ecological risk assessments has the potential to lengthen the approval process, leading to unnecessary delays and costs that could have a negative effect on public health."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Social Acceptance and Ethical Concerns", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Academy of Sciences, \"there is insufficient evidence available at this time to support the release of gene-drive modified organisms into the environment,\" and a considerable amount of research and evaluation is still necessary.

", "For example, a gene drive could be constructed to suppress the population of an invasive plant species so that native plant species would be able to re-populate the ecosystem. However, the invasive plant may have assumed a critical role in the ecosystem, and its suppression may result in the sudden loss of habitat or a food source for native animals even if native species are eventually able to assume their previous ecological roles. If the native animal is an endangered or threatened species, then reducing its habitat (i.e., reducing the invasive plant species) could have negative consequences for the native animal and its recovery as required by the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, while the desired benefit of suppressing the invasive species is re-population by the native species, it could actually create an opportunity for an even more resilient invasive species to take its place.", "In another scenario, a gene drive could be developed to modify a population of mosquitos so they can no longer host the Zika virus and thereby reduce the number of infants with serious defects at birth or emerging later in life. However, an unintended consequence of modifying the mosquito population could be that it then becomes a more susceptible host for a new or existing virus that may have an even greater negative impact on human health. ", "Some scientists have called for the development of reversal or immunization gene drives as a means to counter any unintended consequences with the open environment release of a gene drive-modified organism. These gene drives could be designed to revert the targeted organism back to its original genetic state or incorporate a genetic change into the organism that would prevent it from being susceptible or \"immune\" to the original gene drive.", "Besides the scientific questions of risk in making changes to complex and interwoven ecosystems, these examples raise a number of questions about the use of gene drives and what may be considered socially acceptable. Some may view the use of gene drives to benefit public health, especially in a time of crisis (i.e., an outbreak of a harmful virus), as appropriate. Others may view the possibility of eradicating a species as morally objectionable, regardless of the potential benefits to human health. Others may object to the use of gene drives entirely, and view any attempt to \"control\" nature as unwarranted. These views may also vary by community. For example, a society that is plagued by a serious disease may be more tolerant of the use of gene drives and the potential unintended consequences that may result than a community not affected by the disease being targeted. Variation in societal and ethical views suggest the need for public engagement and dialogue before any field testing or open environmental release of a gene-drive modified organism. Concerns about environmental justice and who will be responsible for addressing unanticipated public health or environmental harms may also be an issue as developing countries may be primary locations for the use of gene drives. ", "According to the National Academy of Sciences:", "Engagement can facilitate mutual learning and shared decision making, support democracy and justice, help identify and assess potential benefits and harms, and provide a mechanism to explore difficult-to-articulate questions, such as the human relationship to nature\u2026. The question is not whether to engage communities, stakeholders, and publics in decisions about gene drive technologies, but how best to do so. The outcomes of engagement may be as crucial as the scientific outcomes to decisions about whether to release of a gene-drive modified organism into the environment. Thus, engagement cannot be an afterthought; it requires effort, attention, resources, and advanced planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), as implemented through the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols, is the primary international agreement governing the development and use of genetically modified organisms.

The treaty states as major objectives the conservation of biological diversity and sustainable use of its components; fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources; and appropriate transfer of relevant technologies. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, completed in 2000, applies to the transboundary movement, handling, and use of genetically modified organisms that may affect human health, the environment, or biological diversity. Under Article 17 of the protocol, a party to the agreement is required to take appropriate action to notify a potentially affected party \"when it knows of an occurrence under its jurisdiction resulting in a release that leads, or may lead, to an unintentional transboundary movement of a living modified organism that is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.\" ", "The Cartagena Protocol was developed mainly due to concerns related to genetically modified crops, but extension of the protocol and the CBD to synthetic biology, and similarly to gene drives, has recently been examined. In November 2018, at a meeting to update the CBD, government officials considered (but ultimately rejected) a resolution that would have prohibited the release of organisms modified using gene drives, including experimental releases. The proposed moratorium on gene drives caused some in the scientific community to issue a letter in opposition to the ban, stating that, \"closing the door on research by creating arbitrary barriers, high uncertainty, and open-ended delays will significantly limit our ability to provide answers to the questions policy-makers, regulators, and the public are asking. The moratorium suggested at CBD on field releases would prevent the full evaluation of the potential uses of gene drives.\" On the other hand, some environmental groups supported the ban on gene drives, stating that, \"gene drives threaten natural systems. If released experimentally into the environment they may spread engineered genes uncontrollably through wild and domesticated species. This could alter ecological systems and food webs, harm biodiversity and eradicate beneficial organisms such as pollinators.\" ", "The CBD is predicated on the precautionary principle, which is generally understood to mean that if definitive scientific certainty is lacking, it is better to err on the side of caution. This approach is a source of concern for critics, who worry about the possible erection of trade restrictions that might be justified by the application of this concept. The United States is generally more tolerant than many other nations of scientific uncertainty and risk as they relate to innovation and emerging technologies; it does not operate its regulatory systems according to the precautionary principle. ", "The National Academy of Sciences indicates that since the United States is not a party to the CBD, it lacks a clear policy for engaging with other countries with different systems of governance in the release of gene-drive modified organisms. The NAS report also expresses concern that many of the countries where field testing and the environmental release of gene-drive organisms is likely to occur lack independent capacity to assess the safety of gene drive research, to undertake public engagement and societal dialogue, and to maintain regulatory institutions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Basic Research", "paragraphs": ["CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing provides flexibility and new opportunities in basic research. For example, the modeling of disease in animals is an important tool in fundamental understanding of disease and the development of therapeutics. CRISPR-Cas9 has made the development of animal models of disease less labor intensive, more cost-effective, and more precise. Before CRISPR-Cas9, creating a new mouse disease model took approximately a year and cost tens of thousands of dollars, but with the CRISPR technology a new mouse model can be created within a month and at a fraction of the previous cost. CRISPR-Cas9 is also expanding the types of animals that can be used for basic research. For example, neurobiologists are using CRISPR-Cas9 to develop the tree shrew as a model for the human brain. Additionally, some countries, including China and Japan, are using the technology to position themselves as leaders in primate-related research, especially neuroscience. For example, scientists in China have used CRISPR-Cas9 to create monkey models of autism and cardiovascular disease.

The study of changes in gene expression without the modification of the underlying DNA is termed epigenetics. CRISPR-Cas9 offers researchers the first tool to precisely alter the epigenome, the chemical compounds attached to DNA. With this technique, researchers modify the CRISPR-Cas9 technology so that it does not cut the target gene, but instead attaches itself to the gene in a way that promotes or prevents gene expression. The modified technology can also be coupled with other components to create on-off switches and fluorescent molecules to allow visualization of gene expression in living organisms.

Given the broad distribution, low cost, and accelerated pace of development of this dual-use technology, its deliberate or unintentional misuse might lead to far-reaching economic and national security implications.", "In 2017 and 2018, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats also highlighted national security concerns associated with genome editing and advances in biotechnology. In 2018, Director Coats stated: \"New biotechnologies are leading to improvements in agriculture, health care, and manufacturing. However, some applications of biotechnologies may lead to unintentional negative health effects, biological accidents, or deliberate misuse.\"", "Just as CRISPR-Cas9 technology is lowering the cost and technological expertise required for biological research in general, the technology could do the same for biological weapons programs. In theory, advances in gene editing could be used to create novel pathogens or change the hardiness, resistance, infectivity, pathogenicity, or specificity of existing pathogens. However, current understanding of many of these traits and how they interact in particular pathogens may complicate making desired changes without also causing undesired changes. A 2016 conference concluded that \"with regards to weapons relevance, the implications of gene editing technology are probably modest. But should a biological weapons program be started today, these technologies would likely become a part of it.\" Additionally, the concerns discussed above regarding potential inadvertent effects of ecological use of CRISPR-Cas9 linked gene-drive technology equally apply to the potential effects of its deliberate malign use.

Given the current global availability of CRISPR-Cas9 technology and knowledge, export control regimes and international agreements designed to limit proliferation may be ill-suited for addressing national security concerns raised by gene editing. Current efforts aimed at mitigating the risks of biological weapons in general will also help mitigate the risks of biological weapons developed by gene editing. However, it may be possible to use gene editing to circumvent current mitigation strategies.
