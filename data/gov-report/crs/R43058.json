Recent Senate debates in Congress over judicial nominations have focused on issues such as the relative degree of success of President Barack Obama's nominees in gaining Senate confirmation (compared with other recent Presidents) as well as the number and percentage of vacant judgeships in the federal judiciary and the effect of delayed judicial appointments on judicial vacancy levels. This report addresses these issues, and others, by providing a statistical analysis of nominations to U.S. circuit and district court judgeships during the first terms of President Obama and his four most recent predecessors. Some of the report's findings include the following:", "During his first term, President Obama nominated 42 persons to U.S. circuit court judgeships. Of the 42, 30 (71.4%) were confirmed, 5 (11.9%) had their nominations either withdrawn by the President or returned to the President and not resubmitted to the Senate, and 7 (16.7%) had their nominations returned to the President at the end of the 112th Congress and subsequently were renominated during the 113th Congress. During the first terms of the five most recent Presidents (Reagan to Obama), the 30 confirmed Obama circuit court nominees were tied with 30 Clinton nominees as the fewest number of circuit nominees confirmed. The percentage of circuit nominees confirmed during President Obama's first term, 71.4%, was the second-lowest, while the percentage confirmed during G.W. Bush's first term, 67.3%, was the lowest. Of the 173 persons nominated by President Obama to U.S. district court judgeships during his first term, 143 (82.7%) were confirmed, 6 (3.5%) had their nominations withdrawn or returned and not resubmitted, and 24 (13.9%) had their nominations returned to the President and were renominated during the 113th Congress. President Obama's first term, compared with the first terms of Presidents Reagan to G.W. Bush, had the second-fewest number of district court nominees confirmed (143 compared with 130 for President Reagan) and the second-lowest percentage of district court nominees confirmed (82.7% compared with 76.9% for President G.H.W. Bush). As it did during the first terms of Presidents Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, and Clinton, the circuit court vacancy rate during President Obama's first term increased (from 7.3% at the beginning to 9.5% at the end). Over the five most recent presidencies, G.W. Bush's first term was the only one during which the circuit court vacancy rate decreased (from 14.5% at the beginning to 8.4% at the end). As it did during the first terms of Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush, the district court vacancy rate also increased from the beginning to the end of President Obama's first term (rising from 6.6% to 9.5%). President Obama is the only President during this period for whom the district court vacancy rate increased unaccompanied by the creation of new district court judgeships. The average number of days elapsed from nomination to confirmation for circuit court nominees confirmed during a President's first term ranged from 45.5 days during President Reagan's first term to 277 days during President G.W. Bush's. For district court nominees, the average time between nomination to confirmation ranged from 34.7 days (Reagan) to 221.8 days (Obama). The median number of days from nomination to confirmation for circuit court nominees confirmed during a President's first term ranged from 28 days (Reagan) to 225.5 days (Obama). For district court nominees, the median time elapsed ranged from a low, again, of 28 days (Reagan) to 215 days (Obama). President Obama is the only one of the five most recent Presidents for whom, during his first term, both the average and median waiting time from nomination to confirmation for circuit and district court nominees was greater than half a calendar year (i.e., more than 182 days)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The process by which lower federal court judges are nominated by the President and considered by the Senate has, in recent decades, been of continuing interest to Senators.

Senate debate often has concerned whether a President's judicial nominees, relative to the nominees of other recent Presidents, encountered more difficulty or had to wait longer, before receiving consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee or up-or-down floor votes on confirmation.

In contrast, during his first term, no nominees of President Obama were confirmed to either the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. President Obama is the first President in more than 50 years who has served a full four-year term without having a single nominee confirmed to the appellate court for the D.C.

Various factors influence the number of such opportunities a President will have during his tenure in office. One such factor, at the start of a presidency, is the number of judicial vacancies already in existence (i.e., the judicial vacancies a President inherits when taking office). The number of inherited vacancies, in turn, is influenced by various factors. These include the frequency with which judicial departures occurred and new judgeships were statutorily created in the years or months immediately prior to a new presidency; the extent to which the outgoing President, during this same period, made nominations to fill judicial vacancies; and the rate at which the Senate confirmed these nominations before the new President took office. ", "A large number of judicial vacancies created before the start of a new presidency might or might not result in many appointment opportunities for the incoming President. Much would depend on how prompt the previous President was in making nominations to fill newly created judicial vacancies and on how willing the Senate was to confirm those nominations. The different rate, for instance, at which the Senate confirmed district court nominations immediately prior to the G.W. Bush and Obama presidencies was one factor in how many district court appointment opportunities each President inherited upon taking office. During the presidential election year of 2000, 56 district court nominations were pending in the Senate, of which 31 (55.4%) were confirmed. In contrast, during the presidential election year of 2008, 37 district court nominations were pending in the Senate, of which 24 (64.9%) were confirmed. This variation contributed to differences in the number of appointment opportunities for Presidents G.W. Bush and Obama.", "Legislation creating new judgeships might also provide a new President with the opportunity to appoint a greater number of judges than he might have otherwise inherited. Legislation substantially increasing the number of authorized judgeships was enacted in 1978 (Omnibus Judgeship Act, P.L. 95-486 ); 1984 (Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act, P.L. 98-353 ); and 1990 (Federal Judgeship Act, P.L. 101-650 ). The large number of district court vacancies, for example, inherited by President Clinton contributed, in turn, to the relatively large number of district court confirmations during his presidency. The large number of district court vacancies inherited by President Clinton was, in part, the result of 74 new district court judgeships created by the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990.", "Over the course of a presidency, opportunities for a President to make circuit and district court appointments continue to be affected by the rate at which judges depart office (by taking senior status, retiring, resigning, or dying). During some presidencies, substantial new judicial appointment opportunities also have arisen because of the statutory creation of new circuit and district court judgeships. Both factors\u2014judicial departures and the statutory creation of new judgeships\u2014can, throughout a President's tenure, affect the number of persons nominated by the President and the number confirmed by the Senate.", "For example, a study found that, largely as a result of judges retiring from full-time service on the bench, President Obama was confronted during his first three years in office with more judicial vacancies than his two immediate predecessors:", "... 92 judges took senior status in the first three years of the Obama administration compared to 72 and 70 in the Clinton and Bush administrations' first three years....

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Selection of Nominees by a President", "paragraphs": ["The \"hallmarks of the modern presidential role in judicial appointments are the selection, vetting, and evaluation of federal judicial nominees.\" A variety of factors can affect how long it takes a President to select, vet, and evaluate nominees to fill judicial vacancies. These factors include how many individuals are involved in identifying and vetting potential nominees, the specific selection criteria a President desires to emphasize in identifying nominees, whether a Supreme Court vacancy occurs, and, if so, the resources devoted to filling that vacancy. A vacancy on the Supreme Court, for example, occurred early in both the Clinton and Obama Administrations, and in both instances, while the Administrations' searches were underway for a Supreme Court nominee, the Presidents sent few lower court nominations to the Senate.", "The level of consultation between a President and a nominee's home state Senators also can influence the President's pace in selecting nominees for judicial vacancies. Home state Senators traditionally play an important role in the selection of district and, to a lesser extent, circuit court judges. The pace might be slowed by communication or other difficulties between the President and those Senators who represent states with vacant federal judgeships. Additionally, if the home state Senators are themselves slow in recommending a candidate, or if they and the President cannot agree on a suitable candidate, the nomination of an individual to fill a vacant judgeship may be delayed.", "Another factor affecting a President's pace in selecting judicial nominees is the degree of priority he attaches to the process. According to one account, for example, judicial selection may not have been a priority for the Obama Administration during the 111 th Congress. \"The surest key to understanding the politics, processes, and outcomes of the Obama judicial selection record in the 111 th Congress,\" according to the account, is \"the recognition that judges were not seen as a priority by those closest to the President. Judicial selection was not a major focal point in the administration's legislatively driven domestic policy agenda, nor was it seen as a 'legacy' issue.\"", "Finally, the speed at which a President selects nominees might be influenced by the length of his Administration's vetting process. One recent study, for example, found that the time from vacancy to nomination during the first 14 months of the Obama Administration was longer than at the same point in the G.W. Bush Administration, especially for circuit court nominees. The greater time for President Obama to submit nominees, the study said, was likely due in part to the pre-nomination candidate vetting by the American Bar Association's (ABA's) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. The G.W. Bush Administration, the study noted, chose not to have its judicial candidates rated by the ABA committee (prior to submitting them to Congress). By contrast, the Obama Administration \"brought the committee, and thus the additional 30 to 45 days typically consumed by its investigations, back into the pre-nomination stage.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Processing of Judicial Nominations by the Senate", "paragraphs": ["As in the nominee selection stage, the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate from first nomination to final Senate action is also affected by many institutional and political factors. Various studies, for example, have concluded that how long lower federal court nominees wait in the Senate confirmation process, from first nomination to final action, is affected by such factors as the extent of ideological differences between the President and the opposite party in the Senate, or of interest group opposition to certain nominees. Other factors cited have been whether nominees had \"champions\" on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the point in a session when nominations arrived in the Senate, and the kind of ratings given nominees by the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Some of these factors might also contribute to other features of the confirmation process discussed in this report, for example, whether a nominee is ultimately confirmed, and, if so, whether he or she is confirmed by roll call vote rather than voice vote.", "The presence or absence of \"divided government\" (with the President and Senate majority of opposite political parties) also might influence the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate. One study concludes, however, that whether the President and Senate majority are of the same party or not, \"presidents continue to select judges according to the same criteria and the Senate confirms or does not confirm nominations according to the same criteria.\" Divided government, though, may affect the procedural strategies used to oppose a President's nominees. It has been suggested, for example, that Senators \"may rely on certain types of ... tactics during the confirmation process more or less depending on\" whether the party controlling the presidency is also the majority party in the Senate.", "Some factors might influence how quickly judicial nominations are processed at the committee level but not on the floor (and vice versa). For example, the role of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary in evaluating judicial candidates may be seen as a factor in the time that a circuit or district court nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee (but not in the time that a reported nomination is pending on the Senate Executive Calendar ). If the ABA committee's role is (as it usually has been over the decades) to evaluate judicial candidates before the President selects a nominee, then the ABA's evaluation does not add to the time between when the President makes a nomination and the Senate Judiciary Committee reports it. If, however, the ABA's role is (as it was during the G.W. Bush presidency) to evaluate only after a person has been nominated, then the time taken for that evaluation will add to the total time that the nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee.", "Another factor that affects the length of time it takes the Judiciary Committee to process a judicial nomination is the amount of information on a nominee that Senators and their staff review prior to holding hearings or reporting a nomination. Additionally, any committee member can request that a vote on a nomination be postponed for one week or until the next committee meeting, whichever is later. Consequently, final committee action on some nominations might be delayed when a recess or adjournment occurs.", "Once a nomination has been reported from committee, the time taken until final Senate action might be influenced by political or other factors not present (or minimally so) at the committee level. Even if a nominee is noncontroversial and received bipartisan support from the committee, significant delays in filling a judicial vacancy might occur when a judicial nomination, after having been placed on the Executive Calendar , is blocked for one reason or another from floor consideration by Senators through the use of \"holds,\" or objections to unanimous consent requests.", "Finally, another factor that might affect the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate (and, thus, judicial confirmation statistics) is the blue-slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as set by its chair. Under this policy, which dates back to at least 1917, the committee chair seeks the assessment of Senators regarding various nominations for offices related to their states, including those for U.S. district court judgeships, U.S. circuit court judgeships, U.S. attorneys, and U.S. marshals.", "In practice, the chair sends a blue-colored form to both home state Senators regarding judicial nominations related to their state. If a home state Senator has no objection to a nominee, the blue slip is returned to the chair with a positive response. If a Senator, however, has misgivings about the nominee and wants to stop or slow committee action, he or she can decide not to return the blue slip, delay returning it, or return it with a negative response. Most chairs of the Judiciary Committee have required a return of positive blue slips by both a state's Senators before allowing consideration of a nomination. ", "It should be noted, however, that the return of positive blue slips by both home state Senators does not always lead to a relatively speedy confirmation. During President Obama's first term, for example, circuit and district court nominations were reported by the Judiciary Committee only after home state Senators returned positive blue slips for the nominations. Nevertheless, the average (and median) time during which circuit and district court nominations waited on the Senate Executive Calendar before being confirmed, as discussed above, reached historically high levels (see \" Length of Time from Committee Report to Confirmation \").", "A new standing order in the 113 th Congress, however, might serve to facilitate negotiations arranging for floor consideration of district court nominations (circuit court nominations are not affected). Under a new procedure in effect for just this Congress, the Senate could move more quickly to final action on district court nominations supported by at least three-fifths of the Senate. Specifically, if cloture is invoked on a district court nomination in accordance with Rule XXII of the Senate, post-cloture consideration is reduced from a maximum of 30 hours to 2 hours. Generally, district court nominations are considered pursuant to unanimous consent agreements, in part because of the greater amount of time necessary to consider them through the cloture process in the absence of unanimous consent. The majority leader, when the new standing order was approved, indicated that the intent is to continue to negotiate unanimous consent agreements for the consideration of nominations. The ability to more quickly vote on district court nominations in the absence of unanimous consent, however, might facilitate unanimous consent negotiations and, therefore, reduce the waiting time from committee report to final Senate action for such nominations during the 113 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
