Formal negotiations between Washingtonand Pyongyang did not occur, however, during 2001. Following the 9/11 attacks, Bush linked NorthKorea to the war on terrorism by including it in the \"axis of evil\" along with Iraq and Iran in hisJanuary 2002 State of the Union address.

Prospects for successful talks were derailed when Assistant Secretary of StateJames Kelly reportedly presented the North Koreans with evidence of the program during a visit toPyongyang in October 2002. North Korea reportedly confirmed the allegations.

As the 1994 agreement faltered, the Administration stood by its conviction that the previousarrangement rewarded North Korea for bad behavior and failed to engage regional powers,particularly China, in enforcement. Pyongyang, meanwhile, insisted that direct talks withWashington were the only way to reach a resolution. Together with the Chinese, the Administrationset the stage for a multilateral forum to address the North Korean nuclear issue.

Because China isthought to be North Korea's top trading partner and source of aid, Beijing's cooperation wasconsidered crucial to any attempts by the international community to put economic pressure on thePyongyang regime. President Bush cultivated Chinese cooperation by addressing the nuclear issuewhen Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Crawford, Texas in October 2002, and later callingJiang directly to request his help in resolving the escalating crisis. On both occasions, Jiang statedChina's commitment to a non-nuclear Korean peninsula. China's new activism in diplomacycontinued under Jiang's successor Hu Jintao, who officially assumed the presidency in March 2003.

Officials within this group expressed hopeand/or expectations of a collapse of the North Korean regime. A second faction, mainly in the StateDepartment and NSC, was composed of officials with experience on East Asian and Korean issues.

The United States rejected this proposal, insistingon a complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear programs before entering into othernegotiations. The U.S. eventually countered with a proposal at the June 2004 talks, which wasloosely modeled on Libya's decision to abandon its nuclear weapons program in December 2003:a freeze of North Korea's weapons' program, followed by a series of measures to ensure completedismantlement, and, eventually, a permanent security guarantee and discussions on a return tonormal relations. In the interim, Japan and South Korea would provide heavy oil. The proposalclosely resembled one presented by South Korea earlier in the talks.

After thefirst two rounds of talks failed to produce breakthroughs, indications of frustration with the U.S.approach appeared among the other parties. In June 2004, China's deputy prime minister assertedthat the U.S. had not convinced Beijing that North Korea was pursuing a uranium program, asuggestion echoed by officials in South Korea. (6) At the G-8 summit in Sea Island the same month, Prime MinisterKoizumi urged President Bush to open up a productive dialogue with North Korea, stressing KimJong-il's readiness to find a resolution. Some speculated that this pressure led to the U.S. proposalat the June 2004 talks. China and Russia also reportedly voiced some support for allowing NorthKorea to use nuclear technology for \"peaceful\" civilian purposes, while the United States insistedthat all nuclear programs should be dismantled. Following the June meeting, the talks came to astandstill in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. In October 2004, during a trip to Asia bySecretary of State Colin Powell, both Chinese and South Korean officials criticized the U.S. position,calling for a more \"realistic\" and \"flexible\" approach to resolving the problem, without noting NorthKorea's rejection of the June U.S. proposal.
