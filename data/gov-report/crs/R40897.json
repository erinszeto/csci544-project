Concerns regarding congressional activities are typically considered in the context of the congressional environment. In the field of information management, however, they reflect broader issues related to the manner in which government and private information is created, assembled, distributed, and preserved. A number of issues arise due to significant transformations in the areas of printing, publishing, and information management. Those changes have been initiated as a consequence of the emergence in the past three decades of electronic publishing and distribution, which has expanded the means of information creation and delivery beyond mechanical compilation and production of documents that only exist on paper.", "Since its establishment in 1861, and until the emergence and integration of digital dissemination, the Government Printing Office (GPO) has compiled, formatted, printed, bound, and distributed documents that recorded the activities of Congress (and the work of other governmental entities) through a series of labor- and resource-intensive steps. Over time, the agency has integrated new technologies into its production processes as they became available, or were mandated. The enactment of P.L. 103-40 , the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 , required the production of electronic versions of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register , and provided authority for production and distribution of other government documents electronically. The act requires GPO to the \"extent practicable, [to] accommodate any request by the head of a department or agency to include \u2026 information that is under the control of the department or agency involved\" in its electronic directory and systems of online access. Arguably, that language does not bind Congress to make its materials available, since it is not a department or agency.

The bill funds three GPO accounts: congressional printing and binding (CPB); salaries and expenses of the Superintendent of Documents (S&E); and, on occasion, a small part of the revolving fund.

The data show that CPB spending has declined from $164.3 million in 1985 (2010 dollars) to $93.73 million in 2010.

GPO expresses the overall production of congressional documents in the number of pages produced for several categories of documents. Generally, page production is a function of congressional activity; more activity, which may result in an increase in the number or length of days in session, the number of measures introduced, or the number of hearings held, typically means greater demand for printing services and increases the volume of pages produced. As noted in congressional testimony, the number of pages necessary to meet demand varies by Congress and session, according to workload and activity on the floor. For example, the page volume for the Congressional Record and bills, resolutions, and amendments may be higher as more measures are introduced during the first session of a Congress than in the second session. GPO's page production categories include the following:", "Congressional Record, daily edition .

In addition, the Congressional Record is published in fewer paper formats than authorized, and fewer copies of those remaining formats are produced. These differences reflect Member needs. At the same time, the variable distribution of paper copies and the lack of explicit, readily identifiable authority to disseminate electronic versions of some congressional documents in statute governing congressional printing may call into question the capacity of current controls and processes to ensure systematic management by Congress of its published products.

Since FY1987, the daily edition has been printed in lower quantities than authorized. The number of both CPB-charged copies and agency and subscription copies have declined since FY1987, the earliest year for which such data are available.

The first was the introduction of electronic versions of material printed in the Congressional Record . In 1994, GPO first produced an electronic version of the daily edition as required by Congress under P.L. 103-40 . This likely contributes to reductions in the number of printed copies that began as commercial firms began providing material from the Congressional Record to their subscribers in electronic format prior to 1994. The ongoing decline is presumably attributable to users turning to the electronic version in greater numbers over time. The second event occurred in 1996, when the House ordered the elimination of distribution of CPB copies issued by House Members \"for constituent copies and by-law distribution of the Congressional Record . \" The House's actions appear to have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of copies produced by GPO from FY1996 to FY1997 and a corresponding decline in the number of copies distributed by Congress to other users. Figure 4 provides the distribution of CPB copies of the Congressional Record daily edition between 1987 and 2010.", "Similar differences between authorized levels and actual practices apply to other formats of the Congressional Record . For example, the bound edition is considered the official, permanent version, and is typically available within four years of the final adjournment of a Congress. 44 U.S.C. 906 authorizes the printing of approximately 2,400 bound copies of the Congressional Record ; in practice GPO prints about 345 copies, of which 92 are paid through CPB.

In practice, GPO notes that it prints the number of copies of congressional documents requested. In past debate on proposed amendments to appropriations bills to reduce or eliminate printing of the daily edition of the Congressional Record , congressional leaders have said that current levels of distribution to Congress are based on the availability of appropriations to cover the costs of congressional printing. If that is the case, the further reduction or elimination of printed copies may impair the ability of some Members from carrying out their duties. Congressional leaders have also noted that any efforts to change congressional printing practices must proceed through JCP rather than through appropriations bills.", "Officials at GPO suggest that much of the reduction in the number of printed congressional documents could be ascribed to the use of newer printing technologies, and migration by congressional documents users to information technologies that provide congressional information through electronic means. Those transitions have generally resulted in a smaller work force at GPO, a reduction in the number of printed copies produced, arguably, reduced paper consumption, and smaller appropriations. While overall printing costs have gone down, it is not clear that continued reduction in print runs would result in significant reductions of costs. In line with printing industry practices, GPO estimates that prepress processes, actions that must be taken before multiple copies can be made, make up approximately two-thirds of the cost of producing the daily edition of the Congressional Record . The balance is spent on printing, binding, and mailing of the finished copies. For FY2011, GPO estimates the cost of producing one page of the Congressional Record at $782. The agency allocates $532 (68.03%) for prepress, which GPO refers to as \"data preparation,\" and $250 (31.97%) for printing.", "In their budget requests, GPO does not provide estimates for other congressional products broken down by the cost of prepress and printing processes. Table 5 provides some the potential savings that might result by the elimination of the printed versions of several congressional products, based on the distribution of prepress and printing cost estimates for the Congressional Record . Since most of the prepress costs would be necessary to make the Congressional Record and other congressional documents available to users, whether in electronic or printed form, the extent of any statutory reduction in authorized printing levels or further reductions in the actual number of copies that GPO produces may result in somewhat modest cost savings. Any such cost savings may come at the expense of denying congressional materials to users who prefer the paper-based documents, or those who do not have access to electronic versions.", "Any effort to reduce the availability of centrally produced printed versions of congressional documents in favor of electronic delivery and storage may also raise concerns about the preservation and long-term ability to retrieve congressional records, and the need for reliable backup systems. While some of the printed records of Congress dating back to the First Congress (1789-1791) are retrievable in paper form, concerns have been raised about the ability to retrieve some electronic records created in the past few decades. Other related challenges might include the costs of document conversion as electronic document creation, management, and storage technologies evolve in a way that might not incorporate records and documents created with obsolete systems. Taken together, these concerns might raise questions about the long-term costs of a \"paperless\" system in comparison to the current hybrid process of making documents available in electronic and paper form.", "Of particular concern in the congressional environment could be the preservation of an official, definitive version of a document that is widely accepted by lawmakers, congressional officials, the executive branch, the courts, and the American public. Currently, GPO provides hard copies of the Congressional Record , legislative measures at various stages of consideration, related congressional documents, and laws passed by Congress. Similar materials are available electronically through the Legislative Information System (LIS) for congressional users, and through THOMAS, maintained by the Library of Congress, for the general public. Nevertheless, congressional rules require legislative measures to be signed by the Member sponsoring them before introduction, and the preservation of those original, official documents by congressional officials. The bound version of the Congressional Record , which may appear up to four years after the conclusion of a Congress, is considered, the official, archival product.

It is unlikely that the number of printed copies could be eliminated without legislation, since a number of paper copies must be preserved for archival purposes, and some users may prefer printed formats.
