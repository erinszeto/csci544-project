Given the importance of honey bees and other bee species to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a \"pollinator crisis\" has been occurring in recent decades.", "Over the past few decades there has been heightened concern about the plight of honey bees as well as other bee and pollinator species. Although honey bee colony losses due to bee pests, parasites, and disease are not uncommon, there is the perception that bee health has been declining at a faster rate both in the United States and globally in recent years. This situation gained increased attention in 2006 as some commercial beekeepers began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Since then, honey bee colonies have continued to dwindle each year, for reasons not solely attributable to CCD. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that CCD may not be the only or even the major cause of bee colony losses in recent years.

The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) reauthorized and expanded many of these provisions, addressing managed honey bees and native pollinators as part of the law's research, conservation, specialty crop, and miscellaneous title provisions. In addition, outside the farm bill, H.R. 4790 would promote conservation practices on millions of acres of highway rights-of-way by encouraging states to reduce mowing and plant for pollinators, providing improved habitat for pollinators and other small wildlife. Also, H.R. 2692 would suspend registrations of neonicotinoids and prohibit new registrations of any pesticide for use unless EPA determines the insecticide would not cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators, including honey bees and native bees as well as other pollinators.

Of the roughly 2 million bee colonies rented out each year to pollinate U.S. agricultural crops, an estimated 1.6 million colonies are needed to pollinate California's more than 900,000 acres of almond trees alone. Increasingly, bee colony rentals are also being used to pollinate cultivated blueberries in the East Coast states and in the Midwest. Other information indicates that bee colonies are also rented for apple, pear, plum, cherry, cranberry, avocado, cucumber, kiwi fruit, melon, pepper, and citrus fruit production, as well as for alfalfa, clover seed, and sunflower production.

", "Rental fees collected by commercial beekeepers for pollination services may vary by crop type, and tend to be lower for some seed crops and higher for berry and tree crops. In recent years, pollination fees paid by crop producers have increased. For example, fees paid by California's almond industry have risen from a reported $35 per colony in the late 1990s to about $75 per colony in 2005. More recent estimates of fees for pollinating almond trees are even higher, at $150 per colony or more ( Figure 2 ). Fees may also vary by region.", "Among the reasons for higher pollination fees are expanding almond acreage and relatively high honey prices, but also fewer available honey bees for pollination due, in part, to colony declines and bee mortalities.

Many plants can be pollinated by more than one species, and many bee species use more than one pollen or nectar source. As individual pollinator species (bees or other species) decline, other species may take over the declining species' role. Where the data are available, evidence suggests that, where a generalist bee species is able to step in to provide pollination services (even if less able than a specialist bee), the effects of a reduced bee population may be masked by the generalist. In more concrete terms, the presence of a highly efficient generalist\u2014like the honey bee\u2014may mask the loss of native species (regardless of the reason for the decline of the native species). If honey bees themselves then decline, the effects of the lost population may be more severe because populations of back-up pollinators have already been reduced or eliminated. And conversely, reductions in honey bee populations may reduce competition sufficiently to allow other (reduced) bee populations to rebound to greater numbers.", "Another study examined population changes in meliponine (or stingless) bees. Previously stingless bees were widely cultivated by Native Americans in Central and South America before the introduction of honey bees from Europe. However, loss of forest cover eliminates nesting sites; also the shift by beekeepers to honey bees for more intensive production has also reduced the number of stingless bees. An analysis of the effects of forestry on stingless bees in Brazil observed that most bee nests were found in hollow trees over 50 cm (~20 inches) in diameter. Given the high value of the bees as pollinators for many species of plants, and the low commercial value of hollow trees, the study recommended that managed forests maintain hollow trees as both seed sources and as homes for these bees. Some studies suggest that stingless bees are especially susceptible to some pesticides."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Bee Health", "paragraphs": ["Among the factors that are thought to be harming bee health are (listed in no particular order): ", "parasites , pathogens , and diseases (for a detailed listing, see text box); bee genetics including lack of genetic diversity and lineage of bees, and increased susceptibility and lowered disease resistance; miticide resistance ; diet and nutrition including poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, and pollen or nectar scarcity associated with invasive plants; bee management issues including transportation stress from migratory beekeeping, overcrowding, feeding practices, chemicals used by beekeepers to control mites (antibiotics and miticides), confinement and temperature fluctuations, susceptibility to disease, potential for cumulative exposure to diseases and parasites, use of bees for honey production versus pollination, chemical residue or contamination in the wax, and reliability of the queen source; habitat loss, and other environmental or biological stressors including loss of foraging area, interspecific competition between honey bees and native bees, pathogen spillover effects, and climate change; pesticides including acute or cumulative exposure to new types or combinations of agricultural pesticides through a variety of media including dust, water droplets, pollen, and nectar; other agricultural practices including the use of genetically incorporated pesticides in seeds or treated seeds, such as with bioengineered crops; and potential cumulative and interactive effects of each of these factors.", "Many of these factors were among those initially thought to be contributing to CCD. As outlined in USDA's 2011 progress report, the available research over the past years has led USDA and university researchers to conclude that \"no single factor or specific combination of factors has been identified\" as a 'cause' for CCD. This has led researchers to consider CCD may be \"a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically\"; it may also involve \"an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors.\"", "According to USDA: \"Despite a number of claims in the general and scientific media, a cause or causes of CCD have not been identified by researchers.\" However, CCD may not be the single leading cause of honey bee colony losses in recent years. USDA reports that in 2012/2013, \"there were more colonies that dwindled away\" rather than suffering from the onset of CCD, which is characterized by a sudden loss in bee colony populations. Whether colony loss is attributable to CCD may also be based, in part, on reported colony losses \"with no dead bees present, which is indicative of CCD\" (i.e., the absence of dead bees). USDA also claims that \"beekeepers did not report CCD as a major cause\" of overwinter losses in its 2012-2013 and 2011-2012 surveys.", "Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. The NRC study documents the extensive literature on honey bee population losses due to bee pests, parasites, pathogens, and disease. Most notable are declines due to two parasitic mites, the so-called vampire mite ( Varroa destructor ) and the tracheal mite ( Acarapis woodi ), and also colony declines due to the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae . Other reasons for bee colony declines reported by the NRC include interspecific competition between native and introduced bees, pathogen spillover effects, habitat loss, invasive plant species that reduce nectar- and pollen-producing vegetation, bee genetics, and pesticides, among other factors.", "Mite infestations are a relatively new occurrence. The 1980s saw two periods of large die-offs due to Varroa and tracheal mites: The first Varroa mite infestation was reported in 1987; tracheal mites were first detected in 1984. Varroa mites are also said to have eliminated most feral bee colonies in the mid-1990s. Varroa parasitism affects both worker bees and male larvae and can affect the ability of the queen to reproduce. It is associated with viral pathogens and if left untreated can cause colony mortalities usually within six months to two years after the initial infestation. Less is known about the effects of the tracheal mite. The pathogen Paenibacillus larvae is the most serious honey bee pathogen and causes American foulbrood (AFB), which is a disease of larval honey bees. AFB resulted in large colony losses in the 1940s, but its incidence has been reduced by the use of antibiotics and increased apiary inspection programs. Nevertheless, mite and pathogen infestations have likely raised beekeeper operating costs to pay for miticides and/or antibiotics, labor and expenses for treatment, improved management and inspection, and colony replacement of dead bees.", "According to USDA, the cost of mite controls and hive replacement every 1-2 years, as opposed to every 3-5 years previously, calls into question whether beekeeping on the United States will continue to be financially viable.", "Symptoms similar to those observed for CCD have also been described in the past, and heavy losses have been documented. It is still not clear whether the current colony losses are being caused by the same factors or if new contributing factors are involved.

Moreover, there is \"widespread resistance to the chemicals beekeepers use to control mites within the hive,\" and new virus species have been found in the U.S. and several of these have been associated with CCD. Need for Increased Genetic Diversity in Bee Colonies. Genetic variation improves bees' thermoregulation, disease resistance, and worker productivity in colonies, and bee breeding should emphasize traits (such as hygienic behavior) that confer improved resistance to Varroa mites and diseases. Need for Improved Nutrition for Honey Bee s . Nutrition has a major impact on individual bee and colony longevity, and a poor diet can make bees more susceptible to harm from disease and parasites. Bees need better forage and a variety of plants to support colony health, and federal and state programs should consider land management strategies that maximize available nutritional forage and to protect bees by keeping them away from pesticide-treated fields.
