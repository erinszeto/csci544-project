Upon receipt of the rejected bill, Congress is able to begin the veto override process, which requires a two-thirds affirmative vote in both chambers in order for the bill to become law. Pocket vetoes occur when the President receives a bill but is unable to reject and return the bill to an adjourned Congress within the 10-day period. The bill, though lacking a signature and formal objections, does not become law. Pocket vetoes are not subject to the congressional veto override process.", "Since the founding of the federal government in 1789, 37 of 44 Presidents have exercised their veto authority a total of 2,572 times.

Article I, Section 7 also provides the President with the power to veto, or \"forbid,\" the bill from becoming law. The President may sign a bill into law within the 10-day period (excluding Sundays), let the bill become law without signature, or veto the bill. ", "The Constitution states that when the President vetoes a bill, \"he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated.\" For example, if the President vetoes a bill that was introduced in the Senate, the bill will be returned first to the Senate where the possible override process would begin. This type of action is called a \"regular\" or \"return\" veto.

Because the Constitution does not state exactly how Congress should reconsider a vetoed bill, House and Senate procedures govern the specific treatment of acts returned by the President. Passage by a two-thirds margin in both chambers is required to override a veto before the end of the Congress in which the veto is received. If a two-thirds vote is successful in the originating chamber, that chamber informs the other of its decision to override the veto by message. Neither chamber is under any constitutional, legal, or procedural obligation to schedule an override vote.
