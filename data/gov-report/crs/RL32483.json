It requires 26 categories of major stationary sources of pollution\u2014including electric generating units (EGUs)\u2014in existence on the date of enactment (1977), but not more than 15 years old as of that date, to install \"best available retrofit technology\" (BART) if the state determines the source may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any class I area. A key contributor to regional haze is very fine particles (PM2.5), to which sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are important contributors. EGUs are major emitters of SO2 and NOx.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was directed to issue regulations to assure that State Implementation Plans (SIPs) required (1) reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal and (2) compliance with specific provisions, including the BART requirements. However, EPA delayed issuing regional haze rules, and in 1990 Congress amended the CAA's visibility requirements. EPA issued the final regional haze rule on July 1, 1999. Among its provisions, the rule required \"reasonable progress\" toward visibility improvement and a state BART implementation plan. For BART, states could alternatively propose a trading program\u2014but only if it achieved greater progress in improving visibility.", "The BART requirement's interaction with other air pollution control programs has become an issue\u2014most notably its relation to the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) designed to reduce emissions crossing state lines and hindering compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). CAIR involves controls on SO2 and NOx, focuses on EGUs as the most cost-effective source to control, and proposes using a trading mechanism to accomplish reductions. At issue is how the model CAIR trading program for EGUs interacts with the BART requirement for EGUs. In 2005, EPA made a final determination to exempt EGUs subject to the CAIR trading program from the Section 169A visibility BART program. Critics of EPA's proposal point out that Section 169A specifies protection of individual class I areas and that BART requirements would be more stringent than CAIR for individual sources; and they claim that overall, visibility improvements attributable to CAIR would not be adequate to meet CAA goals.", "EPA's effort to meld the visibility program with CAIR is consistent with its expressed desire to redirect CAA compliance strategies toward a market-oriented, cap-and-trade program, viewed by many as more cost-effective than direct regulation (such as BART). The Administration has proposed \"Clear Skies\" legislation to create a more integrated trading process for addressing SO2 and NOx emissions from EGUs, but it failed to be reported out of committee in the Senate. CAIR represents a regulatory initiative to achieve a step in coordinating certain CAA programs, but it may be that a statutory solution will be necessary.", "This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background to the Regional Haze Rule", "paragraphs": ["When amending the Clean Air Act in 1977, Congress added provisions focused on protecting the quality of clean air areas, and especially of national parks and other important national sites.", "Codifying regulations developed by EPA in 1974 and 1975, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program focuses on preventing further deterioration of air quality in pristine areas of the country by specifying how much increase in pollution levels is permitted. Mandatory class I areas\u2014those areas that receive the maximum amount of protection\u2014include most national parks, national wilderness areas, and national memorial parks, currently 156 areas. PSD regulations apply to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), particulates (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from new and modified sources of air pollution.", "Along with the PSD program for new sources, the Congress also added a new Section 169A, setting \"as a national goal the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing , impairment to visibility in mandatory class I Federal areas....\" PSD and Section 169A act in tandem, with PSD controlling new sources of impairment and Section 169A reducing emissions from existing sources of impairment. Under PSD, major new or modified sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and must install \"best available control technology\" (BACT); more stringent controls can be required if modeling indicates that BACT is insufficient to avoid violating an allowable PSD increment or the National Ambient Air Quality Standard itself. Under Section 169A, 26 categories of major stationary sources of pollution in existence on the date of enactment (1977), but not more than 15 years old as of that date, must install \"best available retrofit technology\" (BART) if the state determines the source may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in a class I area. Included in the list are electric generating units (EGUs).", "Implementing these provisions protecting visibility has not been easy, particularly Section 169A respecting existing sources. First, EPA had to define what visibility was. In general, visibility impairment from human activities manifests itself in two ways: (1) plume blight, where a clearly identifiable plume of smoke emanates from one or more sources; and (2) regional haze, where a uniform reduction in visual range occurs, or a layered discoloration by hovering bands of air tinged brown, yellow, or red. Second, EPA had to promulgate regulations within 24 months of enactment to assure that State Implementation Plans (SIPs) required (1) reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal mentioned earlier, and (2) compliance with several very specific\u00a0provisions, including the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for existing sources.", "EPA promulgated rules in 1980 to address visibility impairment that was \"reasonably attributable\" to a single source or small group of sources (i.e., plume blight). As with many air pollution regulations, these visibility regulations are implemented by states through SIPs. In general, the 36 states with mandatory class I areas were required to revise their SIPs to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal. The major elements of the regulation were (1) identifying existing sources causing visibility impairment and creating procedures for determining which existing stationary sources should be subject to BART requirements; (2) assessing potential adverse impacts from proposed new sources (or modified old sources) and recommending remedial actions via the New Source Review (NSR) process and the PSD program; (3) developing a 10-15 year long-term strategy to make \"reasonable progress\" toward the visibility goal; and (4) conducting visibility monitoring in mandatory class I areas.", "As noted, these regulations deal with plume blight only\u2014regional haze reduction was explicitly delayed until some future date. This lack of aggressive implementation of Section 169A extended to the implementation of the 1980 regulations as well. After 35 of 36 states missed the September 1981 deadline for final visibility plans, the Environmental Defense Fund sued the EPA in 1982 to implement the plume blight regulations. The suit was settled in 1984 with the EPA developing a phased-in schedule for compliance with a December 1986 deadline for states to revise their SIPs to include controls on existing sources that hinder visibility goals. This sequential implementation of plume blight regulations actually extended through 1989. So far, the only BART installation to occur under the 1980 regulations has been the installation of sulfur dioxide scrubbers at the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona in 1991.", "EPA's lack of initiative on visibility during the 1980s prompted the Congress to revisit the issue in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Those actions included a new Title IV, controlling precursors of acid rain and regional haze, and a new Section 169B. In some ways, Section 169B was a triggering mechanism to force EPA to move on Section 169A with respect to regional haze. Specifically, the 1990 Amendments required EPA to establish a Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) within 12 months of enactment (and other commissions upon its own discretion or petition from at least two states). Commissions were required to assess the scientific, technical, and other data available on visibility impairment from potential or projected emissions growth in the region. Based on those data, the commissions were to issue reports within four years to EPA recommending what measures, if any, should be taken to remedy such impairment. Within 18 months of receiving a commission's report, EPA was to carry out its responsibilities under Section 169A, including criteria for measuring \"reasonable progress\" toward the national goal. Finally, states affected by any regulations promulgated under Section 169A were required to revise their SIPs within 12 months of such promulgation.", "In 1991, a Visibility Transport Commission for the region affecting visibility in Grand Canyon National Park was established. In June 1996, this commission (consisting of the governors of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming, and the leaders of five Indian tribes) approved a set of recommendations for improving western vistas. There were nine primary recommendations, including increased energy conservation, use of renewable energy, and emission reductions from stationary sources. The commission's Baseline Forecast anticipated that current regulatory programs would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide from stationary sources (power plants, smelters, and other industrial sources) 13% by the year 2000, although additional measures under consideration might reduce emissions 20%-30%. In light of this uncertainty about the effects of current programs and the fact that emissions were projected to decline in the short term without additional regulation, the commission agreed to set only regional targets for sulfur dioxide emissions in the year 2000. The ultimate targets would be in the range of 50%-70% reduction by the year 2040, but \"interim targets may also be needed to ensure steady and continuing emission reductions and to promote investment in pollution prevention.\" If the targets are exceeded, this would trigger a regulatory program, probably including a regional cap on emissions, with market-based trading."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Regional Haze Rule", "paragraphs": ["The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required the EPA Administrator to take action under Section 169A within 18 months of receipt of a commission report.

Focused primarily on SO 2 emissions, which are a major component of regional haze, states set voluntary \"SO 2 milestones,\" instead of requiring BART. If the milestones are not achieved, then a back-up mandatory emissions trading program would be activated to ensure compliance with the milestones. The successor organization to the GCVTC, the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) submitted to EPA an annex to the commission's report in 2000 that identifies the voluntary SO 2 reduction milestones out to the year 2018, along with the back-up trading program details.

To implement the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, a monitoring network had to be established and three years of data collected before states could identify PM 2.5 nonattainment areas and begin the development of SIPs. Adhering to the separate schedules could lead some states to revising SIPs twice, once for visibility and then, a year or two later, for PM 2.5 attainment. As a result, EPA proposed that states preparing SIPs for attaining the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS combine it and their submittal of the regional haze SIP revisions.

But states classified as nonattainment under the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS will have three years after that designation to submit to EPA their revised SIP, allowing them to combine implementation of the regional haze rule with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS compliance.

In February 2002, the Bush Administration announced a \"Clear Skies\" multi-pollutant proposal that would amend the Clean Air Act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO 2 , NOx, and Hg. Implemented through a tradable allowance program, the emission caps would generally be imposed in two phases: 2008 and 2018. Although different in geographic scope, the Administration's Clean Air Interstate Rule and mercury rule are very similar in terms of reduction\u00a0requirements as Clear Skies. However, unlike EPA's \"suite of integrated air action,\" Clear Skies contains significant conforming language to avoid conflicts with other CAA provisions such as Section 169A. The Administration has stated its preference for Clear Skies over its regulatory approach.", "However, the Congress has yet to move any multi-pollutant proposal to the floor, nor has it given EPA broad authority to reconstitute regulatory approaches into market-oriented ones. EPA's combining of CAIR and BART represents a regulatory initiative to achieve at least a partial step in coordinating regulatory programs under a market-oriented approach. It is possible, however, that a statutory solution could be necessary."], "subsections": []}]}}
