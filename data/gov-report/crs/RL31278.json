Alternatively, Congress might choose to provide further protection forthe Refuge's biological and wilderness resources through statutory wilderness designation or tomaintain the current status of the area.

However, in twosections of ANILCA, Congress postponed a decision on wilderness designation of 1.5 million acresof the coastal plain (called the 1002 area ) -- a portion of ANWR thought to be rich in oil and gasresources -- and required the Department of the Interior (DOI, or Interior) to prepare a detailedstudy of the area and to recommend how it should be managed.", "Interior finished its detailed analysis of oil potential, wildlife resources, impacts, and mitigation measures in April 1987. In its report to Congress, DOI estimated then that the chance of recoveringeconomic quantities of oil at 19%, a figure that is very high by industry standards. The reportrecommended that the entire area be made available for leasing. The report and its recommendationgenerated controversy, as have virtually all subsequent reports on this topic. In intervening years,estimates of oil potential have varied, but enthusiasm for ANWR oil development remains strong,particularly in Alaska. Likewise, opposition to energy development continues to be strong, basedon concern for the area's wilderness values and wildlife. ", "Figure 1. Shaded Relief Map of Northeastern Alaska.

On the one side, if oil were found and developed, theadditional domestic supply would be seen as enhancing national security (although some opponentsof opening ANWR argue that the vulnerability of the TAPS pipeline to sabotage diminishes thenational security argument). Further, oil development would create several thousand short-term jobsin Alaska and elsewhere, and a substantial number of long-term jobs as well. The state wouldbenefit from additional royalty income, and many of Alaska's Native groups would benefit as well(though some would face threats to important subsistence resources).", "On the other side, many believe developing oil would irrevocably compromise the area's wilderness values -- defined as an area \"untrammeled by man.\" Some counter that the area hasalready been affected by man: there are a few remains of DEWLINE construction and a capped oilwell in the 1002 area. Some argue, too, that the coastal plain itself is not of a wilderness qualitymost would expect. The area is bounded on the south by the spectacular Brooks Range, but is itselfmostly flat or rolling -- a treeless tundra laced with shallow streams, most of which flow onlyduring the brief arctic summer.", "However, the apparently hostile nature of the area belies its national and international significance as an ecological reserve. It protects a virtually undisturbed, nearly complete spectrumof arctic ecosystems, and is one of the last places north of the Brooks Range that remains legallyclosed to development. Those who favor preservation argue that when the United States is servingas an international leader in the protection of vanishing ecosystems, development of the 1002 areawould not set a good international example. Thus, if oil development occurred, the issue wouldbecome how to ensure that development would be compatible, as far as possible, with the purposesof the wildlife refuge. ", "Developing oil in the harsh, fragile arctic environment is expensive and risky. Since oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, oil companies and government agencies have done much toreduce environmental impacts, e.g. , through reducing the size of drill pads, numbers of roads, andsize and location of support facilities; and through improving waste management. Depending onstatutory and regulatory requirements, and with proper investment, monitoring, and enforcement,energy companies could develop the 1002 area in ways that continue to reduce effects on plants andanimals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Choices Before Congress", "paragraphs": ["In the context of these tradeoffs, the spectrum of alternatives before Congress includes: ", "No action, which would maintain the status quo, which prohibits drilling for oil and gas throughout the refuge.", "Authorize leasing in the coastal plain of ANWR to proceed under the current regulatory requirements and capabilities of DOI.", "Allow leasing in the coastal plain of ANWR to proceed, but with special statutory and regulatory conditions, (which could be greater or less than currently required).

Companies may not discover economic quantities ofoil -- or any oil at all. If they do find economic quantities and development occurs, oil facilitieslikely would occupy only a small, though dispersed, portion of the total area; and it is unlikely thatoil would be produced until 7 to 12 years after any congressional approval of exploration. Drillingproponents argue that this long lead time is a reason for making a decision now.", "Assessing the Potential. Parts of Alaska's North Slope coastal plain have proved abundant in oil reserves, and its geology holds further promise. (1) Theoil-bearing strata extend eastward from the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), past theprolific Prudhoe Bay field and a few smaller fields, and may continue into and through ANWR's1002 area. Clearly, a key step in making a decision on ANWR is estimating how much oil mightbe there. Drilling (both exploration and confirmation), now prohibited, is the only method by whichthe 1002 area's petroleum potential can be ascertained with reasonable assuredness in the contextof the uncertainties of oil discovery.", "On its part, the Department of the Interior, without drilling, has issued assessments in 1987, 1991, 1995, and 1998 of the amount of oil and gas that might be present in ANWR. Those preparedafter 1987 have been based upon progressively newer geological data from outside ANWR and uponreinterpretation of previous information using improving techniques, and have changed estimatesof ANWR's oil potential.", "Two considerations might be noted at this point. One is that the projected price of oil is a key factor in estimating the amount of oil that might be economically recoverable. The second is thatthe larger the area open to leasing and resultant oil company participation, the more likely thatcompany bidding will give the government (the people of the United States) a larger return formaking resources accessible to private entities.", "ANWR Oil, U.S. Oil Consumption, and ANWR Gas. Based upon the results of the 1998 Interior Department assessment, the 1002area contains some of the most promising undrilled onshore geologic structures with petroleumpotential known in the United States. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that, at$24/barrel (in 1996 dollars), there is a 95% chance that 2.0 billion barrels or more could berecovered, and a 5% chance of 9.4 billion barrels or more. In comparison, the Prudhoe Bay fieldoriginally was estimated at 11-13 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil.", "Many argue that this large potential should be explored and developed to offset the decline in domestic oil production. Domestic production without ANWR is projected by the U.S. EnergyInformation Administration (EIA) in its base case to be down to 5.6 million barrels per day (bbl/d)by 2020 (from 5.8 million bbl/d in 2000), while consumption is projected to rise from 19.7 millionbbl/d to 26.7 million bbl/d. Other things being equal, domestic output without ANWR would supplyonly about one-fifth of U.S. consumption, with the rest coming from imports. Assuming a higherprice of $30 per barrel, it appears that potential peak output from USGS's \"low\" and \"high\" ANWRvolumes of economically recoverable oil at 300,000 and 1,575,000 bbl/d, respectively. These wouldrepresent a 5% and a 28% rise in U.S. output, respectively, at peak production.", "Possibly of greater importance are the gathering and transportation economics of both existing and prospective fields, which include the cost of shipment through the TAPS pipeline. Combinedproduction at Prudhoe Bay and other North Slope fields is now at only about half of its peak and isprojected to rise only slightly between 2000 and 2020. Development of and production from ANWRwould improve the commercial viability of currently producing North Slope fields by spreading theper barrel cost (maintenance and capital charges) of operating the pipeline over a larger number ofbarrels.", "The possibility of large amounts of natural gas in ANWR together with huge amounts of proven gas reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area (not being produced presently) may increase the appeal of oiland gas development of ANWR to energy companies. For economic reasons, natural gas generallyhas not been emphasized, but becomes more attractive as demand grows and prices rise. Construction of a pipeline to transport natural gas to North American markets and/or a warm waterport for shipping liquefied natural gas would be a necessary element.

Changes in the ecosystem could result from several facets of oil development. Majorintrusions would include large requirements for water and gravel; and the displacement anddisturbance of land, animals, and plants by pipelines, roads, airstrips, and other infrastructure. Thereis particular concern for caribou migration routes; calving and insect relief areas; migratory birdnesting and staging; effects of air and water pollutants; and direct and indirect effects of humanpresence. In addition, because of mixed ownership in the area, problems arise in how to establishand enforce controls on development.", "Infrastructure. The trend in North Slope energy development is toward compactness, reduction in numbers and mileage of roads, centralization orreduction of support facilities, reduction of hazardous wastes, and concentration of exploration andearly development activities in winter (when the frozen tundra makes cross-tundra travel possible,and when roads can be built from ice). Industry representatives now argue that the entire ANWRarea can be developed with only a 2,000 acre \"footprint.\" Opponents argue that the 2,000 acreswould be spread across the entire 1002 area, is achievable only if one fails to count some majorfacilities, and is misleading in any case, since effects of the area covered by gravel may extend wellbeyond even a broadly defined footprint. Limitation of the footprint has begun to be a major pointof congressional debate.", "Physical Environment. Much of the controversy over development of the 1002 area has focused on potential impacts on biological resources in thearea. However, if development occurs, there also would be impacts on the physical environment andresources of the area -- land, air, and water -- as a result of construction, operations, and humanhabitation. Currently, because the area is uninhabited (except for Kaktovik), the condition of thephysical environment has been characterized as pristine and nearly unaffected by human activity. ", "Exploration and development activities would alter the existing physical environment. For example, oil field operations would result in air pollution emissions. There would be need for largeamounts of water for drilling and ancillary activities, including construction of roads, drill pads, andairstrips. There likely would be impacts from both the mining and use of gravel as part of some ofthese activities. Exploration and development also would result in the generation of several typesof waste streams, both from industrial operations and domestic wastes, requiring disposal. At issueare the individual and cumulative effects of such alterations and the ability of the naturalenvironment to recover and be reclaimed when oil-related activities have ceased.", "Industry points out that companies use improved technology in the arctic today (compared with that used in the past for development of existing sites in the arctic region) which greatly reduces the\"footprint\" of operations and relies on practices that minimize and provide for better disposal ofwastes. The result is less direct and indirect impact in terms of habitat loss and environmentalcontamination. Moreover, numerous environmental protection requirements administered by federaland state authorities are intended to govern and regulate activities that might take place. Critics,however, are concerned about environmental effects of routine operations in the fragile 1002environment, as well as the possibility of leaks and spills of various contaminating substances, andwhether adequate safeguards would be adopted and enforced by regulators. Moreover, critics arguethat even careful development would lead to lasting changes in the fragile arctic environment.", "Alaska Native Ownership. Over 100,000 acres in ANWR are owned by Alaska Natives. The surface of more than 90,000 acres is owned by theKaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) and the subsurface of these acres is owned by the Arctic SlopeRegional Corporation (ASRC). The remaining 10,000 plus acres are owned by individual Natives. Some of the 100,000 acres are within the legal description of the 1002 area; some also lie along thecoast but are legally described as outside the 1002 area, and all 100,000 acres are within the Refugeas a whole. Regulation of development on these lands is problematic and is often not consideredexplicitly in legislative proposals. (See CRS Report RL31115 , Legal Issues Related to ProposedDrilling for Oil and Gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .)", "Special Areas. Wildlife experts are particularly interested in threats of development to several sensitive or special areas. For example, on thesouthern edge of the coastal plain, Sadlerochit Spring is of great biological importance because itnever freezes. Other areas include the southeast portion of the coastal plain, where caribou calvingis particularly likely to occur; certain staging areas for snow geese; riparian areas important to muskoxen; deep rivers and lakes important to overwintering fish; and denning or nesting sites of bears andraptors, to name a few.", "Secondary Development. Also of concern are the effects of possible spin-off development both in Kaktovik, an Alaska Native settlement andDistant Early Warning Line (DEWLINE) station on Barter Island just off the coast, and on otherNative lands within the Refuge. Kaktovik could be a staging area for oil operations. Suchdevelopment could compromise wildlife and other environmental values. Currently, Deadhorse (atPrudhoe Bay, the oldest support center), the Kuparuk Industrial Center (west of Prudhoe Bay), andto some extent Alpine (a very modern oil development west of the Kuparuk oil field, with much ofits support activities reduced or taking place elsewhere) offer alternate examples of how servicesupport areas might be handled. Deadhorse was left mostly to private decisions, and its sprawl andcontamination problems led to the more compact, controlled approach at the Kuparuk Facility. Stilllater, the Alpine field essentially eliminated the need for some kinds of additional support facilities,reduced the physical size of some of the remaining facilities, and shifted still other operations toother sites by flying material in and out or carrying other equipment in on winter ice roads. In the1002 area, facility reduction might continue, and some needs might be shifted to Native lands withinand near the 1002 area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Whether strict statutory and regulatory controls and strong government enforcement could protect wildlife values to the satisfaction of those opposing development is open to question.

New data exist to show that such an intensive presence couldlast many decades after activity ceases. Complete removal of all infrastructure seems unlikely, andresulting water flow patterns might not even make it desirable.

Its mean estimate of economically recoverable oil was 3.2 billionbarrels, and the report predicted the area could supply about 4% of total U.S. demandin 2005, and reduce imports by nearly 9%. (See Oil Potential , below, for updates ofthese figures.) It estimated total national economic benefits of $79.4 billion andfederal revenues of $38.0 billion. It assumed that oil would be selling at $33/barrelin 1984 dollars by 2000. (In actuality, West Texas Intermediate, a benchmark crudeoil, sold from about $25.50 per barrel to about $34.50 per barrel in 2000, which wasabout $20.30 to $27.50 in 1984 dollars.) ", "The FLEIS also said the \"1002 area is the most biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge for wildlife and is the center of wildlife activity.... The areapresents many opportunities for scientific study of a relatively undisturbedecosystem.\" It analyzed the effects of the various development alternatives on theplants and animals, and especially on the calving grounds of the Porcupine CaribouHerd (PCH). It stated that \"major effects on the PCH could result if the entire 1002area were leased and all prospects contained economically recoverable oil\" (p. 123). It concluded that full leasing would lead to reductions in bird nesting habitat, loss ofover-wintering fish habitat, and loss of polar bear denning habitat. It also predictedmoderate effects on polar and grizzly (brown) bears due to direct mortality relatedto human encounters; and recommended buffer zones of at least 0.5 miles aroundknown polar bear dens.

Midwestern interestsfavored it because of the prospective economic gain. Opponents contended that suchroutes were very long, and therefore would cost more and take longer to build. Oilprices had not reached levels sufficient to justify further investigation.", "The third route was ultimately chosen: oil is shipped via TAPS south to the seaport of Valdez on Prince William Sound, then loaded on tankers destined for otherports.

The MineralLeasing Act of 1920 prohibits export of oil transported through pipelines grantedrights-of-way over federal lands (30 U.S.C. 185(u)). There was considerableopposition to the export of North Slope oil and many saw a growing domestic needfor the oil in late 1973 as a result of the Arab oil embargo (imposed during theArab-Israeli War of October 1973), and of the gasoline shortages (resulting frompetroleum allocation regulations).

(19) As a result ofavoiding the trip through Panama,Alaskan oil would gain higher prices (net of transportation costs) if sold in Japan. DOE predicted that higher resulting prices on the West Coast would spur additionalproduction. In addition, the study found, exporting North Slope oil would stimulateimports of crude oil better suited to California's petroleum product demand mix. However, the study acknowledged, exporting Alaskan oil would divert cargoes awayfrom the U.S. domestic merchant marine fleet and workforce.

The President may impose terms andconditions; and authority to export oil may be modified or revoked. Beginning with36,000 bbl/d in 1996, ANS exports rose to a peak of 74,000 bbl/d in 1999.

This section highlights how the leasing process wouldnormally work, and some of the leasing issues that might be considered by Congressin legislation to open ANWR. ", "In the leasing phase as it is carried out under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, (28) BLM gathers information about an area of federal land, based on data from federalagencies and industry submissions. The leasing phase involves a series of decisionsand actions by the federal government and by oil corporations, with each decision oraction influencing the next. Then BLM determines how much, and what specificlands would be offered. Generally, BLM offers federal leases on a competitive basis,though non-competitive leases may be offered in some circumstances. BLM solicitsbids on the tracts, selecting the winning companies based on these bids. Competitiveleases would probably be the norm in the 1002 area. The entire process, from initialpublic notice, to sales, and to any production, with public input along the way,generally requires several years. Broadly speaking, Congress may choose to passlegislation which entirely replaces the normal processes for leasing on other federallands, or may selectively override, or substitute for, some of those processes. Thefollowing is an abbreviated outline of the steps in a competitive oil or gas lease sale.It indicates as well the areas in past bills where there were proposed changes fromcurrent practices. ", "Leasing must be in accordance with relevant land management plans, such as those for National Forests or for BLM lands, but an analogous plan does not exist forANWR, though the 1987 FLEIS carried out some of the same functions. These plansare developed with public input and information, as did the FLEIS. Even if thefederal lands in question are not subject to general land management planning, theNEPA processes or special statutory provisions may provide opportunity for publicparticipation. If ANWR were opened to leasing, Congress might choose to specifythat some of these planning steps, or measures for public participation, be includedin the ANWR leasing process. Alternatively, given past reviews such as the FLEIS,it might override some or all of the NEPA process. (See Compliance with NEPA ,below.)", "The Director of BLM may elect to accept formal or informal nominations of lands to be leased. If nominations are to be accepted, a company would normallynominate more land than those areas it felt most promising, in order to conceal itsintentions and avoid excessive attention by future competitors on what it believes arethe best prospects. In the case of ANWR, it seems highly likely that formalnominations would be part of any leasing process, and measures to provide forformal nominations have been included in bills in previous Congresses. In decidingwhich (if any) nominations to make, companies would already be considering factorssuch as likely operating costs, future oil prices, and alternative or perhaps moreattractive prospects in the United States or elsewhere. In Alaska, the North Slope'sgenerally high operating costs would tend to be an especially important considerationas companies decided which tracts to nominate. Those companies with pastexperience elsewhere on the North Slope might be more interested in participatingthan those lacking such experience. ", "BLM would use the nominations and other information to determine how much land to offer (if this is not set in legislation) and in what tract sizes. (29) For example,the geology of the area is markedly different on either side of the Marsh Creekanticline (see Figure 5 ), and the agency might wish to recognize that in some wayin its selection of tracts. In previous Congresses, bills have often directed a particularschedule, usually setting a fairly fast pace for the initial and subsequent leaseofferings. BLM would not normally choose to offer millions of acres for bidding atonce, but instead offer portions over a number of years, using previous discoveriesand geologic information to determine future offerings. ", "At the time of any offering, BLM would also specify terms or conditions that may apply to particular tracts. These conditions might include, in the case ofANWR, limits on surface occupancy, size of footprint, seasonal availability toexploration, wildlife protection measures, reclamation standards, and the like. Congress could also specify particular terms or conditions in legislation to open the1002 area to development, and these terms and conditions could be a major vehiclefor environmental protection measures in the 1002 area. (Though these terms andconditions might not necessarily apply to Native lands; see Alaska Native Lands andRights , below.) It would be essential for industry to have a firm idea of the terms andconditions of a lease, since these provisions would likely affect the cost of operatingthe lease, and therefore the amount a company might be willing to bid for the tract. Leases under the Mineral Leasing Act are for 10 years and continue as longafterwards as oil and gas is being produced commercially; Congress could chooseany length for the leases.", "Under current law, on the date of a competitive sale, oral bidding takes place at a specified location. Competition among companies is based on the size of theirup-front offer, called the bonus bid . A bonus bid is required to be at least $2 peracre, but bonus bids can total many millions of dollars for some tracts, while othersmay receive no bid at all. Payment of the bonus bid will occur at a point when thewinning bidder cannot yet be certain that oil will be present. As a result, even anANWR utterly devoid of commercial oil deposits might still earn millions of dollarsfor the federal government, whether oil is ever produced or not. According to BLM,leases on other federal lands are granted \"on the condition that the lessee will haveto obtain BLM approval before conducting any surface-disturbing activities.\" (30) Congress may choose to specify certain conditions or modifications on therequirement for this final step after a lease is sold and before construction of roadsor drilling platforms.", "In a typical lease under the MLA, a successful bidder must pay $1.50/acre in rent for its tract(s) in the first 5 years, and $2.00/acre thereafter. The first year'srental payment, plus the minimum bonus bid and a $75 administrative fee is due onthe date of the sale. The remainder of the bonus bid must be received within 10 workdays. Subsequent rental payments are due on the anniversary date of the lease. Inaddition, once production starts, companies pay a standard 12.5% royalty on the saleof the oil they produce. Leases expire after 10 years unless production or specifiedsteps toward production are occurring. Lessees may also voluntarily surrender thelease, subject to requirements concerning abandonment of wells, clean up, and anyfinal payments that may be owed. Generally speaking, few bills in previousCongresses have treated an ANWR leasing program in this level of detail (save fora willingness to specify a 12.5% royalty rate). Instead, development bills usuallydirect the Interior Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out theleasing program in order to carry out the provisions of the legislation.", "Frontier Variations. In a typical frontier area, where energy leases have been rare to non-existent, and geologicalknowledge is sparse, BLM might allow companies to conduct seismic exploration inthe general area before specific tracts are designated. (ANWR is not typical,however, because ANILCA had specific exploration provisions for the 1002 area.) Once the sale tracts have been named, further exploration might take place. Congressmight specify whether additional exploration could occur before nominations wererequired. However, due to the seasonality of North Slope exploration, this choicecould lengthen the time required to make a first lease offering. In the NPR-A (whichhas its own distinct regulations), this exploration occurred for the first lease sale;exploration took place during the arctic winter, and companies focused on dataanalysis once melted tundra made the area inaccessible. Far more exploration thentook place on leased tracts, in order to help the companies select specific drill sites.", "In addition, in frontier areas such as NPR-A and elsewhere, the NEPA impact assessment process is occurring both before and during preparation for the sales. Afull EIS can add substantially to the time required to carry out a sale, even if it occursconcurrently. Congress has, in several ANWR development bills, shown awillingness to modify or eliminate NEPA requirements, on the basis that the 1987FLEIS fulfilled that function.", "Thus, a leasing phase may overlap substantially with an exploration phase. In the 1002 area, while both of these phases might be shortened by reducingrequirements for environmental review, for example, there is a limit to how much theprocess might be truncated. Furthermore, in the arctic, current technology limitsexploration to the winter season only. Since BLM would wish to consider the viewsof industry in selecting the tracts to be offered -- views that will take time andfurther exploration to develop -- this too could lengthen the leasing process.", "Leasing on National Wildlife Refuges. A factor which Congress might consider, should it decideto open ANWR, would be the special circumstances that apply to leasing part of aNational Wildlife Refuge, since leasing would normally have to be determined to be\"compatible\" with the major purposes of the National Wildlife Refuge System andwith the purposes of the particular unit of that System. (See Compatibility withRefuge Purposes , below.) While energy leasing does occur in the National WildlifeRefuge System, it occurs in less than 10% of refuges, and in virtually no instance hasleasing occurred after a compatibility determination. (See Box for examples.) IfCongress wished ANWR development to occur as expeditiously as possible, it couldoverride the compatibility test. In previous Congresses, bills have expresslyaddressed the potential conflict by stating that Congress has determined energyleasing to be compatible with the purposes for which ANWR was designated.

The exploration phase is the time at which industry and the federal governmentaccumulate data about the area that will be, or has already been leased. Explorationactivity is most intense after leases have been purchased. Preliminary seismicexploration, using two dimensional (2-D) imaging technology, continues to be usedin early exploration in new areas. It is carried out directly across frozen tundra(without special ice roads) in widely spaced grid lines. Seismic exploration usestrains of rolligons (large vehicles with enormous soft tires that spread their weightevenly across the surface) for vibrating the surface and recording the result, plusvehicles for carrying fuel, mechanical repair facilities, and a crew of 80 to 120people. Damage in the area around Prudhoe is prevented by waiting until the tundrais well-frozen, though tractors with heavy rubber treads are required to pull some ofthe heavier equipment. For the much less expensive, but less precise 2-D surveys,lines may be several miles apart, but for the high accuracy of 3-D seismic, lines areabout 1100 feet apart. More exploration using 3-D seismic technology becomeseconomic in defining more precisely the boundaries of potential structures, thoughdrilling may occur based on 2-D alone. Under the more advanced 3-D technology,finer grid lines are also run directly across the tundra. The better data resulting from3-D increase the chance that a given well will be successful from 1 in 10 to perhaps3 or 4 in 10. ", "Modern arctic exploration on the state-owned lands of the North Slope is carried out in winter; while early phases involve travel across frozen open tundra, subsequentexploration drilling uses a combination of ice roads, and ice pads. Each mile of iceroad uses an estimated one million gallons of liquid water, and road builders typicallytransport liquid water no more than 10 miles, since it may freeze before it is used. Technical solutions to water shortages could involve greater use of chipped icescraped from lakes to supplement liquid water, and/or development of newtechnologies using a desalination plant and a heated elevated pipeline. (31) Though suchtechnologies could prove feasible and some are already in use on the North Slope,they could also change the economics of exploration and later development. ", "If data indicate economic quantities of oil may be present, a hole is drilled entirely in winter, on thick insulated pads of frozen water. These pads melt insummer, leaving the tundra in relatively good condition. (32) If no commercial quantityof oil is found, the pipe is plugged and temporarily or even permanently abandoned,covered by a small cube-shaped building. Use of these methods, in comparison tothe technology available in 1987, can substantially reduce impacts of exploration onthe landscape.

(See Figure 4, showing the Alpine field.) Two gravel pads,linked by a 3-mile long combined road and runway, support 112 wells. Heavyequipment to be used in the field was delivered to the nearest staging area in summervia gravel road. Once winter ice roads were built, the equipment was transported tothe field. In summer, access to Alpine is by aircraft only.

These advances contribute toefficiency and often to reduced environmental impacts, and some would likely beused, required or not, due to cost savings. Others might be used if required by thefederal government or the state; such requirements could change the economics ofdevelopment. One clear improvement since 1987, as a result of improved dataanalysis at the exploration phase, is that development can be more efficient, sincefewer \"dry holes\" are likely to be drilled. Other improvements are as follows.", "Advanced Drilling. Drilling technology has evolved from a single hole straight down into a prospect, todirectional, extended reach, horizontal, multilateral, and designer wells. All of thesedesigns permit more efficient production of hydrocarbon reserves, and allow easierconnection to production facilities, with fewer pipelines. They also reduce thenumber of wellheads. Drill bit technology has improved, allowing wells to be drilledfaster. Drilling muds are less toxic; cuttings generated during drilling can be storedin temporary reserve pits and then used in construction, or reinjected into specialwells for waste disposal. (34) Efforts are made toavoid any surface discharge of wastes. Savings make it likely that these technologies would be used if ANWR were opened;legislative provisions might push further requirements.", "Drill Pads. With this advanced drilling technology, more of the oil-bearing structure can be tapped from a well head,and drill pads can be located, under very favorable conditions, up to 7 miles inhorizontal distance from a target. These technologies reduce development'sfootprint, as well as allow greater protection of surface features. Since each drill padcan develop a greater area, fewer drill pads are needed than in the past. Technologiesdeveloped largely in the 1990s also permit closer spacing of wells, and morewellheads can be placed on a smaller drill pad. Drill pads in the 1970s were about44 acres. In contrast, Alpine's 2 drill pads are 36 acres and 10 acres. (35) The largerpad is the main production pad, and includes a central processing facility, housing,and storage area, along with wellheads. The secondary pad contains only drillingfacilities and wellheads; workers there commute from the main pad. If the PrudhoeBay oilfield and surrounding fields had been developed using this technology, only4,000 acres, instead of the present 12,000 acres, would be needed. (36) Productionfacilities (like those at Alpine) would be scattered in a network over producing fields,due to the 7-mile maximum reach of horizontal drilling, and multiple pads could beneeded for producing fields. (Pipelines would carry oil from the pads to a collectionline; see Production Phase .)", "Roads. If a development phase followed the model at Alpine, heavy equipment would be carried to a staging area asnear as possible to the drill site and accessible to the gravel road network thatservices the currently developed areas. As soon as ice roads could be built, theequipment would be moved to the drill site, where a gravel pad would have beenconstructed previously. All heavy equipment would be transported to the site duringthe winter; equipment needed in the summer would be flown in along with personnelto an adjacent airstrip. As at Alpine, gravel roads might be constructed to link padswithin the same field.", "If this model were followed, the mileage of roads constructed in the 1002 area would be far smaller than was expected in the 1987 FLEIS (for a given size andlocation of discovery). Heavy reliance on ice roads could mean high demands forwater if the staging area were just to the west of the 1002 area and discoveries werein the eastern portion of the 1002 area -- a distance of roughly 100 miles. Alternatively, staging areas could be located farther east, perhaps by off-loadingbarged equipment at Kaktovik. Water demands might be further reduced, perhapsby developing new technologies, or by placing gravel roads to transport heavyequipment on Native lands. The feasibility of these options would also depend onthe extent to which Congress regulated development on Native lands (as opposed tofederally-owned land).", "Figure 4. Alpine Oil Field.

The footprint of development infrastructure is the area within the outline of any structureson the surface of the land as these features might be shown on an ordinary twodimensional map. In the case of arctic energy development, most observers appearto include gravel drill pads, runways, and roads in the total footprint of development. However, in the case of elevated pipelines, some might choose to count only the baseof the support arms holding aloft the pipelines (footprint in the narrow sense), ratherthan the entire length and width of the pipeline (footprint in the broad sense). (37) Somewould also count the surface covered by gravel mines, ports, water impoundments,water treatment facilities and the like (footprint in the broadest sense).", "Arctic Power (a consortium of development proponents that includes industry) has estimated that the 1.5 million acre 1002 area could be developed with amaximum footprint of 2,000 acres. (38) Some haveassumed that the footprint wouldbe a single compact unit of 2,000 acres (equivalent to 3.125 square miles -- about0.13% of the 1002 area). However, full development would be impossible if thefootprint were a single compact unit. With advanced drilling technology (extendedreach drilling), under favorable circumstances, lateral drilling can reach 5 to 7 milesfrom a drill site. Thus, if development were confined to a compact box of 3.125 mi 2 (equivalent to a square 1.77 miles by 1.77 miles) and optimum conditions obtained,up to 10.5% of the 1002 area could be developed. In contrast, full development ofthe 1002 area would require the strategic placement of pads, connector roads (thetype of road at Alpine), and pipeline supports to be scattered about the 1002 area ina network.", "Most development advocates do not oppose a surface occupancy, or footprint, limitation to 2,000 acres, apparently feeling that such a limit based on a definitioncovering pads, airstrips and pipe supports would not hinder full development. Evenif the term footprint were expanded to include connector roads like that at Alpine(where the road represents about 15% of the gravel surfaces), they do not appear toconsider a 2000-acre limit to be overly confining. If, however, gravel mines, watercatch basins, water treatment plants, ports, causeways, and other possible features(FLEIS, p. 99), were to be built and included in a 2,000-acre limit on footprint (thebroadest definition of the term), and if geology of the fields required more numerousor widespread wells, there appear to be three possible responses to the problem: (1)facilities might be modified (perhaps through improved technology) in order to staywithin a 2,000-acre limit; (2) some otherwise economic prospects might be missed;or (3) the footprint limitation might be modified in some way. Finally, if legislationdid not apply limitations to Native lands, some additional prospects on federal leasesmight be developed from pads within these Native lands by using advanced drillingtechnologies. Support facilities also could be located on the Native lands within theRefuge and as a result avoid an acreage limitation, if legislation did not specificallyinclude such lands in the limitation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Production Phase", "paragraphs": ["In a production phase, drilling equipment would be removed, and small buildings (housing oil pumps) would be installed and connected to pipelines and, forthe 1002 area, ultimately to TAPS.

Compact factory-manufacturedproduction facilities would be transported to the site instead of built on site. Depending upon conditions, slim-hole or coiled tubing drilling would be used.

Alaska has enacted legislation that bans construction of a gas pipeline in northernstate waters. The Alaska state legislature strongly supports proposals for a pipelineto the south. While the royalties to the state (for those natural gas resources actuallyowned by the state) would be higher under the shorter, less costly northern route,thereby making the wellhead prices higher, (62) stateofficials see a greater gain throughthe income multiplier effect of construction within the state and greater access byAlaskan communities to the new gas supplies. Also at issue is the fact that aCanadian route would likely serve new Canadian gas fields, which would thencompete with Alaska in U.S. markets. This, together with the factors cited above,suggests a potential conflict between maximizing energy company profits andbenefits to the state.", "Canadian Position on Natural Gas Pipeline. Canada supports a natural gas pipeline that wouldtravel from Alaska through Canada. The Canadian government has not taken a standon which of the two possible Canadian routes it might prefer; affected provincialgovernments all support routes through their jurisdictions. The over the top routecould make some natural gas deposits in the Yukon and Northwest Territorieseconomically viable. In either case, Prime Minister Chr\u00c3\u00a9tien has expressed Canada'sinterest in selling more oil and natural gas to meet U.S. energy needs. (Some haveargued that this interest has intensified Canadian opposition to ANWR development.) ", "However, the Canadian government has expressed deep concern that price supports to encourage development of the pipeline could damage or even endCanadian natural gas sales to the United States. The Premier of the NorthwestTerritories, Stephen Kakfwi, fears that price supports might even flood westernCanada with sufficient cheap natural gas to shut down the area's own natural gasproduction.

The U.S. economy as a whole would be affected bydevelopment and production of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge throughthe direct effects of the economic activity constituted by the development andproduction itself. The economy would also be indirectly affected by any change inoil prices resulting from ANWR production and any effects on the amount spent onimported oil. A major unknown and driving factor is the amount of economicallyrecoverable oil discovered and eventually produced. (64)", "Development Stimulus. Oil and gas development in ANWR would generate primarily mining, construction,manufacturing, and transportation activity, but also many types of other supply andsupport services such as food, fuel, power, and management services. Such demandfor goods and services equipment would be felt in the lower 48 states as well as inAlaska.", "Major determinants of the cost of developing ANWR, and its direct stimulus, would be the size of any overall discovery of economically recoverable oil resourcesand the sizes of the individual fields containing such resources. There are highdegrees of uncertainty in both areas. (See Table 2.) ", "The USGS estimates also have very wide ranges with respect to oil field sizes. Among the larger sizes, which oil companies probably would consider first, theestimates show a 95% chance of three or more fields and a 5% chance of six or morefields with 256-512 million bbl of technically recoverable oil; a 95% chance of oneor more fields and a 5% chance of four or more fields with 512-1,024 million bbl;and a 95% chance of a field of three-tenths of a field or more and a 5% chance of oneand a half fields or more with 1,024-2,048 million bbl. (65) Each company would havedata on 1002 area prospects from its preliminary exploration and comparisons withexisting information; it would then select the most attractive prospects based uponits own interpretation of geologic data, its own resource assessment, and its ownfinancial criteria. Smaller fields probably would become attractive if and when largerfields were developed and infrastructure was in place.", "Thus, if commercial oil fields were discovered, they most likely would be of different sizes and the collective overall quantity of economically recoverable oilcould be in a very wide range. And, given that the size of a possible overalldiscovery is unknown, estimations of the overall cost of developing ANWR arehypothetical.", "Advances in arctic oil and gas development technology, equipment, and facility configuration reduce both the extensiveness of facilities and the development cost perbarrel of discovery. (66) These advances have madesuch development more capitalintensive onsite and moved more labor offsite, to locations where data analysis isperformed. A very crude benchmark to use as a basis for estimating the outlays thatwould be entailed is the roughly $1 billion cost of developing the Alpine field, whichhas about 430 million bbl of reserves. (67) Alpineis a recently developed field on theNorth Slope of Alaska that employs advanced arctic technologies. However, Alpineis appropriate as a cost benchmark only to the extent that the geological conditions,pristineness, and accessibility of the hypothetically discovered fields at ANWR weresimilar to those at Alpine. (68)", "Two illustrative hypothetical cases might be as follows: (1) A discovery of 2.40 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil in four 100-million bbl fields, three200-million-bbl fields, two 400-million-bbl fields, and one 800-million-bbl field. (2)5.24 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil in six 200-million-bbl fields, four400-million-bbl fields, two 800-million-bbl fields, and one 1,200-million-bbl field. (69)", "In the first case if, hypothetically, the fields associated with an overall 2.40-billion-bbl discovery of economically recoverable oil are of the same nature anddegree of difficulty to develop as Alpine, and if, as is unlikely , development costs forANWR are proportional to field size (using Alpine as the benchmark), totaldevelopment cost of an ANWR discovery of that size would approximate $6.5billion. With identical caveats for a 5.24-billion-bbl overall discovery, totaldevelopment cost of that overall discovery would approximate $14.0 billion. (70) Atroughly $2.70 per barrel discovered ($14 billion \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 5.24 billion bbl), thesehypothetical estimate totals, which may well exclude exploration costs, appear low. In recent years, major oil companies have experienced onshore finding costs of about$5.25 per barrel (with exploration costs accounting for about one-third), based uponEnergy Information Administration (EIA) surveys, (71) but such costs have beendeclining over time.", "Oil Market Response. Other things being equal, an increase in production, or supply, would be expected to result in aprice decline (or a lower price than would occur otherwise). The size of the declinewould depend to some extent on how close world oil output would be in relation toworld oil production capacity and upon the reaction of other suppliers to the market.", "As noted above, peak production from any economically recoverable volumes of 2.03 billion and 9.37 billion bbl at $24 per barrel (72) probably would be reached inabout 2020, and would range from roughly 300,000 to 1,400,000 bbl per day. EIAprojects world oil production to total 106.6 million bbl per day in 2015. (73) Thus,ANWR production (from the respective discovery volumes) at their peaks around theyears 2013-2015 would range from about 0.3% to 0.9% of world output.", "Opponents of ANWR have suggested that potential ANWR resources are equivalent to U.S. daily demand for oil for a matter of just months. (74) This does notconsider the role which any incremental source of petroleum plays in markets, whichare dynamic. Consequently, the impact of ANWR production on world oil prices islikely to be variable depending upon market and political factors prevailing in themoment. For proponents of development, the oil shocks to the market in 1973-74,1979-80, 1991, and 2000-2001 tend to loom large. ", "However, a review of the nearly thirty years since the time of the Arab oil embargo and first oil price shock in 1973 suggests that it is more accurate to see thisnearly thirty-year period as one of general price and supply stability that isperiodically broken with shorter episodes when price became volatile and suppliesof fuel less certain. During any of these episodes, even an additional 100,000 bbl/dayof refined product in certain regional markets might have eased prices. (75) In times ofuncertainty -- and even at the low range of estimates of potential ANWR production -- these volumes might help contain a short-term spike in prices. In these moments,it matters little whether the incremental supply comes from a field holding sixmonths' national demand, or sixty years' potential supply, because the price ofproduct at the pump will not discriminate between the two.", "Some argue that ANWR production could result in lower world oil prices if supply in the world market were relatively tight in 2015 and the market wasreasonably competitive. In a period of general stability and balance in supply anddemand, production from ANWR at the lower range of the estimates would probablyhave a small effect on prices. There is also the prospect that, depending upon marketfactors and their internal economies, OPEC and other producers could cut theiroutput to offset the supply effect of ANWR, as has occurred before. This woulddepend upon the commitment of OPEC nations to try to support or defend a priceband for crude oil by cutting production, as they did three times in 2001. At the sametime, internal revenue needs have sometimes prompted producing nations to selloutput above their quotas. Additional oil supply from non-OPEC producers alsomakes it more difficult for OPEC to affect prices. (76)", "Macroeconomic Effects. In general, if energy prices fall, the drop would tend to increase the amount of inputs affordedby businesses, boosting the overall supply of goods and services. Higher aggregateincome and lower prices would enable households to buy more goods and services. Economic growth would speed up; and, if the economy is not at full employment,more labor and capital would be employed. Once the adjustment to lower prices iscompleted, growth would return to its prior rate, but at a higher output level.", "However, in analyzing the impact of changes in energy costs on the economy as a whole or on individual sectors, one needs to be aware that the relative price ofoil has decreased since the oil price spikes of the 1970s and early 1980s, and energyuse per unit of output has fallen as well. The proportions of production costsaccounted for by energy have dropped across the economy; and energy costs as ashare of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have declined. Consequently, the relativeimpacts of energy price changes on the economy in general and on particular sectorscan be expected to be smaller than they were 20-25 years ago.", "It appears also that any price effect would have to be considerable and sustained for the macroeconomic effects to be reasonably noticeable. For example, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that an increasein oil prices of $10 per barrel above its baseline scenario would result in U.S. GDPbeing 0.2% lower one year and two years after the shock. (77) In contrast, as notedabove, the price effect of a 0.3% -- 0.9% addition to world oil supply resulting fromANWR production probably would be small, although econometric research findingssuggest that the beneficial macroeconomic result of a price drop would notnecessarily be proportional.", "Oil and gas producers that do not participate in ANWR development, their suppliers, and their local economies in the contiguous 48 States would be harmed should oil prices decline. Producers' revenues would decline indirectly as well asdirectly through reductions in output -- both effects leading to cutbacks inemployment and in purchases of other goods and services.", "With respect to ANWR development, hypothetical outlays of $6.5 billion and $14.0 billion with an income multiplier of two (78) applying to both would come toroughly 0.12% and 0.26% of projected GDP for the year 2002 (on the unlikelyassumption that all the outlays occur in one year). (79) If the outlays are spread overmore than one year, the impact in each year would be less, but the total effect wouldbe about the same. The percentages would be much lower in 2020, when theeconomy is projected to be about 45% larger. (80) If there is some spare capacity in theoil and gas industry, producers and their suppliers would benefit. However, if theeconomy is at full employment, the multiplier effect would be transitory.", "Employment Effects. Oil and gas development in ANWR would generate additional jobs in the national economy tothe extent that development resulted directly and indirectly in a net economicstimulus. A key factor would be whether the economy is at full employment or lessthan full employment. The direct effects are clearer than the indirect, given theuncertainty of the effects of ANWR oil on world oil prices and any consequentbeneficial effects of lower energy prices on the economy as a whole.", "Rough estimates can be made for jobs generated by the hypothetical development outlays by using the national averages of 3.89 jobs directly andindirectly generated per $1 million of sales by oil and gas producers and 16.53 jobsper $1 million of sales by oil and gas field service companies, as estimated by theBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). (81) Adjusting forprice increases since 1992 andassuming that half of the outlays are attributable to each group, $6.5 billion in outlayswould lead to about 60,000 jobs, and $14.0 billion would lead to about 130,000jobs. (82)", "If the economy were at full employment, however, investment in ANWR may crowd out other spending in the economy; moreover, ANWR development may drawoil industry resources (capital and labor) from oil prospects elsewhere in the country. In the long run, the unemployment rate is determined by the structure of the labormarket, and, at full employment, any jobs generated by ANWR development wouldcome at the expense of an equal number of jobs lost in the rest of the economy.", "Because the impact of ANWR oil on world oil prices would be uncertain, and any decrease would have to be considerable and sustained for the macroeconomiceffects to be reasonably noticeable, the effects on employment would be highlyuncertain. Any gain in employment from beneficial macroeconomic effects of a dropin oil prices, however, may be offset by the harm to oil producers elsewhere in theUnited States, who may reduce their operations and workforce.", " Other Job Impact Estimates. Some proponents of ANWR development assert that such development would result in a gain of more than700,000 jobs in the economy. This is based upon a 1990 report by The WEFAGroup (83) that estimated that the economic impactof oil development in ANWR wouldresult, through direct and indirect effects, in a net gain in employment of 735,000 inthe peak year of job creation. The major portion of WEFA's employment gainresults from large estimated beneficial macroeconomic effects of lower world oilprices caused by an increase in world oil supply attributable to ANWR oil. WEFAbased that increase upon an oil discovery near the high end of the 1987 FLEISestimates.", "The study's estimates of effects on GNP (84) and employment appear large in thecontext of WEFA's essentially full employment base case. They are large alsocompared with actual economic consequences of oil price changes, and in view ofdecreased importance of energy inputs in the economy compared with the 1970s(noted above). It may have been reasonable for WEFA to posit that the world oilsupply situation in 2005 would be much tighter than in 1990, and that an injectionof an additional 1.7 million barrels per day would tend to lower prices somewhat; andthe model used by WEFA allowed for some response by OPEC. The estimated priceeffect is large nevertheless. In general, the report tended to select the more or mostoptimistic of underlying scenarios when there was a choice to be made in thesequential analysis required in estimating efforts of this type. (85)", "A recent report by Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) examined The WEFA Group study and re-estimated the employment effects. It followed WEFA's paradigm but applied different assumptions about some basicdata, the degree of response by the market and by OPEC to ANWR oil, and thedegree to which the economy responds to an oil price decline. CEPR estimated thatoil production in ANWR would result in the creation of 46,300 jobs. (86) The CEPRreport, however, does not purport to be a full-fledged estimate of job effects undercurrent oil market, oil industry, and economic conditions.", "Import Reduction. As any ANWR oil would be the marginal source of petroleum for the United States, net imports (totalimports minus exports) probably would be reduced by virtually one barrel for everybarrel of ANWR output. This is true regardless of the amount of exports of NorthSlope oil (now nil), which would affect gross imports. The economy would benefittemporarily through a reduction in the income transferred overseas to pay for the oil. Using the EIA's projection of refiners' acquisition cost of foreign crude oil of about$21.50 per barrel in 2015, (87) the oil import billwould be cut by $2.4 billion to $11.0billion in that year, improving the U.S. merchandise trade balance in the short run.", "The relative reduction in dollars flowing abroad, however, could cause the dollar to appreciate. This would tend to reduce other exports and expand other imports tosome extent, reversing the initial improvement. A possibly greater increase indemand for imports of other goods and services could result from the higher level ofeconomic activity caused by lower oil prices. Basically, the trade deficit reflects thedesire of Americans to borrow abroad versus the desire of foreigners to invest orborrow in the United States. Assuming that oil development of ANWR did notinfluence this dynamic, it would likely have no permanent effect on the trade balance.", "Effects on the Alaskan Economy. The Alaskan economy could be affected substantially by development and production ofoil in ANWR through the direct effects of the exploration, development, andproduction, and indirectly through the ripple effects of the money spent in Alaska bythe producing companies and their workers. A major unknown is the amount of oilthat might eventually be produced.", "Oil and gas production already is a major industry in Alaska, directly accounting for about 4,500 jobs and $425 million in annual payroll, (88) and about 20% of stategross product on average. (89) ANWR developmentwould affect primarily the oil andgas industry, but also construction, telecommunications, manufacturing,transportation, and other mining, as well as employment in these industries. Manytypes of other supply and support services such as food, fuel, power, andmanagement services would also benefit. A study of the current economic impactof the oil and gas industry on Alaska indicates substantial effects of the industry onindividual regions in the state. And it found indirect and \"induced\" employmentimpacts equal to six times employment in the industry itself. (90)", "The direct stimulus of the outlays for exploration, development, and production would be felt more in Alaska than elsewhere in the United States -- the amount ofeconomically recoverable oil discovered and eventually produced being a key factor. However, much of the equipment and other goods required would be manufacturedin the lower 48 states as well as in Alaska. Working with the hypothetical outlays of$6.5 billion and $14.0 billion for wells, pipeline extension, and other facilities, andmaking the simplifying assumption that half of these outlays would be spent forgoods and services (including labor) in Alaska, they would come to $3.25 billion and$7.0 billion. Again adjusting for price increases since 1992 and assuming that oilproducing companies and oil field service companies each accounted for half of theoutlays, it would lead to about half of the hypothetical jobs estimated for the UnitedStates as a whole -- 30,000 and 65,000, respectively. ", "The ratios used, however, are national averages, and oil and gas industry wages in Alaska are higher than average. While the latter is beneficial in one respect, it maytranslate into a smaller number of jobs per billion dollars of outlays. Also, advancesin oil and gas development technology and facilities since 1990, reducing the size offacilities, may also reduce the number of jobs generated by such development.", "Furthermore, if there were some slack in the Alaskan economy if or when ANWR energy development occurs, jobs created by ANWR could result in areduction in Alaskan unemployment. If the Alaskan economy were at fullemployment, the job gain could be transitory. Moreover, as noted earlier, any jobsgenerated by ANWR development could come at the expense of an equal number ofjobs lost in the rest of the economy. This could include drawing oil industryresources (capital and labor) from oil prospects elsewhere in the country to someextent.", "The Alaskan state government, and ultimately Alaskan citizens, could benefit substantially from ANWR development via its share of potentially billions of dollarsof revenues from bonuses, rents, and royalties. Alaskan citizens receive annualdistributions from the state's Permanent Fund, which is endowed by revenues frommineral lease rentals, royalties, and bonuses, and the states's share of federalmineral-derived revenues. The distribution in 2000 was $1,963.86 per resident.", "Regarding only royalties, a discovery sufficient to produce the modest amount of 750,000 barrels per day with a wellhead price of $20 per barrel and a royalty rateof 12.5% could yield about $700 million per year for Alaska's 627,000 residents. Asdiscussed subsequently in this report, however, it is uncertain at this point whatAlaska's share of the various revenue streams might be.", "Relationship to Recent U.S. Energy Difficulties. The current interest in oil exploration and developmentin ANWR was at least partly prompted by the increase in the retail prices for refinedpetroleum products that began with gasoline in early 1999, and California's electricpower problems. Any energy and/or economic benefits that would accrue from oiland gas development of ANWR essentially would not address the power difficultiesexperienced in California -- which were related to insufficient generation capacity,natural gas price spikes, and the electric power market deregulation plan adopted bythe state.

The area included within the proposedrange is a major habitat, particularly in summer, for the great herds of Arctic caribou,and the countless lakes, ponds, and marshes found in this area are nesting groundsfor large numbers of migratory waterfowl that spend about half of each year in therest of United States; thus, the production here is of importance to a great manysportsmen.... The proposed range is restricted to the area which contains all of therequisites for year-round use. The coastal area is the only place in the United Stateswhere polar bear dens are found. (91)", "Twenty-eight years later, the FLEIS echoed these remarks with the following: \"The Arctic Refuge is the only conservation system unit that protects, in anundisturbed condition, a complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems in NorthAmerica\" (p. 46). It also said \"The 1002 area is the most biologically productive partof the Arctic Refuge for wildlife and is the center of wildlife activity\" (p. 46). Thebiological value of the 1002 area rests on the very intense productivity in the shortarctic summer; many species arrive or awake from dormancy to take advantage ofthis richness, and leave or become dormant during the remainder of the year. Caribouhave long been the center of the debate over the biological impacts of Refugedevelopment, but other species have also been at issue. Among the other speciesmost frequently mentioned are polar bears, musk oxen, and the 135 species ofmigratory birds that breed or feed there. To some extent, the effects of developmenton animals in the Refuge can be estimated by examining past effects on the samespecies as they exist in developed areas on the coastal plain. (92) However, thesecomparisons must be made with some caution for several reasons:", "The coastal plain in the 1002 area is much narrower (as little as 15 miles) than around Prudhoe (roughly 100 miles) or the NPR-A (as much as130 miles).

", "This section presents background information on various species as it might relate to energy development in the Refuge and the potential effects of developmenton these species.", "Caribou. In 1987, the Porcupine caribou herd (PCH) was estimated at 180,000 animals, and is now estimated at129,000 animals. (94) The herd winters south of theBrooks Range in central Alaskaand northwestern Canada. Its winter range is centered on the Porcupine River inCanada and Alaska. In the spring, the males and yearlings migrate north first,followed by the cows, who move north with the retreating snow line; the entire herdcalves in only a few days. In most years, the cows reach the 1002 area and give birththere, concentrating their activity in areas that are greening most rapidly and thatoffer the high protein content required by growing calves and lactating cows. (95) Ifsnowfall has been heavy, or if a cool spring delays snowmelt, the cows are delayed,and drop their calves short of the 1002 area. (Maps of the distribution ofradio-collared caribou throughout their annual cycle can be found at http://www.taiga.net/caribou/pch/pc_cycle.html and annual calving maps at http://www.r7.fws.gov/nwr/arctic/pchmaps.html .) ", "Much has been made of the failure of caribou cows to calve in the 1002 area in some years, notably 1986, 1987, 2000, and 2001. In these years, heavy snowfall orcool spring temperatures slowed the northern migration, so that when calvingoccurred, most cows had not yet crossed large flooding rivers or passed the BrooksRange. Many newborn calves died in river crossings or fell prey to the golden eagle,wolf, and grizzly populations in the Brooks Range. For radio collared cows in 2000,the June calf survival rate and the July calf to cow ratio were the lowest everrecorded. (96)", "Even if migration is delayed, the cows continue on to the 1002 area, where they continue to forage. As June days lengthen and become warmer, mosquitos, bot flies,and warble flies can reach tremendous numbers on the coastal plain. While theblood-sucking habits of mosquitos are well-known, the flies present major healthproblems as well. These flies deposit their eggs in the nasal passages of the caribouor in wounds; larvae feed and migrate through the skin, making holes in the skinwhen ready to emerge. Severely infested animals, or those in weakened condition( e.g. , injured or older animals, young calves, lactating cows) have restricted breathingor are otherwise weakened. They may die or fall to predators. When these flies arenumerous, herds may appear panicked, seeking relief in areas where flies are lessnumerous. ", "Mosquitos become active earlier in the summer and are deterred by cool, windy, humid conditions. When they are numerous, caribou congregate near the coast,where breezes are typically stronger, temperatures lower, and mosquitosconsequently rarer. The larger bot and warble flies tolerate somewhat higher winds,but not shade; they too prefer warmer temperatures, and become active later in thesummer. (97) Consequently, after calving is overand the herd has reached the 1002area, the herd generally moves to the coast to escape mosquitos; as mosquitopopulations decline and fly populations increase, the herd may return to inland areaswhere patches of snow, gravel bars, or hills offer less favorable conditions for theincreasing numbers of bot and warble flies. At this time of year, cows are at theirlowest energy levels, and according to the FLEIS, \"[a]ccess to insect-relief habitatand forage during this period may be critical to herd productivity\" (p. 25). ", "The effects of exploration, production, and development in the 1002 area on caribou cannot be known with certainty unless such events actually occur, and eventhen will undoubtedly be debated. When the 1987 FLEIS was released, debatecentered on the potential for displacement of the herd from (a) its preferred calvingarea and (b) the coastal areas needed for relief from clouds of biting insects. Theseremain the primary concerns. A major point of debate has been the comparison ofeffects of development on the Central Arctic Herd (CAH), whose range is partly inthe developed areas west of the Refuge, and the potential effects of development onthe PCH, whose summer range is primarily in the 1002 area. Comparisons of the twoherds must be made cautiously, since the PCH is about 5 times larger than the CAH,calves in about 1/5 the area of the CAH, and annually migrates to overwinter southof the Brooks Range, while the CAH generally remains year-round in the muchbroader coastal plain in and south of the existing oil fields. ", "Would Caribou Be Displaced from Calving in the 1002 Area? This question can be divided into two parts: would thePCH likely be displaced from the 1002 area at calving time ? And more importantly,if it were displaced, would displacement have harmful effects on calving success ? For the first question, the answer for the herd as a whole, based on the Prudhoe Bayexperience, appears initially to be a qualified \"no.\" Individual animals, especiallyadult males, habituate to the disturbance, and sometimes seek out gravel pads androads, where insect attacks may be less severe. The CAH has grown sincedevelopment began, from 5,000 to about 27,000. However, warning signs exist. Forinstance, Brad Griffiths and Ray Cameron and their students at the University ofAlaska (Fairbanks) have shown that for the western portion of the CAH, cows haveshifted their calving southward, out of the development area, and return to this richforaging area only after their calves are older. These studies also show that \"thegreatest incremental impacts are attributable to initial construction of roads andrelated facilities\" and that \"the extent of avoidance greatly exceeds the physical'footprint' of an oilfield complex.\" (98) Thus, it ispossible that habituation could occur,especially with males and yearlings, but some displacement of cows with youngcalves also seems likely.", "The second question is the most crucial, since displacement to another area is inconsequential only if calving success is equally good in the alternative area(s). More precisely, if the herd is significantly less productive in the alternative area(s),the difference serves not to show the availability of alternatives but rather to highlightthe importance of the preferred area. For clues, scientists have examined thereproductive success both of displaced cows in the CAH, and of the PCH in yearswhen natural events prevented it from calving in the 1002 area. Griffiths andCameron have shown a correlation of calf survival in the CAH with the amount ofhigh-protein food in the calving area. In the much narrower coastal plain of the 1002area, any cows displaced southward would calve in or nearer the Brooks Range,where golden eagles, grizzly bears, and wolves (all calf predators) are more abundantthan on the plain. Cows displaced to the east and calving in Canada tend to eatmosses and evergreens there, rather than the more digestible cottongrass and otherplants available in the 1002 area. (99) As notedabove, in 2000, when snows delayedmigrating cows, effects on calf survival were severe. (100)", "In sum, calving can -- and in some years does -- occur in areas other than the preferred 1002 area. However, evidence exists to suggest that calving success willbe reduced when this occurs. At present, displacement from areas of the mostnutritious forage is a rare event; if it were to become common, reduced fecunditycould be expected. Smaller drill pads and fewer roads could combine to reducedisplacement, and with directional drilling, pads might be sited to avoid areas of highquality forage. Even then, the naturally cyclic nature of caribou populations mightconceal all but large effects for a considerable time. ", "Attempting to address this question of calf survival, USGS scientists used existing field data on caribou displacement elsewhere and combined it with fivepossible development scenarios (described in previously published literature) rangingfrom development only at the periphery of the northern and western portion of the1002 up to one scenario that included most of the 1002 area and two fulldevelopment scenarios. Then they examined the hypothetical outcomes that wouldhave occurred had those areas been developed at that level with the actual data on thedistribution of cows from 1980 to 1995. In effect, they asked where would PCHcows have gone in each of those 16 years of data, if that level of development hadbeen in place and if PCH cows responded as other caribou cows do to various kindsof disturbance. With this empirical model, they then predicted PCH calf survival inthe areas to which the cows would have been displaced. \"The simulations indicatedthat a substantial reduction in calf survival during June would be expected under fulldevelopment of the 1002 area.\" (101)", "Would Caribou Be Displaced from Insect Relief Areas? Relief from massive mosquito populations and thenfly populations can be critical to the herd. Given the particular aversion of cows withyoung calves to developed areas, the potential for conflict with development seemslikely to be more important early in the calving season. Immediately along the coast,breezes deter mosquitos. Any shore facilities or activities that block access to thecoast could be most significant in this potential conflict. Later, when bot and warblefly populations are peaking and calves are older, cows with calves are likely to leavethe coast and move inland. In the CAH, they may join the rest of the herd when itrests on drill pads or under pipelines or other structures, where shade discourages flypopulations. Studies by Pollard et al . have shown that temperatures were lower andwind speeds higher on gravel pads, and mosquitos and flies were less common ongravel pads than on tundra. (102) Thus, graveldrill pads could join other features inproviding fly relief to the PCH, once caribou become accustomed to the facilities. However any such benefit is likely to be marginal for the PCH, since the herd tendsto leave the 1002 area before the bot and warble fly populations have reached theirpeaks. (103)", "Polar Bears. Polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) probably rank right after caribou in generating attention in the ANWRdebate. The Beaufort Sea population is estimated at about 2000-2500 bears andranges along the Alaskan and northwestern Canadian coasts. Bears spend most oftheir adult lives at sea on the ice, feeding primarily on seals. Female bears give birthabout once every three years (or less, if previous cubs died young) as they hibernate. While some females den on the ice pack, other adult females come ashore. In eithercase, they give birth to one to three cubs. In the spring, the females and cubs leavethe dens; those with onshore dens return to join the rest of the population on the icepack. As a result of this pattern, only a small part of the population is on shore at anyone time. The Refuge has the highest density of onshore dens of any area along theAlaskan coast. Researchers have shown that female polar bears are very sensitive todisturbance and will abandon their dens and young cubs if sufficiently disturbed(FLEIS, p. 129-130).", "The shift to winter for virtually all exploration and certain other activities during development and production benefits many species. However, for polar bears thisactivity would occur at the times when female bears would be denning. To the west,industry has worked to avoid known den sites, but fewer dens are present in that areathan in the 1002 area. Paradoxically, one new technology may present moredifficulties. Use of 2-D seismic exploration can be accomplished with crewsworking at considerable intervals between survey lines. But for finer analysis ofgeological data, industry may find 3-D seismic exploration to be a cost-effective andpreferable supplement. However, 3-D crews must work at much closer spacing than2-D, thereby increasing the potential for conflict with denning bears. However, morerecent studies suggest that denning polar bears may not be as seriously disturbed byhuman activities as previously thought: certain dens exposed to high levels of activitydid not suffer a detectable reduction in productivity. (104)", "Other possible conflicts include inhibition of bears coming ashore for denning, and the habituation of polar bears to human presence, and the subsequent risk tohuman life. Protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and an internationalagreement (though not under the Endangered Species Act), polar bears are huntedrelatively infrequently in Alaska (for subsistence), and some may lose their fear ofhumans. If human presence increases in the 1002 area as a result of development,conflicts with scavenging bears might become more common in the 1002 area. Polarbears are attracted now to the Kaktovik area (especially on occasions when whalecarcasses have been landed). Generally, when such conflicts have occurred on theNorth Slope, habituated nuisance bears are relocated or destroyed. ", "The FLEIS suggested buffer zones of at least 0.5 miles around known dens in order to prevent abandonment. It also recommended orienting facilities to permitinland access for pregnant polar bears, relocating problem bears, and as a last resort,humane killing to protect human welfare. These actions continue to be the primaryforms of mitigation.", "Musk Oxen. Musk oxen were hunted to extinction in the area in the late 1800s, but 64 animals were re-introducedinto the 1002 area in 1969-1970, and the population peaked at about 400 animals in1986. (105) About twice that many are presentduring spring calving. They survivebrutal winters protected by their thick fur, and conserve energy by moving little fromtheir preferred riparian habitats. River corridors are used both for feeding and fortravel all through the year, particularly in western portions of the 1002 area. Limitedhunting of bulls is permitted by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.", "The high demand for water could create conflicts with the needs of musk oxen. The preferred habitat for musk oxen is riparian areas; if riparian areas are heavilymined for gravel, or altered for capture of spring runoff, this species could beaffected. In addition, the extreme metabolic slowdown that this species undergoesto survive the harsh winter could be threatened if herds are forced to flee frequentdisturbances. The latter seems more easily mitigated than habitat alteration, sinceknowledge of the specific whereabouts of herds through radio collars could permitworkers to avoid them.", "Migratory Birds. A variety of bird species nest or forage in the 1002 area, taking advantage of the explosion of insectlife and rapid plant growth that occurs in the short summer. Compared to birdsbreeding in temperate areas, these species cycle from spring arrival, to nesting, tosouthern migration at a furious pace. A large variety of birds, both familiar and rarein the lower 48 states, breed or fatten for migration in the Refuge. (See FWS website: http://www.r7.fws.gov/nwr/arctic/wildlife.html .) Among these are manypopular game species: snow geese, Canada geese, white-fronted geese, brant, pintails,widgeons, and others. A wealth of shorebirds (plovers, dunlin, sandpipers,turnstones, phalaropes, and others) also frequent the area. Population data on mostANS bird species come from studies done in or near developed areas around PrudhoeBay. The populations of many species oscillate, as is common in the arctic. Amongshorebirds, only dunlin have shown long term declines, though this trend is shownin other arctic areas, and may be due to losses in their wintering habitat in eastAsia. (106) Only 6 bird species are regularly foundin the 1002 area in winter: snowyowls, gyrfalcons, rock and willow ptarmigans, common ravens, and Americandippers. (107)", "The spectacled eider, a large sea duck, is a rare to uncommon breeder along the coast of ANWR. It is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). (See FWS fact sheet, including distribution map, at http://alaska.fws.gov/es/spei.pdf.) Reasons for the decline are unclear and may vary in different parts of the bird'srange, but increased lead poisoning from ingested lead shot, hunting, and increasedpredation due to augmented predator populations near human development andgarbage dumps are thought to play a role. ", "Steller's eider is a casual visitor along the coast of the Refuge. It too is listed as threatened under ESA. (See FWS fact sheet, including distribution map, athttp://www.r7.fws.gov/es/steller/stei.pdf.) Reasons for the decline of this species arealso unclear, but may be similar to those for the spectacled eider. ", "In comparing likely environmental effects of potential energy development on the birds of the 1002 area under a modern scenario and under that envisioned in1987, only one feature seems to have changed markedly: much greater reliance onaircraft. Many more airstrips are now likely to be built, and many more flights made,especially in summer when more birds are present, than seemed likely in 1987. Thespecies most likely to be affected by these flights is the snow goose, since their hugefeeding flocks are highly sensitive to overflights, and are easily startled away fromforaging sites. Mitigation measures suggested in the FLEIS were \"careful facilitiessiting and controls on surface activities, air transportation, and hunting\" (p. 133). These remain important, and it seems likely that a reduced number of facilities couldmake siting easier, but controls on air traffic seem more likely to be difficult than wasassumed then. Protection of eiders, which were not listed under ESA at that time,could also be an issue in the western part of the Refuge where these rare birds aremore likely to occur. Measures to protect both species of eiders could includerestrictions on certain activities such as vehicular traffic, noise, construction withinabout 200 meters (660 feet) of active nests, and habitat alteration.", "Other Species. Arctic fox populations and brown (grizzly) bear populations on the coastal plain have increasedfrom development due to increased scavenging. The FLEIS noted that the increasedpopulation of foxes had damaging effects on their normal prey species, such as youngbirds, on which they continue to feed. Scavenging arctic grizzlies can becomehabituated to humans, as they do elsewhere, and become dangerous to human life. As noted in the FLEIS, careful control of trash can mitigate both problems. ", "Special Areas. If Congress opened ANWR, it could choose to afford special protections to special areas. Fourareas within the coastal plain are commonly considered to have exceptionalecological value and were identified as such in the FLEIS. ", "By far the most frequently mentioned is Sadlerochit Spring in the southernmost part of the 1002 area. The spring maintains a flow of water at50-58F year-round, and keeps the river open for nearly 5 miles, even in winter. Itrepresents the extreme northern range of some plants and birds, and provideswintering habitat for fish; muskoxen frequent the area. During the research leadingup to the Section 1002 study, 4,000 acres around the spring were closed toexploration. There are individual Native allotments in the Sadlerochit area, whichcould complicate attempts to set it aside.", "The Kongakut River lies between the 1002 area and theCanadian border, and flows into the Beaufort Lagoon. Because of the unusual anddiverse offshore ecosystem, and the presence of some of the North Slope's very raretrees in the upper part of the watershed, the area is considered ecologically valuable. About 25,000 acres of this system are included in the extreme northeastern part of the1002 area.

However, if development occurs, there also will be impacts on the physicalenvironment and resources of the area -- land, air, and water -- as a result ofconstruction, operations, and human habitation. Currently, because the area is largelyuninhabited, the condition of the physical environment is almost pristine (althoughrugged and challenging for man's use) and essentially unaffected by human activity. Especially in terms of land and water, the dominant physical characteristic ispermafrost, the permanently frozen layer which starts between 1 and 2 feet below thesurface and has been found at a depth of 2,000 feet, that impedes drainage and createssaturated soil conditions in most areas of the entire North Slope. Permafrost and thesurface layer on top of it are fragile, and special construction techniques (such as iceroads and structures built on pilings) have been devised to protect them.", "It is undisputed that exploration and development activities will alter the existing physical environment. Oil field operations will result in air pollutionemissions. There will be a need for large amounts of water for drilling and ancillaryactivities, including construction of roads, drill pads, and airstrips. Some amount ofgravel will be mined as part of some of these activities, and there likely will beimpacts from both the mining and use of gravel.

Air quality on the North Slope of Alaska, including that in ANWR, currently meets all NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and would likely continue to do so evenwith ANWR development. Areas such as ANWR (i.e., those that meet the NAAQS)are regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirementsof the Clean Air Act. The PSD program requires pre-construction review andpermitting of major new sources of pollution to determine the impact of projectedemissions, and the imposition of Best Available Control Technology on emissionsources.", "Emissions and Expected Air Quality. Oil field operations -- and the natural-gas-fired turbines and heaters associated withthem in Alaska -- generate significant amounts of air pollution. The power facilitiesneeded to support operations on the North Slope are quite large: according toBPAlaska, the Central Compression Plant at Prudhoe Bay has turbines capable ofgenerating the equivalent of 429 megawatts of electric power -- enough power fora city of 150,000 people. (108) Even though itburns relatively clean fuel (natural gas),the North Slope complex emits an estimated 63,786 tons of air pollution per year. (109) Nitrogen oxide emissions, which account for more than two-thirds of the total, are\"2-3 times the amount emitted by Washington, DC.\" (110)", "Despite these emissions, as noted, air quality on the North Slope of Alaska, including that in ANWR, currently meets all National Ambient Air QualityStandards. Annual concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, measured at three monitoringstations in the Prudhoe Bay field, were, in fact, 70% to 90% below the NAAQS ineach of the years 1996-2000. Emissions of other criteria pollutants were also withinlimits. (111)", "Potential emissions from ANWR sources were discussed in the Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement (completed in 1987, and not subsequently updated). The FLEIS concluded that the likely effect on air quality of the full leasing anddevelopment alternative would be minor. (112) It also noted that while \"it is difficult topredict the impacts on air quality in the 1002 area without knowing the scope, timing,and location of oil development,\" which is impossible to predict without furtherexploratory activity, \"The maximum annual emissions from the 1002 area wouldprobably be analogous with present North Slope operations.\" (113)", "PSD Regulatory Structure. Facilities in the 1002 area would be subject to the Clean Air Act's Prevention of SignificantDeterioration rules. The PSD program is designed to protect air quality whereambient concentrations of pollutants are better than required by National AmbientAir Quality Standards. Pollutants subject to PSD requirements are particulate matter,sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. Of these, only the nitrogen oxide increment (114) isexpected to pose any challenge to the development of the 1002 area. ", "Under the PSD program, the type of area affected by a proposed facility's emissions determines the amount of air quality degradation to be allowed. Allinternational parks, national parks larger than 6,000 acres, and most wilderness areaslarger than 5,000 acres are mandatory Class I areas -- those for which the leastincrement of pollution is allowed. Facilities affecting Class I areas may increaseannual ambient concentrations of NOx by only 2.5 g/m 3 -- 2.5% of the NAAQS. ", "ANWR, and specifically the 1002 area, are not Class I areas, however: the 1002 area has not been designated wilderness, and the remainder of ANWR, while it isofficially wilderness, was not designated so until after the statute establishing thePSD program was enacted. Thus, like most other areas of the United States, ANWRis a Class II area. In such areas, new facilities may increase concentrations of NOxby 25 g/m 3 , 25% of the NAAQS -- 10 times the amount allowed if the area weredesignated Class I.", "Even this allowed increment could pose constraints for full ANWR development. In establishing the PSD increments for nitrogen oxides in 1988, theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) made specific note of their potential impacton the North Slope, stating that \"certain Class II areas such as Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,have ambient concentrations as much as 40 g/m 3 higher than in 1980,\" (115) whichexceeds the 25 g/m 3 increment adopted. If the FLEIS is accurate in projecting NOxemissions from full development of ANWR as analogous to levels observed atPrudhoe Bay, emissions might exceed allowed levels unless additional pollutioncontrol measures are adopted.", "Major new sources of air pollution in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). Statepermitting agencies (in this case, the Alaska Department of EnvironmentalConservation) determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy,environmental, and economic impacts. More stringent controls can be required ifmodeling indicates that BACT is insufficient to avoid violating an allowable PSDincrement or the NAAQS itself. Thus, the permitting process should ensure thatambient concentrations of NOx increase no more than 25% of the NAAQS level.", "Arctic Haze. Another air quality concern that was much discussed when ANWR development was first considered inthe 1980s is a phenomenon known as arctic haze. Beginning in the 1950s, arcticobservers have noted the presence in late winter and early spring of persistent bandsof haze that reduce visibility and change the color of clear skies from deep blue to apale blue or hazy gray. The haze consists of suspended particles, primarily sulfates,that originate in Europe and the former Soviet Union. (116) The arctic's cold, dry air,with little precipitation and weak sunlight, produces remarkably stable air masses inwinter and early spring, allowing the particles to remain airborne for weeks at a timeand to spread thousands of miles from their point of origin.", "Arctic haze appears to be less of a concern at present than it was in the 1980s. With the breakup of the former Soviet Union and the closure of many of the mostheavily emitting industrial facilities in Eastern Europe and Russia, the haze hasdeclined by as much as 50% since the mid-1980s.

According to the 1987 FLEIS, free water is limited in the 1002 area and is confinedto the surface and the shallow zone of soil located above the impermeable permafrostlayer. The refuge receives an average of 6 inches of precipitation annually. A studydone in 1989 found 255 lakes, ponds, and puddles within the 1002 area. Most lakesare shallow and freeze solid in winter. Less than 25% were deeper than 7 feet, andonly 8 contained enough unfrozen water to build a mile or more of ice road. (118) Anumber of rivers and streams exist in the 1002 area, most draining to the coast andthe Beaufort Sea; these too are also usually shallow.", "According to the FLEIS, 99% of the 1002 area is classified as wetlands, which are transitional lands found between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the watertable usually is at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. Arcticwetlands are different from those in the Lower 48 states, however. In warmer areasoutside of Alaska, wetlands play a significant role in floodwater storage, lateral watermovement, groundwater recharge, and sediment and erosion control. But in thearctic area, the permafrost layer impedes drainage and prevents many of the processesnormally attributed to wetlands from occurring, because most arctic wetlands are nothydrologically linked to underground aquifers. However, this thin surface layer ofsoil and rock, located above the permanently frozen layer, is the area where theprocesses that sustain life in the arctic occur, including the cycle of freezing in winterand thawing in the brief summer and where biological activity of micro-organismsand growth of plant roots take place. (119) Plantsthat grow in the perpetually saturatedsoils of the area include sedges, grasses in flat areas, and tiny shrubs and dwarf treesin the foothills and uplands.", "Water availability is cyclical during the year. In the spring, rapid snowmelt occurs throughout the area, and melting snow flows to rivers because it does notpenetrate the permafrost. Rivers run full, riverbanks are severely eroded by ice andsnow, and there is extensive spring flooding. Turbidity from suspended sedimentsis high, which impairs water quality. In summer and fall, rain follows, which canalso lead to flooding. But at the time of freezeup in the fall, low water supplyconditions prevail. Most rivers go dry or freeze to the bottom, and streamflow ceasesduring winter except below a few warm springs.", "Currently, water quality conditions in the 1002 area are not affected by human activity. While the state does not have extensive information about water quality inthe vast majority of Alaska's watersheds, because they are not actively monitored,most are presumed to be in relatively pristine condition -- including the 1002 area-- due to the state's size, sparse population, and general remoteness. As of 1987,no data were available on water quality below the permafrost in the 1002 area, butthe water beneath it is probably brackish, according to the FLEIS.", "Effects of Oil Exploration and Development. The 1987 FLEIS identified the use of limitedfresh water sources for industrial purposes as having the potential for major adverseeffects, if exploration and development of the 1002 area occur. It estimated that oneexploratory well could require 15 million gallons of water: 7 to 8 million gallons forconstruction and maintenance of an airstrip; 1.2 to 1.5 million gallons per mile forroad construction and maintenance; and 1.7 to 2 million gallons for drillingoperations and domestic use. Despite technological improvements and a smaller\"footprint\" for oil and gas operations in the arctic today (discussed below), estimatesof water requirements are generally the same as presented in the FLEIS.", "These water supply needs result from the fact that ice is the construction material of choice for the winter exploration season to make temporary roads, winterairstrips, and drill pads, in preference to mining of gravel (discussed below). Thisis done by spreading 6 inches of chipped ice from rivers and lakes, then spraying thearea with fresh water to make temporary roads and pads that melt in the spring. When they melt, they leave no significant damage to the tundra. Road constructiontechniques have evolved since early days of oil activity in the arctic. Temporary iceroads now allow construction of oil field pipelines during the winter months, thuslargely eliminating the need for permanent gravel roads adjacent to pipelines. (120)", "A source of water for ice roads, airstrips, and drill pads would need to be located, but there is little evidence on whether North Slope rivers and lakes cansupport the amount of water used by oil fields. One FWS hydrologist suggests thatdrawing too heavily from deep lakes would diminish the aquatic species that are foodfor migratory waterfowl; heavy withdrawals from the Canning River, which flowsfreely in winter for many miles below warm springs, could harm overwinteringfish. (121) The deepest river basins are near themouths of the Canning and Jago Rivers;if the brackish water from these basins were used for ice roads, the result could beharm to tundra vegetation when the ice melts in the spring.", "Because the Refuge has few deep lakes or lakes that do not freeze solid in winter, it is believed that there is only enough water in the 1002 area for less than 50miles of ice roads. (122) To meet water needs,alternatives that might be consideredinclude creating water reservoirs by excavating deep pools in conjunction with gravelremoval. Overflow during spring runoff would fill the basins, and the accumulatedwater could be used for construction. With sufficiently deep basins, habitat could becreated for overwintering fish. If economic quantities of oil were not found, basinsmight be left in place, or it would be necessary to find clean gravel to fill in thebasins. Riparian habitat is heavily used by musk oxen in winter, and siting offacilities in riparian areas (with or without oil discovery) would likely to be an issue.", "Companies might also melt lake and river ice and snow, or desalinate marine water. Oil companies also might consider transporting water by truck from existingdeveloped areas, such as Prudhoe Bay, although the economics of doing so for longdistances could be impractical. Another possibility is that oil companies might revertto building gravel roads for exploration and production, as in the past elsewhere onthe North Slope.", "On the North Slope today, most wastes associated with drilling, as well as sewage and garbage, are injected in dedicated disposal wells, rather than in wastepits, which greatly reduces surface impacts and water pollution incidents. The oilindustry has improved both technology and practices to prevent and clean upaccidental releases that could harm the surface layer and water. However, critics areconcerned about the possibility of spills of various substances, including waste oil,acid, ethylene glycol, and drilling fluids, especially given the relatively few lakes andstreams in the 1002 area. Even small spills, if not cleaned up, can affect lakes andstreams, for example if a spill on an ice pad melts in the spring. The primary impactof contaminated water is its potential to reduce oxygen availability in receivingwaters, plus possible toxicity of the waste.

In addition, they areconcerned about the environmental standards which would have to be met fordevelopment on these federal lands.", "Regulatory Setting.

State standards do currentlyapply to waters throughout the state, including the 1002 area. Any permits writtenby federal or state agencies must provide that state water quality standards will notbe violated. In addition, the state requires development of oil discharge preventionand contingency plans for exploration or production facilities and proof of financialresponsibility to ensure that owners and operators maintain adequate financialresources to respond to any spill and mitigate environmental damages.

These permits, issued in Alaska by EPA,establish specific limitations on pollutants in industrial waste or sewage that may bedischarged from any facility to waters of the United States, as well as generalrequirements such as monitoring and reporting. CWA permits for oil and gasoperations in the arctic typically require Best Management Practices (BMP) planswhich focus on pollution prevention rather than end-of-pipe discharge limits throughspecification of structural and operational controls, maintenance, and inspections. Outside of the 1002 area, EPA has issued a general permit for onshore and offshoreoil and gas extraction in Alaska that covers rest of the North Slope Borough. Itprovides general authorization to different facilities having similar discharges forsuch activities as discharges from ice roads constructed of gravel pit water,discharges of sanitary and/or domestic wastewater from covered facilities, andconstruction dewatering. The general permit application process is streamlined,because individual sources covered by a general permit do not need to apply to EPAfor a source-specific permit; if they file a Notice of Intent and meet certain otherqualifications, they can be covered by the general permit. The current general permitwas issued in 1997 and extends to April 10, 2002.

In Alaska, primary responsibility for regulation of injection wellsthrough this program is split between EPA and the Alaska Oil and Gas ConservationCommission (AOGCC). EPA issues permits authorizing subsurface injection ofnon-hazardous industrial wastes associated with oil exploration and development,while the AOGCC issues permits for wells used for injection of fluids brought to thesurface from oil and gas production operations or liquid hydrocarbons which arestored underground. Injection of fluid wastes which cannot be recycled is preferredto the discharge to surface disposal pits or ponds. Underground injection is to beconducted so as to protect USDWs. However, in existing oil production areas on theNorth Slope, EPA has determined that there are most likely not any aquifers beneaththe permafrost which are fresh enough to qualify for protection as USDWs.

Because of the extent of wetlands in the 1002 area, these requirements arelikely to apply to nearly all oil exploration and development activities that mightoccur onshore. In addition, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 requires permitsfrom the Corps for construction of any dam or dike in a navigable waterway or anystructure in or over any navigable waterway, if the structure affects the course,location, or condition of the waterbody. (125) Ifdocks or offshore navigationalcomponents of facilities to transport people and materials to and from the 1002 areawere constructed, permits under this authority as well as the CWA would likely berequired. ", "Another permit provision that could arise is contained in the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act (Title I known as the Ocean Dumping Act), whichrequires a permit from the Corps for the disposal of dredged material in the territorialseas, for example, for disposal of material dredged in the construction of channels inopen seas needed to get to shore facilities. In carrying out its regulatoryresponsibilities, the Corps evaluates projects through a public interest balancingprocess, considering the public benefits and detriments of all relevant factorsincluding conservation, economics, aesthetics, wetlands, cultural values, fish andwildlife values, and navigation. Further, the Corps shares jurisdiction with otheragencies. For example, the Corps uses environmental guidelines issued by EPA toevaluate impacts of a proposed discharge and consults with other federal and stateagencies before issuing permits.", "The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires certification by states that projects to be located in a state's coastal zone are consistent with the state's coastalzone management program. The CWA requires a similar state certificationconcerning compliance with state water quality standards. Both would presumablyapply to oil exploration and development activities. According to EPA officials,however, in part because of resource limitations, the state of Alaska frequentlywaives CZMA and CWA certification, rather than using that authority to imposeenvironmental conditions on projects. (126)", "Waste Disposal. Oil exploration and drilling result in the generation of several waste streams. There are also smallquantities of solid and hazardous wastes associated with daily living activities andwith running an industrial complex. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA) governs the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardouswastes, and in Alaska the program is carried out by the U.S. EPA. Nonhazardous andRCRA-exempt solid wastes are regulated by the Alaska Department ofEnvironmental Conservation (ADEC). ", "The hazardous wastes come from maintenance shops, laboratories, and other support activities. The largest categories are paint wastes, solvents, miscellaneouschemicals (particularly from laboratories), crushed light bulbs and bases, and rags,sorbents, and filters. There are no commercial facilities in the state for disposal ofhazardous wastes, and they must be stored in secure areas before shipment toRCRA-permitted facilities in the lower 48 states.", "RCRA-Exempt Wastes. EPA has determined that oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes constitute ahigh-volume, low-toxicity waste stream that would be better managed outside theRCRA hazardous waste regime. The ADEC regulates these drilling fluids, producedwaters, and other wastes. ", "In the past, drilling wastes were placed in surface impoundments called \"reserve pits,\" but they have several disadvantages: they take up a great deal of space, makingthe well pad's footprint larger; they require continuous fluid management,maintenance, and monitoring to prevent releases of metals, salts, and othercontaminants into the environment; and, when closed down, may require years ofenvironmental monitoring. Today these wastes are ground up and injected intodedicated disposal wells 5,000 - 8,000 feet deep. (127) The ADEC regulatesunderground injection wells, as discussed above in Water Resources and Wetlands . The wells are only allowed in areas where there is no underground source of drinkingwater, or where aquifers are too deep or briny for development. Grind and injecttechnology has ended the use of reserve pits for permanent disposal.", "Minimization and Recycling. The companies on the North Slope employ waste minimization and recycling programsto reduce the volume of solid waste. (128) Oneof the waste streams is drilling muds --mixtures of natural clays and weighting materials with small amounts of specializedadditives that serve to lubricate the drill bit, remove cuttings from the well bore, andcontrol the pressure in the well. As the mud circulates back to the surface, cuttingsand other solids are removed, and the muds are reused; this recycling can reduce mudrequirements by 50 % or more. During drilling operations, each well can generateup to 8,000 barrels of muds and cuttings. Cuttings from the upper strata are washedand used as gravel for construction of roads and pads. The remaining cuttings areground fine and injected in a slurry in a permitted disposal well along with otherproduction wastes. ", "Surface discharges of sanitary and domestic wastewater (black and gray water) have been eliminated at some facilities by injecting them in disposal wells or usingthem for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Other nonhazardous and RCRA-exemptliquids that might otherwise be discarded may also be used for EOR. Used oil fromvehicles and equipment is collected at several North Slope facilities. It is blendedinto the crude oil and sent to refineries.", "In conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission's approval of the sale of ARCO Alaska to the Phillips Petroleum Company in 2000, an agreement betweenthe State of Alaska and the companies operating on the North Slope was reached. Called the \"Charter for the Development of the Alaskan North Slope,\" it contained,among other things, several environmental provisions committing British Petroleumand Phillips Petroleum to clean up selected existing and abandoned sites, retrieve anddispose of abandoned empty barrels, and close inactive reserve pits. (129)", "These cleanup activities are testament to the uneven environmental record of the past. And as recently as the year 2000 British Petroleum (BP) paid $7 million in civiland criminal penalties and agreed to spend $15 million to carry out a nationwideenvironmental management system as a result of a contractor's illegally disposinghazardous waste for at least 3 years, and of BP's failing to report it immediately ondiscovery.

Gravel is a necessary component of exploration and development activities on the North Slope,and gravel suitable for these activities is a relatively valuable resource there. (131) However, with the higher velocities of rivers in the narrow coastal plain of the 1002area, gravel is more abundant than in the broader, developed portion of the coastplain to the west. Gravel roads and pads are constructed by piling gravel on top oftundra to provide a base for aboveground structures and to insulate the permafrostthat lies just below the surface. The mining of gravel from streambeds andfloodplains for such purposes can alter natural river drainage and cause increasederosion and sedimentation. Vegetation covered with layers of gravel dies, subtractingits resources from the food web of the ecosystem. In addition, dust blown from thegravel structure may affect freezing and thawing of nearby vegetation, as may anymaterial washed from the gravel surface. The blown dust might convey someunexpected benefits: dust kicked up from gravel structures may cause earlier snowmelt. Early melting stimulates plant growth, and could provide earlier foraging areasfor waterfowl. Possible contamination of the dust with wastes might counterbenefits, however.", "The need for gravel for activities in the 1002 area, if development occurs, is likely to be much less than that for earlier years of oil development in existing areasfor several reasons. First, gravel previously was used as the base for nearly all roadand pad construction, but today it is likely to be used only for permanent roads andpads because ice is the preferred construction material for temporary roads and pads(although the availability of adequate supplies of water is an issue for developmentof the 1002 area; see Water Resources and Wetlands , above). Second, gravelpreviously was mined to create reserve pits that held drilling muds and otherproduced wastes. Today, however, nearly all wastes are recycled, reused or disposedby underground injection, thus greatly reducing the need for reserve pits. Third, evenwhere used for drilling pads, the amount of gravel needed will be less because of thesmaller overall footprint of sites.", "If development in the 1002 area followed the pattern at Alpine, it would be, if not entirely roadless, then road-reduced, compared to older developments. Alpineis not connected by road to older facilities, but the development includes a 3-mileroad (14.6 acres) and a 36.3-acre airstrip. (See Figure 4.) The latter forms part of theroad connecting the 2 pads. (132) The road andairstrip constitute about 52% of the totalpermitted acreage. If anything like this pattern holds in a modern scenario, it wouldrepresent a very substantial reduction in the miles of roads relative to earlierdevelopment. ", "However, it is not clear whether roadless development along the Alpine model would be economic in ANWR. According to a recent report, current leaseholders atthe Badami oil field (25 miles further east than the current easternmost permanentroad on the North Slope, and about 25 miles west of the 1002 area) are seeking apermanent road to field. (133) The leaseholdersargue that the leases are not economicwithout a year-round road. They seek state funding for the creation of this road. Ifsuch a road were built, the Badami area would represent the nearest staging area tothe 1002 area. Thus depending on whether the Badami road is built, development inthe 1002 area would require either construction of an additional 25 or 50 miles ofgravel road up to the refuge boundary, plus ice roads into the 1002 exploration sites. Proponents of state construction of the Badami road estimate that it would cost$50-60 million. Similarly, the three most extensive of 5 development scenarios inone recent model assume the presence of a road, parallel to a pipeline, as well as aconnector road to Kaktovik, in the 1002 area. (134) The absence of a gravel road linkedto currently developed areas would add to the cost of development of ANWR,potentially making some prospects uneconomic or adding to pressure to build gravelroads outside or inside the 1002 area. (On the other hand, a variety of factors,including higher oil prices, could mean that such costs would not be prohibitive.)", "Caribou cows in existing oil fields with calves younger than a few weeks old (roughly, during June in most years) are known to avoid roads, pads, and other areasaround human activity; avoidance during this early period extends well beyond thefootprint of facilities, especially in early years of oil development. (135) (See also Caribou , above.) If road mileage were reduced, impacts on calves at this sensitivetime could be lowered. In ANWR, as calving ends in early June, and as thePorcupine Caribou Herd (PCH) tends to move to the coast and the western portionof the 1002 area for insect relief, roads or runways oriented across the path of travelcould be expected to disrupt the cows' movement more than those oriented roughlyparallel to it. If calving were displaced to the foothills, greater predation wouldapparently result; if foraging is displaced from prime areas, weight loss in cows couldresult in reduced survival rates in calves. (136) On the other hand even in June, someanimals (primarily males and yearlings) use pads, roads, and runways for insectrelief, and so may congregate in these areas. Later in the summer, when calves areolder, some cow-calf pairs may join them.", "Consequently, interpretations of impacts based on the CAH must be made cautiously, due to the differing concentrations of the herds and the differingavailability of similar calving areas. (137) If roadmileage were limited, impacts wouldprobably be lowered. Conversely, if roads were not limited, or if economic necessitylater resulted in a change in this restriction, impacts on the PCH or other species,such as tundra swans (which tend to avoid nesting within 200 meters (about 650 feet)of roads), could be greater.

It may be useful tocompare those features considered in the footprint as described in the 1987 FLEIS,and how that might differ from a scenario predicated on modern technologies. In1987, the FLEIS described the assumptions built into its full development scenario:", "For the sake of maintaining data confidentiality, [the full development scenario] shows a highly generalized placementof production and transportation facilities based on typical North Slope prospectcharacteristics for three localities within the 1002 area.

A comparison with ascenario using modern technology suggests that the footprint (as defined by theFLEIS in its table) would be smaller, but perhaps not markedly so. If, as suggestedby Arctic Power (a pro-development group cited earlier), full development of the1002 area could be accomplished by building no more than 2,000 acres of facilities(scattered appropriately around developed oil fields, and assuming the same oil fieldsas the FLEIS), then either its definition of \"footprint\" is different from that used inthe FLEIS, or additional technological improvements may be required. It is the pads,airstrips, pad supports, and connector roads that are typically considered whendevelopment proponents have recently referred to limiting surface impacts to 2,000acres; other features, such as pipelines, gravel mines and the like typically are not.

Vegetation may be exposed by the wind and damaged as it is run over,especially where more hilly terrain could make rolligon use difficult. In a moretemperate environment, vegetation might recover fairly quickly, but the intense coldand the freezing and thawing cycles of the arctic environment can make recoveryrates much slower. However, there is no research to show whether this type ofvegetational damage would affect foraging animals. (140)", "The vegetation under ice roads and ice pads may be damaged, partly by compaction, but also by being delayed in its spurt of growth in the brief summer. Where all debris is removed and no spills have occurred, little effect has beenobserved. (141) Where insulation is used tomaintain an ice pad over a single summer,damage appeared to be confined to areas around the edges of the pad, where somethawing had occurred but no sunlight had reached the plants; evidence ofrecolonization began to appear in two growing seasons.

If water for ice roads is at apremium, port development could reduce the need for long ice roads from the west. If port facilities were carefully sited and built offshore, and connected to shore viacauseways, and in turn to ice roads, they may prove attractive for the staging andmovement of heavy equipment. Offshore facilities may also be considered forplacement of heavy equipment such as water treatment plants, since such placementcould put them outside any 2,000 acre limit on surface occupancy (if Congress wereto impose such a limit).

The Gwich'in do not hunt within the 1002 area. They takecaribou from the Porcupine herd in areas south of the Brooks Range, inside andoutside ANWR, during the fall, winter, and spring. According to the FLEIS, ArcticVillage in Alaska and Old Crow in Canada are the two Gwich'in villages mostinvolved in caribou harvesting (recent information suggests Fort McPherson inCanada may now have a larger harvest than Old Crow (159) ). Other Alaska Gwich'invillages hunting PCH caribou are Venetie, Fort Yukon, and Chalkyitsik; some ofthese also trade for much of their caribou meat. These Gwich'in villages harvestmore caribou than does Kaktovik. Caribou is the main food source for ArcticVillage, Venetie, and other Gwich'in villages. Arctic Village, according to theFLEIS, harvested 200-1,000 caribou per year in the 1970s, as did Old Crow, whilethe other Alaskan Gwich'in villages together took 300-400 a year and the otherCanadian villages 100-2,100 a year. The Gwich'in also harvest other animals as wellas fish and birds. For the Gwich'in, caribou are by far the most culturally importantsubsistence animal. They speak of themselves as \"people of the deer,\" andtraditionally the Gwich'in believed that people and caribou each had a bit of theother's heart in theirs. (160)", "Arctic Village and Venetie have benefitted from Alaska's oil and gas development, but to a much lesser extent than Kaktovik. Arctic Village and Venetieelected, under ANCSA, to forego regional corporation shareholdings and take privatefee title to their 1.8-million-acre reservation. After 1971, the reservation was firstheld in joint ownership by the two villages' village corporations, but in 1979 thecorporations transferred title to the villages' tribal government, the Native Village ofVenetie Tribal Government (the land was not, however, restored thereby to the statusof an Indian reservation). Hence, because they had no shareholdings in Doyon, Ltd.,the regional for-profit corporation, Arctic Village and Venetie residents have notshared in any dividends flowing to Doyon shareholders. Moreover, the AlaskanGwich'in villages are not in an organized borough, so their benefits from North Slopedevelopment have come chiefly through state government activities. Theircommunity facilities are less prosperous and extensive than those of North SlopeBorough villages. (161) Paid employment inArctic Village and Venetie is not aswidespread as it is in Kaktovik. Census statistics for 1990 show that 54% of ArcticVillage's adults and 48% of Venetie's adults were in the labor force. (162)", "The Gwich'in argue that oil and gas development in the 1002 area will endanger the PCH by threatening the herd's calving areas, and that because of their dependenceon the PCH they will suffer subsistence loss and harm to their culture. When criticsfrom the pro-development set of Alaska Natives argue that Arctic Village andVenetie in the 1980s sold oil development leases (ultimately unsuccessful) on theirlands, and that the villages seemed unconcerned about endangering the PCH then, theGwich'in respond that the lease areas were not calving or postcalving areas and thuswere not as sensitive for the herd's survival.", "Alaska Native Lands and Rights. Alaska Natives have various property interests related to the issue of oil drilling inANWR that may present complex legal issues for refuge management if the coastalplain is opened to oil development. (163) In 1971,Congress enacted ANCSA to resolveall Native aboriginal land claims against the United States. ANCSA provided formonetary payments and also created village corporations that received the surfaceestate to approximately 22 million acres of lands. Village selection rights includedthe right to choose the surface estate in a certain amount of lands within the NationalWildlife Refuge System, in which case, under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd22(g) of ANCSA, the lands were toremain subject to the laws and regulations governing use and development of theRefuge. (164) KIC received rights to threetownships (165) along the coast of ANWR.", "ANCSA also created regional corporations which could select subsurface rights to some lands and full title to others. Subsurface rights in National Wildlife Refugeswere not available, but in-lieu selections to substitute for such lands were provided.", "Section 1431 of ANILCA (1980) followed up on the previously enacted ANCSA and gave KIC rights to make certain selections and to enter into certainexchanges. ANILCA (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1002(b)) also defined the 1002 area by reference to a mapdated August 1980, which has been interpreted as excluding the KIC lands. As aresult, Kaktovik has its previous surface rights to three townships along the coast thatare outside the 1002 area and one township inside that area. Geographically , the KIClands are all on the coastal plain and are indistinguishable from surrounding lands intheir importance to wildlife. However, all of the Kaktovik lands are within theRefuge as a whole and hence are subject to the restrictions on oil and gasdevelopment of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1003 of ANILCA and, under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd22(g) of ANCSA and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1431(g) ofANILCA, they are subject to the laws and regulations governing the Refuge. ", "Section 1431(o) of ANILCA also authorized the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), whose shareholders are Inupiat, to obtain rights in the Refugethrough exchanges, if lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) orANWR within a certain proximity to village lands were ever opened for commercialoil and gas development within 40 years of the date of ANILCA. However, undera different ANILCA exchange authority (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1302(h)), an exchange was executed onAugust 9, 1983, between then Secretary of the Interior James Watt and ASRC. Under this \"Chandler Lake Agreement\" the United States received certain ASRClands in the Gates of the Arctic National Park and ASRC received the subsurfacerights to the KIC lands -- which, it will be recalled, are three townships within theRefuge on the coastal plain but outside the 1002 area, and one township within the1002 area. Congress appears to have ratified the Agreement in later legislation ( P.L.98-366 , \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5; 98 Stat. 468, 470-471).", "Also as part of the Chandler Lake Agreement, ASRC was given the contractual right to drill up to three exploratory wells on the KIC lands that are outside the 1002area within a certain window of time. One test well was drilled, but the results ofthat well have been kept confidential. ", "In addition to the KIC and ASRC Native lands, there are also some individual Native \"allotments\" within the coastal plain. These typically are surface rightsbelonging to a particular individual. The conveyance of some lands has beencompleted; other lands have been applied for, but final rulings have not been made. BLM currently is compiling the exact locations and acreage of these allotments, butpreliminary data indicate that these allotments and applications appear to be clusteredalong the coast and near Sadlerochit Spring, both of which are important wildlifeareas. (See Special Areas , below.) Allotments already conveyed total over 10,000acres. Use of allotments appears not to be subject to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd22(g) ANCSA controls, norto other restrictions or regulations unless Congress enacts same.", "The 1983 Agreement and its appendices address oil exploration and development on the KIC/ASRC lands and their terms will govern the developmentand oil production on those lands unless they are superseded by statutory provisions. Appendix 2, part 9 of the 1983 Agreement states that development and productionactivities undertaken on ASRC lands \"shall be in accordance with the substantivestatutory and regulatory requirements governing oil and gas exploration, includingexploratory drilling, and development and production that are designed to protect thewildlife, its habitat, and the environment of the coastal plain, or the ASRC Lands, orboth.\" Other provisions in the Agreement purport to survive subsequent legislation(which is to say they likely would unless Congress acts to expressly negate them),and would affect the applicability of any environmental controls Congress mightotherwise enact. If Congress repeals the current prohibition against oil developmentin the Refuge, development could occur on the more than 100,000 acres of Nativelands that are comprised of KIC/ASRC lands and individual Native allotments.", "Canadian Interests in Traditional Native Rights. The Canadian government has consistently opposeddevelopment in the 1002 area, citing risks to the PCH and consequently to theGwich'in people found on both sides of the international border. (166) It also points toa 1987 U.S.-Canada \"Agreement on the Conservation of the Porcupine CaribouHerd\" under which each nation agreed to protect the PCH and its habitat. If onecountry plans to carry out an activity that may result in significant long term adverseimpacts on the PCH, the other is to be notified, and given the opportunity to consultbefore any final decision. Canada cites evidence of its commitment to the herd in itscreation of Ivvavik and Vuntuk National Parks on the Canadian side, which preventdevelopment in important calving and migration areas on its side of the border. Theembassy website notes: \"... the 1002 Area of ANWR contains the core of thecritically important calving area for the Porcupine Caribou Herd, and Canada isconvinced that only permanent protection of the plain will assure the herd'slong-term sustainability.\" (167)", "Development proponents often claim that the Canadian position borders on hypocrisy, since a significant portion of the PCH range in Canada was leased for oiland gas development in decades past. But commercial quantities of hydrocarbonswere not found, and leases have been allowed to lapse. Thus, this argument goes,Canadian opposition arose only after it became clear that commercial quantities ofoil were not found in the PCH range in Canada. In response, Canadians (andGwich'in on both sides of the border) argue that the portion of the calving area on theU.S. side is the most frequently used, and that at the time the Canadian leases wereoffered, the importance of the proposed leasing areas to caribou was unclear. Indeed,some Canadian industry officials now complain of government hostility todevelopment in the northern areas of the country, based on what they perceive asoverzealous environmental concerns.

The FLEIS seemed to be of two minds. It speaks of \"rehabilitation\" (168) and says that effects on wildlife could be \"very long-term [but] would not beconsidered irreversible once the life of the producing fields in the 1002 area wasover.\" (169) Yet it also speaks of \"the long-termcommitment of this area to industrialuse based on oil and gas development\" (170) andof \"long-term changes in the wildernessenvironment, wildlife habitats, and native community activities currently existing,resulting instead in an area governed by industrial activities.\" (171) And it notes that\"complete restoration [of disturbed sites] may not be possible, inasmuch asconstruction activities dramatically alter surface features which determine plantspecies composition in the natural habitat.\" (172) These comments raise the question asto whether the 1002 area, upon initiation of development, remains an integral part ofa wildlife refuge with a temporary (albeit long) interlude of industrial activity, or anarea whose fundamental purpose has changed, but continues to lie within theboundaries of a national wildlife refuge.", "Whatever development might be permitted, should it be seen as essentially temporary -- serving immediate energy needs and then being removed, followed byrestoring the 1002 area habitat to a condition as near as possible to itspre-development state? The answers to questions about rehabilitation of the 1002area, and the confidence in the response, will crucially affect not only anydevelopment of the area, but also will likely affect views on whether the 1002 areashould be opened to exploration and production in the first place.", "Conditions for Rehabilitation. Total rehabilitation after development could be defined as restoration to a state whicha trained ecologist could not distinguish from the original ecosystem. So defined,total rehabilitation of the 1002 area might require centuries and could be impossible,since it might be confounded by other long-term changes: global warming, changesin sea level, expansion or contraction of the polar ice cap, changes in the northernpolar hole in the ozone layer or in CO 2 levels, etc. On the other hand, if \"substantial\"rehabilitation were defined as restoration of the area to a state approximating theoriginal, with a full complement of pre-development species (if not all atpre-development population levels), so that at least untrained observers could noteasily or frequently detect human influences, then such a level might be anachievable but very difficult goal. Such a goal would probably require not merely theremoval of structures and equipment and stringent pollution control, including thesafe disposal of hazardous and other wastes, but also the return to pre-developmenthuman population levels, the removal of gravel roads, and the restoration of nativevegetation.", "As yet no major operating oil fields anywhere are known to have been shut down permanently, and many have kept producing long beyond initial expectations,due to enhanced recovery techniques. Thus there is little relevant experience to guidea total closure of potential 1002 area development. Interestingly, in 1988 ARCOAlaska said with respect to Prudhoe Bay that \"Large scale rehabilitation/restorationis neither currently practical nor required by Federal or State regulations.\" (173) Thus,rehabilitation and restoration could be an important feature in congressional debateconcerning the 1002 area.", "Human Population Levels. In an oil field, human population levels reach a peak during the construction phase, once aproducible field has been confirmed. In 1987, the FLEIS estimated 1,500 workersat the peak of construction. (174) After majorconstruction projects are completed,personnel levels drop to those needed for operations -- perhaps a few hundredworkers -- or for smaller construction projects such as the addition of new drill pads.", "Once energy production ceases, it is hard to imagine what incentives would hold workers in the 1002 area, since few other industries seem likely to seek the high costof North Slope operations. An important exception would be Alaska Natives,presumably those in Kaktovik especially. With an increasing reliance on a monetaryeconomy, both for personal and local government income, there may be pressure tomaintain development to support (possibly subsidized) alternative local industries,including tourism. The North Slope Borough has stated that its support for 1002development stems partly from a concern over declining Prudhoe Bay revenues,which are used for schools, fire stations, and other facilities. Over the years, littledebate has focused on the post-development status of permanent human populations -- a reflection, in part, of a lack of debate on the long-term fate of the 1002 area ingeneral.", "Removal of Roads and Gravel Structures. There is a striking distinction between the accesspolicies around development areas in the North Slope versus those in the 1002 areaas it is currently managed. In the former, a road network provides relatively easytransportation, but its use is largely restricted to authorized persons. In the latter, thelack of roads requires aircraft for most travel, but the journey is relativelyunrestricted. If Congress decides to authorize 1002 area development, the fate ofroads could have far-reaching environmental effects. (175)", "Under the scenario for development based on current technologies, fewer roads would be built than with older technology. However, if oil prices fall, or operatingcosts rise, the cost of reliance on expensive aircraft might make construction of haulroads seem attractive, especially for movement of heavy equipment. In addition, itis unclear whether any restrictions on road construction would apply to Native lands,and still less whether requirements for road removal would apply on Native lands. In any event, under all current scenarios, it is likely that at least some roads would bebuilt. If these are in unconnected small segments, as at Alpine, their effects onhuman access would probably be quite small. Experience in national parks, nationalforests, and national wildlife refuges has shown that reducing human access canbenefit sensitive species, in such matters as preventing illegal hunting, or reducingdisturbance of nesting sites, calving areas, or spawning streams.", "Removing millions of tons of gravel from roads (and pads) -- some of it contaminated with oil or other toxins -- would be expensive, but so would continuedgravel maintenance to preserve culverts and other flow control measures. Costswould likely prevent either the total removal of roads once production ceased, or theindefinite maintenance of the full network. Unless otherwise specified or required,rehabilitation of gravel structures would likely include removal of culverts andbridges to ensure natural drainage, grading and scoring of the road or pad surfaces,and seeding of grasses and forbs. Care would be required to minimize erosion,sedimentation, and ponding. Probably, only if there were a need for gravel elsewherewould some portion of the gravel be removed from abandoned roadbeds.", "Thus, if leasing is allowed and production is achieved, there appear to be several options, depending on the gravel structure and congressional policy. First, some maywish to see certain useful structures retained even if all production ceases. Examplesof such structures are water treatment plants and some airfields. Others, such as drillpads, seem unlikely to be useful in a post-production setting, and would likely bepriority candidates for removal. Finally, for roads, there appear to be two basicoptions: maintain some roads while rehabilitating rights of way for the rest; orabandon all of the roads and rehabilitate the rights of way in an effort to return topre-development conditions. If development were to result in increased tourism ( e.g. ,visitor centers or visitor cabins), there might be considerable pressure to keep at leastsome roads open, especially if tourism were seen as a continuing source of incomefor Natives after development ceased. Continuing access could be expected toprolong habitat disturbance and delay rehabilitation. ", "Restoration of Native Vegetation. Once production ceased, restoration of the correct species and adequate numbers ofnative plants would be a key factor in restoration of animal populations. There is akey distinction between the 1002 area and the developed areas to the west: the rollinghills of much of the 1002 area support more shrubby, woody vegetation, while thewetlands of the developed areas are dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Thus,restoration experience around Prudhoe Bay and environs may provide usefultechniques for only part of the 1002 area. Moreover, recent research has shown that\"none but the smallest and wettest patches on level ground ... recovered unassistedto something approaching their original state in the medium term (20-75 years).\" (176) In larger, drier, or more sloping sites, revegetation (where it occurred) often resultedin a species composition that differed from the original state. \"A wide range of smalldisturbances resulted in alternative vegetation states with reduced speciesdiversity.\" (177) If roads and other gravelstructures were not removed, revegetation onthese structures would be particularly difficult, due to drying, loss of seeds, anderosion. On the other hand, revegetation at the edges of the pads would be lessdifficult, due to wetter conditions and protection from wind. ", "Site Phase-Out. The requirement to remove all facilities and to rehabilitate the site is generally a term or condition ofa lease sale. Thus far, there is relatively limited experience in the arctic from whichto judge the effectiveness of this requirement. North Slope fields that have beendeveloped are still active and only a relatively small number of drilling sites havebeen abandoned. These abandoned sites include a few artificial drilling islands in theBeaufort Sea and a number of onshore sites, several of which are in the NPR-A. Atthe abandoned island sites, facilities and slope protection have been removed and theartificial islands were left to erode away. The NPR-A example is particularlyrelevant to ANWR development.", "Site Cleanup in the NPR-A. Before the recent return to NPR-A prospects, there were two rounds of drilling in theNPR-A. The most recent was between 1974 and 1981, when 28 wells were drilledin a federal program under the supervision of USGS. In that round, each exploratorysite included a drill pad, airstrip, and source of water supply. Buildings andequipment were located on the drilling pad, often on pilings to prevent thawing of thepermafrost. The pad design included a fuel storage pit, a reserve pit for drilling fluidsand cuttings, and a flare pit.", "Cleanup included removing miscellaneous debris, cutting off pilings below ground level, and filling the pits by grading off and contouring the gravel pads. Thenrevegetation of the sites was attempted using grass seed mixtures and fertilizer. Theprogram for revegetating the pads met with mixed success. Generally, the leastsuccess was found at some coastal sites where pads were constructed of relativelybrine-rich clay silts excavated from the reserve pits. Considering the somewhatexperimental nature of the revegetation program and the variability of individualsites, revegetation was thought to progress at reasonable to excellent rates by 1986. (178) In the interim, pad construction techniques elsewhere on the North Slope haveevolved, and exploration pads such as those in the USGS program at NPR-A wouldbe built of ice. ", "However, as with roads, the return of vegetation is not identical to recovery of the tundra to its previous condition. Even if organic matter is left intact after adisturbance, \"significant and essentially permanent change [in] both vegetation andsoils\" may still occur. (179) Nonetheless, amanager may be satisfied if a site simplyreturns to a plant-covered, stable surface. (180)", "Site Development and Facility Removal. Facility removal really begins as soon as drillinga well is finished. At that point, the drill rig is removed, leaving only pipe valves andgages for each well and any operational facilities on the pad. When a field isdepleted or a well is abandoned, the well is plugged with cement plugs at variouspoints and at the surface. Surface facilities are removed, and the pad would begraded and revegetated. The FLEIS full development scenario estimated that 5,650acres scattered around the 1.5 million acre 1002 area would be physically coveredwith gravel (less than 0.4%). As noted previously (see Land and Gravel Use , above),somewhat less would probably be covered with the use of modern technologies,though these features would still be scattered in various spots around the 1002 area. Until the affected areas were restored and revegetated, the impacts would remainvisible (at least as long as they were not concealed by snow and darkness). Asdifferent requirements for rehabilitation might apply to Native lands, their inholdingsmight retain various structures or pads might remain for a considerably longer period.", "Retention of Facilities: the Other Option. The alternative to removing all drilling pads, roads,buildings, airstrips, and other facilities would be a judgment that some of thedevelopment may be of longer term and/or broader benefit than the oil and gasdevelopment in the immediate area. In remote regions of a hostile environment,emergency shelters can be life-savers. A building or other recognizable structure,such as a road or airstrip, in a featureless region can serve as a visual aid tonavigation, which can also save lives. In addition, if it were necessary to re-developa location, it would likely be less disruptive to the environment to reopen a closedfacility than to construct a new one. In any event, carrying out the actual restorationrequirements in ANWR would probably not arise for many years; thus a tensionmight exist between those preferring that a goal of restoration be made a conditionof development and those preferring that the decisions on some facilities beconsidered on a case-by-case basis later. In the later case, it could be difficult toenforce a cleanup measure that was not originally specified as regulation, or a termor condition of the lease."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Issues", "paragraphs": ["The ANWR debate has continued for such a long time that most issues have along history of debate.

There aretwo parts to the disposition question: (a) how would revenues be split between thefederal government and the state; and (b) how would the federal portion be used?", "Federal/State Split. The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) (189) governs the leasing ofoil and gas and certain other mineralsfrom federal public lands. Under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd35 of the MLA, certain western states receivedirectly 50% of revenues received. An additional 40% goes to those states indirectlythrough the construction and maintenance of irrigation projects under theReclamation Act of 1902. (190) Before 1976,these percentages were 37\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% and 52\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd%respectively. Because the territory of Alaska did not benefit from the ReclamationAct, it received only a 37\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% share of federal leasing revenues. Before enactment ofthe Alaska Statehood Act, Congress amended the MLA to provide that the territorywould receive an additional 52\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% share, thereby putting Alaska on the same footingas the other states. (191) Section 28(b) of theAlaska Statehood Act again amended theMLA to change the references from territory to State of Alaska. (192) Section 317 of theFederal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 amended the revenues section of MLAto direct payment of 90% to Alaska, rather than the separate percentages previouslystated. (193) The committee report accompanyingthe 1976 change states that the actionwas intended to clarify that Alaska was to continue to receive 90% of the mineralrevenues taken in from federal lands in Alaska. (194)", "Alaska has asserted that the 90% total referenced in the Statehood Act cannot be changed and must always be paid to the state because the Statehood Act is acompact between the prospective state and the federal government. Others assert thatthe Statehood Act provision was a technical one, meant to recognize that Alaskashould receive a share comparable to that of other states under the MLA , but does notpreclude the Congress from changing the MLA or at times making special provisionfor leasing certain areas under a different regimen. ", "Alaska sued in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, asserting that because the United States had an obligation under the Statehood Act both to maximize mineralleasing in Alaska and to always pay a 90% share of gross receipts to Alaska, theUnited States had either breached the contract established by the Statehood Act, or\"taken\" property of Alaska by withdrawing some lands in Alaska from leasing(notably ANWR) and by deducting administrative costs prior to the disbursement ofthe 90% revenues to the State. The court found that the Statehood Act and theprevious statute providing the territory of Alaska with the same shares as the otherstates \"simply plugged [Alaska] into the MLA, along with the other States.\" (195) Therefore, Congress could amend the MLA, e.g ., to provide a different way ofcalculating receipts, and the changes would lawfully pertain to Alaska. Furthermore,the court concluded that the United States did not promise in the Statehood Act tomake federal mineral lands produce royalty revenues for the State, and that theUnited States therefore retained discretion over leasing decisions. (196) Because of thesefindings, the court also granted the government's motion for summary judgment onthe takings claim, dismissing Alaska's claim. ", "If the Statehood Act simply means that Alaska will be treated like other states under the MLA, the question may be asked whether Congress may legislate speciallyas to ANWR and prescribe different revenue-sharing provisions. Congress has doneso in the past, e.g. , with respect to the National Petroleum Reserves, in whichsituation all of the revenues go into the federal Treasury, (197) except for the NationalPetroleum Reserve in Alaska, in which instance the revenue sharing is 50/50. (198) Therefore, arguably Congress has flexibility in legislating regarding oil and gasleasing in the Refuge, including providing for the disposition of revenues from anysuch leasing. ", "Uses for Federal Share of Revenues. Proponents of opening ANWR for oil production pointout that the federal share of any revenues could be made available for variousconservation purposes, including ameliorating impacts, providing funds for researchon renewable energy sources, or assisting other refuges and conservation areas. While additional funding for these purposes would undoubtedly cheer manyenvironmental groups, it is difficult to name any such group whose views on ANWRdevelopment have been swayed by such proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wilderness Designation", "paragraphs": ["In each Congress since 1980, bills have been introduced in both House and Senate statutorily to designate the coastal plain of the Refuge as wilderness.
