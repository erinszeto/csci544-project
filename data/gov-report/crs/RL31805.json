That total is $3.5 billion below the Administration's request and $4.0billion above last year's enacted level.

The Secretary of Defensehas waived these various domestic preference restrictions in certain circumstances. (6) ", "This year's debate focused on the extent of DOD's waiver authorities in terms of both thecriteria and the items that could be covered. The Administration sought to widen circumstancespermitting waivers, whereas the House would have either required domestic purchase of additionalitems (such as machine tools) or made it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to waive currentrestrictions. (7) Forexample, the House bill required DOD to identify and then buy from U.S. sources items consideredto be \"critical\" to the U.S. defense industrial base as well as assess the extent of U.S. dependence onforeign suppliers. The House version also would have prohibited DOD from purchasing fromforeign countries who had restricted sales of military goods or services because of U.S. operationsin Iraq, a provision that could have affected both France and Germany.", "The Secretary of Defense had signaled that the Administration would veto the bill if theHouse provisions were included. Concerned about the effects of these provisions on U.S. traderelations, Senator Warner requested the State Department, the U.S. Trade Representative, and OMBto address the potential effects of the legislation on trade relationships and cooperative defenserelationships. (8) ", "Reflecting a compromise between the House's desire to expand protections for the defenseindustrial base and Senate's concerns about potential effects on U.S. trade relations, the conferenceversion dropped the new restrictions on certain items but required DOD to assess potential U.S.vulnerabilities. To meet Senate and Administration concerns about potential effects on U.S. traderelations, the conference bill stated that none of the provisions in this industrial base section wouldapply if the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State determine that U.S. international agreementswould be violated. (9) ", "To get a better understanding of the extent of DOD dependence on foreign sources or singledomestic sources for critical items or components of military systems, the Defense Department isto develop a \"Military System Essential Item Breakout List\" and identify where these items orcomponents are produced. DOD is to contract for a study that will define the criteria for \"critical\"and recommend items to be included on the list. ", "To give additional support to domestic producers of critical items, the conference agreementestablishes a new Defense Industrial Base Capabilities Fund that DOD can use to provide incentivepayments to domestic contractors. No funds are specifically authorized (or appropriated) for thisfund in FY2004, however. Another new industrial base tool for DOD is authority to give preferencein source selection to domestic producers of machine tools or other capital assets used to makedefense goods.

Instead, theSecretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, is to identify foreign countries whonow restrict military sales to the United States because of U.S. counterterrorism or militaryoperations; that list can be revised periodically. Even for those countries, DOD can purchase goodsif the department has a \"compelling and urgent\" need for the item.

The annual cost would increase steadily to $2 billion by FY2008 and $3.5 billion by2013.

(17) Signing of the contract has been held up because of questions ofimpropriety by two Boeing officials, Darlene Druyan, formerly in charge of Air Force acquisition,and Michael Sears, the Chief Financial Officer; Ms. Druyan is alleged to have discussed employmentopportunities with Boeing at a time when she was also negotiating the tanker deal.

(20) One contract could be implemented more quickly but could mean that the Air Force would payunnecessary costs associated with the lease. (21) ", "The lease 20, buy 80 alternative differs from the Air Force's original unprecedented proposalto contract with Boeing to lease and then buy100 aircraft for a cost of $29 billion over a 15-yearperiod, including support costs. The Air Force finds leasing attractive because major funding wouldnot be required until 2006, and the bulk of the funding would not be needed until 2010-2017.

(23) In hisconfirmation hearing to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology andLogistics, Michael Wynne suggested that the conference language may require that the Air Force payfor the aircraft when ordered rather than delaying payment by three years when the aircraft aredelivered. The Air Force has not identified how to fund the tanker within its current budget plans,which did not anticipate the tanker lease.", "This proposal has been controversial because leases are substantially more expensive thanbuying: the Air Force, CBO, CRS, and GAO all found that the lease would cost $5 billion to morethan $6 billion more than a multiyear buy of the aircraft, because the Air Force planned to rely ona special purpose entity to finance the deal and because congressional agencies and others havesuggested that the proposed lease did not meet the criteria for an operating lease.

(25) Although leasing 20 rather than 100 aircraft would be less costlythan the original proposal, the extent of the savings depends on how the Air Force implements theproposal. According to press reports, the Air Force now plans to use two contracts -- one for thelease and one for the buy -- costing a total of $18.3 billion in acquisition costs. That total would be$3.2 billion less than the previous $21.5 billion contract to lease and buy 100 aircraft but still $3.5billion more than CBO estimates a straight multiyear contract would cost.

The conferenceagreement also adopted the Administration proposal to use narrower definitions of harassment ofmarine mammals for DOD's military readiness and scientific activities of federal agencies than areapplied to other agencies.
