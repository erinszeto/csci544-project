Throughoutthe 1960s, Vietnam-related demonstrations andattacks at embassies, mostly involving destruction of property, were on the rise; and in 1965 the United Stateswitnessed the dawning of a new level of violencewhen 3 embassy employees were killed in the U.S. embassy in Saigon. The 1970s were marked by frequent terroristattacks on embassies; the decade ended withthe hostage taking in Tehran in 1979.

Security determinations are made afterconsultation among State's Office of Diplomatic Security, Office of Foreign Buildings Operations, and the embassysecurity officer in the overseas facility.

Nevertheless, State Departmentofficials are quick to point out that all threats are taken seriously. ", "Generally, procedures include a first level response in which the resident security officer and the regional officer of a facility confer with officials in Washingtonto discuss the credibility of the threat. Subsequent discussions determine whether the local post can handle thethreat alone or whether a greater response iswarranted. Normally, the regional security officer seeks information from the local police to assist in determiningthe credibility and the nature of the threat. U.S.intelligence also tries to verify the significance of the threat. Some of the actions that the Chief of Mission can takeinclude: closing surrounding streets (withlocal police concurrence), putting up concrete barriers, temporarily reducing staff size in the building, andevacuating all personnel from the area or country.

By themselves, these reductions (an average of $66.7 million annually) from theDepartment's total requests for security fundsdo not appear to support the implication by some critics that Congress has failed to support the Inman panel'srecommendations, especially since the cuts wereoften made for specific reasons related to construction delays or other practical considerations. Rather, it wouldappear that the State Department has not asked forfunds in the magnitude necessary to implement Inman recommendations, if more than the appropriated $5 billionwas necessary. Furthermore, in at least twoyears-FY1995 and FY1996-Congress rescinded a combined total of nearly $100 million of unobligated funds inState's Security and Maintenance of OverseasMissions account.
