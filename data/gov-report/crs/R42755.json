Participation and spending for the Post-9/11 GI Bill has represented approximately 80% or more of total GI Bill participation and spending in each year since FY2013. In FY2018, the program is estimated to benefit almost 800,000 individuals and expend over $12 billion. For a description of the other GI Bills, see CRS Report R42785, GI Bills Enacted Prior to 2008 and Related Veterans' Educational Assistance Programs: A Primer.", "The Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)\u2014enacted as Title V of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-252) on June 30, 2008\u2014is the newest GI Bill and went into effect on August 1, 2009. There were four main drivers for the Post-9/11 GI Bill: (1) providing parity of benefits for reservists and members of the regular Armed Forces, (2) ensuring comprehensive educational benefits, (3) meeting military recruiting goals, and (4) improving military retention through transferability of benefits.", "The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides benefits to veterans and servicemembers and their family members. Veterans and servicemembers who serve an aggregate minimum of 90 days on active duty after September 10, 2001, and continue serving or are discharged honorably may be eligible. In addition, individuals who have been discharged or released for a service-connected disability after serving a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty after September 10, 2001, may be eligible. There are two mechanisms by which dependents of individuals with military service may be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits may be available to the dependents of servicemembers who serve for at least 10 years. Also, the Post-9/11 GI Bill Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship Program may be available to the spouse and children of servicemembers who die while serving on active duty in the line of duty.", "Participants may be eligible for payments to cover tuition and fees, housing, books and supplies, tutorial and relocation assistance, and testing and certification fees. Individuals who serve on active duty for 36 months after September 10, 2001, may receive a tuition and fees benefit of up to the amount of in-state tuition and fees charged when enrolled in public institutions of higher learning (IHLs), or up to $22,805.34 when enrolled in private IHLs in academic year 2017-2018. In general, the monthly housing allowance is based on the Department of Defense (DOD)-determined monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH) for a member of the Armed Forces with dependents in pay grade E-5 and varies depending on location. Benefit payments vary depending on the participant's active duty status, length of qualifying active duty, rate of pursuit, and program of education. For example, participants on active duty are not eligible for a Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance.", "Many Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals are eligible for another GI Bill or other veterans program that could support educational achievement such as Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX). Individuals with a single qualifying active duty service period must make an irrevocable election to give up benefits under one other GI Bill program to receive benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Similarly, individuals may not establish Post-9/11 GI Bill and UCX eligibility based on the same period of service."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), previously named the Veterans Administration, has been providing veterans educational assistance (GI Bill \u00ae ) benefits since 1944. The benefits have been intended, at various times, to compensate for compulsory service, encourage voluntary service, prevent unemployment, provide equitable benefits to all who served, and promote military retention. In general, the benefits provide grant aid to eligible individuals enrolled in approved educational and training programs. The newest GI Bill was enacted on June 30, 2008, as the Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), Title V of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-252 ). Although the VA still provides benefits under several older GI Bills, participation and spending for the Post-9/11 GI Bill has represented approximately 80% or more of total GI Bill participation and spending in each year since FY2013. In FY2018, the program is estimated to benefit almost 800,000 individuals and expend over $12 billion.", "The Post-9/11 GI Bill was enacted in response to findings that \"service on active duty in the Armed Forces [had] been especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since September 11, 2001,\" and that there was a need for an educational assistance program that provided \"enhanced educational assistance benefits \u2026 worthy of such service.\" The benefits were designed to meet four main objectives: ", "1. provide reservists benefits equivalent to members of the regular Armed Forces for equivalent, though often not continuous, active duty service; 2. ensure comprehensive educational benefits; 3. meet military recruiting goals; and 4. improve military retention through transferability of benefits. ", "It was recognized that veterans and servicemembers would be eligible for U.S. Department of Education (ED) student financial aid benefits such as Pell Grants and Stafford Loans; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) educational assistance; and various state, local, and other federal benefits in addition to the basic Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Many Members of Congress hoped that a benefit that exceeded amounts available under the other active GI Bills would ameliorate the military recruiting challenges and higher unemployment rate among veterans compared with non-veterans of the same age group that existed in 2008. ", "There was some discussion about whether increasing the monthly benefit might result in lower retention in the Armed Forces. Some DOD research suggested that education is not a very important factor in the decision to stay in or leave the military, while other evidence suggested that very high education benefits would encourage discharge. DOD considered the ability to transfer benefits to dependents critical to retention. The Administration was interested in transferability as well, and President George W. Bush advocated for transferability in a State of the Union address.", "The Post-9/11 GI Bill is codified under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 33. The stated purpose is to reward members of the Armed Forces for service on active duty since September 11, 2001; maintain a history of offering educational assistance to veterans; respond to the needs of the Armed Forces when not at peace; demonstrate the high esteem with which military service is held; recognize the difficult challenges involved in readjusting to civilian life after serving; and enhance the educational assistance benefits to those who serve on active duty after September 10, 2001. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides aid payments to or on behalf of participants pursuing approved programs of education for tuition and fees, housing, books and supplies, and other education-related expenditures. The program became effective August 1, 2009. The program is permanently authorized and supported through mandatory funds.", "Following enactment, concerns were raised about several aspects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and calls were made for the program to be amended.

The Restoring GI Bill Fairness Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-26 ), enacted on August 3, 2011, temporarily reverses one amendment of the Improvements Act for some individuals attending private institutions of higher learning (IHLs) in seven states.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 ( P.L. 114-92 ), enacted on November 25, 2015, prohibits concurrent receipt of unemployment insurance and Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits.
