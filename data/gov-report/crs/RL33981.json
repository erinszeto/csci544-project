According to the President's budget request, in FY2008, funds from a reauthorized MDUFMA would account for an estimated $47.5 million and 200 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This would comprise 16.6% of FDA's medical device review budget authority and 13.0% of its medical device review-related FTEs. While these numbers and percentages are not as high as those projected for collection under a similar FDA user fee authority related to prescription drugs (pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act), they are significant.", "For MDUFMA as passed in 2002, the fee amounts and performance goals articulated and incorporated in statute were the result of an agreement between FDA and the medical device industry. In order to facilitate the reauthorization of MDUFMA, in April 2007, the FDA and industry published the results of their negotiations with a notice of an April 30, 2007, public meeting on the topic. According to FDA, during the five years covered by the proposals (through 2012), FDA would receive approximately $287 million from user fees. This represents an increase from the $110 million FDA received during the first four years of the program.", "The industry agreement also calls for changes in the fee structure, performance goals, small business relief, and third-party inspection program. In addition, the agreement reflects FDA's initiatives related to the regulation of in vitro diagnostic devices (laboratory tests). (MDUFMA enabled third-party inspections and set standards for the use of reprocessed single-use devices.) The details of the proposed reauthorization of MDUFMA have been incorporated, with a few exceptions, into the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2007 (MDUFA 2007). On May 9, 2007, MDUFA 2007 passed the Senate as Title III of the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082).

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices in the United States. According to statute, a medical device is", "an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is (1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them, (2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. (Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 \u00a7201(h)) (FFDCA).", "According to this definition, a medical device can be anything from a tongue depressor to a home\u00a0pregnancy test to a wheelchair to a pacemaker. Types of medical devices vary widely, as do\u00a0their respective manufacturing requirements. In part due to the diversity of medical devices, compared to the drug industry, the device industry is more fragmented, smaller (estimated earnings of $80 billion in 2004 compared to the drug industry's estimated $222 billion), and dominated by smaller companies.", "FDA is divided into six centers, each charged with regulating a particular type of product. The center within FDA primarily responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). One other center, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), regulates some devices\u2014specifically those associated with blood collection and processing procedures, as well as with cellular therapies (e.g., stem cell treatments). Jurisdiction of the centers' medical device review is governed by the FDA Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDRH (October 31, 1991).", "CDRH categorizes medical devices according to their risk into one of three classes: Class I, II, and III. (See Table 1 .) The risk a device poses, and the regulatory controls required, increase from Class I to Class III. The device classification regulation defines the regulatory requirements for a general device type. Most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification (510(k)) and require only registration with FDA before marketing; most Class II devices require a 510(k) before marketing; and most Class III devices require Premarket Approval (PMA). Most PMAs and some 510(k)s require clinical trials, which are conducted with FDA permission via an investigational device exemption (IDE) that allows a device to be used in a study to gather information on its safety and effectiveness. Devices are reviewed by CBER under a biological license application (BLA).", "To supplement a PMA when there are changes in safety and effectiveness data, FDA may require one of four types of submissions: Panel Track Supplements, 180-Day Supplements, Real Time Supplements, and 30-Day Notices. Panel Track Supplements are akin to second entire PMAs. They reflect new indications for use or significant changes in device design or performance, and require substantial clinical data. As artificial heart valve approved for use to replace the aortic valve, and proposed for use in the mitral valve, would require the submission of a Panel Track Supplement. 180-Day Supplements are submitted for significant changes to medical device components, materials, designs, specifications, software, labeling, or color additives. A proposed change in a blood glucose monitoring system from wired to wireless telemetry would require this type of submission. Real Time Supplements are submitted when there are minor changes to the design, software, sterilization or labeling of a device. A change in the storage temperature and expiration dating for an injectable gel would require this type of supplement. 30-Day Notices are submitted for modifications to manufacturing processes or methods, such as a change in the sterilization process.", "FDA offers one alternative that can be used in place of a PMA: the Product Development Protocol (PDP). A PDP is based upon early consultation between the sponsor and the FDA, leading to a device development and testing plan acceptable to both parties. It aims to minimize the risk that the sponsor will unknowingly pursue\u2014with the associated waste of capital and other resources\u2014the development of a device that FDA will not approve.", "One additional type of submission is a 513(g) request, so named because of the section of the FFDCA that regulates it. 513(g)s enable requesters to obtain information from FDA regarding the regulatory status of their devices or products.", "Of all device-related submissions, a PMA (or Panel Track Supplement) is the most rigorous and time consuming application process for manufacturers and review process for the FDA. A 510(k) is significantly less rigorous, and is much more common. The majority of medical devices that come to market do so with 510(k) clearance rather than PMA approval. (See Table 2 .)", "In the years prior to MDUFMA's enactment, FDA's resources for its device and radiological health programs had increased at a lower rate than its costs. As stated in the House Report to H.R. 3580 (MDUFMA):", "The medical device industry is growing rapidly. The complexity of medical device technology is increasing at an equally rapid pace. Unfortunately, FDA's device review program lacks the resources to keep up with the rapidly growing industry and changing technology. Because prompt approval and clearance of safe and effective medical devices is critical to improving public health, it is the sense of the Committee that adequate funding for the program is essential.", "In addition to filing applications for clearance or approval with FDA, device manufacturers must be registered with FDA and file annual reports. In addition, FDA inspects establishments where medical devices that are marketed in the United States are manufactured to assess compliance with FDA's quality system requirements for ensuring good manufacturing practices (GMP) and other applicable requirements. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO):", "During quality system inspections, FDA investigators examine manufacturing controls,\u00a0processes, and records. These inspections are FDA's primary means of assuring that the\u00a0safety and effectiveness of medical devices are not jeopardized by poor manufacturing\u00a0practices.", "In addition to issues raised by medical device review funding and inspection capabilities at FDA, prior to MDUFMA, concerns had also emerged regarding the reprocessing and re-use of medical devices that FDA had cleared or approved as single use devices (SUDs). Reprocessing means cleaning and sterilizing a device and verifying that it functions properly.

The new fees are an annual establishment registration fee (paid once each year by each manufacturer), an annual fee for filing periodic reports (applicable to Class III devices approved under PMAs, premarket reports, and PDP processes), and a fee for filing a 30-Day Notice. The FDA Agreement states that the implementation of these new fees would allow for significant reduction in MDUFA 2007 of existing application fees. (See Table 7 .) Generally, fees would increase each year by 8.5%, which, according to FDA's recommendation, would ensure that fee revenues contribute their expected share to total program costs, and provide industry with stability and predictability in the fee revenues it would expect to pay. For the newly created establishment fee, the Secretary could increase the fee amount in FY2010 up to an additional 8.5% over the annual 8.5% increase if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009.
