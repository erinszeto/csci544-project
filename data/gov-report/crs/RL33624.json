Each of these changes is discussed in detail in a subsequent section of this report. It should be noted that the act provides funding to eligible agencies and eligible recipients. An eligible agency is the state board that functions as the sole state agency responsible for the administration or supervision of career and technical education in a specific state. An eligible recipient receives funding from the eligible agency and includes, for example, local educational agencies and public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education that offer career and technical education courses leading to various outcomes, such as an industry-recognized credential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Changes", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 109-270 , the Carl D.

However, as shown in Table 2 , Perkins IV makes several changes in these reservations to reflect certain changes in the act.", "The amount reserved for assistance for outlying areas has been reduced from 0.2% of funds appropriated under Section 9 to 0.13%. This reduced percentage reflects the fact that two freely associated states (FASs)\u2014Micronesia and the Marshall Islands\u2014are no longer eligible for Perkins funding because the United States and these FASs have signed an agreement to extend their Compacts of Free Association.", "In addition, P.L. 109-270 increases the amount of direct grants to outlying areas (Section 115). Under Perkins III, Guam received a direct grant of $500,000 and American Samoa and the Northern Marianas each received direct grants of $190,000. Remaining funds were then distributed to the Pacific Regional Educational Laboratory (PREL), which would make grants to these three outlying areas and to eligible FASs. Under current law, direct grants are $660,000 for Guam and $350,000 each for American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. For the first fiscal year after the enactment of Perkins IV (FY2007), the Secretary distributes remaining funds to PREL as before. In subsequent years, remaining funds are divided equally among the three outlying areas. Finally, Palau receives a direct grant of $160,000 for as long as it is eligible for Perkins funding.", "As Table 2 illustrates, the percentage reserved for assistance for Indians and Native Hawaiians under Section 116 has not changed. However, the reservation for incentive grants has been repealed. These funds are now distributed to states under the \" State Allotment Formula \" discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Allotment Formula", "paragraphs": ["Of funds appropriated under Section 9, Perkins IV, slightly more than 98% is allotted to states based on the formula detailed in Section 111. The underlying formula is identical in Perkins III and Perkins IV: Funds are initially allotted based on three population groups (population ages 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65). These initial allotments are adjusted by states' per capita income (PCI), such that states with below average PCIs tend to receive somewhat increased grants, and those with above average PCIs tend to receive somewhat decreased grants.", "Perkins IV maintains the state allotment formula used under Perkins III unless \"additional funds\" are available above the FY2006 funding level. If funding allotted to states contains no \"additional funds,\" the formula is unchanged. That is, the initial formula factors are applied, subject to the minimum grant provisions and to the provision that holds states harmless at 100% of their FY1998 grant amount. Assuming appropriations are level funded at the FY2006 amount, states with growing populations, such as Arizona and North Carolina, will tend to receive increased grants. States at their FY1998 grant amounts, such as Vermont and Wyoming, will continue to receive those grant amounts. Other states' grants will tend to decline, as funding shifts to states with more rapidly growing populations.", "P.L. 109-270 modifies the state allotment formula when there are \"additional funds\" above the amount allotted to states for FY2006. \"Additional funds\" are defined as amounts in excess of funds allotted to states for FY2006, plus the amount set-aside for incentive grants for FY2006 and $827,671. These additions to the amount allotted to states in the base year ensure that funds previously reserved for incentive grants and funds previously reserved for outlying areas no longer eligible for funding (the specified dollar amount) are not considered \"additional funds,\" which trigger the formula changes discussed below.", " Table 3 illustrates how \"additional funds\" would be calculated assuming a 1% overall increase in FY2006 appropriations under Section 9. First the FY2006 state grant amount would be calculated by subtracting the set-asides from the total appropriation ($1.182 billion minus $26.5 million = $1.156 billion), which was the amount allotted by formula to states for FY2006. Next the amount for incentive grants ($6.384 million) and $827,671 are added to the state formula amount. This results in the FY2006 \"base\" amount of $1.163 billion. Any funds in excess of this base amount is defined as new money, which is allotted as described below. In Table 3 , this amount is $1.175 billion (the amount allotted to states by formula) minus $1.163 billion (the FY2006 base amount) which equals $11.631 million (the additional funds).", "Up to one-third of the \"additional funds\" (about $3.88 million based on the example in Table 3 ) would be allotted to states (except for the Virgin Islands) with FY2006 grants that are less than the minimum grant amount of \u00bd% of the current-year funds allotted to states. Based on the example, these would be states with FY2006 grants less than $5.87 million (i.e., \u00bd% of the amount allotted to states\u2014$1.175 billion), which would be Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The \"additional funds\" for these \"qualifying\" states would be allotted in proportion to how much below the minimum grant amount of \u00bd% each state's FY2006 grant is. For example, Vermont and Wyoming, with FY2006 grants of $4.2 million, would receive larger amounts of funding than Maine and Rhode Island, which received FY2006 grants of nearly $5.8 million. As a result of this allotment procedure, none of these states could receive more than the minimum grant amount of \u00bd% of the current amount allotted to states. The remaining funds (at least two-thirds of the \"additional funds\" or about $7.75 million based on the above example) would be allotted to the other states based on the underlying formula, except that no state would receive a grant less than its FY1998 grant."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Within State Allocation and Substate Formulas", "paragraphs": ["The Perkins Act specifics how funds received by states must be allocated with respect to the percentage reserved at the state level and the percentage subsequently distributed to the local level.

States may reserve up to 10% of the funds distributed to the local level for eligible recipients in rural areas and in areas with high percentages or high numbers of career and technical education students.

The act does not change the distribution of funds for eligible postsecondary institutions (e.g., community colleges) and consortia of such institutions. Funds continue to be distributed based on each eligible institution's number of Pell grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. For example, if an eligible institution accounted for 10% of all such recipients among all eligible institutions in a state, that institution would receive 10% of the funds the state set-aside for postsecondary career and technical education.", "P.L. 109-270 does change the substate formula for distribution of funds for secondary school CTE programs, although this change should have no practical impact. Under prior law, 30% of funds designated for secondary education programs were to be distributed based on school districts' shares of resident population ages 15 to 19; and 70% of funds were to be distributed based on shares of individuals ages 15 to 19 from poor families. The act permitted the Secretary to waive this formula if a state could demonstrate \"that a proposed formula more effectively targets funds on the basis of poverty\" (Section 131(c)(1)). Because population and poverty data for the 15 to 19 age group are not available at the school district level, the Secretary has waived the application of this formula (apparently for all states). Instead, the Secretary has allowed states to use resident population and poverty data for ages 5 to 17, which is available at the school district level because these data are used to allot grants under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). P.L. 109-270 codifies this procedure in law: 30% of funds designated for secondary education programs is distributed based on school districts' shares of resident population ages 5 to 17; 70% is distributed based on shares of residents ages 5 to 17 who are from poor families."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "National Programs", "paragraphs": ["Section 114 of the Perkins Act authorizes certain national programs and activities, such as a national assessment of vocational education, research, and dissemination.

Perkins IV, however, includes greater specification of membership on the independent advisory panel. The contents of the assessment are similar under Perkins III and Perkins IV, but Perkins IV adds additional requirements. For example, in examining teacher preparation and qualifications, it is recommended that this include whether CTE faculty meet teacher certification or licensing requirements. The evaluation must also consider career and technical education achievement, in addition to academic achievement and employment outcomes. It must also examine the \"extent and success of the integration of rigorous and challenging academic and career and technical education\" and the outcomes of such integration on academic and technical proficiency achievement. The assessment must also determine whether CTE programs are preparing students for employment in occupations in which mathematics and science skills are critical.

The application must include information as required by the Secretary, as well as information based on trends provided in accordance with Section 15 of the Wagner-Peyser Act.

For example, Perkins III states that designated entities must provide programs to assist \"individuals\" to improve career and occupational decision making.
