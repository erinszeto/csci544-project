One of the primary strategic goals of the USDA is to \"assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving.\" While many rural telecommunications providers already have deployed broadband networks, studies, surveys, and data collections continue to show that broadband access, on average, is less adequate in rural areas than it is in suburban or urban communities. ", "The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem and DSL \u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.", "Given the RUS emphasis on \"rural\" broadband, the issue becomes: what level of \"rurality\" is necessary for an area to be eligible for RUS broadband grants or loans? Within the RUS telecommunications portfolio, there is no standard definition of \"rural,\" with programs such as the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program defining eligible rural areas as populations less than 20,000 (plus areas not in an urbanized area adjacent to a city of not more than 50,000), while the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program defines eligible areas as populations of 5,000 or less (extremely rural areas). Among all the RUS telecommunications programs, the different definitions of eligible service areas (which correspond to definitions of rurality) are presented in Table 1 . ", "Shifting definitions of \"rural\" have generated controversy. For example, during the first round of BIP awards, a separate category called \"remote areas\" was created, defined as an unserved rural area at least 50 miles from the limits of a non-rural area. For last mile projects, only remote areas were eligible for BIP grants (as opposed to loans or grant/loan combinations). The remote area category was eliminated in the second round, due to criticism from many Members of Congress who argued that the remote rural definition excluded many areas of the country (primarily in the eastern half of the United States). ", "The definition of \"rural\" has also generated much controversy over the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee program, particularly as Congress continues to refine the program through periodic consideration of the farm bill. Over the life of the broadband loan program, the definition of a rural area eligible for the program has been changed three separate times by Congress. Ultimately, the definition of what constitutes a rural community is always a difficult issue for congressional policymakers in determining how to target rural communities for broadband assistance. On the one hand, the narrower the definition the greater the possibility that deserving communities may be excluded. On the other hand, the broader the definition used, the greater the possibility that communities not typically considered \"rural\" or \"underserved\" may be eligible for financial assistance.", "During the 113 th Congress, the 2013 farm bill\u2014which would amend the statute authorizing the rural broadband loan and loan guarantee program\u2014explicitly addresses the rural definition issue. For example, S. 954 , the Senate-passed version of the farm bill (the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013), would adopt a uniform definition of \"rural area\" for all USDA rural development programs, including the broadband program. Under the Senate bill, a rural area would be defined as any area that is not a city or town with a population greater than 50,000, and that is not an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town with a population over 50,000. Because the current definition of a rural area eligible for broadband loans is towns with populations under 20,000, this new definition would increase the number of larger communities eligible for broadband assistance.

By contrast, urban and suburban areas are more likely to have a greater number of existing broadband providers offering service.", "One of the ongoing concerns expressed by some Members of Congress is the extent to which RUS grants and loans have been awarded to projects serving areas that already have existing providers offering broadband service. The issue of providing federal funding to areas and communities with existing providers is controversial, and has been previously raised with respect to the RUS Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program and the Broadband Initiatives Program. Broadband awards to areas with preexisting service\u2014that is, areas where existing companies already provide some level of broadband\u2014have sparked controversy because award recipients might compete to some extent with other companies already providing broadband service. On the one hand, one could argue that the federal government should not be subsidizing competitors for broadband service, particularly in sparsely populated rural markets which may be able only to support one provider. Furthermore, providing grants and loans for projects serving communities with preexisting broadband service may divert assistance from unserved areas that are most in need. ", "On the other hand, many suburban and urban areas currently receive the benefits of competition among broadband providers\u2014competition which can potentially drive down prices while improving service and performance. It is therefore appropriate, others have argued, that rural areas also receive the benefits of competition, which in some areas may not be possible without federal financial assistance. It is also argued that it may not be economically feasible for applicants to serve sparsely populated unserved communities unless they are permitted to also serve more lucrative areas which may already have existing providers. ", "The existing provider issue was examined during congressional consideration of the 2012 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill (which is the current statute in force) set specific restrictions on the broadband loan eligibility of project areas with existing providers. However, RUS did not issue a rule reflecting those changes until March 2011. Organizations representing the cable industry have argued that existing provider restrictions should be strengthened to focus the loan program more exclusively on unserved areas with no existing providers. By contrast, organizations representing rural telecommunications providers (primarily the traditional rural telephone companies) counter that no changes should be made to the existing provider restrictions, given that RUS has had limited opportunity to award new loans under the new 2008 farm bill rules. In the 2013 farm bill, S. 954 , as passed by the Senate, would change the existing provider restrictions currently in statute. In the House, a hearing held on April 25, 2012, by the House Subcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture, Committee on Agriculture, debated whether or not the rural broadband loan program should be modified to prohibit loans to projects serving areas with incumbent broadband service providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loans vs. Grants", "paragraphs": ["The ARRA broadband stimulus program\u2014which is no longer offering awards\u2014offered grants, loans, and grant/loan combinations. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program does not offer grants. Not surprisingly, those seeking federal broadband assistance typically prefer grants, given that loans must be paid back with interest. On the other hand, from a federal budgetary perspective, loans are more attractive than grants, not only because loans are paid back, but because loan programs are subsidized by a much smaller appropriation (called a loan subsidy). Thus, for example, the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program was appropriated a loan subsidy of $6 million in FY2013, which is estimated to support a loan level of approximately $64 million. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program, which has been issuing loans since 1949, is funded at a loan level of $690 million, yet typically requires no loan subsidy or appropriation.", "The issue of loans versus grants became part of the debate over the farm bill and the reauthorization of the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. Senate-passed S. 954 would add a new grant program to the rural broadband program, and would raise the authorization level from $25 million to $50 million per year. The Senate bill does not specify how much of the authorization would be targeted to grants versus loans. Given that financing loans costs the federal government significantly less than financing grants, the proportion of grants to loans would likely be of interest to the Appropriations Committees, which remain under pressure to reduce overall federal discretionary spending.

During the 20 th century, government and industry efforts to expand telephone service led to the development of a complex system of cross subsidies to expand the network and address universal service goals. For example, profits from more densely populated, lower cost urbanized areas helped to subsidize wiring and operation costs for the less populous, higher cost rural areas.", "With the advent of competition and the breakup of the Bell System, the complex system of cross subsidies that evolved to support universal service goals was no longer tenable. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ; 47 U.S.C., 1996 act) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services (\u00a7254), and the FCC established a universal service fund (USF or Fund) to meet the objectives and principles contained in the act. The 1996 act enumerated specific universal service principles including that \"access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided to all regions of the Nation\" (\u00a7254 [b] [2]) and \"consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas\" (\u00a7254 [b] [3]). The concept of universal service was also expanded to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates (\u00a7254[b][6] and 254[h]).", "One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service in the last decade was whether access to advanced telecommunications services (i.e., broadband) should be incorporated into universal service objectives. With the growing importance and acceptance of broadband and Internet access, gaps in access to such services, particularly in rural areas, generated concern. A growing number of policymakers felt that the USF should play a role in helping to alleviate this availability gap. They pointed to the provisions, cited above, contained in the Universal Service section of the 1996 act to support their position. However, with the exception of funding for schools and libraries and rural health care providers, the USF was not designed to directly support broadband.", "Provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) called for the FCC to develop, and submit to Congress, a national broadband plan (NBP) to ensure that every American has \"access to broadband capability.\" This plan, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan , submitted to Congress on March 16, 2010, called for the USF to play a major role in achieving this goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Universal Service Fund\u2014A Fund in Transition", "paragraphs": ["The federal Universal Service Fund (USF or Fund) was established in 1997 to meet the specific objectives and principles contained in the 1996 act.

The FCC, through the USF, provides universal service support through a number of direct mechanisms that target both providers of and subscribers to telecommunications services. The USF was designed to provide subsidies for voice telecommunications services for eligible high-cost (typically rural or insular) telecommunications carriers (High Cost Program) and economically needy individuals (Low Income Program); access for telecommunications services and broadband access for schools and libraries (Schools and Libraries Program); and access to telecommunications, advanced telecommunications, and information services for public and non-profit rural health care providers (Rural Health Care Program).

More specifically, the High Cost Program is to be phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is to be created to replace it; and the Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care programs are to be modified and given wider responsibilities.

This mechanism, which has always been the largest USF program based on disbursements, has been particularly important to rural America, where the lack of subscriber density leads to significantly higher costs. The goal of the USF Order is to restructure and transition the High Cost Program from one that primarily supports voice communications to one that supports a broadband platform that enables multiple applications, including voice.

Price cap incumbent local exchange carriers, which tend to be the large and mid-sized carriers, will transition to the CAF in two phases. Under Phase I, which commenced on January 1, 2012, legacy high-cost funding is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than $ 1.8 billion annually) for price cap carriers and is required to be used to achieve universal availability of both voice and broadband. Frozen high-cost support will equal the amount of support each carrier received in 2011 in a given study area (i.e., the defined geographic service area of an incumbent local exchange carrier's telephone operations). An additional $300 million in \"incremental support\" to stimulate broadband deployment in unserved areas is also established. This Phase I incremental support is available to those price-cap carriers that choose to deploy fixed broadband to areas not currently served, or targeted to be served, by a fixed broadband provider within their service territory. Access to Phase I incremental support is dependent on meeting specific criteria and build-out requirements, and is offered to jump-start the deployment of broadband to unserved areas within price-cap carrier service areas. Any price-cap carrier electing to receive Phase I incremental support will receive $775 in incremental support for each unserved location it provides broadband with actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps of actual upload speed. Once the funds are accepted, carriers must meet deployment schedules to no fewer than two-thirds of the required locations within two years and complete all deployments within three years. Of the $300 million made available for Phase I incremental support, only $115 million was taken with $185 million remaining unclaimed. A second round of Phase I support will be offered in 2013. The FCC, in May 2013, released a Report and Order detailing the rules for the second round of Phase I incremental support. Provisions call for a disbursement of $485 million ($300 million plus the unclaimed $185 million from the previous round of incremental support) and expands eligibility to cover areas that are underserved as well as unserved. Support for unserved areas remains at $775 per location and support for underserved areas is set at $550 per location. The FCC anticipates that this will be the last \"incremental support\" round before the transition to Phase II Price Cap annual support and any unused funds will be given to the Phase II Fund.", "Under CAF Phase II Price Cap annual funds (estimated at no more than $1.8 billion annually) will be distributed through an FCC-developed cost model and through competitive bidding (e.g., reverse auctions) for a period ending year-end 2017. CAF support will be available only in areas where a federal subsidy is needed to ensure the build-out and continued operation of broadband networks. By the end of the third year, carriers that accept support must offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1Mbps of upload speed. In addition, usage capacity must be reasonably comparable to urban residential terrestrial fixed broadband to at least 85% of their high-cost locations and to all supported locations by the end of the fifth year (2017). The incumbent carrier is given the right of first refusal, until the end-of- 2017, to receive the model-derived support, after which a shift to competitive bidding will be implemented. If an incumbent carrier declines Phase II funding the FCC will implement a competitive bidding process. CAF Phase II price cap is not expected to be implemented until sometime in 2014. ", "Rate-of-Return Carriers . Rate-of-return carriers, which tend to be smaller carriers that solely provide service in rural areas, will continue to receive support, with some modifications, from current support mechanisms pending full transition to the CAF (through 2017). During this transition, rate-of-return carriers' legacy high-cost support is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than $2 billion annually). Unlike in the case of price-cap carriers, no additional \"incremental support\" is provided specifically targeted for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Modifications are made to the operations of the High Cost Program, as they impact rate-of-return carriers, during this transition period to improve \"the efficiency and effectiveness\" of USF support. For example, the Order phases out support over three years in study areas that overlap completely with an unsubsidized fixed, terrestrial broadband/voice competitor, and gradually phases down over three years (commencing July 1, 2012) per-line support to a cap of $250/per month ($3,000 annually).

Under this program, which became effective January 1, 1998, eligible schools and libraries receive discounts ranging from 20% to 90% for eligible services depending on the poverty level of the school's (or school district's) population and its location in a high-cost telecommunications area (urban/rural status). Eligible schools, school districts, and libraries may apply on an individual or a consortium basis. The FCC established a yearly ceiling, or cap, of $2.25 billion, adjusted for inflation prospectively, beginning with funding year 2010, for this program. Since its inception this program has been over-subscribed, leaving requests by otherwise qualified applicants unfulfilled.", "Areas that do not have ready access to broadband are likely to depend on anchor institutions, such as schools and libraries, to meet growing broadband needs. The FCC has acknowledged the importance of anchor institutions in achieving broadband access goals, and has taken steps to upgrade the E-Rate Program by, among other actions, permitting schools to allow community use of E-Rate funded services outside of school hours; supporting eligible services to the residential portion of schools that serve students in special circumstances (e.g., schools on tribal lands); and committing $9 million to a pilot program, \"Learning On-The-Go,\" to support off-campus connectivity in 20 schools and libraries, for K-12 students and library patrons, for portable (wireless) learning devices outside of regular school or library hours.

Subsection 254(h)(1) further specifies that \"to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable,\" health care providers should have access to advanced telecommunications and information services. The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program to comply with these provisions. ", "Under FCC-established rules only public or non-profit health care providers are eligible to receive funding. Eligible health care providers, with the exception of those requesting only access to the Internet, must also be located in a rural area. Like the Schools and Libraries program, this support program went into effect on January 1, 1998, and a funding ceiling, or cap, was established, in this case at $400 million annually. The primary use of the funding is to provide reduced rates for telecommunications and information services (e.g., transmission of data, images, or interactive video) necessary for the provision of health care to either qualified individual health care providers or consortia. Health care providers can use funding to save on service they already have, to upgrade current services, or to install new services. Equipment charges are not eligible for support. The telecommunications program was established in 1997 to ensure that rural health care providers pay no more than their urban counterparts for their telecommunications needs when providing health care services. The Internet access program, which was established in 2003, provides a 50% discount on the cost of monthly Internet access in states that are entirely rural and a 25% discount for all other rural health care providers. Only the monthly charge for access is eligible for support. These two programs are collectively known as the \"Primary Program.\"", "The FCC, in 2007, established a \"Rural Health Care Pilot Program\" to help public and non-profit health care providers build state- and region-wide broadband networks dedicated to the provision of health care services. The Pilot Program funds up to 85% of the eligible costs of broadband infrastructure deployment of telehealth networks that connect rural and urban health care providers within a state or region. The Pilot is closed to new projects and participants will transition to the newly created Healthcare Connect Fund. ", "The Healthcare Connect Fund, which was created by the FCC in a December 12, 2012, order, was established to expand access to broadband, particularly in rural areas, for eligible public or not-for-profit health care providers. The Healthcare Connect Fund, will absorb the Internet Access Program (which is currently part of the Primary Program), and replace the Rural Health Care Pilot Program with a permanent program. The Healthcare Connect Fund will encourage consortia between smaller rural health care providers and urban medical centers, but consortia must remain majority rural. The Fund will provide a 65% discount on broadband services, equipment, and connections with health care providers required to contribute the balance (35%). Upfront payments for the Healthcare Connect Fund is $150 million annually. It is anticipated that the FCC will begin accepting applications in late summer 2013.", "The FCC also established, as part of the Healthcare Connect Fund, a Skilled Nursing Facilities Pilot Program to assess how to support broadband connections for skilled nursing facilities. The pilot, which is scheduled for a 2014 implementation, will give preference to facilities in rural areas and will receive funding of up to $50 million total over a three-year period.

The decision by the FCC to incorporate broadband and mobility mandates into the universal service concept, and the subsequent restructuring of the USF to accommodate this decision, will have a major impact on consumers and providers of telecommunications and broadband services. As the United States moves towards this transition, numerous policy issues and concerns have surfaced. Included among the issues confronting policy makers are how to define success; who should pay to support this mandate; how the nation should address the rural/rural divide; and how the nation should ensure that these changes do not negatively impact the financial health of, in particular, small, rural carriers that are significantly dependent on USF subsidies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Is Success Defined?", "paragraphs": ["The commitment made under USF reform to ensure universal availability of advanced broadband, at rates that are reasonably comparable in all regions of the nation, is a major undertaking. How policy makers determine if that goal has been successfully met, however, will depend, to a large part, on how success is defined. Most consider the universal service mandate to provide voice service to have been met, but the United States has never reached a 100% penetration rate. According to the FCC, as of July 2011 (the most recent published data available), the telephone subscribership penetration rate in the United States was 95.6%, and rates vary based on characteristics such as location, age, and income. For example, penetration rates among states ranged from a low of 91.4% to a high of 98.5%; households headed by a person under 25 years of age had a penetration rate of 93.8% compared with at least 95.9% for those headed by a person over 55; penetration rates for households in income categories below $20,000 were at, or below, 94.7%, while the rate in households in income categories over $75,000 was at least 98.9%. When it comes to broadband deployment, is anything under 100% an acceptable goal and, if so, what would the appropriate rate be? ", "Even if at some point in time broadband is made available in all areas of the country, the question of access versus adoption needs to be considered. According to the FCC's NBP, broadband is available in 95% of the nation but adoption rates are about 65%. This significant gap is explained by three factors: cost, digital literacy barriers, and a perceived lack of relevance. The USF Order has attempted to address this issue through reforms including those to the Low Income Program, but the details of how this will be addressed are yet to be fully resolved.", "Additional issues that policymakers may wish to monitor include those related to performance metrics such as speed, capacity, and latency. Although the USF Order provides requirements for such metrics, these needs will continue to evolve. Just as voice access standards evolved from, for example, party line to single line service, society's expectations with regard to broadband will also evolve. Policymakers will face the task of assessing what the standard for access will be in terms of performance metrics. What may be considered an acceptable level of service today may be considered inadequate for future needs.

Therefore, the USF receives no federal monies but is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers providing interstate service. These contributions are based on a percentage of the interstate and international telecommunications end-user revenues of telecommunications carriers and are called the contribution factor. This contribution factor has grown significantly since its inception from approximately 5.5% in 1998 to an all-time high of 17.9% in the first quarter of 2012; the factor for the first quarter of 2013 is 16.1 %. Increases in demand for, and expansion of services covered by, the USF, as well as technological change and decreases in the interstate and international revenue base, have all contributed to this upward trend. ", "The FCC's decision to include broadband and mobility in the universal service definition has further highlighted the need to address how the funding mechanism should be modified to support such a mandate. At issue is the uncertainty and costs associated with mandating nationwide deployment of broadband as a universal service policy goal, and the impact that such a mandate will have on an already strained funding mechanism. Some have expressed concern that given the pressures currently facing the USF, and their impact on the contribution factor, a restructuring of the funding mechanism should have been addressed prior to, or at least simultaneously with, the expansion of the USF definition. Questions regarding who should contribute, how the mechanism to assess such contributions should be designed, and whether the contribution base should be expanded, are among the issues to be considered. The FCC, on April 27, 2012, adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on comprehensive reforms to address the USF funding issue.

Some parts of rural America have sophisticated high-level broadband access while other parts have little to no broadband access. Disparity in access to broadband among rural areas is known as the \"rural-rural divide.\" Price-cap companies, which are largely classified as non-rural carriers, serve both urban and rural areas and in their rural service areas face issues, such as remoteness and lack of density resulting in high costs, more commonly associated with rural carriers. According to the FCC, more than 83% of the approximately 18 million Americans that lack access to residential fixed broadband at or above the FCC's broadband speed benchmark live in areas served by price-cap carriers. In other rural areas, often served by rate-of-return carriers, broadband is being deployed, often with the support of a combination of RUS loans and USF support. To address this disparity the FCC, in its USF Order, established a $300 million incremental support component in the Phase I CAF Fund for areas lacking broadband infrastructure, solely for the use of price-cap carriers. ", "Concern has been expressed that providing for a CAF Phase I Fund for broadband deployment, solely for the use of price-cap carriers, disadvantages rural areas lacking broadband infrastructure that are served by the smaller, rural rate-of-return carriers. Some question why access to such funding should be limited to price-cap carriers when other areas of the nation are facing the same, or even more challenging, conditions to bring broadband to areas lacking access. If the ultimate goal is to bring broadband to all unserved areas, they ask, why should this funding be based on carrier classification rather than need? They also point to the fact that $185 million of the $300 million total for 2012 went unclaimed to further support their position that this support should be opened to all providers.

Many RUS telecommunications and broadband borrowers (loan recipients) receive high cost USF subsidies. In many cases, the subsidy received from USF helps provide the revenue necessary to keep the loan viable. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program is highly dependent on high-cost USF revenues, with 99% (476 out of 480 borrowers) receiving interstate high-cost USF support. This is not surprising, given that the RUS Telecommunications Loans are available only to the most rural and high-cost areas (towns with populations less than 5,000). Regarding broadband loans, 60% of BIP (stimulus) borrowers draw from state or interstate USF support mechanisms, while 10% of farm bill (Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program) broadband borrowers receive interstate high-cost USF support. Thus, to the extent that USF may be reformed, this could have an impact on the viability of RUS telecommunications and broadband loans, and ultimately the overall financial health of the carrier.", "Although the FCC included a waiver process in its USF Order for those carriers that felt they would be subject to significant economic stress, due to the reforms, many smaller carriers assert that the waiver process is too burdensome and difficult and that the requirements for qualifying for relief are too restrictive."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "RUS and USF: Different Approaches, Shared Goals", "paragraphs": ["The RUS broadband programs and the FCC's Universal Service Fund (USF) share a common goal: increasing broadband infrastructure deployment and applications in rural areas. However, the way that each program addresses these goals is markedly different. ", "RUS grants and loans are used as up-front capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, whereas the USF provides ongoing subsidies to keep the operation of telecommunications\u2014and most recently broadband networks in high-cost areas\u2014economically viable for providers. These subsidies, in turn, enable providers to invest in upgrading their telephone networks to make them broadband-capable. Aside from the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) program, RUS telecommunications programs address broadband infrastructure deployment, which is intended to increase the availability of broadband in rural America. The USF, while also addressing broadband availability (through the High Cost Program and the Connect America Fund), also addresses end-user broadband adoption through the Low Income Program. Regarding the health and education applications, the principal difference between RUS programs (Distance Learning and Telemedicine) and the USF programs (Schools and Libraries Program, Rural Health Care Program) is that RUS funds end-user equipment, while USF funds connectivity. DLT grants serve as initial capital assets for equipment, instructional programming, technical assistance, or instruction for using eligible equipment (e.g., video conferencing equipment, computers) that operate via telecommunications to rural end-users of telemedicine and distance learning. DLT does not fund the telecommunications that connects that equipment. By contrast, the USF Schools and Libraries Program supports the conduit or pipeline for communications using telecommunications services and/or the Internet, and includes four categories of service: telecommunications services, Internet access, internal connections, and basic maintenance of internal connections. Similarly, the Rural Health Care Program provides discounts for rural non-profit health care providers by providing connectivity. Finally, the RUS programs are funded through annual appropriations and are subject to the annual congressional budget process. By contrast, USF is not funded through annual appropriations, but is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers that provide interstate service.

With the September 30, 2010, conclusion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ) broadband grant and loan awards, the RUS broadband programs and the USF programs remain the only ongoing federal vehicles to provide financial assistance for rural broadband deployment. ", "With both programs currently at a pivotal point, an issue for the 113 th Congress is how best to shape those programs as they go forward. The statute authorizing the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee\u2014Section 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936\u2014was significantly modified in the 2008 farm bill, and is being addressed once more in the 2013 farm bill. Typically a new farm bill is developed every five years, principally by the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate both have a major role to play as well, as each considers annual appropriations for the RUS broadband programs through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. ", "Meanwhile, the USF is undergoing a major and unprecedented transition through a series of reforms being implemented by the FCC. Congress has largely adopted an oversight role and a \"wait and see\" posture with respect to the FCC's USF reforms. While numerous Members have written letters to the FCC urging various modifications in the reform package, there was no comprehensive legislation introduced into the 112 th Congress that addressed the FCC's USF reforms. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the House Committee on Natural Resources continue to assess the impact of the reforms, and the FCC's progress in their implementation. To the extent that various constituencies and interest groups (whether it be small rate-of-return carriers, large price-cap carriers, competitive providers, state utility regulators, or broadband providers and consumers) feel they are disadvantaged by the reforms, and to the extent that programmatic inefficiencies or waste, fraud, and abuse come to light (as they have in the past through GAO reports, for example), Congress always has the prerogative in the future of formulating and considering legislation that could modify those reforms by amending the 1934 Communications Act.", "Given that the RUS and USF broadband programs share the goal of deploying broadband to rural America, Congress may also wish to assess how these two programs can best fit together. Are they effectively targeted towards providing broadband to the most unserved areas of the nation, while at the same time minimizing adverse impacts on private incumbent providers? Are they the most cost-effective way for Congress to fund rural broadband development? To what extent are the two programs complementary and to what extent do the two programs overlap? And finally, how will changes made to the USF program affect the viability of broadband loans made under the RUS programs? "], "subsections": []}]}}
