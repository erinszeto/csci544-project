CHIP is jointly financed by the federal government and the states and is administered by the states. Participation in CHIP is voluntary, and all states, the District of Columbia, and the territories participate. The federal government sets basic requirements for CHIP, but states have the flexibility to design their own version of CHIP within the federal government's basic framework. As a result, there is significant variation across CHIP programs. ", "States may design their CHIP programs in one of three ways: a CHIP Medicaid expansion, a separate CHIP program, or a combination approach in which the state operates a CHIP Medicaid expansion and one or more separate CHIP programs concurrently. CHIP benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules depend on program design. CHIP Medicaid expansions must follow the federal Medicaid rules for benefits and cost sharing. For separate CHIP programs, the benefits are permitted to look more like private health insurance, and states may impose cost sharing, such as premiums or enrollment fees, with a maximum allowable amount that is tied to annual family income. ", "Federal appropriations for CHIP are provided in statute. In recent years, the appropriations had been provided a couple years at a time. For instance, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended) provided appropriations for FY2014 and FY2015, and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10 ) added appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017.

The FMAP formula compares each state's average per capita income with average U.S. per capita income. The formula provides higher reimbursement to states with lower incomes (with a statutory maximum of 83%) and lower reimbursement to states with higher incomes (with a statutory minimum of 50%). ", "The E-FMAP rate is calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. Statutorily, the E-FMAP (or federal matching rate) can range from 65% to 85%. For some CHIP expenditures, the federal matching rate is different from the E-FMAP rate. For instance, the matching rate for translation and interpretation services is the higher of 75% or states' E-FMAP rate plus 5 percentage points. Also, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA; P.L. 111-3 ) included a provision that reduced the matching rate to the regular FMAP rate for children with family incomes exceeding 300% of the federal poverty level (FPL) with an exception for certain states.", "The ACA included a provision to increase the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points (not to exceed 100%) for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 through FY2019.

In FY2018, 13 states have E-FMAP rates of 100%. Figure 1 shows the state distribution of E-FMAP rates for FY2018, with the 23 percentage point increase.
