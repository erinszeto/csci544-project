{"id": "RL33836", "title": "Campaign Finance Legislation and Activity in the 109th Congress", "released_date": "2007-01-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["During the 109th Congress, 51 bills were introduced to change the nation's campaign finance laws (primarily under Titles 2 and 26 of the U.S. Code). These bills\u201443 in the House and 8 in the Senate\u2014sought to change the current system, including tightening perceived loopholes. Two of those bills passed the House, but no bill passed both chambers. Therefore, no statutory changes occurred in federal campaign finance law during the 109th Congress.", "Although the 109th Congress chose not to enact campaign finance legislation, Congress nonetheless considered dozens of bills addressing a wide variety of topics. In summarizing that legislation, this report identifies 14 major topics (categories) addressed in the bills. These categories are diverse, ranging from changing individual contribution limits to regulating independent expenditures. Although some bills called for increased regulation, others proposed less regulation. Hence, legislative activity during the 109th Congress reflected a long-standing debate in campaign finance policy over extending regulation of campaign finance practices versus limiting the reach of such regulation.", "The most prominent legislation introduced during the 109th Congress\u2014and that which advanced farthest through the legislative process\u2014focused on political organizations operating under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, but outside federal election law. Sponsors of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) offered bills to require that \"527s\" (as these organizations are popularly known) involved in federal elections comply fully with federal election law. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee reported such a measure\u2014S. 1053\u2014in May 2005, but no further action occurred in the Senate. The House Administration Committee reported two 527 bills with starkly different approaches: H.R. 513\u2014the 527 Reform Act of 2005, the counterpart to S. 1053\u2014and H.R. 1316, which sought to address the 527 issue indirectly by loosening restrictions on funding sources permitted under federal campaign finance law. In April 2006, the House passed H.R. 513, as amended, but the Senate took no action on the bill.", "Legislation proposing 527 reform later became a component of the 109th Congress debate over lobbying reform. The text of H.R. 513 was eventually incorporated into the House Republican leadership's lobbying and ethics reform bill\u2014H.R. 4975, which passed the House in May 2006. The Senate-passed lobbying bill did not contain the 527 provisions. Disagreement between the two chambers on the 527 issue reportedly contributed to neither lobbying reform nor 527 regulation legislation being enacted during the 109th Congress.", "This report will not be updated, because it reflects the complete record of 109th Congress proposals and activity in this area.

The role of 527 organizations in federal elections was the principal campaign finance issue examined by the 109 th Congress.", "On March 8, 2005, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee held a hearing on S. 271 (McCain-Feingold-Lott), the 527 Reform Act of 2005, to require that 527s involved in federal elections comply fully with federal election law. On April 27, 2005, it voted to report the bill, as amended in committee. Committee amendments largely added provisions to deregulate other aspects of FECA. On May 17, the bill was reported as an original bill\u2014 S. 1053 \u2014and placed on the Senate's legislative calendar. The Senate took no further action on the measure.", "The House Administration Committee held a hearing April 20, 2005, on regulation of 527 organizations. It focused on two measures: H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), the 527 Reform Act of 2005 (the companion to S. 271 , later S. 1053 ); and H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn). In sharp contrast with the Shays-Meehan bill and the one reported in the Senate, H.R. 1316 sought to address the 527 issue indirectly, by loosening restrictions on funding sources within FECA. By so doing, proponents maintained that because more money could be directed to regulated sources, there would be fewer incentives for political money to flow to 527 groups operating outside the FECA framework. On June 9, 2005, House Administration voted to report H.R. 1316 favorably, as amended, and it was reported on June 22. On June 29, 2005, the committee held a markup of H.R. 513 and ordered it reported (as amended to reflect the sponsors' changes), without recommendation. This set the stage for a potential floor debate on the two contrasting measures ( H.R. 513 and H.R. 1316 ).", "Almost a year later, on April 5, 2006, the House passed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), as amended, by a 218-209 vote. The rule for its consideration\u2014 H.Res. 755 \u2014allowed one floor amendment, by Representative Dreier, to remove political party-coordinated expenditure limits in 2 U.S.C. 441a(d); this issue is discussed below. The amendment was added by voice vote before final passage.", "The text of H.R. 513 was also incorporated into the House Republican leadership's lobbying and ethics reform bill\u2014 H.R. 4975 (Dreier). As introduced, Title VI of the bill incorporated the language of H.R. 513 as reported by the House Administration Committee. In addition, it included the same provision as was included in the House-passed version of H.R. 513 , to remove the political party-coordinated expenditure limits.", "Prior to House passage of H.R. 4975 , another amendment unrelated to 527s was included in the bill by the House Rules Committee, to allow leadership PACs' funds to be transferred without limitation to national party committees (as is the case with funds in candidates' principal campaign committees). On May 3, 2006, the House passed (by a vote of 217-213) H.R. 4975 , the Lobbying Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which included the text of H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), as well as the amendments on leadership PACs and party coordinated expenditures. After passing H.R. 4975 , the House substituted it for the text of S. 2349 , the Senate-passed version of the bill, to enable a conference with the Senate. The Senate-passed bill did not contain the 527 provisions, and disagreement between the two chambers on the 527 issue\u00a0reportedly contributed to the 109 th Congress enacting neither lobby reform nor 527 regulation legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Party Coordinated Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["\"Party coordinated expenditures\" refer to expenditures made by a political party in coordination with a candidate's campaign. They have been subject to limits since the 1974 FECA Amendments, codified in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7441a(d). The limits are relatively high compared with the $5,000 limit on contributions most party committees may give directly to candidate campaigns. In 2006, for example, parties could make up to $79,200 in coordinated expenditures in support of House candidates (in multi-district states). Limits for Senate candidates vary by state, ranging in 2006 from $158,400 in states with the smallest populations, to almost $4.2 million in California.", "Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (518 U.S. 604 (1996)), which permitted parties to make independent expenditures on behalf of their candidates, the importance of coordinated expenditures has been diminished. The prospect of unlimited independent expenditures has been increasingly appealing to the parties, and it has become common for parties to make both independent expenditures and coordinated expenditures for the same candidates, albeit from at least nominally different departments of a party committee. In 2004, Democratic party committees (federal, state, and local) made $33.1 million in coordinated expenditures and $176.5 million in independent expenditures to promote their federal candidates. By contrast, Republican party committees made $29.1 million in coordinated expenditures and $88.0 million in independent expenditures. As of this writing, data for the complete 2006 cycle were not yet available.", "As enacted, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) contained a provision to require a party to choose between making either independent expenditures or coordinated expenditures, but not both, for one of its nominees. This, however, was one of two BCRA provisions struck down by the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC (549 U.S. 93(2003)). Hence, although abolishing the limit on coordinated expenditures would appear to allow the parties to spend unlimited amounts on behalf of their candidates, through independent expenditures they already have that right, albeit through expenditures that are technically made without any coordination with the favored candidate. Supporters of removing the limits on coordinated expenditures assert that doing so would largely signal acceptance of campaign reality and allow parties to reinforce their direct ties with candidates. Opponents counter that abolishing coordinated expenditure limits would send the wrong message to an electorate cynical about the role of money in politics, and that the national parties are now playing a significant role, especially in light of increased hard money limits under BCRA. Party committees raised almost $1.5 billion in the 2004 election cycle (all hard money), more than ever had been raised in combined hard and soft money by the national parties.

Internet communications were addressed at a House Administration Committee hearing September 22, 2005. On November 2, 2005, the House failed to pass a measure to exempt Internet communications from regulation under federal campaign finance laws; H.R. 1606 (Hensarling) was brought up under suspension of the rules but failed on a 225-182 vote. On March 9, 2006, the House Administration Committee ordered the bill favorably reported, and it was expected to be considered by the House on March 16, but that vote was postponed.

Prior to BCRA's enactment, some observers became concerned about communications that promoted political issues in reference to candidates, but which, by avoiding specific election advocacy language (e.g., \"elect Jones\" or \"defeat Smith\"), were not subject to regulation under federal election law. These \"issue advocacy\" communications contrasted with those that explicitly promoted the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates\u2014a class of communications known as \"express advocacy.\" Since the courts had generally construed \"express advocacy\" communications in a narrow sense (i.e., using explicit phrases advocating election or defeat), communications that may have been perceived as constituting thinly veiled election activity could thus avoid federal disclosure and source regulations.", "BCRA addressed issue advocacy by creating a new term in federal election law, \"electioneering communication\"\u2014political advertisements that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate and are broadcast within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The act prohibited unions and certain corporations from spending treasury funds for electioneering communications and required disclosure of disbursements of more than $10,000 and the identity of donors of $1,000 or more.", "In part because of BCRA's narrowly tailored response to issue advocacy, concerns remain.
