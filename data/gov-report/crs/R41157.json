After a decade's experience with the budget resolution process, Congress and the President enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) of 1985 (Title II of P.L. 99-177 ), in large part to establish the goal of achieving a balanced budget in the near term and to bolster budget enforcement. The central feature of the 1985 act, in Part C, was a series of declining deficit targets, expected to lead to a balanced budget by FY1991. The deficit targets were enforced by sequestration, a process involving largely across-the-board spending cuts triggered automatically if a deficit target was not met.", "Congress and the President were not successful in meeting the deficit targets and, after five years, they established a \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) process and limits on discretionary spending under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Title XIII of P.L. 101-508 ). These changes took the form of amendments to Part C of BBEDCA of 1985. ", "The two new mechanisms effectively superseded the deficit targets, but sequestration was retained as the means of enforcing them. The statutory PAYGO process applied to direct spending and revenue legislation, while the discretionary spending limits applied to annual appropriations acts. Direct spending, also referred to as mandatory spending, is provided for the most part in substantive laws under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate legislative committees. Direct spending principally funds entitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, federal employee retirement, and unemployment compensation, but it also funds programs of a mandatory nature that are not entitlements. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Discretionary spending for the most part funds the routine operations of federal departments and agencies. In some instances, such as for Medicaid, a direct spending program lacks its own funding mechanism and relies on funding provided in an annual appropriations act (but funding for such \"appropriated entitlements\" is not regarded as discretionary spending).", "The statutory PAYGO process and discretionary spending limits were extended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ) and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (Title X of P.L. 105-33 ); in all, they operated from calendar years 1991 through late 2002. The discretionary spending limits expired on September 30, 2002, and the statutory PAYGO process effectively was terminated on December 2, 2002, with the enactment of P.L. 107-312 , which fixed the balances for the remaining years on the PAYGO scorecard (FY2003-FY2006) at zero. The remaining provisions of Part C of BBEDCA of 1985 expired on September 30, 2006; Part C was not repealed, however, so it has remained in the U.S. Code for several years as obsolete law.", "Beginning in 2003, proposals were made from time to time to restore the statutory PAYGO process, but disagreements centered on whether it should apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation (as originally framed and generally favored by Democrats) or only to direct spending legislation (as generally favored by Republicans).", "In the 108 th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted draft legislation to Congress, the Spending Control Act of 2004, that would have restored the PAYGO process for direct spending legislation but not for revenue legislation; in addition, the proposal would have restored the discretionary spending limits. The House Budget Committee reported a bill, H.R. 3973 ( H.Rept. 108-442 ; March 19, 2004), reflecting the President's proposal; a comparable measure, H.R. 4663 , was considered in the House on June 25, 2004, but failed to pass, by a vote of 146-268.", "In the 110 th Congress, interest was renewed in restoring a comprehensive PAYGO requirement.

In some instances, other House and Senate committees have jurisdiction over legislation affecting fines, certain user fees, or other transactions that are treated as revenues, but such legislation usually affects a very small portion of total revenues.", "Many legislative committees in the House and Senate exercise jurisdiction over direct spending legislation. Most direct spending involves entitlement programs that are funded automatically by means of permanent appropriations in substantive law; legislative action may occur to modify such programs, notwithstanding their permanent funding status. In other instances, direct spending is provided through legislative action that occurs on a regular cycle, such as for the periodic farm bill or highway bill, or on an irregular basis, such as for extensions of unemployment compensation during economic downturns.", "Hybrid measures may fall within the jurisdiction of a single committee in a chamber (generally the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees), such as in the case of measures affecting Medicare revenues and spending, or fall within the jurisdiction of two or more committees, such as in the case of measures affecting the revenues and spending of transportation trust funds.", "Finally, annual appropriations acts, including regular, supplemental, and continuing appropriations measures, provide discretionary spending and are under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Discretionary spending is not subject to the statutory PAYGO process, but is controlled by other budget enforcement procedures. Some annual appropriations acts, however, may serve as a vehicle for revenue or direct spending provisions under the jurisdiction of other House and Senate Committees. Section 3(4)(C) of the act provides that provisions in annual appropriations acts that \"make outyear modifications to substantive law\" (except those in which the outlay effects net to zero over a six-year period, including the current year) are covered under the statutory PAYGO process.

At present, the off-budget entities are the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund under Social Security, and the Postal Service Fund. These programs also are accorded off-budget status in the congressional budget process and in the President's budget.", "Second, the direct spending and revenue impacts of provisions in legislation that are designated as emergency requirements under the act are not counted as budgetary effects (Section 4(g)(4)).

The difference between these two estimated costs is the maximum adjustment that may be used to offset the cost of legislation addressing each specified policy for the purposes of PAYGO enforcement. If the estimate of the legislation has a greater budgetary effect than the maximum amount of the adjustment, then the adjustment can be used to offset a portion of its cost. The additional cost would be counted for statutory PAYGO purposes. If a less costly policy is enacted, any remaining amount in the adjustment cannot be used to offset the cost of policies in other areas (as specified in Section 4(c)(3) of the PAYGO statute).", "In addition, the adjustments in each policy area are further limited to prevent using the full amount of the available adjustment to offset the cost of a more generous policy for a shorter period.

Violations of the prescribed procedures (e.g., deviating from the required text of a legislative reference or failing to insert a statement into the Congressional Record before a vote on final passage) could invalidate the congressional determination of a measure's budget effects, and the effects would be determined in that case by OMB.
