Coal mineral classification considers type, rank, and grade. The plant life that coal originated from determines its type, and the degree of metamorphosis determines its rank, grade, and the amount of inorganic mineral matter present. Qualities such as moisture, carbon, sulfur, and ash content contribute to a coal's heating value as a fuel (measured in British thermal units [Btus]). ", "The content of sulfur is significant because of the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions that occur during coal combustion. Under the Clean Air Act, there are federal limits on the amount of SO 2 , among other pollutants, allowed from coal-fired power plants. Western coal (low sulfur and low energy content) primarily produced in the Powder River Basin (PRB) of Wyoming, is used generally for power generation, while eastern coal has been used domestically for power generation and exported for coking and metallurgical purposes.

Long steel bolts properly spaced and driven into the roof are required. In continuous mining, the cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading are performed by a mechanical excavator known as a continuous miner. The continuous miner cuts and loads the coal. Together, room and pillar and continuous techniques account for 50% (conventional, room and pillar\u20142%; continuous\u201448%) of underground mining. ", "The most efficient technique in underground mining is the longwall method, which employs a large machine with a rotating drum that moves back and forth across a wide coal seam.

In other words, while coal extraction is taking place, as required by federal law, the reclamation work occurs in an adjacent area previously mined. Mountaintop removal mining is a form of strip mining. Mountaintop removal mining generally removes a coal seam from one side of a mountain to the other.

Once cleaned and separated, if necessary, the coal is stockpiled and shipped to the customer by rail, barge, truck, or conveyor. It usually takes more than one mode of transport for coal to reach its final destination. Utilities burn pulverized coal to produce high-pressure steam that powers an electric generator.

Reserves are known quantities that can be produced given current prices and technology. Resource assessments are complex and rely on bed thickness as a major factor in determining recoverability, with direct correlation between bed thickness, depth, and recoverability. Coal rank (degree of metamorphism) and coal quality (heating value) contained in a unit of coal are factors as well.

Resources, however, can become reserves. Reserve data is temporary and subject to change based on public policy, coal versus natural gas prices, production rates, transportation issues, exports, technology, and other conditions. Reserves are only an estimate of what might be recovered. Reserves must be developed from a better defined resource base according to the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research report. A maturity index is used to measure the ratio of the amount of remaining economically recoverable resources to the previously mined tonnages. The Interior and Appalachian regions have less than a 0 index meaning their recoverable reserves are less than the amount already mined. Those areas are far more developed than the western regions. The remaining eastern resources may be thinner and of lower quality overall, which may lead to more mining underground than before because much of the surface resources have already been mined.", "The United States has the largest amount of coal reserves and resources in the world.

", "Despite the regulatory concerns, U.S. coal production was robust over the last decade, reaching an all-time production high (in tonnage) in 2008, before a slight decline following the great recession. U.S. coal production is forecast to rise at a rate (<1%) slightly above projected U.S. demand through 2040, according to the EIA. In 2011, coal fell below natural gas as the leading source of primary energy production in the United States and will unlikely reclaim the top spot that it held for nearly the past three decades. ", "If trends continue, the U.S. coal industry will likely become more concentrated and produce more on federal lands. This may raise the issue that lease sales could become no more competitive in the future than they are today and possibly even less competitive. But since fair market value returns to the government consider all of the revenue streams, not just bonus bids at the lease sale, it will become increasingly important for the federal government to capture the correct valuation of federal coal (price x volume) and assign the appropriate royalty rate. Most of the federal coal (94%) in the PRB is accessible or possibly accessible (pending land use plans or surface owner consent), but 70% of the resource base has not been screened for leasing because of low interest and higher costs. This lack of interest could place a limit on just how much federal coal actually gets developed. ", "Overall, U.S. coal production has been very strong over the past decade and if the industry is successful in penetrating the global market, primarily for steam coal, U.S. production may continue to grow faster than consumption. Although U.S. metallurgical coal will likely continue to be in demand on the world market, higher than predicted steam coal exports could further widen the gap between U.S. coal production and consumption.
