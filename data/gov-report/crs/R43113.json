Continuing obstacles to faster and more balanced development and greater foreign investment include poor education and public health, low government capacity, weak legal and financial institutions, inadequate infrastructure, and official corruption. ", "The United States is the largest overseas market for Cambodian goods, accounting for about half of the Kingdom's garment exports. There are about 600 clothing factories that employ approximately 400,000 workers in the Kingdom. Bilateral trade fell by 20% between 2007 and 2009, but has since rebounded. In 2011, U.S.-Cambodian trade surpassed the levels of before the global recession. In 2012, bilateral trade was worth $2.9 billion, including $2.7 billion in U.S. imports of Cambodian goods, mostly apparel, and $226 million in U.S. exports to the Kingdom. The largest U.S. export item was vehicles.", "In 1996, Cambodia and the United States signed a bilateral trade agreement (BTA), which provided for reciprocal \"normal trade relations\" tariff treatment. In July 2006, Cambodia signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the United States. Cambodia acceded to the WTO in October 2004. As a member of ASEAN since 1999, the Kingdom is committed to participating in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 2015. Cambodia is also a party to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade area including the 10 nations of ASEAN and 6 other Asia-Pacific countries, which is under negotiation.", "Principal foreign investors in Cambodia include China, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam. According to one report, China has become Cambodia's largest investor with approximately $9 billion in cumulative investment ($1.19 billion in 2011). U.S. cumulative investment reportedly totals $1.3 billion. The United States invested $144 million in the country in 2011, triple the amount of 2010. ", "Tourism accounts for 350,000 Cambodian jobs and 12% of gross domestic product, according to the Tourism Minister. Cambodians hope that offshore oil production will eventually provide a boon to government revenues and the economy. A number of multinational and national companies, including Chevron, are working in the Gulf of Thailand to develop oil reserves, estimated at 500 million barrels. However, the estimated start date of oil production has been delayed from 2013 to 2017. ", "In addition to low labor costs, many Cambodian garment factories have developed a reputation for good labor practices, largely because of a U.S.-Cambodia agreement, enacted in 1999, that rewarded progress in labor conditions with increased access to the U.S. market. As part of the agreement, in 2001, the International Labor Organization (ILO) was brought in to monitor and promote good labor practices in the Kingdom. It continues to do so under the program Better Factories Cambodia with funding from the Royal Government of Cambodia, the Garment Manufacturers' Association in Cambodia, the U.S. Department of Labor, the World Bank, the Australian Agency for International Development, and international buyers.", "Labor relations have shown some signs of strain in recent years. Cambodian workers are free to form their own unions and have the right to strike, although a majority of unions are affiliated with the CPP, and independent labor leaders and strike organizers sometimes have been harassed by employers. In February 2013, an estimated 20,000 workers across a number of foreign-owned textile factories in an industrial area in southeastern Cambodia went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. Other strikes also occurred in other regions throughout the year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Chinese Investments", "paragraphs": ["Although some Cambodians have expressed appreciation of China's role in their country's development, others have complained of its adverse social, environmental, and other effects. According to some estimates, China has become Cambodia's largest investor, concentrated in such areas as garments, agriculture, and mining. Although the United States is Cambodia's largest export market for apparel, China leads in foreign investment in the sector. Chinese companies are also helping to develop Cambodia's infrastructure and basic industry, reportedly building a rail line, sea port, and steel plant worth $11 billion. Other projects include road construction, hydropower, and irrigation. In December 2012, Cambodian and Chinese oil companies announced plans to build the Kingdom's first oil refinery in Kampot province, to be completed in 2013.", "Domestic demand for energy and Chinese investment have fueled dam construction in Cambodia and other countries along the lower Mekong and other rivers, alarming environmentalists and people who rely upon the waterways for their livelihood. Three Chinese-backed dams have been built in the Kingdom, three are under construction, and more reportedly are planned. These hydropower projects are largely financed and constructed by Chinese banks, companies, and workers, often on terms that are unfavorable to Cambodia, according to critics. Ownership of most Chinese dams is based upon a \"build-operate-transfer\" arrangement. During a period of Chinese operation, which may last from 30 to 45 years, Cambodia pays the Chinese company for power generated by the dam. ", "Some experts contend that such dams endanger or disrupt fish supplies, soil conditions, drinking and irrigation water, wildlife and aquatic species, and ecological balances. They add that there is very little transparency or public input regarding the conception, construction, and environmental assessments associated with these projects. Similar dams built in Laos and Vietnam reportedly also have had damaging effects on Cambodia, which lies downstream. Proponents of the dams argue that China is filling a void made by the withdrawal of the World Bank and other developed countries from hydropower projects in the region for reasons related to feasibility and environmental, social, and political costs. They argue that these facilities supply energy for development, reduce reliance on oil, and help expand electricity in rural areas.", "Cambodian economic development and foreign (particularly Chinese) demand for hardwood threaten to deplete Cambodia's forests and have spurred illegal logging. Stronger environmental policies in some neighboring countries, such as Thailand, have added pressure on the Cambodian timber market. In 2012, a Cambodian environmental activist and an investigative journalist who had exposed illegal logging were killed under suspicious circumstances in separate incidents. Another reporter who had uncovered timber smuggling involving a well-connected local businessman was arrested. In May 2012, the Cambodian government suspended the granting of land to domestic and foreign companies in a move to curb forced evictions and illegal logging."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
