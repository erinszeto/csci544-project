The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 501) would impose a federal excise tax of 50% on the producer and importer price of marijuana. The National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy Act of 2013 (H.R. 1635) proposes establishing a National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy that would review the potential revenue generated by taxing marijuana, among other things.", "This report focuses solely on issues surrounding a potential federal marijuana tax. First, it provides a brief overview of marijuana production. Second, it presents possible justifications for taxes and, in some cases, estimates the level of tax suggested by that rationale. Third, it analyzes possible marijuana tax designs. The report also discusses various tax administration and enforcement issues, such as labeling and tracking.", "Economic theory suggests the efficient level of taxation is equal to marijuana's external cost to society. Studies conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada suggest that the costs of individual marijuana consumption to society are between 12% and 28% of the costs of an individual alcohol user, and total social costs are even lower after accounting for the smaller number of marijuana users in society. Based on an economic estimate of $30 billion of net external costs for alcohol, the result is an external cost of $0.5 billion to $1.6 billion annually for marijuana. These calculations imply that an upper limit to the economically efficient tax rate could be $0.30 per marijuana cigarette (containing an average of one half of a gram of marijuana) or $16.80 per ounce. An increased number of users in a legal market would raise total costs, but not necessarily costs per unit.", "Some could also view excise taxes as a means to curtail demand, particularly as the price of marijuana can be expected to drop from current retail prices of up $200-$300 per ounce to prices closer to the cost of production at $5-$18 per ounce, if broadly legalized. The demand for marijuana is estimated to be relatively price inelastic, meaning that consumer demand is relatively insensitive to price changes. Although previous studies of marijuana demand largely examine consumers willing to engage in illegal activities, it appears that higher tax rates would have a minor effect on reducing demand. With this said, tax policy, coupled with adequate law enforcement, could be an effective tool to limit marijuana consumption among youth, as empirical studies indicate that their demand is more sensitive to price than non-youth.", "Excise taxes on marijuana could also be levied primarily to raise revenue, as has been historically the case with tobacco and alcohol. As an illustration, assuming a total market size of $40 billion, a federal tax of $50 per ounce is estimated to raise about $6.8 billion annually, after accounting for behavioral effects associated with price decreases following legalization.", "The choices in administrative design could affect consumer behavior, production methods, evasion rates, or the tax base of a federal marijuana excise tax.

In addition, in November 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize, regulate, and tax small amounts of marijuana for non-medicinal use (so-called recreational) by individuals 21 and older. Commercial sales of recreational marijuana became legal in the state of Colorado beginning on January 1, 2014\u2014the first jurisdiction in the world to do so.

Another bill proposes the establishment of a National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy that would review the potential revenue generated by taxing marijuana, among other things. Overall, the debate concerning marijuana legalization is complex, as it spans across issues ranging from criminal justice to public health and safety. The revenue-raising potential of a marijuana tax could become a contributing factor in the desirability of legalizing marijuana.", "This report focuses solely on one aspect of the economic debate over federal marijuana legalization: imposing an excise tax on legalized marijuana.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Brief Overview of Marijuana Production", "paragraphs": ["Marijuana is a preparation of the plant, C annabis sativa , generally used as a recreational drug or medicine primarily for its psychoactive and physiological effects. The term marijuana refers to the dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant. The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the primary cannabinoid responsible for the \"high\" that users experience when consuming the drug. Still, THC is only one of many \"cannabinoid\" chemical compounds in marijuana that contribute to the effects of the psychoactive effects of marijuana (in terms of strength, onset, duration, etc.). Consumers could desire different strains of marijuana for the contents of other cannabinoids that do not produce a psychoactive effect. For example, marijuana strains high in cannabidiol (CBD) are often sought to provide relief from anxiety.", "Depending on its preparation, the potency, or relative concentration, of a particular product derived from marijuana can vary. The stalks and stems of a marijuana plant have almost no psychoactive content, whereas the leaves and flowers (buds) of the plant have increasing concentrations of THC. The hair-like trichomes on the buds are coated with a translucent resin that contains the highest concentration of THC on the plant. Marijuana plants are also either male or female. If female plants are grown in controlled environments, separate from pollination of male plants, then the female plants are capable of growing buds that produce more resin. This process is used to grow sinsemilla (Spanish for without seed) varieties of marijuana, which typically contain 10%-18% THC content (about three times the level of conventional, commercial-grade marijuana derived from pollinated plants). ", "Marijuana consumption methods vary. Marijuana is generally consumed by smoking the dried plant matter. A \"joint\" is made by rolling marijuana in cigarette paper whereas a \"blunt\" is made by hollowing some or all of the tobacco from a cigar and replacing it with marijuana. Although smoking habits vary by user, a typical joint contains less than half a gram of marijuana, and each \"hit\" or drag on the joint contains approximately one-twentieth of a gram of marijuana. Numerous other devices for consuming marijuana exist, ranging from glass pipes to vaporizers (which heat the chemicals in marijuana, but avoid creating the smoke irritants associated with combustion).", "Cannabis can also be processed into a number of different products, all with their own THC concentration levels and typical methods of consumption. For example, hashish or \"hash\" is made by pressing trichomes together into a brick-shaped product with more than 40% THC content. THC is also capable of being dissolved in fats, oils, and alcohol for use in the creation of \"edibles,\" such as candy or baked goods. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why a Federal Excise Tax on Marijuana?", "paragraphs": ["Economic analysis as a general rule suggests that excise taxes are less desirable than more general taxes (such as income or broad based sales taxes) because they distort prices of different commodities. This section discusses several possible reasons for imposing an excise tax on marijuana: (1) reflect external, or spillover, costs to society; (2) discourage use, particularly for youth; (3) prevent too rapid a fall in price; (4) fund related programs; and (5) raise revenue."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Taxes to Reflect External Costs", "paragraphs": ["Economic efficiency occurs when the price of a commodity (at the margin) equals its costs. If consumption of marijuana imposes costs on others, then the consumer cost is too small and economic efficiency could be achieved by imposing a tax equal to consumption cost. This rationale has often been used for similar commodities, such as alcohol and tobacco. ", "In considering this justification and the level of tax economic analysis suggests, the external costs should be separate from the costs the user bears. For example, if a substance causes early death, the value of the lost years of life and the individual's own costs in treating illness falls on the individual. Society bears the loss of tax revenue from those lost earnings and some of the costs of treating illness that fall on private or social health insurance. However, society also receives gains from the early death in the amount of smaller health costs and transfer payments (such as Social Security) in the future. These future costs should be discounted. At least in studies of other substances, these external costs are typically much smaller than the total costs. A 1991 study by Manning et al. used this method to estimate the external costs of alcohol and tobacco. Adjusting these estimates for price changes, those results imply a cost of $30 billion for alcohol, which will be used to estimate the cost for marijuana, for which no study of this nature exists. As with the case of tobacco, these external costs are typically much smaller than the total costs. ", "Although no U.S. study of marijuana of this nature could be located, it is possible to investigate the likely magnitude of a tax necessary to correct for externalities of marijuana use by examining studies that compare the costs of cannabis use to alcohol. ", "A British study ranked different drugs by harm on a scale of 1 to 100. Overall, alcohol ranked 72, whereas cannabis ranked 20, or 28% of alcohol. Considering just the external harm, alcohol ranked 47 and cannabis ranked 9, or 19% of alcohol. A Canadian study found an even smaller ratio of health costs per user, about 12%. It is also likely that the non-health costs of marijuana are lower than for alcohol. For example, part of the spillover effect of alcohol is in the effect of traffic accidents, but studies tend to find that marijuana impairs driving ability less than alcohol. Evidence also suggests that smoking marijuana is inversely related to domestic violence. The Canadian study found larger enforcement costs for marijuana, but that effect is probably due to marijuana's illicit status. (For additional discussion of some of the various social effects of marijuana, see Appendix A .)", "In addition to indications that the externalities of marijuana are smaller per user than alcohol, the prevalence of marijuana use is smaller. According to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), alcohol usage in 2013 for the population 12 and older was 66.3% in the past year and 52.2% in the past month, whereas marijuana usage was 12.6% and 7.5% respectively. Thus marijuana usage is 19% (based on use in the past year) and 14% (based on use in the past month) as common as alcohol usage. These numbers suggest that the external costs of marijuana range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. ", "To translate this amount into a tax per ounce requires an estimate of the total market size and the price. A 2014 report issued by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) provides estimates of the unit price, total expenditure, and total consumption weight of marijuana in the United States. The calculations extrapolate from two sets of data: (1) the NSDUH, which is a self-reported survey of drug use habits; and (2) survey data from drug-offense arrestees in a limited number of areas designated as Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) jurisdictions. The report finds that from 2002 to 2010, the amount of marijuana consumed in the United States likely increased by about 40%. The ONDCP report also provides estimates of $30 billion, $41 billion, and $60 billion (given various assumptions) for total U.S. expenditures on marijuana in 2010. Additionally, the report indicates that THC levels in marijuana increased from 2000 to 2010.", "Using the ONDCP estimates of the market cited above ($30 billion to $60 billion), the estimates of external cost imply a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of current price. ", "The White House's 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the price per gram of marijuana from 2000 to 2010. The nominal price of marijuana is roughly constant over the period, implying the inflation-adjusted price of marijuana was likely decreasing over time. In 2010, the White House report estimates that the price per gram of marijuana was $7.11 per gram ($199.08 per ounce), not accounting for differences in quality.", "In addition, there are anecdotal prices recorded through anonymous sources and informal interviews with consumers or dealers in the underground market. Other researchers have used different techniques and newer data sources to estimate the price of marijuana across a wider range of locations. One website, priceofweed.com, contains anonymous, volunteer-submitted data on individual transactions across a variety of global locations, down to the level of particular towns or cities. Using data from priceofweed.com, the price of marijuana can be estimated as $317 per ounce, after weighting the observations for the quality of marijuana reported. However, it is unclear if data submitted to priceofweed.com are representative. Anecdotal reports in the media indicate that high-quality marijuana can be obtained in some areas, such as Washington State, for $28 per eighth of an ounce ($224 per ounce, but presumably less if bought in bulk). Another source suggests that consumers would have to pay at least $10 per gram, or $238 per ounce. ", "Tax rates ranging from 0.8% to 5.3% of the price might seem small to some, but marijuana prices are currently much higher than the production cost because of the illicit nature of the market. In a legal market, prices would be lower. These estimates of external cost range from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. The smaller estimate assumes a 0.8% tax and a $200 price; and the larger estimate assumes a 5.3% tax and a $317 price. Estimates discussed in subsequent sections suggest the price in a fully competitive market could be as low as $5 per ounce, so that the tax would be greater relative to price. ", "If a typical joint contains a half of a gram of marijuana, then the largest estimate is the equivalent of $0.30 per joint. For comparison, the federal tax on cigarettes is $0.05 for each cigarette whereas taxes on alcoholic drinks range from $0.04 for a five ounce glass of wine, $0.05 for a 12 ounce beer, and $0.13 for a 1.5 ounce shot of distilled spirits. Thus, the tax on a joint would be about the same as the tax on a six-pack of beer. States (and sometimes localities) also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and they presumably would also tax marijuana as Colorado and Washington have. These state taxes are probably already in excess of the external costs of marijuana.", "Although clearly many uncertainties surround attempts to measure the external costs of marijuana (as reflected in the range of estimates), the information that is available suggests a relatively small tax compared with current prices. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discouraging Use, Including Among Youth", "paragraphs": ["An argument can be made for imposing a tax to discourage marijuana users because these potential consumers underestimate long-term health costs and possible dependence when they begin to use the substance. This argument may be particularly important to underage use of marijuana. ", "Some disagree that marijuana is physically addictive, although it may result in dependence. A recent study found that about 9% of marijuana users become dependent. Another study found that medical marijuana laws in the United States increase the probability of marijuana abuse or dependency by 15%-27% among adults aged 21 or older. ", "Information on the risks of marijuana could be improved with more research and dissemination of the results of that research. In the case of the risk of addiction or dependence, economists disagree on whether the behavior of users is suboptimal, at least in the case of adults. \"Rational addiction\" theories indicate that as long as consumers are informed they are making desirable choices. Other economists argue that individuals can be engaged in hyperbolic discounting, in which they make time-inconsistent choices in the present that their future selves would not prefer. ", "An important issue in determining a tax that is intended for the best interests of the potential user is that the tax would also reduce income. If the purpose of the tax is to increase the user's welfare, that benefit must be offset by the reduced income. Individuals that typically consume multiple joints per day consume a disproportionate share of the marijuana used in the United States (a trend similar to alcohol use) and in heavier doses. Researchers have estimated that 20% of marijuana users constitute about 80% of consumption. Like taxes on alcohol and tobacco, the majority of the burden of a marijuana tax would fall primarily on the heaviest users. ", "A tax on marijuana, like most excise taxes, is likely to be regressive, and this outcome might be considered undesirable (although current users are likely to benefit from a decline in price from making marijuana legal).", "Evaluating the potential benefit to users of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on how users' participation in the market and the quantity purchased respond to the tax. It is assumed that the tax is passed on in price. Responses to price changes are generally expressed as elasticities by economists: the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. For example, if the elasticity is -0.5, a 10% increase in price leads to a 5% decrease in quantity consumed. If the price elasticity is low, the tax alters behavior very little, while imposing a significant tax burden, and users are harmed by the tax although their small change in consumption may be closer to the optimal choice (i.e., the choice they would make fully accounting for the costs).", "Gallet (2014) examines a combination of 42 studies on the demand for various illicit drugs, 13 of which measure the price elasticity demand of marijuana. After controlling for various factors related to the studies, Gallet's model predicts elasticities of demand for marijuana ranging between -0.15 and -0.31. In other words, a 1% increase in the price of marijuana results in a 0.15% to 0.31% decrease in the demand for marijuana. Consumer demand is relatively unresponsive to changes in price. Thus, it is more likely that users would be harmed overall by a tax imposed for their own benefit, because gains in moving to more optimal consumption may be more than offset by lost income from the tax.", "Government policy is often focused on limiting use of drugs (whether legal or illegal) by minors. Current, state marijuana legalization laws disallow purchases by those under 21 years old, but, as with other commodities, youth may still obtain them in various ways. Estimates of the price elasticity for minors tend to be larger. One study had an overall estimate of -0.44 but an estimate of -1.01 for ages 12-17 years old. Thus taxes may be more effective in reducing usage among youth (assuming these youth are not purchasing marijuana through illegal markets or acquiring legally produced marijuana through informal, secondary channels without cost). ", "The policy question then may be how much of a tax burden should be placed on non-responsive adult users to limit consumption of youth. (A similar issue arises with taxation of tobacco.) This question has no quantifiable answer, but one objective that might be considered is to set the tax so that the price of marijuana does not fall substantially with legalization and expanded demand, especially among minors who are more responsive to price. The next section discusses the potential level of such a tax. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capturing the Current Differential Between Cost and Price", "paragraphs": ["The characteristics of a legalized, and low-cost, marijuana market, as well as the concerns discussed above about youth consumption, may suggest a tax to keep these prices from falling precipitously until the consequences of a legal market can be determined. Depending on those consequences, a relatively high tax may be retained, or the tax may be reduced.", "After legalization, it is estimated that the cost of marijuana will decrease significantly because more will be produced and the implicit costs of evading law enforcement will decline. Many producers are currently confined to smaller-scale or indoor operations that lack economies of scale. Workers in the illicit trade of marijuana must also be compensated more than comparable workers in industries that are not subject to law enforcement risk (e.g., laborers harvesting fruits or vegetables). Although a legalized market for marijuana could develop in such a way that some firms are able to attain market power and charge higher prices for their particular brands of marijuana compared with generic brands, the market for marijuana could become more competitive. In a competitive market, firms earn no profit above the normal return necessary to attract capital (if they did, other firms would enter to exploit it). Prices would, therefore, fall to reflect lower production costs. ", "The difference between the projected cost in a legal competitive market and current prices (which largely reflect illicit production) provides a range within which a federal tax rate might be considered, at least initially. The tax should not be set too high (including any state and local taxes) to encourage illicit productions, so that this approach might be aimed at offsetting only part of the price reduction expected from the legalization of marijuana. ", "Caulkins (2010) estimates the costs of producing and processing legalized marijuana, under a number of methods and scenarios. As shown in Table 1 , Caulkins estimates that the production cost per pound of high-quality marijuana would be roughly equivalent to the current retail price per ounce . Outdoor production of marijuana is estimated to cost substantially less, per pound of output. However, marijuana cultivated outdoors is less likely to contain the higher levels of THC found in plants grown indoors in controlled growing environments. The estimated production costs in Table 1 do not include processing costs, which are estimated to add an additional $20 to $35 per pound.", "Producing high-quality marijuana in greenhouses appears to cost, at the upper limit, $215 plus $35 per pound for processing, or around $15 per ounce. Using outdoor production, of $10 plus $35 a pound, the cost is about $2.80 per ounce. These products vary by THC concentration; as noted earlier, sinsemilla contains 10% -18% THC, or about three times the potency conventional commercial-grade marijuana that is pollinated. ", "In a different estimate, Easton (2009) indicates that government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced at 33 cents per gram ($9 per ounce or $144 per pound). He also suggests that, based on tobacco sales, the cost per gram of going to a retail market is about 10 cents per gram, or $2.80 per ounce ($44.80 per pound). Adding this amount to estimated costs leads to a cost (and expected price) of $5-$18 per ounce ($80-$288 per pound). ", "In jurisdictions where marijuana has become quasi-legal, prices tend to be lower than the street price in most cases but higher than these cost estimates. In an article indicating an increased price for medical marijuana in Canada, the price was listed as $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, $50-$140 per ounce. In that same article, a lawyer representing numerous suppliers said his clients could supply for $1-$4 per gram, or $28-$110 per ounce. The street price was listed as $10-$15 per gram, or $280-$420 per ounce. Of course, the price could be discounted if bought in larger quantities. These street prices are high compared with the averages in priceofweed.com. Beginning in April 2014, the Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 (CAD) per gram, which is higher than the current average and closer to the street price. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be permitted under the new law. These prices are higher than the costs discussed above but also apparently do not reflect an unfettered and mature competitive market. ", "Actual prices can also be observed in Colorado marijuana shops through online websites, such as Leafly.com. Leafly is a website and mobile phone application that helps users find marijuana shops, medical marijuana dispensaries, and doctors that prescribe medical marijuana located in their areas. Like the consumer website and application, Yelp (which is used to review restaurants, stores, and other sites of interest), Leafly provides consumer reviews of each location and various strands of marijuana and provides \"menu\" prices of products available at each shop. According to an examination by the authors of some of the most-reviewed marijuana shops in Denver, a gram of marijuana is priced around $9 to $15, an eighth of an ounce of marijuana can be priced around $29 to $40, and an ounce can be priced around $190 to $350. Some of the higher prices listed on Leafly include tax, but it is unclear from the \"menu prices\" whether some of the prices are before or after tax (although they are most likely before tax, unless noted). ", "Submissions to priceofweed.com report that marijuana prices in Colorado are lower than the national prices reported earlier, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce (compared with $377 and $245 reported for the United States overall). These prices still reflect a mix of the illicit and legal markets but would presumably include taxes on any legal purchases. ", "Colorado prices provide some indication of falling prices with legalization, but prices appear not close to the cost of production. The prices in Colorado, however, may not reflect those in a fully legal market because they are still in a quasi-legal status. Because the federal government does not recognize the legality of these operations, media reports indicate that these producers may have trouble getting banking assistance, including deposit accounts, much less business loans. These operations are potentially subject to very large federal income taxes, which can be imposed without allowing for deductions because they remain illegal. These taxes can be the equivalent of excise taxes at the federal rate and can apply at each stage of production. (See discussion in Appendix B .) And marijuana businesses are still subject to the threat of potential enforcement from federal authorities. ", "In a 2010 study of the possible effects of legalization in California, researchers from the RAND Corporation estimate that the pretax retail price of marijuana would likely decrease by more than 80%, suggesting a price of $40-$60 per ounce. Miron and Waldock, however, estimate a 50% price reduction, based on a comparison of prices in the United States and the Netherlands (sold in coffee shops). This price reduction would suggest a price of $100-$150 per ounce on average. The Netherlands, however, is, like Colorado, not an instance of a fully legalized market because the Netherlands bans imports and has anti-drug laws on the books. ", "Although the range of projected prices in a fully legal market is wide, from a few dollars to $100 per ounce, street prices of $200-$300 per ounce suggest that there could be a wide scope for a tax rate designed to align legalized marijuana prices close to current street prices of illegal marijuana. For example, if the eventual competitive price is $50 per ounce and the average street price is $250 per ounce, there is scope for taxes up to $200 tax per ounce.", "There are several caveats to this point. The first is state and local governments will likely collect a tax that will absorb some of the differential. The second is a tax that is set too high would encourage the illicit market, and one of the advantages of legalizing marijuana is to largely eliminate the illicit market, reducing law enforcement costs. Moreover, the potential scope of the difference is uncertain, but lowering tax and observing market conditions may be the best initial strategy.

A recent report by the American College of Physicians noted that limitations on marijuana research are caused, in part, by barriers encountered for federal approval, the lack of high-grade, research-quality marijuana, and the general classification of marijuana as a Schedule I illegal drug. The report discusses a wide range of conditions that marijuana may be beneficial for and urges study of the efficacy and side effects of marijuana.

This section provides some illustrations of how much revenue might be raised from an excise tax were marijuana to become legal. These revenue consequences are quite uncertain given the broad uncertainty about potential price and quantity in the market.", "In addition, casual consumers may enter the marijuana market and increase revenue. These consumers may purchase marijuana because concerns about punishment are no longer present or because of a distaste for participating in illegal activities in general. These effects are not necessarily captured in the existing price elasticity estimates (which mostly reflect consumers that are determined enough to defy law enforcement to consume marijuana), and the legal market, even setting price aside, could be much larger than the current market for this reason.", "The pace of legalization and taxation of marijuana at the state level could also affect potential revenue collected from a federal excise tax. If more states tend to legalize marijuana, and try to set their excise tax rates to roughly equalize the price of legal (under state laws) marijuana with illicit marijuana, then federal lawmakers could be more constrained in their ability to levy excise taxes on marijuana without encouraging production in the illicit market. ", "Some analysts have tried to estimate the potential revenue that could be raised from nationwide legalization of marijuana using various economic models, and may in some cases include excise taxes.

They also estimate $3.3 billion in annual savings in expenditures from law enforcement. Miron and Waldock do not report price and quantity separately, but they are probably estimating a tax of around $50-$75 per ounce.

As noted earlier, data on the value of the market ranged from $30 billion to $60 billion according to ONDCP. The current price was estimated at between $200 and $300 per ounce. For this example, assume intermediate values of a $40 billion market and a $250 current price. ", "To illustrate the potential effect on revenue assume a fully legalized industry nationwide, assume a pretax price of $50 per ounce, a state tax of $50 per ounce, and the consequences of a federal tax of $50 per ounce. The taxes and costs bring the total price to $150 per ounce. ", "The federal excise tax collection, therefore, is $50 multiplied by the quantity (in ounces). In the current market, quantity would be determined by dividing $40 billion by $250. If quantity did not change the federal excise tax revenue would be $50 multiplied by $40 billion divided by $250, or $8 billion. Collections, however, would be somewhat larger because the fall in price from legalization would increase consumption. Using a constant elastic formula, the ratio of the new quantity to the old is (P*/P)^E, P* is the new price, P is the old price, and E is the price elasticity (which is negative). Assuming a price elasticity of -0.25, the effect of legalization alone, which is assumed to reduce the price to $50 per ounce, would lead to a 50% increase in quantity. With federal, state, and local taxes, the price is $150 and the increase in quantity is 14%, leading to a projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion.

Costs of these lab tests can be much as $100-$120 per sample, and as low as $60-$75 per test with a bulk discount. If marijuana is legalized, it can be expected that more labs that perform similar services will enter the market, and possibly reduce the price of testing.

Among non-alcohol drugs, marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in the general driver population as well as in drivers being involved in crashes.

Technical Calculations for the Estimate of a National Marijuana Tax Base from Colorado Data", "An estimate of the total sales volume of a national sales base can be calculated by extrapolating tax collection data from Colorado or Washington. Data from both states likely underrepresent total demand because licenses for more production and retail businesses are pending. Additionally, it is unknown if the underground market for marijuana significantly declined from the opening of state-licensed stores. ", "For the purposes of this report, the most recent tax revenue data from Colorado are used to calculate an estimate of the state's marijuana tax base (dollar amount of total sales). The recreational tax base can be calculated using tax collections data from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax or the 2.9% general sales tax (which provide two measures to derive the total tax base), where tax base is equal to tax collections divided by the tax rate. Because each of the two taxes yields slightly different tax bases, the two calculations are averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales. ", "For example, the Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 (on retail, non-medical marijuana) in September 2014. Using the methodology above, this would lead to tax base calculations of $29.4 million and $30.6 million, respectively. Averaging these two numbers leads to an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in the state of Colorado in September 2014. ", "The data from Colorado can then be extrapolated for each state and the District of Columbia to calculate an estimate of the national sales tax base. The recreational sales tax base averaged from the two data points in Colorado can be multiplied by each state's or district's population (indexed, relative to Colorado) and then multiplied by the marijuana usage rates (indexed, relative to Colorado) as reported by the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). In other words, this simple calculation assumes the primary sources of variation in consumption in each state or district are based on population and usage rates and does not assume major changes in price (e.g., the large-scale production of relatively cheap, unbranded marijuana; or variations in state tax rates) that could lead to further supply and demand effects. Using the August 2014 data from Colorado, it can be estimated that the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be $14.5 billion or $15.4 billion per year. These estimates could be subject to revision, as recreational tax revenue in Colorado has been generally increasing since January 2014. ", "A similar process can be used to calculate the medical marijuana tax base in Colorado, although there is only one tax levied on medical marijuana in Colorado (the 2.9% general sales tax). Based on September 2014 data, medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million. From January to September 2014, monthly medical marijuana sales in Colorado have ranged between approximately $31 million and $35 million. In FY2013 (ending June 30, 2013), before the legalization of recreational marijuana, state sales tax collections data from the Colorado Department of Revenue imply an annual medical marijuana tax base of $314.2 million in sales. It is too early to conclude whether the opening of the recreational marijuana market has affected the demand for medical marijuana in Colorado. ", "However, it is difficult to extrapolate medical marijuana data in Colorado to the general U.S. population because of incomplete data in some states. Additionally, the medical marijuana patient data could have a self-selection bias, as some individuals could have been willing to relocate to states permitting medical marijuana use, if they felt that they had few other options to alleviate their condition. Based on Colorado's tax collections data, medical marijuana consumption could double marijuana consumption total amounts, if not more. Even if medical marijuana regulations were more tightly enforced, post-legalization, users denied for a medical card could purchase marijuana for recreational purposes. "], "subsections": []}]}}
