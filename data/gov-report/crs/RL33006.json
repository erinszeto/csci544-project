The House bill would reduce energy taxes by about $8.1 billion over 11 years,as compared with $14.1 billion in the Senate version. A nuclear energy production tax credit isincluded among the Senate incentives.", "ANWR. The House-passed bill would authorize oil and gas exploration, development, andproduction in ANWR, with a 2,000-acre limit on production and support facilities. No ANWRprovisions are included in the Senate version.", "Energy Production on Federal Lands. Both bills include numerous provisions to increaseenergy production on federal lands.

The price of crude oil began to rise in 2003 -- exceeding $60/barrel (bbl) in early July2005 -- setting much of the context for renewed debate over omnibus energy legislation in the 109thCongress.", "National and world demand for oil continues to grow. However, domestic oil production inthe United States continues to decline. As a consequence, the gap between U.S. production andconsumption has had to be covered by increased oil imports. These imports, roughly 6 millionbarrels per day (mbd) after the Arab oil embargo, now exceed 10 mbd to satisfy total U.S. oilconsumption of nearly 21 mbd. (1) ", "Addressing dependence on imported oil raises a number of issues touching on both demandand consumption of fossil fuels. Chief among these are the production of additional fossil fuels,development of alternative energy sources, and conservation and energy efficiency. Energyinfrastructure has also been a growing issue, including the oil refining and distribution sector, andelectricity transmission, reliability, and regulation. Increased use of domestic coal and reassessmentof many issues associated with nuclear energy have drawn attention as well.", "Developing a comprehensive approach to energy policy that balances economic, security, andenvironmental issues -- as well as competing regional priorities in the United States -- is anenormous challenge for policymakers. Keeping a clear eye on distinguishing between short- andlong-term policies is also difficult but important in keeping expectations realistic for whatcomprehensive legislation can achieve.", "In the 109th Congress, the House approved an omnibus energy bill ( H.R. 6 ) onApril 21, 2005, that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas leasing,substantially change oversight of electric utilities, increase the use of alternative motor fuels, provide$8.1 billion in energy tax incentives, extend the nuclear accident liability system, and authorizenumerous energy R&D programs. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 6 on June 28without ANWR provisions but including $14.1 billion in tax incentives and provisions on globalclimate change. The two versions of the bill contain many provisions from the conference report onan omnibus energy bill (also numbered H.R. 6 ) in the 108th Congress that was blockedby a Senate filibuster.", "The House- and Senate-passed bills in the 109th Congress would mandate increasing levelsof ethanol production through 2012 but allow regions to opt out under certain conditions. Use ofmethyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a domestic gasoline additive would be phased out, but statescould authorize continued use and under the House bill the President could void the ban. Producersof MTBE and renewable fuels would be granted protection (a \"safe harbor\") from product liabilitylawsuits under the House bill, while only renewable fuels would be covered in the Senate bill. MTBE liability protection proved highly contentious in the Senate in the 108th Congress.", "The Senate bill includes a \"renewable portfolio standard\" (RPS) -- rejected by the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee -- requiring utilities to generate at least 10% of their electricityfrom renewable energy sources by 2020. Also, the Senate bill would establish a credit-baseddeployment program to encourage technologies to reduce greenhouse gas intensity and establishprograms to deploy technologies in developing countries. Neither of those provisions is in the Housebill.", "Provisions are also included in both bills to increase access by energy developers to federallands. Several new statutory efficiency standards would be established for consumer and commercialproducts and appliances, and other standards would be set by the Department of Energy (DOE)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Electricity Regulation. Title XII in the House-and Senate-passed bills would create an electric reliability organization (ERO) that would enforcemandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system. All ERO standards would be approvedby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under this title, the ERO could imposepenalties on a user, owner, or operator of the bulk-power system that violates any FERC-approvedreliability standard. This title also addresses transmission infrastructure issues. The Secretary ofEnergy would be able to certify congestion on the transmission lines and issue permits totransmission owners. Permit holders would be able to petition in U.S. District Court to acquirerights-of-way for the construction of transmission lines through the exercise of the right of eminentdomain. In the Senate bill, FERC could approve participant funding for transmission lineconstruction. A provision that would have required FERC to approve participant funding for newtransmission lines was removed in markup by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. ", "Under the House bill, FERC's Standard Market Design notice of proposed rulemaking wouldbe remanded. The Senate bill would terminate FERC's Standard Market Design notice of proposedrulemaking. Under both Senate- and House-passed bills, native load service obligations would beclarified, and federal utilities would be allowed to participate in regional transmission organizations.", "Under both bills, the electricity title would repeal the mandatory purchase requirements underthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). The Public Utility Holding Company Act of1935 (PUHCA) would be repealed. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and stateregulatory bodies would be given access to utility books and records.", "FERC would be required to issue rules to establish an electronic system that providesinformation about the availability and price of wholesale electric energy and transmission servicesunder the House version, and could issue such rules under the Senate version. Under both versions,for electric rates that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finds to be unjust, unreasonable,or unduly discriminatory, the effective date for refunds would begin at the time of the filing of acomplaint with FERC but not later than five months after filing of a complaint. Criminal and civilpenalties would be increased. Under the House version, the Federal Power Act would be amendedto give FERC review authority for transfer of assets valued in excess of $10 million. The Senateversion would also apply to the purchase, lease, or acquisition of an existing generating facility thathas a value in excess of $10 million and is used to generate electricity for FERC jurisdictionalinterstate wholesale sales. In addition to the House requirements, the Senate version would requireFERC to determine that the proposed transaction would not result in harmful cross-subsidizationwith a non-utility associate company.", "(For additional discussion on these issues, see CRS Report RL32728 , Electric UtilityRegulatory Reform: Issues for the 109th Congress ; and CRS Report RL32133 , Federal MergerReview Authority .)", "Renewable Fuel Standard and MTBE. The Houseand Senate versions of H.R. 6 would amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate therequirement that reformulated gasoline (RFG) contain 2% oxygen to reduce automotive emissions,a requirement which prompted the widespread use of MTBE and, to a lesser degree, ethanol. Instead, the bills would establish a new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline containrenewable fuels such as ethanol. The House bill would require that 3.1 billion gallons of renewablefuel be used in 2005, increasing to 5.0 billion gallons by 2012, and the Senate bill would require 8.0billion gallons by 2012 (compared with 3.4 billion gallons used in 2004). However, concerns havebeen raised that this requirement could significantly increase the pump price for gasoline in someareas.", "Because of concerns over drinking water contamination by MTBE (a major competitor withethanol), both bills would ban the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel, except in states thatspecifically authorize its use, not later than December 31, 2014, under the House version and fouryears after enactment in the Senate version. The ban has two possible exceptions. First, theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) may allow MTBE in motor fuel up to 0.5 percent byvolume, in cases that the Administrator determines to be appropriate; and second, under the Houseversion, the President may make a determination, not later than June 30, 2014, that the restrictionson the use of MTBE shall not take place. The House bill would authorize $2.0 billion and theSenate bill $1.0 billion to assist the conversion of merchant MTBE production facilities to theproduction of other fuel additives. Further, the bills would preserve the reductions in emissions oftoxic substances achieved by the RFG program (although they use different baselines for determiningrequired reductions).", "One of the most controversial provisions in the House version of H.R. 6 is theestablishment of a \"safe harbor\" from product liability lawsuits for producers of MTBE andrenewable fuels (such as ethanol). The safe harbor provision would protect anyone in the productchain, from manufacturers down to retailers, from liability for cleanup of MTBE and renewable fuelsor for personal injury or property damage based on the product being deemed defective. (That legalapproach has been used in California to require refiners to shoulder liability for MTBE cleanup.) Thesafe harbor would be retroactive to September 5, 2003. Prior to that date, five lawsuits had beenfiled. After that date, at least 150 suits were filed, on behalf of 210 communities in 15 differentstates. The Senate bill includes the safe harbor provision for renewable fuels but not MTBE; theSenate safe harbor would not be retroactive.", "(For additional information, see CRS Report RL32865(pdf) , Renewable Fuels and MTBE: AComparison of Selected Legislative Initiatives ; CRS Report RL30369, Fuel Ethanol: Backgroundand Public Policy Issues ; and CRS Report RL32787 , MTBE in Gasoline: Clean Air and DrinkingWater Issues .)", "Energy Taxes. After the conference report on H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress was blocked in the Senate, several of the measure's energytax provisions -- estimated at $1.3 billion over 10 years -- were included in the Working FamiliesTax Relief Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-311 ), enacted on October 4, 2004. About $5 billion in additionalenergy tax incentives over 10 years were part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L.108-357 ) enacted on October 22, 2004.", "Many of the energy tax incentives in H.R. 6 from the 108th Congress that werenot enacted in 2004 have been repackaged into the H.R. 6 in the 109th Congress, withsignificant differences between the House and Senate versions. First, the Senate bill would providenet tax reductions of $14.1 billion over 11 years compared with $8.1 billion in the House-passedversion. Second, most of this difference is accounted for by tax cuts for the electricity industry,energy efficiency, and renewable and alternative fuels. The Senate bill provides absolutely andrelatively more tax cuts for energy efficiency and alternative fuels. The differences in tax cuts foralternative fuels are particularly striking: $12 billion in the Senate bill vs. $0.6 billion in the Housebill. The Senate bill also provides more tax incentives for energy efficiency investments than theHouse bill. The House bill provides much larger tax cuts for the electricity industry, particularly forelectricity infrastructure.", "Thus, in a relative sense, the House bill is tilted more toward fossil fuel production, whilethe Senate bill's tax cuts are tilted more to the production of alternative and renewable fuels andenergy conservation. However, the absolute dollar tax cuts for oil, gas, and coal are also somewhatlarger in the Senate bill than in the House bill ($5.8 billion vs. $4.7 billion).", "(For more background, see CRS Issue Brief IB10054, Energy Tax Policy .)", "Nuclear Energy. Strong incentives for buildingnew commercial nuclear power plants are included in the Senate version of H.R. 6 , andboth the House and Senate bills would reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act nuclear liability systemfor 20 years and authorize DOE to build an advanced reactor in Idaho.", "The strongest nuclear incentive is the Senate bill's 1.8-cents/kilowatt-hour tax credit forelectricity produced by nuclear reactors. The credit would be available for up to 6,000 megawattsof new capacity -- the equivalent of about five or six new reactors -- for the first eight years ofoperation. The nuclear production tax credit was also included in the energy bill conference reportin the 108th Congress, and the Energy Information Administration concluded then that the creditwould provide sufficient incentives for new commercial reactors to be built. (2) The Senate bill would alsoauthorize loan guarantees for new reactors. Neither of those incentives is included in the Houseversion.", "Reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act is generally considered to be a prerequisite fornew reactors. Under Price-Anderson, commercial reactor accident damages are paid through acombination of private-sector insurance and a nuclear industry self-insurance system. Liability iscapped at the maximum coverage available under the system, currently about $10.7 billion. Evenwithout reauthorization, existing reactors continue to be covered, but any new ones would not. Price-Anderson also authorizes the Department of Energy to indemnify its nuclear contractors. Thelimit on DOE contractor liability is the same as for commercial reactors, except when the limit forcommercial reactors drops because of a decline in the number of covered reactors.", "Both versions of H.R. 6 would provide a 20-year extension of Price-Andersonto the end of 2025. The nuclear industry contends that the system has worked well and should becontinued, but opponents charge that Price-Anderson's liability limits provide an unwarrantedsubsidy to nuclear power. The House version of the bill would also require the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC) to assess nuclear power plant security and require additional security measures.", "(For more information, see CRS Issue Brief IB88090, Nuclear Energy Policy .)", "Renewable Portfolio Standard and EnergyEfficiency. The Senate version of H.R. 6 would require retailelectricity suppliers (electric utilities, except for those in Hawaii and that sold less than 4 billionkwh) to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from a portfolio of new renewable energyresources. The minimum renewable energy target, or Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), wouldstart at 2.5% in 2008, rise in steps of 2.5% every four years, and level off at 10% from 2020 to 2030. The House version of H.R. 6 does not have an RPS provision.", "Eligible resources for the RPS in the Senate bill would include \"new renewable energy\"produced from solar, wind, ocean, and geothermal energy, most forms of biomass, landfill gas, andincremental hydropower. Also, additional energy above the average generation in the threepreceding years from \"existing\" (already placed in service) facilities using solar, wind, ocean,biomass, landfill gas, incremental hydropower, or incremental geothermal energy would be eligibleto satisfy the RPS target. The base for calculating the target production level would exclude powerfrom existing hydropower and municipal solid waste generation. Thus, states with a large amountof existing hydropower or municipal solid waste generation would have a proportionately lowertarget for new generation. However, there may be a debate in conference about whether existingnuclear and hydro generation, or some portion of it, would be eligible to satisfy the RPS target.", "Tradable credits would be created, which could be purchased in place of alternative powersources. The credits would function like those in the Clean Air Act emission allowance tradingsystem, which has lowered compliance costs for air pollution regulations. Electricity suppliers could\"carry forward\" surplus credits for up to three years. Double credits would be provided for facilitieson Indian land and triple credits would go to distributed generators under 1 megawatt in size. A costcap for the credits is set as the lesser of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour (kwh) or 200% of the average marketvalue of the credits. DOE collections from credit sales and penalties would fund grants to states topromote renewables.", "Both versions of H.R. 6 would legislate new energy efficiency standards forseveral consumer and commercial products and appliances. For certain other products andappliances, DOE would be empowered to set new standards.

The Senate version contains no ANWR provisions.", "Development advocates argue that ANWR oil would reduce U.S. energy markets' exposureto crises in the Middle East; boost North Slope oil production; lower oil prices; extend the economiclife of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System; and create many jobs in Alaska and elsewhere in the UnitedStates. They maintain that ANWR oil could be developed with minimal environmental harm, andthat the footprint of development could be limited to a total of 2,000 acres.", "Opponents of development in ANWR argue that intrusion on this ecosystem cannot bejustified on any terms; that economically recoverable oil found (if any) would provide little energysecurity and could be replaced by cost-effective alternatives, including conservation; and that jobclaims are overstated. They also maintain that the footprint of oil development, despite a provisionin the measure to limit certain facilities to 2,000 acres, would still be scattered in many parcels acrossthe landscape, and would have a greater impact than is implied by any limit on total acreage.

In 1997, the 11th CircuitCourt of Appeals ruled that the injection of fluids for the purpose of hydraulicfracturing constituted underground injection, that all underground injection must beregulated, and that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane (CBM) wells in Alabamamust be regulated under the state's UIC program ( LEAF v. EPA , 118 F. 3d 1467). ", "Hydraulic fracturing involves the high-pressure injection of fluids into coalbeds to enhance the recovery of oil and natural gas from underground formations.Water-based fluids are typically used as fracturing fluids; however, diesel fuel oftenis used instead of water, and various chemicals are added to fracturing fluids. (3) Whilehydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventional oil and gas sincethe 1950s, this practice has been used for CBM recovery mainly since the 1990s.", "A growing concern is that, in many CBM-producing regions, the target coalbeds occur within underground sources of drinking water, and the fracturing processinjects fluids directly into the drinking water sources; EPA has determined that theuse of diesel fuel as a fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic substancesdirectly into underground sources of drinking water. (4) Also, becausethe process fractures rock, fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas(primarily methane) to enter drinking water aquifers. As the number of coalbedmethane (CBM) wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly inrecent years, so has concern over the potential impact on water resources, particularlyin the water-scarce West. Very few studies have been done to evaluate these impacts.

Under the SMD case, a 5% increase in transmission capability by 2005is assumed by DOE due to improved operational efficiency at regional seams. Inaddition, DOE assumes that adopting the SMD would result in some savings that aredifficult to quantify but would be a result of several factors including theconsolidation of control areas from the currently existing 150, the possible avoidanceof capital cost and software expenditures that would have been needed at existingcontrol centers, improved regional planning, and consistency of market design. DOEassigns a 10% savings due to these efficiency improvements.

The model's range foruncertainties is estimated to be about $100 million. The cost varies significantly byregion, ranging from 47 cents per megawatt-hour for GridFlorida to 12 cents permegawatt-hour for PJM. (13) Regions with existing RTOs have zero additionalcosts. Under the SMD case, the effects of SMD on retail rates are influenced to asignificant extent by whether the states in question have cost-of-service regulationor competitive retail choice. DOE found that for some importing regions withcost-based rates, the net result could be increased costs associated with wholesalepurchases, which would be passed through to retail customers. For some exportingregions with cost-based rates, additional utility revenues from exports are expectedto lead to lower retail prices for the region under the SMD case. In contrast, inregions in which most states have adopted retail choice, increased electricity exportsare expected to lead to higher market-clearing prices in the short-term markets andsomewhat higher consumer prices. However, in areas such as California that areprojected to see increased imports, lower wholesale prices and lower prices forconsumers are expected. DOE found that the magnitude of the projected changes,both positive and negative, decreases through 2020. Overall, DOE projects the netbenefit for all consumers would be about $1 billion per year over the first six years,after factoring in the estimated $760 million per year and RTO costs.
