Policy issues cover such areas as: U.S. trade negotiations; tariff and nontariff barriers; worker dislocation from trade liberalization, trade remedy laws; import and export policies; international investment, economic sanctions; and trade policy functions of the federal government. Congress also has an important role in international finance. It has the authority over U.S. financial commitments to international financial institutions and oversight responsibilities for trade- and finance-related agencies of the U.S. Government.", "The 112th Congress approved U.S. bilateral free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, extended the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs through December 31, 2013, and reauthorized the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) through July 31, 2013. It also authorized permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status for Russia and Moldova, reauthorized the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and approved full U.S. participation in general capital increases for the World Bank and four regional development banks. The 113th Congress may revisit these issues and address new ones. Among the more potentially prominent issues are:", "1.Possible renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), allowing the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements, and providing trade negotiating objectives and expedited legislative procedures to consider trade agreement implementing bills; and the possible related issue of TAA program reauthorization;", "2.Negotiations for comprehensive reciprocal trade agreements with major trading partners, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with the United States 12 countries from the Western Hemisphere and Asia, and new negotiations with the European Union for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Agreement;", "3.U.S.-China trade relations including investment, intellectual property rights protection, currency reform, and market access liberalization;", "4.International finance issues including implications of the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis for the U.S. economy, oversight of international financial institutions, and negotiations to conclude new bilateral investment treaties (BITs);", "5.Oversight of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round negotiations, including the completed trade facilitation agreement, and of separate new trade negotiations (e.g. services) that some members of the WTO have undertaken;", "6.Review of the President's export control reform initiative and possible renewal of the Export Control Act (EAA), and review of trade sanctions; and", "7.Reauthorization of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and expiring trade preference programs (e.g., the GSP and the Andean Trade Preference Act).", "A list of CRS reports covering these issues is provided at the end of the report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policymaking in a Global Economy1", "paragraphs": ["The 113th Congress, in exercising both its legislative and oversight responsibilities, faces numerous international trade and finance policy issues. They are important to Congress because they can affect the health of the U.S. economy, the success of U.S. businesses and their workers, and the standard of living of Americans. A list of CRS reports covering in detail each of the issues addressed is provided at the end of the report.", "International trade and finance issues are complex, and policy deliberation is often made more challenging by developments in the global economy. First, the world continues to recover unevenly from the 2008 global financial crisis, with many developed countries experiencing weak growth and the large emerging economies, such as China, India, and Brazil experiencing slower growth. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe and increased vulnerability of the Eurozone are among the most visible examples. Second, developing country influence and role in the global economy are growing, as witnessed by changing trade and investment patterns, as well as the ascendance of the Group of 20 (G-20) economies as a major forum for international economic cooperation. The rise of Brazil, India, and China, among other emerging economies, presents new challenges in U.S. trade policy and in developing global trade and finance agreements. Third, economic tensions emanating from large international imbalances have not eased. ", "The U.S. economy is recovering slowly from its worst recession in eight decades. Although the economy is experiencing productivity gains and moderate expansion in output, it nonetheless continues to struggle with declining, but still high unemployment and a large federal debt. These domestic imbalances are connected to international ones, including the large U.S. trade deficit, rising holdings of U.S. debt by foreign countries, and downward pressure on the dollar. The United States has long consumed more than it has produced, giving rise to the expanding trade deficit, which is financed by capital inflows. The counterpart is large saving balances, trade surpluses, and capital outflows in other countries, including China, Japan, and Germany.", "The call for \"global rebalancing\" implies a reversal of these trends, which would require national and foreign responses. For the United States, this would involve increased saving (less spending) relative to investment that would produce a rise in net exports (reduction in trade deficit). Implicit in this mix, particularly given steady de-leveraging of U.S. firms and households since 2008, is a reduction of the fiscal deficit, the major source of U.S. dissaving since 2000. For trade surplus countries, it implies the opposite\u2014an increase in domestic demand and decrease in saving relative to investment that would lead to a fall in net exports (reduction in trade surplus). Rebalancing also implies changes in relative exchange rates, including a likely depreciation of the dollar against major U.S. trade partner currencies, and appreciation of China's currency. ", "On the trade policy side, the 113th Congress during the second session will likely exercise its oversight responsibilities and possibly take up legislation that would lead to reauthorization of trade promotion authority. It may also take up implementing legislation for reciprocal trade agreements including the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, with the European Union for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement, and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). Some of these agreements address new issues, such as cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, and international supply chains.", "President Obama's National Export Initiative (NEI) continues to promote the goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years, which given that 95% of the world's population lives outside U.S. borders, some view as one solution to the challenge of generating faster economic and employment growth. In addition to supporting U.S. economic growth, the rationale for promoting exports is based on the view that foreign demand is needed to supplement an American consumer still dealing with a residual debt overhang and a federal government facing persistently large fiscal deficits. U.S. exports have recovered briskly since 2009. Meeting the goal of doubling exports, however, will be difficult because trade policy by itself is limited in its ability to affect the trade deficit and aggregate output, which will require vibrant global economic growth, a competitive dollar, and changes in domestic and foreign macroeconomic policies. In addition, after decades of increasing, global trade has slowed recently. ", "Foreign country policies, however, may not align easily with U.S. priorities. The European Union continues to wrestle with its own financial crisis and economic downturn, while Japan is mired in persistent slow growth, although Prime Minister Abe's government launched a program of immediate and long-term initiatives\u2014 dubbed \"Abenomics\"\u2014designed to place Japan on a path to more sustainable economic growth. Rising economic powers, whose strong growth represents expanding markets for U.S. goods, may also be turning to less expansionist macroeconomic policies. Many countries, including many G-20 and emerging economies, have returned to industrial policies, backtracking on trade liberalization. So despite U.S. policies directed at opening markets, export promotion and encouraging macroeconomic changes abroad, U.S. economic recovery still depends on a balance of increased domestic investment and demand, which could worsen the trade deficit if increased saving is not also part of the mix. ", "On the international finance side, policy-driven currency misalignments and the specter of \"currency wars\" point to the other side of the global imbalances problem. Some countries are discussing the need for more coordinated and equitable exchange rate policies, if not a broader rethinking of the international monetary system. Attention has also turned to the relevance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral economic institutions in this process, such as the World Bank, including reevaluating their role, structure, and governance (i.e., increased role of emerging economies). A current concern is the potential threat of competitive devaluations, particularly from China, that could increase trade tensions, hinder the rebalancing of the global economy, and undermine international economic stability. China is not alone in this behavior, but receives the most attention because of its closed capital account and large holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.", "U.S. international economic policy must also contend with \"globalization,\" or the increasing integration of markets and production, and supply chain networks brought about by advances in technology, communications, transportation, and lower barriers to trade. These transformative changes in the global economy have led to large decreases in transaction costs that have spurred tremendous growth in trade, particularly of intermediate goods, which now account for over 60% of the world's commercial exchange. It has also contributed to rising incomes. In the United States, jobs are supported by U.S. exports to foreign affiliates and U.S. production abroad, as well as foreign firms operating in the United States. These complex production networks further complicate the trade and employment policy debates, and raise other questions such as what constitutes an \"American-made\" product and how will innovation and production strategies continue to change the economic landscape.", "At the same time, while global economic integration has increased trade and economic growth, it has also exposed U.S. firms and workers to greater competition from lower-cost and more efficient producers in certain sectors and increasingly, from state-owned-enterprises (SOEs). Globalization and the larger volume of imports of goods and services, therefore, may force some U.S. firms to make costly adjustments to remain competitive. In some cases this may take the form of worker dislocation and shifts to production abroad, and may raise concerns in Congress over distributional issues of global production and trade.", "In sum, U.S. costs and benefits linked to an increasingly interconnected global economy may run in many directions. The discussion is no longer simply about free trade versus protectionism. The debate involves domestic and foreign macroeconomic policies, the participation of foreign states in markets, the competitiveness of U.S. firms and workers, implications of value-chain and cross-country production, and the financial stability of the international economy. For the United States, an overarching goal is to maintain its high standard of living by remaining innovative, productive, and internationally competitive, while safeguarding those stakeholders who otherwise may be left behind in a fast-changing global economy, suggesting a strong supporting role for complementary domestic policies. These changes have also raised new trade policy issues, some of which are being discussed in current U.S. free trade agreement negotiations.", "Congress is in a unique position to address these issues, particularly given its constitutional mandate for legislating and overseeing international trade and financial policy. In addition to broader congressional oversight of the economic and political context of the current U.S. participation in the global economy, this report highlights major international trade and finance issues that the 113th Congress may address. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Congress in International Trade and Finance5", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Constitution assigns express authority over foreign trade to Congress. Article I, Section 8, gives Congress the power to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations\" and to \"lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\" For roughly the first 150 years of the United States, Congress exercised its authority over foreign trade by setting tariff rates on all imported products. Congressional trade debates in the 19th century often pitted Members from northern manufacturing regions, who benefitted from high tariffs, against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions, who gained from and advocated for low tariffs. ", "A major shift in U.S. trade policy occurred after Congress passed the highly protective \"Smoot-Hawley\" Tariff Act of 1930 (P.L. 71-361), which, by raising U.S. tariff rates to an all-time high level, led U.S. trading partners to respond in kind. In response, world trade declined rapidly, exacerbating the impact of the Great Depression. Since passage of this tariff act, Congress has delegated certain trade authority to the executive branch. First, Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934 (P.L. 73-316), which authorized the President to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within congressionally preapproved levels, and to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation. Congress has renewed this authority periodically. Second, Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1974 aimed at opening markets and establishing non-discriminatory international trade for nontariff barriers as well. Because changes in nontariff barriers in reciprocal bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements usually involve amending U.S. law, the agreements require congressional approval and implementing legislation. Congress has renewed and amended the 1974 Act many times, which includes fast-track trade negotiating authority, now called trade promotion authority (TPA). ", "Congress also exercises trade policy authority through its oversight responsibilities and the enactment of laws authorizing trade programs and governing trade policy generally. These include such areas as U.S. trade agreement negotiations; tariffs; nontariff barriers; trade remedies; import and export policies; economic sanctions; and the trade policy functions of the federal government. In addition, Congress oversees the implementation of trade policies, programs, and agreements. ", "Congress has an important role in international investment and finance as well. It has authority over bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and the level of U.S. financial commitments to the multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the World Bank, and to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also authorizes the activities of such agencies as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Congress has oversight responsibilities over these institutions, as well as the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, whose activities affect international capital flows. Congress also closely monitors developments in international financial markets that could affect the U.S. economy, such as the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["During the first session of the 113th Congress, while overshadowed by other legislative priorities, including federal budget issues, trade and trade policy issues were the subject of active congressional interest, including through oversight committee hearings, if not direct legislative action.

They include: renewal of trade promotion authority (TPA); potential trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and also expanded agreements in information technology products and trade facilitation under the WTO; U.S.-China trade relations; international finance issues; review of the U.S. export control regime; reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank; and reauthorization of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and expiring trade preference programs.

These obligations include adhering to congressionally-defined trade policy negotiating objectives, as well as congressional notification and consultation requirements before, during, and after the completion of the negotiation process. The primary purpose of TPA is to preserve the constitutional role of Congress with respect to consideration of implementing legislation for trade agreements that require changes in domestic law, while also bolstering the negotiating credibility of the executive branch by ensuring that the trade agreements will not be changed once concluded. Since first enacted in the Trade Act of 1974, TPA has been renewed multiple times, with the latest grant of authority expiring on July 1, 2007. ", "In light of TPA's special provisions governing trade agreement implementing bills, many consider its renewal as necessary to approve and implement new trade agreements. Others question whether TPA is necessary to pass trade implementing bills and note that it is not a prerequisite for initiating or concluding trade agreement negotiations. Some experts argue that TPA would have to be renewed if the United States is to be a credible negotiator in concluding proposed trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a Trade in International Services Agreement (TISA), future WTO agreements, and other future trade agreements. It can also be argued that while the Obama Administration has been notifying and consulting Congress on these negotiations per previous TPA requirements, Congress has not formally expressed its views in the form of new or updated legislative negotiating objectives for trade agreements, which have been an important part of previous TPA/fast-track authorities.

The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO on January 1, 1995, and the new rules and trade liberalization agreements that occurred as a result of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), first established in 1947.", "The WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, begun in November 2001, has remained deadlocked for several years. However, WTO Members at 9th Ministerial Conference held in Bali, Indonesia on December 3-7, 2013, agreed to a package of trade facilitation, agriculture, and development measures. Though modest in scope, it represents the first successful conclusion of a negotiation in the WTO's nearly 20-year history. The accord has three components: ", "Trade facilitation. Members agreed to a package that would impose binding disciplines on issues concerning the process of trade: freedom of transit, fees and formalities associated with the import and export of goods, and transparency and publication of goods. These provisions are designed to reduce transaction costs and to improve efficiencies, especially with regard to trade with and between developing countries. The accord places binding disciplines on developing countries to implement these reforms. While wealthy donor countries and international organizations have pledged funds to least-developed countries (LDCs) to implement these reforms, the agreement itself places no obligations on Member states to provide assistance. Agriculture. Members agreed to a compromise on so-called food security issues. This agreement would exempt food stockpiling programs, especially for developing countries, subject to certain transparency requirements, from dispute settlement until a permanent solution to the relationship between these programs and trade-distorting subsidy limitations in the WTO Agriculture Agreement is negotiated. Members also agreed to provisions concerning the administration of tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) and recommitted themselves to negotiate the parallel elimination of export subsidies. Development Issues. The Members agreed to a package of items to enhance trade with least-developed countries (LDCs). The agreement contained: a commitment to develop simplified preferential rules-of-origin for LDCs; a \"services waiver\" to grant LDCs greater access to the services markets of developed countries; a commitment to negotiate duty-free, quota-free access to LDCs; and a commitment to improve market access for cotton from LDCs.", "The agreement also directed the WTO secretariat to develop a clearly defined work program to complete the Doha Round within the next 12 months. This task remains formidable. The negotiations have been characterized by persistent differences among the United States, the European Union, and advanced developing countries on major issues, such as agriculture, industrial tariffs and nontariff barriers, services, and trade remedies.

Services have been an important priority in U.S. foreign trade and trade policy and of global trade in general, although their intangibility, the requirement for direct buyer-provider contact, and other characteristics have limited the types and volume of services that can be traded. Advances in information technology and the related growth of trans-national supply and production networks have reduced these barriers making an expanding range of services tradable across national borders.

They argue that if China's currency is undervalued, it acts as a subsidy conveyed to Chinese exporters while constituting an additional trade barrier to U.S. exports to China. Some U.S. policymakers contend that China's currency policy has been a major contributor to large annual U.S. bilateral trade deficits with China ($315 billion in 2012) and the extensive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. In addition, some economists claim that China's currency policy induces other countries to intervene similarly in currency markets.

From June 2010 through the end of November 2013, the RMB has appreciated 12.2% against the dollar. (However, the RMB appreciated very little in 2012 and during the first 11 months of 2013.) In an October 2013 report, the Department of the Treasury stated that the RMB remained significantly undervalued.", "Several bills have been introduced over the past few years to address China's currency policy, some of which would have increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese products or sought to apply U.S. trade remedy measures against countries (such as China) deemed to have a currency that was fundamentally misaligned. Supporters contend that the RMB remains significantly undervalued against the dollar and that pressure needs to be applied to China to induce it to adopt a more market-based currency regime. Opponents argue that such legislation, if enacted, would likely have little impact on the U.S. economy, would worsen trade relations with China, and could later be found to be inconsistent with U.S. WTO commitments.

One highlighted by the Chinese media was that the market would now play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources in the economy. This was in contrast to previous statements that the market was a \"basic\" means of allocating economic resources.

Should Congress decide to renew their authorities, the length of reauthorization may be debated. On one hand, a multi-year or permanent authorization could enhance these agencies' long-term planning capacity and ability to assure businesses of the stability of their programs. On the other hand, shorter-term renewals could permit enhanced congressional oversight. Congress also may consider broader issues. For instance, in terms of the international context, Congress could examine U.S. economic competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the officially-backed export and investment financing provided by other countries, as well as the adequacy of current international disciplines for trade finance to which large emerging economies such as China, Brazil, and India, do not adhere.

In addition, it clarifies that BIT obligations apply to state-owned enterprises (SOEs); includes language further limiting performance requirements; clarifies labor and environmental provisions; clarifies which financial services provisions may fall under a prudential exception (such as to address balance of payments problems); and expands transparency obligations, among other provisions. The conclusion of the Model BIT review may generate momentum to conclude previously-launched negotiations with countries such as China and India, or to launch investment negotiations with other U.S. trading partners. For example, President Obama announced in July 2013 efforts to explore an investment treaty with the East African Community (EAC), building upon the U.S.-EAC Trade and Investment Partnership announced in June 2012. Investment policy issues also feature prominently in U.S. trade negotiations, including the current proposed TPP, where investor-state dispute settlement issues have been particularly controversial. They may be addressed in the TTIP negotiations as well, given the high level of transatlantic investment and U.S. and EU interest in using TTIP to signal the importance of investment protections to third countries.

To cover increased lending, the IMF and the MDBs sought new donor resources. At several G-20 summits, world leaders committed to ensure sufficient resources for the IFIs to support their macroeconomic stability and development mandates.

If enacted, they would increase the institution's core source of funding and expand the representation of major emerging market countries, such as Brazil, India, China, and Mexico. In order for key elements of the reform package to take effect, IMF rules dictate that the reforms must be approved by three-fifths of IMF members (113) representing 85% of the total voting power. Under this formula, approval by the United States is essential because it controls 16.75% of the voting power. Under U.S. law, congressional authorization is required for the United States to consent to change the U.S. quota in the IMF, which determines the U.S. share of total voting power. Furthermore, depending on the budgetary treatment of any newly-authorized U.S. contributions to the IMF, appropriations may be required.", "To date, a majority of IMF member countries have approved these reforms, but the United States has not.

The official G-20 statement released at the end of the summit focused on a wide range of economic issues, including trade, investment, jobs, financial regulation, and corruption. However, foreign policy issues, most notably the situation in Syria, were reported to have dominated the informal discussions. Some analysts are now calling for a more formal foreign policy track in the G-20, similar to the set-up of the G-7/G-8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United States, plus Russia).

Concerns about debt levels have been compounded by weaknesses in the Eurozone banking system, slow or negative growth, high unemployment, and persistent trade imbalances within the Eurozone. The financial crisis also became a political crisis, provoking large scale protests and directly or indirectly leading to the fall of several governments in Europe.", "European leaders and institutions have pursued a number of policies to stem contagion of the crisis. The European Central Bank took unprecedented steps to increase liquidity in the Eurozone banking system, Eurozone governments and the IMF provided financial assistance packages to countries in crisis, and governments implemented several rounds of austerity programs, among other measures. The intense market pressure facing Eurozone countries abated through most of 2013, and economic conditions in some crisis countries, particularly Ireland, have improved.

After unsuccessful attempts to find a mutually acceptable solution to restructuring the debt, Argentina abandoned the negotiation process and made two bond exchange offers in 2005 and 2010 that were accepted by 92% of private creditors. This outcome left debt held by hedge funds and members of the Paris Club of countries, including the United States, in default. The offers flaunted normal restructuring procedures, and, as a result, Argentina faces prolonged litigation by holdout creditors that have resulted in judgments and attachment orders. In addition, Argentina has adopted policies that have caused increased tension with foreign states and companies. These include failure to pay judgments against Argentina in the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), nationalization of a largely Spanish-owned oil company, increasingly protectionist trade measures, capital and exchange rate controls, import taxes, and failure to submit to an IMF Article IV economic review required of all Fund members. ", "Some U.S. policymakers remain frustrated at Argentina's reluctance to settle with U.S. stakeholders and alter other policies. The United States has taken a number of financial actions against Argentina, including suspension of GSP benefits, voting against loans to Argentina in the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, and denying bilateral aid. Previous congresses have introduced resolutions calling for Argentina's membership in the G-20 to be conditioned on adherence to international norms of economic behavior and various versions of the Judgment Evading Foreign States Accountability Act, which would have attempted to pressure Argentina in a number of ways.
