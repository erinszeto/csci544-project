The ACA created a new mandatory funding source for the NHSC\u2014the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), which was intended to supplement the program's annual appropriation. However, between FY2012 and FY2017, the CHCF entirely replaced the NHSC's discretionary appropriation. For FY2018, the NHSC received $105 million from discretionary appropriations in P.L. 115-141 to support awards to expand and improve access to opioid and other substance use disorder treatment providers.

The number of awards the NHSC makes is only one component of program size, because not all awardees are currently serving as NHSC providers; some are still completing their training (e.g., scholarship award recipients). As such, the NHSC also measures its field strength: the number of NHSC providers who are fulfilling a service obligation in a HPSA in a given year. In FY2017, total NHSC field strength was 10,179.

Under each of these programs, health providers receive either scholarships or loan repayments in exchange for a service commitment at an NHSC-approved facility located in a federally designated health professional shortage area (HPSA, see text box). Participants in the state loan repayment programs may also serve in state-designated shortage areas; federal program participants may not. NHSC-approved facilities are generally nonprofit or government-operated (federal, state, local, and tribal) organizations that provide care to patients without regard for the patient's ability to pay.", "The three NHSC programs are managed by the Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) in the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA), an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The NHSC was created by the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 to provide an adequate supply of trained health providers in federally designated HPSAs. Since the program's inception, Congress has reauthorized and revised the program several times, with the most recent reauthorization included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , ACA). The ACA permanently reauthorized the NHSC, creating, among other things, a mandatory funding stream for the program and implementing a part-time option, which allows part-time service in exchange for an extended service commitment.

The federal scholarship program provides scholarships in exchange for a service commitment at the end of a recipient's education, including any training required before licensure. The two loan repayment programs provide clinicians with loan repayment in exchange for an immediate service commitment. HRSA administers the federal scholarship and loan repayment programs and provides funds to states. States match these funds to operate state loan repayment programs. The largest program is the federal loan repayment program, followed by the state loan repayment program, and then the scholarship program. ", "The section below describes these three programs. The discussion focuses on program differences; however, the programs share a number of common elements. Specifically, all three programs require a minimum service commitment of two years in a HPSA. All are restricted to U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals, and all provide awards that are exempt from federal income and employment taxes. In addition, all three programs allow physicians, dentists, physician assistants, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners to participate, but the loan repayment programs also permit additional provider types to participate.

Eligible schools/programs include medical schools (allopathic and osteopathic), physician assistant programs, dental schools, and advance practice nursing schools. Individuals must agree to complete their training (including residency training or required clinical hours, where applicable) in primary care . For each year of scholarship support received (or partial year after the first year), students must agree to provide an additional year of service in a HPSA. For example, if a full-time service scholar receives three years of scholarship support the scholar would owe three years of full-time service at an approved facility. The number of school years of NHSC scholarship support received by the scholar may not exceed four school years. As such, through the scholarship program, the maximum required years of full-time service at an approved facility is four years. ", "NHSC scholars begin their service commitment upon the completion of training, including any advance clinical training needed for licensure (e.g., primary care residency for physicians). Participants must also have obtained a professional license, certificate, or registration before beginning their service commitment. NHSC scholars must fulfill their service commitment on a full-time basis and are required to fulfill their service commitment in a HPSA of \"greatest need.\" Each year HRSA determines the HPSA score indicative of \"greatest need.\" For example, from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017, NHSC scholars must work at NHSC-approved service sites with a HPSA score of 17 or above for their discipline (e.g., a dental scholar is required to serve in an area with a dental HPSA score above 17). Individuals participating in the federal loan repayment program may serve part-time and may serve in areas with lower HPSA scores, but scholars may not.

Historically, the NHSC had been exclusively funded as part of HRSA's discretionary appropriation.

The ACA created the CHCF and provided mandatory funding for it over a five-year period (FY2011-FY2015). The fund was intended to supplement the NHSC budget; however, from FY2012 to FY2017, it made up the entirety of the program's funding.

At the start of FY2018, no mandatory funds had been appropriated for the NHSC; however, a temporary extension ( P.L. 115-96 ) ultimately provided mandatory funding for the first two quarters of FY2018, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123 ) later provided full-year funding for FY2018 and FY2019.

Field strength is a measure of both the NHSC appropriation, which affects the number of awards that can be made, and the relative balance between scholarships and loan repayment, both in the current fiscal year and in the past. The NHSC field strength has increased in recent years as the number of awards made has increased (see Figure 1 ). As of April 2018, HRSA data indicate that there were 8,256 total providers. The majority of these individuals (7,620) were loan repayors, which reflects the NHSC's prioritization of clinicians who will undertake their service commitment immediately in HPSAs. In contrast, HRSA makes scholarship awards in an earlier year, so the funding investment is not realized for several years, as the scholar completes his or her schooling and required training.

These specifications in the law may avert a number of the potential concerns that exist with other efforts to expand NHSC eligible provider types or sites. Specifically, because the number of applicants applying for awards exceeds the funding available, past efforts to expand provider eligibility have been met with concerns that it would increase competition for the program unless there was an increase in appropriations. Moreover, adding new provider types or site type does not guarantee that newly eligible clinicians or sites would receive awards, because there are no quotas for specific numbers of providers by discipline; however, the changes in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), specify that funds be used to support the newly added providers. Generally, NHSC awards are made competitively, with scholarships generally awarded based on participant characteristics (e.g., the participant's commitment to primary care practice and the likelihood of remaining in a shortage area after the NHSC service commitment has ended). Loan repayment awards are made based on the HPSA score of the site and on the loan repayment program participant's characteristics.

For example, exchanges among the Secretary of HHS and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees seem to suggest that Congress recognizes the Secretary's authority to include additional disciplines in the NHSC without congressional action. For example, in 2012, the Senate Appropriations Committee urged the Secretary to offer loan repayments to pharmacists and chiropractors through the NHSC.", "Despite what appeared at that time to be congressional support for administrative action, in 2013, the Secretary declined to include pharmacists on the list of eligible NHSC providers. The Secretary's response to this request from the Senate Appropriations Committee was based on an interpretation that pharmacy and chiropractor services would be outside of the core intent of the NHSC to provide \"primary health services.\" ", "In 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee again raised the issue of the Secretary's authority to add pharmacists, which are sometimes part of primary care teams; however, these providers remain ineligible for loan repayment. Similar conversations have occurred between HHS and the House Appropriations Committee regarding optometry.", "In each of these instances, HHS has not agreed to expand the program's eligibility out of concern that doing so would shift the program away from its traditional focus of providing primary care to underserved populations. HHS also emphasized that the program is currently competitive and that adding new disciplines as eligible could redirect NHSC funds away from already identified clinical shortage areas and add new ones. Another concern is that adding new providers may limit the total number of individuals served by the NHSC because the new provider types (e.g., optometrists and chiropractors) serve a narrower subset of the population than do primary care providers. ", "Despite debates on expanding the clinicians eligible for the NHSC, Congress has, at times, clarified the range of eligible providers. For example, the 21 st Century Cures Act, enacted in 2016, clarified that adolescent and child psychiatrists are eligible to participate in the federal loan repayment program. This law, however, did not expand the list of NHSC providers.

As of August 2017, 45 NHSC providers were serving at CAHs. HRSA requires that these providers split their time between inpatient services at the CAH (up to 24 hours per week) and outpatient services at CAH affiliated-outpatient clinics (not less than 16 hours per week).", "NHSC providers are located at HPSAs throughout the United States and its territories (see Figure 4 ).
