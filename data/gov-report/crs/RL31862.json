It compares a cross section of labor codes of conduct utilized by U.S. corporations andtheir suppliers that manufacture toys, shoes, apparel, and other labor intensive merchandise in Chinafor export. Many consumer goods imported from China to the United States are produced by HongKong, Taiwanese, and South Korean factories in China for U.S. brands. Serious labor rights abuseshave been reported in many of these factories. All of the codes sampled in this report mandate laborstandards that are consistent with International Labor Organization core covenants and China's LaborLaw. The standards compared in this report pertain to: child labor, forced labor, disciplinary actions,discrimination, health and safety, and the environment.

During times of peak demand, work days of 12-to16-hours, no days off for several weeks, and managers' under-reporting of hours worked have beenwidely alleged. Most workers are reluctant to protest such treatment because they fear being firedand/or losing back wages, benefits, security deposits, or temporary residency permits that areretained by the employer. Furthermore, many workers are unaware of their legal rights. LocalChinese reporters have estimated that each year, dozens of workers die of causes related tooverwork.

Lack of compliance with these codes may justify thetermination of contracts by U.S. corporate buyers. These standards are based upon United Nationsand ILO core labor conventions and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)regulations. There are three broad categories: \"multi-stakeholder\" or external codes developed bynon-profit organizations in consultation with labor and business groups; individual corporate codes; and industry or sector codes. (15) Multi-stakeholderprograms that not only monitor suppliers but alsocertify U.S. companies may generate additional public pressures on corporations to conform withinternational labor rights standards. Although codes vary somewhat, they generally mandatestandards at or above the levels of national labor laws. China's labor laws meet internationalbenchmarks in most respects. Often the main problem or variable is not the stringency of thestandards but rather the level of enforcement. However, not all codes apply rigorous methods formonitoring and effecting compliance. Some experts argue that third party, non-profit auditors aremore effective in monitoring compliance than in-house and for-profit auditors. (16) Independentmonitoring organizations in China include Bureau Veritas, Global Social Compliance, IntertekTesting Services, and Verit\u00c3\u00a9.", "Labor codes of conduct have reportedly produced improvements in some large factories that fear losing contracts to large U.S. corporations for violating labor standards. (17) However, some laborrights groups have found monitoring and verification problems stemming from insufficienttransparency, including lack of unannounced audits, lack of input from workers through off-site,confidential interviews (without fear of retribution), and lack of accessibility or disclosure of auditsand assessment scores. (18) Furthermore, largesuppliers often subcontract further to smaller foreignor Chinese companies that have no code of conduct. Only one of the codes sampled in this reportaddresses the problem of subcontracting. The Disney Company's Code of Conduct forbids itsmanufacturers from using subcontractors without the company's written consent, in order to assureboth acceptable labor conditions and product quality. According to some accounts, labor conditionsin privately-owned PRC factories are worse than FIEs. ", "The financial incentives of suppliers in China to abide by codes of conduct -- attracting or maintaining the business of U.S. corporations -- are often negated by countervailing economicpressures. First, the overabundance of migrant labor from the Chinese countryside suppresses wagesin low-skill and labor intensive, export-oriented industries. Since the late 1990s, real incomes inmany rural areas have fallen while the PRC Ministry of Labor estimates that 20% of farmers arejobless or redundant. Second, export manufacturing zones in China have proliferated, andcompetition for foreign investment has grown, thus pressuring local governments to keep laboractivism to a minimum. Third, the global markets in these sectors have become more exacting. TheHong Kong Christian Industrial Committee reported, for example, that in the past decade, intenseglobal competition in the toy industry has shortened delivery times that multinational corporationsdemand of their contractors by approximately 40%, and driven down prices by 30%, therebyexacerbating labor exploitation despite efforts to improve conditions.
