The BNP has been led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia; the AL has been led by Sheikh Hasina. In the years since independence, Bangladesh has established a reputation as a largely moderate and democratic majority Muslim country. This status has been under threat from a combination of political violence, weak governance, poverty, corruption, and Islamist militancy. When in opposition, both parties have sought to regain control of the government through demonstrations, labor strikes, and transport blockades.", "Bangladesh is now ruled by a military-backed caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed that appears unlikely to relinquish power until at least the end of 2008. It is pursuing an anti-corruption drive that has challenged the usual political elites. It is also seeking to put in place voter reforms, including issuing identity cards, and has moved against militant Islamists. Although there is some concern that the new military-backed caretaker government may be reluctant to relinquish power, it has presented a roadmap for new elections and a return to democracy in Bangladesh.", "Bangladesh's status as a secular and moderate state, as well as its democratic process, has been jeopardized as a result of the approach taken by the two main political parties and by the takeover of government by a military-backed caretaker government. Further, there is concern that should Bangladesh become a failed state, or a state with increased influence by Islamist extremists, it could increasingly serve as a base of operations for terrorist activity.", "Political violence has become part of the political landscape in Bangladesh under previous governments. A.M.S. Kibria, a finance minister in a previous Awami League government, and four others were killed in a bomb attack that also injured 70 at a political rally of the Awami League in early 2005. In mid 2004, an apparent political assassination attempt on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina at a political rally in Dhaka killed 22.

Since, it has embarked on an anti-corruption drive and has pledged to return Bangladesh to democracy by holding elections by the end of the 2008.

In 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Bangladesh had over 32 Tcf of undiscovered reserves. Natural gas accounts for 80% of Bangladesh's commercial energy consumption. Though there have been negotiations to build a pipeline to export gas to India these have not come to fruition. Instead, the Bangladesh government appears to have focused on meeting Bangladesh's current and future energy needs.
