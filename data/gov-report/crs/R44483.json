China has also cited its desire to reduce domestic air pollution and carbon emissions by increasing the proportion of natural gas and lowering the proportion of coal in its overall energy consumption. China's entry into the Central Asian energy market has posed perhaps the biggest challenge to Russian dominance in the region.", "China's primary Central Asian supplier of natural gas is Turkmenistan, where state-owned CNPC has major investments in gas fields, including the Bagtyyarlyk and Galkynysh fields. Uzbekistan began supplying natural gas to China in mid-2012 and Kazakhstan began shipments to China in 2014.", "Central Asian natural gas is transported to China via the Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines (CACGP). Two main lines, Lines A and B, run from eastern Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to the border with China's Xinjiang region. Spanning a distance of 1,130 miles, they entered operation in December 2009 and October 2010 respectively. A 1,143 mile-long Line C, running parallel to Lines A and B, began operations in 2014. Line D, running from Turkmenistan to China through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, is intended to help boost Turkmen gas shipments to China to 65 BCM per year, a level the two countries agreed to in Beijing in May 2014. Construction on Line D began in 2014. Line D was originally scheduled to enter operation by 2016, but the general manager of CACGP has been quoted stating that the pipeline will in fact be completed \"by the end of 2020.\" According to CNPC, the overall delivery capacity for lines A, B, and C is now 55 BCM per year.", "At the Kazakhstan-China border, the CACGP connects with West-East pipelines that carry the gas to central China and China's east coast. Three such pipelines are currently in operation. China is reportedly planning at least two more. Together, the Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines and China's West-East pipelines make up the longest natural gas pipelines in the world."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Sources of Pipeline Supplies", "paragraphs": ["China started receiving natural gas from Burma in 2013. On May 21, 2014, the Chinese and Russian presidents announced that they had reached agreement on a 30-year deal for Russia to supply China with natural gas (valued roughly at $400 billion at the time) through a new pipeline slated for completion in 2018. As the two countries have announced previous deals that never materialized, some industry analysts have questioned the announcement, particularly as the oil price basket linked to the contract has dropped by more than 50%. If completed, the Russia-China pipeline is expected to provide China with 38 BCM of Russian natural gas annually, starting in 2018. China and Russia signed a second deal in November 2014 for an additional 30 BCM. International media reports, however, have suggested that low energy prices and uncertainty about China's economic future will lead to a scaling-down of these plans, with one private sector source claiming that China and Russia will likely \"postpone the project commissioning into the late 2020s.\"", "As noted above, on May 12, 2014, the Turkmen and Chinese presidents announced an agreement whereby Turkmenistan will increase its supply of natural gas to China to 65 BCM of gas annually by 2016. The Burma pipeline, completed in October 2013, is expected to deliver 10 BCM annually. Some analysts have suggested that the Russia-China pipeline deal may give China more leverage in negotiations over pricing of its LNG imports, potentially driving down LNG prices in Asia and affecting the bottom line for LNG exporters.

In a November 2013 report, one analyst opined, however, that, \"While the economics of U.S. LNG exports to China may make sense in the current low-price environment, the prospects for this trade remain doubtful. Even if exports to China were to be approved by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Beijing may view buying these supplies as fostering an unacceptable level of energy dependence on the U.S.\"", "DOE permits are not exclusive by country, but are either for countries with which the United States has a free trade agreement or not. Permits to export natural gas to free trade partners are expedited in the DOE process. Factors that may give China pause about significant imports of U.S. LNG include Chinese wariness of the U.S. strategic rebalance to Asia, strains with the United States over Chinese actions in the East China Sea and South China Sea, and tensions sparked by allegations and counter-allegations related to cyber security. The cancellation of CNOOC's bid to buy California-based energy company Unocal in 2005 remains an issue. However, greater energy interdependence may broaden cooperation.", "LNG exports to China were raised during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing in January 2015. In a response to a question from Senator Maria Cantwell about U.S. natural gas prices and manufacturing, Paul Cicio, President of Industrial Energy Consumers of America, stated that China was paying a high price for imported natural gas, and then heavily subsidizing the cost of that gas for its manufacturers. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Angus King raised concern that such policies might be giving Chinese manufacturers a significant competitive advantage in energy costs over U.S. companies, at a cost to U.S. manufacturing jobs, and thus questioned whether LNG exports to China were in U.S. interests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chinese FDI in United States", "paragraphs": ["China's oil and gas firms have made a number of large U.S. acquisitions in recent years.

China's government expects its overall energy consumption to grow in 2016, with natural gas rising to 6.2% of primary energy needs. (See Figure 9 .) Part of the slowdown in consumption growth is attributed to the sluggish economy. In November 2015, China cut natural gas prices to spur demand.", "Predictions of future growth in gas consumption vary. The deputy head of CNPC's Economic and Technology Research Institute projected 7.3 % growth for 2016, while the deputy head of CNOOC's Economic and Technology Institute projected between 4.5% and 5% growth. The large differences in projections by the two companies reflect the difficulty in obtaining good data on Chinese natural gas consumption.", "A 2014 study used a regression model to estimate residential gas price and income elasticities in Chinese urban centers. The study found that the price elasticity of natural gas was much more negative in northern China than in southern China\u2014in other words, a rise in gas prices would be expected to cause much larger consumption declines in northern cities than in southern ones. The authors suggested that this was due to the widespread availability of coal in the north, which can be easily substituted for gas in most cases.", "Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have been one of the major factors behind the fast growth in gas usage in China, chiefly because of their cost competitiveness, although NGV users have encountered severe problems at filling stations during winter's chronic gas shortages. By the end of 2013, China already had some 3,000 LNG and compressed natural gas (CNG) refilling stations, supporting some 80,000 LNG vehicles, with about 40% located in the north and 20% in the northwest of the country. Based on the government plan for China's automobile industry, the number of natural gas-fueled vehicles is expected to reach 1.2 million by 2020. To accommodate such development, China would need to increase the number of natural gas filling stations to 12,000 by 2015, including 10,000 CNG outlets and 2,000 LNG stations, the plan says. According to the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC), China had approximately 3,800 CNG filling stations and 3,100 LNG filling stations in 2015.

Coal emissions were approximately 84%. Chinese policymakers face pressure to clean up the coal industry, not only for reasons related to greenhouse gas emissions but also due to public health concerns from conventional pollutants. A 2014 study at Beijing's Tsinghua University suggested that coal and other sources of small-particulate emissions were responsible for 670,000 premature deaths per year throughout the country.", "The future of natural gas depends greatly on the degree to which Chinese policymakers address these problems. \"Whether or not China will further increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix depends on how fast the government wants to solve air pollution,\" according to Lin Boqiang, Director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at China's Xiamen University.", "Some analysts believe that increasing domestic production and imports of natural gas to China could have benefits for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this view, Chinese natural gas imports could help reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by, for instance, limiting the use of coal in China's electric power sector. Many of China's coal-fired power facilities are older than 20 years and lack the pollution controls of more modern plants. CNPC argues that the 55 BCM of natural gas that China now imports through the Central Asia-China Gas Pipelines allows China to substitute natural gas use for 73 million tons of standard coal use annually, \"cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons each year, respectively.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
