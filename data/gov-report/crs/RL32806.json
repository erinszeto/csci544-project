Testimonial privileges are exceptions to this rule; they are generally granted to allow concealment of communications made in confidence between persons holding certain relationships that have been deemed worthy of protection. Testimonial privileges are generally granted by common law or by statute; these include the lawyer-client and the doctor-patient privileges. There is also one testimonial privilege expressly granted in the United States Constitution: the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"", "Absent a statutory or constitutional recognition of journalists' privilege, a reporter may be compelled to testify in legal, administrative, or other governmental proceedings. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have recognized a journalists' privilege through enactment of press \"shield laws,\" which protect the relationship between reporters, their source, and sometimes, the information that may be communicated in that relationship. Another 16 states have recognized a journalists' privilege through court decisions; Wyoming is the only state that has no legislatively or judicially adopted journalists' privilege. The journalists' privilege is distinct from other recognized privileges in that it vests only with the journalist, not with the source of the information.", "In Branzburg v. Hayes , 408 U.S. 665 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled for the first and only time on a claim of journalists' privilege. It held that journalists have no constitutional privilege to refuse to testify before a grand jury, unless the grand jury investigation was \"instituted or conducted other than in good faith.\" Id . at 707. The court reasoned that the public's interest in prosecuting crime outweighed its interest in journalists' being permitted to preserve their confidential relationships.", "In Branzburg , the Supreme Court noted that there was \"merit in leaving state legislatures free, within First Amendment limits, to fashion their own standards\" regarding journalists' privilege. Id . at 706. In addition, the court noted that \"[i]t goes without saying, of course, that we are powerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a newsman's privilege, either qualified or absolute.\" Id . It is with that understanding that, since Branzburg , 49 states and the District of Columbia have either enacted legislation or issued court rulings protecting the press, to varying degrees, from unfettered disclosure of sources, work product, and information generally.", "The various state statutes range in scope, from broad protections that provide an absolute journalistic privilege, to shield laws that offer a qualified privilege. The majority of state shield laws offer some form of a qualified privilege to reporters, protecting source information in judicial settings, unless the compelling party can establish that the information is (i) relevant or material; (ii) unavailable by other means, or through other sources; and (iii) that a compelling need exists for that information. States may vary this last prong, with some requiring the compelling party to establish whether the need exists as to the party's case, and others whether the need serves a broader public policy.", "Although the vast majority of states protect a confidential source's identity, a number of states also protect a reporter's notes, outtakes, or work product. A small minority of states further protect a reporter's personal observations.", "In addition to addressing what is covered, states differ as to who is covered and under what situations they are covered. For instance, many states require that a newsperson must be professionally engaged in the dissemination of information to the public, while other states use broader definitions of what constitutes a press person and may include individuals who are freelancers, authors, electronic publishers, or educators. Some states further require that, in order to qualify as a member of the news media, evidence or records must be kept documenting actual publication or broadcast, especially when radio or television media are concerned.", "Finally, Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that, in civil cases that arise under state law but are brought in federal court, privileges shall be determined \"in accordance with State law.\" It also provides that, in federal courts, \"the privilege of a witness ... shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. The federal courts have not resolved whether the common law provides a journalists' privilege.", "The remainder of this report sets forth the full text of the state shield statutes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Shield Statutes", "paragraphs": ["ALABAMA (Ala.
