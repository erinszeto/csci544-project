Other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to American allies and friendly states, some of which faced Soviet or Soviet-proxy threats. Aid programs also were used to help the United States gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy American armed forces. Diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the Soviet threat.", "Foreign aid and diplomatic programs also supported a number of secondary U.S. policy goals in the developing world, such as reducing high rates of population growth, promoting wider access to health care, expanding the availability of basic education, advancing U.S. trade interests, and protecting the environment.

Many applaud the restructuring initiative as marking the beginning of what they perceive as a long overdue effort to reform a cumbersome and fragmented U.S. foreign assistance program. Some supporters of the plan, however, believe it does not go far enough and that the Administration is missing an opportunity for launching a much bolder, and necessary reform effort. Some critics have expressed strong concern that the new initiative may lead to a greater degree of aid politicization and that USAID will be further marginalized as a key decision maker of U.S. development policy.

The FY2007 request proposed a $192 million, or 44% increase in agriculture activities. USAID officials have argued for a number of years that this sector has been under-funded, with demands in developing countries far out-pacing available resources. Congressional directives for higher spending on other sectors, they contend, have squeezed the amount of resources available for agriculture. Nevertheless, the entire increase for agriculture in FY2007 was scheduled for Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving other nations at or below FY2006 levels. Conflict Management increase targets Sudan. A 17.6% rise in the FY2007 request for the conflict management sector was due to a proposed $40 million increase\u2014to $60 million\u2014for activities in Sudan. HIV/AIDS funds re-distributed. While HIV/AIDS resources for non-focus countries channeled through CSH account were cut slightly in the FY2007 request, overall resources in Foreign Operations to fight the AIDS pandemic were up significantly in the proposed budget ( Table 7 ). Nevertheless, the FY2007 request continues a fundamental disagreement between the executive branch and Congress over the appropriate size of a U.S. contribution to the multilateral Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Administration has proposed in every year since FY2003 either $200 million or $300 million for the Global Fund, while Congress has appropriated amounts ranging between $350 million and $550 million (including funds provided in the Labor/HHS appropriations measure). For FY2007, the Administration again requested $300 million for the Global Fund (with $100 million requested in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill), while boosting amounts for the 15 focus countries from $1.335 billion to $2.136 billion. The House-passed foreign operations bill provided $444.5 million for the Global Fund, while the House-passed Labor/HHS bill did not include the President's request.

The category of other infectious diseases\u2014which mainly includes funding for malaria, tuberculosis, and recently to combat the anticipated avian influenza pandemic\u2014would rise by $86 million, or 28% in FY2007. In mid-2005, President Bush announced a plan to provide $1.2 billion in additional funding through FY2010 for malaria. The FY2007 request of $223 million for malaria represented the second year of the plan that would increase from three to seven focus countries next year. The FY2007 also included $55 million to deal with international aspects of avian flu. The House-passed bill did not fully fund the President's Malaria Initiative, cutting it by $47 million. The bill also did not provide the Administration's $55 million request for Avian Influenza, perhaps reflecting the inclusion of $2.3 billion in the FY2006 emergency supplemental. The Senate bill provided the Administration's request for malaria and avian flu.", "Basic education allocation for FY2006 exceeds congressional directive but FY2007 shifts funds to strategic countries. One of the highest congressional development assistance priorities in recent years has been basic education programs. In most years, Congress has increased significantly levels proposed by the Administration. This was the case for FY2006, where lawmakers increased the executive's $341 million request to $465 million. Ultimately, however, the Administration allocated $520 million for basic education in FY2006 and proposed $456 million for FY2007, nearly meeting the level directed by Congress for FY2006. The FY2007 request, however, marked a significant shift in resources away from Africa and Latin America in order to increase programs in more strategic countries, including Afghanistan and Jordan ( Table 8 ). The House bill reiterated congressional support for basic education programs, providing $550 million. The Senate bill recommended $455.7 million for basic education, and consolidated funds from ESF, SEED, FSA, and ACI under the Development Assistance account.", "Family planning funds reduced. For the first time during the Bush Administration, the executive branch sought less than $425 million for international family planning and reproductive health programs. Consistently one of the most controversial policy elements of the Foreign Operations spending bill, family planning programs generally have been supported by Congress with larger appropriations, ranging between $432 million and $480 million in recent years. In defending the request for $357 million, USAID Administrator Tobias told the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee that family planning remains a \"very big priority\" of the Agency, but that with the increases for malaria and avian flu, funding trade-offs among various health activities were necessary. Instead, the House provided $432 million for international family planning. Another $34 million would be available for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) if it is deemed eligible for U.S. assistance.

The requests of $3 billion for each of the past two years fall well below the $5 billion target for FY2006 and beyond that the President pledged when he announced the initiative in March 2002. The MCC's Board of Directors selected 23 countries to participate in the program in FY2004-FY2006, and the Corporation has signed eight agreements, or Compacts, with Madagascar, Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Georgia, Benin, Vanuatu, and Armenia between April 2005 and May 2006.", "Some Members of Congress, however, believe the initiative has started more slowly than they had anticipated, spending only small amounts of the roughly $3.7 billion appropriated in total for FY2004-FY2006. Increasing the budget of an untested foreign aid program while other traditional development assistance programs are scheduled for reductions in FY2007, they assert, may not be the best allocation of Foreign Operations resources. The MCC, and its new CEO, Ambassador John Danilovich, argue that changes have been made that will accelerate the signing of more Compacts\u2014three have been signed in 2006\u2014and that new Compacts will be larger in size helping the MCC fulfill its vision of being a \"transformational\" development agency. MCC officials said that existing resources were likely to be fully committed by the end of calendar 2006, and that an additional $3 billion was necessary to finance new Compacts signed in FY2007.", "Another concern frequently raised is that additional spending for the MCC comes at the expense of other core development aid accounts. President Bush pledged in 2002 when the MCC concept was first announced that spending on the new initiative would be additional, and not a substitute for existing foreign assistance resources. It is usually impossible to attribute an increase in one program with reductions in others, given the complicated process through which budgets are compiled and the multiple, but not necessarily directly linked, trade-offs that occur. The FY2007 Foreign Operations request is the first budget proposal since establishment of the MCC where Compacts have been signed in countries where USAID maintains programs. In each of these six countries\u2014Armenia, Benin, Honduras, Georgia, Madagascar, and Nicaragua\u2014USAID resources decline. In some cases, decisions to reduce regular aid programs are most likely unrelated to MCC resources.

Funds could also be used to establish a U.S. civilian ground presence in post-conflict situations. In the past, Congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund for which it can apply little oversight. The Administration had asked lawmakers to launch somewhat similar crisis funds in several recent emergency supplemental and Foreign Operations appropriation requests, proposals that were rejected in each case.

The House bill significantly cut funding for debt relief, providing a total of $20 million, while the Senate bill provided $21 million. The Administration argued that such a level would prevent the United States from meeting its commitment to complete bilateral debt reduction for the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the Committee report noted that Congress had provided $200 million over the last three years for debt relief for Congo. The final CR included $64 million. Peacekeeping funds would grow by 16%, mainly to increase funding for the Trans-Sahara Counter-terrorism Initiative, support for the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur, and for operations in Liberia.
