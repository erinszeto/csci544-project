Direct programs have focused largely on scientific research to improve the capability tounderstand climate systems and/or predict climatic change and variability. Energy use has been amajor focus of efforts related to possible climate change because carbon dioxide, the major\"greenhouse gas,\" is added to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. Those efforts, whichsought to reduce oil imports, manage electricity needs, and address environmental concernsincluding climate change, involve many parts of the government. Similarly, climate science effortsin various agencies have sought to expand scientific understanding of the dynamics of climate andits societal consequences as a basis for policy decisions that rely on improved predictions of futureclimate conditions and climate impact assessments. Coordinating these efforts has been challenging.

(4) Thesepolicies have focused heavily on scientificresearch. The Energy Policy Act of 1992, in conjunction with the U.S. ratification of the 1992United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), influenced the direction ofU.S. efforts, which continued in the first Bush and Clinton Administrations toward energy efficiency,renewable energy, and R&D, (5) to try to movetoward reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "The Climate Change Action Plan, designed with the goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and announced in 1993 by the Clinton Administration, included more than 40 on-goingfederal programs to influence, assist, or work with business, state and local governments, scientificand other entities. R&D and other programs since then were largely maintained or modified withsome new activities and names. With evolution from prior efforts, coupled with some augmentation,packages of programs in the Clinton Administration such as the 1997 Climate Change TechnologyInitiative (CCTI) were built upon the earlier efforts, including efforts originally aimed at reducingdependence on oil imports.", "During the preparations for the final negotiations of the December 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, (6) President Clinton announced thethree-stage CCTI on October 22, 1997. (7) It wasdescribed as \"the cornerstone of the [Clinton] Administration's efforts to stimulate the developmentand use of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency products that will help reducegreenhouse gas emissions,\" (8) through a combinationof R&D, and information and tax incentiveprograms. Stage 1 included funding for R&D, tax incentives for early action, a set of federalgovernment energy initiatives including various tax credits to encourage purchase and use of moreefficient technologies, and industry consultations to explore ways to reduce greenhouse gasemissions. Stage 2, which was planned to begin around 2004, would have reviewed and evaluatedstage 1. Stage 3, as envisioned prior to the Kyoto Protocol, included actions aimed at reducingemissions to 1990 levels by 2008-2012, meeting the binding targets anticipated in the Kyoto Protocolthrough measures that would include domestic and international emissions trading. The KyotoProtocol (which the United States signed on November 11, 1998 but which has not been submittedto the U.S. Senate for advice and consent on ratification), outlines an obligation for the United Statesto reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 7% below 1990 levels, on average,between 2008 and 2012. (9) The ClintonAdministration supported United States participation in thisprotocol. The Bush Administration, on the other hand, has rejected the protocol.", "The Congress has in the past passed budget resolutions and appropriations bills with provisions prohibiting the use of funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol, which has not been ratified by theUnited States or entered into force internationally. Some controversy was engendered by thepossible linkage of funding proposals associated with the CCTI to the Kyoto Protocol goals. Aftersome early consideration of these concerns, for the most part the R & D elements were funded bythe Congress. Moreover, many of the programs related to the CCTI and other climate research preceded the Kyoto Protocol, and were mainly influenced by the voluntary commitments the UnitedStates made in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to try to meet a voluntary goalof returning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to current efforts toreduce intensity of emissions.

", "\"Industry\" efforts include working with industries (especially energy-intensiveindustries such as cement, chemicals, steel, petroleum, airlines, and food processing), commonlythrough technical assistance, to audit and identify greenhouse gas emission sources and to help informulating appropriate reduction goals and strategies, including removal of regulatory and otherbarriers. This includes working with ongoing privately-funded energy efficiency programs at privatecompanies.", "\"Carbon Removal\" efforts at EPA were planned in coordination with the Departments of Agriculture and Energy. The EPA/USDA/DOE funds for this activity are forstudying ways to increase environmental storage of carbon, as well as the kinds and sizes ofincentives that could be given to land owners and crop growers to increase the quantity of carbonstored on agricultural and forest lands, and at the same time improve soil quality, reduce soil erosion,and enhance other environmental and conservation goals.", "EPA works with \"State and Local Governments\" to help find ways to reduce energy use and pollution, sometimes by supporting existing state and local programs. The Cities forClimate Protection program, for example, involves more than 54 local governments in implementingbuilding, transportation, waste, and renewable energy projects to eliminate about 3 million metrictons of carbon dioxide. A state-level example is New Jersey's state carbon bank program,established to help achieve New Jersey's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal of 3.5% below1990 levels by 2005. ", "\"International Capacity Building, Partnerships, and Cooperation\" involves EPA and other agencies working to study ways to provide technical and other assistance to developingcountries to aid in reducing their emissions. Developing countries currently emit more than half theglobal total of greenhouse gases, and such emissions are growing rapidly.", "Smithsonian Institution. Global change research at the Smithsonian Institution attempts to understand more fully atmospheric processes, ecosystemdynamics, natural and human-induced environmental change on daily to decadal time scales, andlonger-term climate metrics. The Smithsonian also serves as a repository of climate change findings. These activities amounted to $6 million in FY2003, the same amount requested in FY2004.", "United States Agency for International Development. The US Agency for International Development has worked withforeign governments with the goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions and loweringvulnerability to the threats posed by climate change impacts, by studying ways to increase use ofenvironmentally sound energy, forestry, and biodiversity conservation methods.

Joined by various European Union environmental policy makers, the Department of State issued a joint statement on February7, 2003 identifying six areas for possible cooperative research: carbon cycle research; aerosol-climateinteractions; feedbacks, water vapor and thermohaline circulation; integrated observation systemsand data; carbon capture and storage; and hydrogen technology and infrastructure. Agovernment-industry partnership involving the Departments of State and Energy, and representativesfrom several countries, was announced on February 27, 2003 to design, build, and operate what waslabeled \"the world's first pollution-free, coal-fired power plant. The facility will cost an estimated$1,000 million over the next 10 years.\" (36) Whileno climate change research funds for State wereidentified in FY2003, the FY2004 request is for $1 million.", "Department of Housing and Urban Development. Climate change research and technology programs, new to the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment (HUD) in FY1999, were for the government/ housing developers/ builders Partnershipfor Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH). Identified as part of the CCTI through FY2001,PATH research had a number of goals in addition to climate change. PATH efforts sought \"todevelop and disseminate technologies that will result in housing that is substantially more affordable,durable, disaster resistant, safer and energy/resource efficient...\" (37) No known money for HUD hasbeen requested since FY2001, but HUD continues to administer the overall operations of the PATH."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Possible climate change linked to \"greenhouse gas\" emissions has been addressed by variousU.S. government policies since the mid-1980s, with an emphasis on energy R&D and on climateresearch and services. U.S. efforts in the former Bush and Clinton Administrations toward R&Din energy efficiency and renewable energy, and research into climate and global change were givendirection by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which implemented United States responsibilities underthe UNFCCC, and by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The 1993 Climate Change ActionPlan linked or made partnerships among various federal agencies, business, state and localgovernments, and other entities with the goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. TheClinton Administration's CCTI built upon these earlier efforts. The current Bush Administrationhas introduced its U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative, the National Climate ChangeTechnology Initiative, and the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan. The Plan, asreleased on July 24, 2003, describes five major research goals (improve knowledge of past andpresent climates, improve understanding of climate change forces, reduce uncertainty in climatechange projections, understand sensitivity and adaptability of ecosystems to climate change, andexplore uses and limits of knowledge to manage risks and opportunities). As funding and otherdetails become available, similarities to and differences from earlier climate-change programs maybecome apparent. The evolving organizational structure, however, makes it difficult to determineprecisely some of the interrelationships among science and technology programs.", "Some critics of current climate change policy call for sharper goals, better defined priorities, and more detailed, clearly stated objectives for climate change R&D, and its associated fundingprofile. Some observers point out, for example, that the total CCSP request for spending in FY2004was up only 0.1% over the FY2003 request, from $1.747 billion to $1.749 billion, while that portionof the funding request allocated to the embedded CCRI was up 355% from $40 million in FY2003to $182 million in FY2004. An issue for Congress in this regard is the extent to which such ademonstrably large CCRI increase actually represents new money, and how much is attributable tothe reclassification of ongoing research programs, especially given the fact that the overall requestis up only 0.1%. On the other hand, some proponents note that further R&D is needed to justifycertain climate change management strategies, to focus those strategies on key policy questions, andto reduce scientific uncertainties surrounding prospective climate change so that policymakers canmake better, more informed decisions."], "subsections": []}]}}
