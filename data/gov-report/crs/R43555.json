TIP is believed to be one of the most prolific areas of contemporary criminal activity and is of significant interest to the United States as a serious human rights concern. TIP is both an international and domestic crime that involves violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards, as well as criminal law. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) is the primary law that addresses human trafficking. Domestically, anti-TIP efforts provided under the TVPA include protection for victims, the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses, and education of the public. Congress reauthorized the TVPA in March 2013 (Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act; Title XII of P.L. 113-4). While this report covers P.L. 113-4, a more complete treatment of that bill can be found in CRS Report RL34317, Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress. This report discusses TIP issues that have received legislative action or are of significant congressional interest in the 113th Congress.", "The House and Senate have acted on other TIP-related bills in the 113th Congress. Since human trafficking issues intersect with many different policy areas (e.g., immigration, child welfare, the criminal justice system, missing and exploited youth), legislation to address human trafficking is varied. For example, the Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination Act (H.R. 3344) and Title III subsection F of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744), as passed by the Senate, would make changes to immigration policy altering how foreign labor contractors operate to help prevent trafficking of noncitizen workers. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act (H.R. 4058), as passed by the House, and the Supporting At-Risk Children Act (S. 1870), as reported by Senate Finance, would address trafficking prevention through the child welfare system. In addition to other provisions, the bills would require state child welfare agencies to develop and implement policies to identify, screen, and determine appropriate state actions and services for children believed to be victims of sex trafficking or at risk of being victims.", "The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act (H.R. 3610/S. 1733) and the SAVE (Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation) Act of 2014 (H.R. 4225) would amend criminal justice policy in an attempt to obstruct human trafficking. H.R. 3610, as passed by the House, and S. 1733 would incentivize states to enact safe harbor legislation\u2014legislation providing that children who were found in prostitution would be treated as victims rather than perpetrators\u2014and increase restitution amounts for victims. H.R. 4225, as passed by the House, would additionally provide penalties for knowingly advertising or knowingly selling advertising that offers certain commercial sex acts. Other bills adopt a multi-prong approach to anti-TIP efforts. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3530, as passed by the House, and S. 1738) would create new grant programs for law enforcement and victims services, and would amend the criminal code (Title 18 of the U.S. Code) to create new crimes and enhance criminal penalties for certain trafficking-related activities. The International Megan's Law (H.R. 4573), as passed by the House, would create a new center in DHS that would be responsible for possibly notifying the destination country of international travel by child-sex offenders.", "The report accompanies CRS Report RL34317, Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress, by [author name scrubbed] and Liana Rosen and CRS Report R41878, Sex Trafficking of Children in the United States: Overview and Issues for Congress, by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The 113 th Congress has made fighting trafficking in persons (TIP) within the United States a legislative priority.

", "The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subject to trafficking in persons. In the United States, human trafficking occurs in every state, and it victimizes both U.S. citizens and noncitizens. As many as 17,500 people are believed to be trafficked into the United States each year, and some have estimated that 100,000 U.S. citizen (USC) children are victims of trafficking within the United States. The trafficking of individuals within U.S. borders is commonly referred to as domestic or \"internal\" human trafficking. Domestic human trafficking occurs primarily for labor and most commonly in domestic service, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial services, hotel services, construction, health and elder care, hair and nail salons, and strip club dancing. However, more investigations and prosecutions have taken place for sex trafficking offenses than for labor trafficking offenses. ", "Noncitizens are more susceptible than U.S. citizens to labor trafficking, and more foreign victims are found in labor trafficking than in sex trafficking. Although labor trafficking can happen to U.S. citizens, significantly more U.S. citizens are found in sex trafficking than in labor trafficking. Research indicates that most of the victims of sex trafficking into and within the United States are women and children. In addition, migrant labor camps tend to be common settings for labor exploitation and domestic trafficking. Domestically, anti-TIP efforts include protection for victims, education of the public, and the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses. The Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL) have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide assistance specific to the needs of trafficking victims. This assistance includes temporary housing, independent living skills, cultural orientation, transportation, job training, mental health counseling, and legal assistance. Both HHS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administer public awareness campaigns on recognizing human trafficking victims. In addition, at the federal level, the majority of the cases are investigated by agents in DOJ's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who coordinate as appropriate; the cases are prosecuted by DOJ. ", "For more than a decade, Congress has been actively engaged in anti-human-trafficking efforts within the United States. Through the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386 ) and its four reauthorizations (TVPRAs), Congress has aimed to eliminate human trafficking within the United States by creating domestic grant programs for both victims and law enforcement, creating new criminal laws, and conducting oversight on the effectiveness and implications of U.S. anti-TIP policy. Most recently, in March 2013, the TVPA's grant programs were reauthorized through FY2017 in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Title XII, P.L. 113-4 ).

Actors engaged in human trafficking range from amateur family-run organizations to sophisticated transnational organized crime syndicates. Trafficking victims are often subjected to mental and physical abuse in order to control them. Abuses may include debt bondage, social isolation, removal of identification cards and travel documents, violence, and fear of reprisals against them or their families. ", "A major aspect of U.S. anti-trafficking efforts is victim assistance: providing immediate services when victims are identified and helping the victims recover from the victimization and reclaim their lives. Pending legislation ( H.R. 3610 / S. 1733 and H.R. 3530 / S. 1738 ) seeks to improve victim services and provide greater access to resources for victims.

Related to this is whether current services are adequate to combat sex trafficking of minors in the United States (i.e., the prostitution of children). There is confusion over whether U.S. citizens, as well as noncitizens, are eligible for services under all the anti-trafficking grant programs authorized by the TVPA and whether Congress has provided funding for programs that target U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident (LPR) victims. Under the TVPA, the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL) have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide services to trafficking victims. Only the DOJ and HHS programs receive specified funding for trafficking victims services.", "A related issue is the overall amount of funding for victims services; especially as the focus on sex trafficking is broadening to include minor sex trafficking victims in the United States who are U.S. citizens. Between FY2002 and FY2013, Congress appropriated approximately $20 million each year for victim services, and the amount was increased to approximately $28 million in FY2014. Between FY2009 and FY2013, HHS used all of its appropriated money on services for trafficking victims before the end of the fiscal year\u2014and all of the services were provided to noncitizen victims. Notably, the most recent Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report (FY2012) recommends increasing funding for relevant agencies to provide victims services. In addition, there is no targeted federal funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) report a critical need for an increase in the overall funding for comprehensive services.", "Recently, Congress has amended certain grant programs so that sex trafficking victims would be eligible for those programs. For example, the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act ( P.L. 113-4 ) clarifies that victims' services and legal assistance under VAWA include services and assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons . In addition, P.L. 113-4 amended the purpose for grants to tribal governments to combat violence against women to include sex trafficking and creates a new purpose to provide services to address the needs of youth who are victims of several crimes including sex trafficking. The act also created a new tribal coalition grant program, administered by DOJ, which, among other purposes, seeks to enhance access to essential services for Indian women victimized by domestic and sexual violence, including sex trafficking; and to assist Indian tribes in developing and promoting state, local, and tribal law and policies that enhance best practices for responding to violent crimes against Indian women, including sex trafficking. P.L. 113-4 also amended the grant program for state and local law enforcement's anti-trafficking programs focusing on U.S. citizen victims, so these grants can be used for anti-trafficking programs for noncitizen victims as well. ", "In the same vein, pending legislation in the 113 th Congress would create new programs to enhance services to trafficking victims. The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 ( H.R. 3610 and S. 1733 ) would require, beginning in FY2017, that the Secretary of HHS make grants for a national communication system to help victims of severe forms of trafficking communicate with service providers.", "The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 ( H.R. 3530 / S. 1738 ) would authorize the Attorney General to make grants to an eligible entity to develop, improve, or expand domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs designed to aid victims while investigating and prosecuting the trafficking offenses. An eligible entity is a state or unit of local government that meets specified criteria. The grants could be used to establish or enhance specialized training programs on the prevention of child trafficking for law enforcement, first responders, health care officials, child welfare officials, juvenile justice personnel, prosecutors, and judicial personnel; establish law enforcement and prosecution units dedicated to fighting trafficking of children; and establish or enhance court programs to assist child trafficking victims.

The assessment would be paid after the person paid all court-ordered fines and orders of restitution arising from the criminal conviction on which the assessment was based. S. 1738 would put these assessments into a new \"Domestic Trafficking Fund\" at the federal treasury. The Attorney General and Secretary of HHS would be directed to use the new fund to award grants or enhance victims programs under the TVPA and its reauthorizations.", "Alternatively, H.R. 3530 would steadily increase the cap on the existing Crime Victims Fund (CVF) over several years.
