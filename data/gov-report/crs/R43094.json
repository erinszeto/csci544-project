Several of the long-term student loan interest rate proposals would amend the Direct Loan program to index student loan interest rates to market indices, such as the rate on 10-year Treasury notes.

In contrast, S. 897 would set the borrower rate for Direct Subsidized Loans made during AY2013-2014 only at the rate of the Federal Reserve discount window primary credit rate.

It is reasonable to assume that projections that extend beyond two years out may be less precise.", "Some of the interest rate proposals described above would use the rate at the last auction held prior to June 1 as the basis for setting borrower interest rates for the following award year. Since rates vary with the market on tradable securities, the rate at which a particular security is auctioned may differ from the rate at which the security is traded at a later date. Also, 10-year notes are typically auctioned about once per quarter, but between ends of quarters. However, the Treasury determines which type of security to auction and at what date to hold an auction in response to the financing needs of the federal government. Thus, the last auction held prior to June 1 may be several months prior to that date and the auction rate may be substantially different than the rate at which Treasury securities are trading on June 1.

This describes whether the interest rate is fixed or variable; and if market-indexed, the index that is used, the applicable add-on, and whether a cap on maximum interest rate applies. ", "Next, a group of three figures show projected interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans made during the next six award years (AY2013-2014 through AY2018-2019). Projected rates are shown for each one-year period beginning July 1 for 2013 through 2027. The figures are designed to show the general pattern of interest rates that might be expected under the various policy options. For instance, would interest rates on all of a borrower's loans remain constant from the time the loans are made until they are paid in full? Would there be the possibility that a borrower who has several loans might have a different interest rate for each of the loans? Or, might a borrower face the possibility that the interest rates on all his or her loans could increase or decrease from year to year? A six-year period was chosen to provide an illustration of the variability associated with rate projections for potential indices. That is, CBO projections for financial instruments are based upon a mix of current and historical economic data in the initial years, but for later years (i.e., year 6 and beyond) are largely based on historical data and the 6-10 year projection is held constant (i.e., it is the same number for each year). In the analysis presented here, market-indexed rates based upon CBO's projection of 10-year Treasury notes for years 6-10 is only shown once\u2014for loans made during AY2018-2019. If we were to show projected market-indexed rates for subsequent years, the projected rates would be the same as for AY2018-2019.", "After the figures displaying projected interest rate, a table is then presented which shows the results of a series of case simulations which are designed to provide an indication of the interest expenses three different types of borrowers might expect to pay on Direct Loans borrowed to finance a four year period of undergraduate education. Simulation results are presented for undergraduate dependent student borrowers, undergraduate independent student borrowers, and borrowers who are parents of undergraduate dependent students. Since the results of the case simulations for policy options that are indexed to market rates are highly sensitive to projected future interest rates, two distinct four-year periods of borrowing are examined. The first is for a four-year period of undergraduate education beginning next fall: AY2013-2014 through AY2016-2017. The second is for the subsequent four-year period, assuming period of undergraduate education beginning four years from now: AY2017-2018 through AY2020-2021.

By adding a second scenario, we present more complete information on the range of outcomes that might be associated with this type of rate-setting structure. ", "As noted earlier, these case simulations are based on projected future interest rates, with rates for the final year of the projection held constant for future years. As it is likely that future rates will differ from those projected, the simulation results presented here for market-indexed loans may be best viewed as indicating a general sense of the direction in which a rate will move and the magnitude of such movement. Simulations based on market-indexed rates are less precise than those based on known fixed rates. Nonetheless, it is intended that this attempt to examine the known and projected rates over common future periods, mapped against actual information about loan balances and amortization periods, as well as loan terms and conditions, provides a relative sense of the potential effects of various interest rate structures on borrowers.", "Additional information on how the three borrower cases were constructed and on the assumptions made in analyzing the various interest rate policy options is presented in Appendix A ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Law", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Undergraduate Dependent Borrower", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, an undergraduate dependent student who, during the four-year period from AY2013-2014 through AY2016-2017, borrowed a cumulative total of $16,491 in combined Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans would pay an estimated total of $7,804 in interest expenses.

These costs include the cost of raising capital, loan servicing costs, costs for collecting on delinquent and defaulted loans, and costs for losses due to default or loan discharge. Other costs include lost interest payments from loans that are repaid early and costs for borrower benefits, such as loan forgiveness programs. Some portion of the cost of making loans are passed on to borrowers through the interest they pay on their loans and the fees they are charged (e.g., loan origination fees, costs for collecting on defaulted loans). When the government establishes an interest rate for borrowers to pay, a major consideration centers on the extent to which the borrower will be expected to pay for the costs of the loan. When borrowers pay less than the full cost of a loan, the amount less than the full cost is referred to as the loan subsidy.", "The Direct Loan program is a federal credit program. Most of the costs to the government associated with the program are accounted for on an accrual basis according to criteria specified under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA; P.L. 101-508 ). Under FCRA, the net present value of future credit flows associated with the loans are discounted to the fiscal year in which the loans are made using interest rates on Treasury securities with comparable maturities; and these discounted credit flows are expressed as loan subsidy rates. The costs of administering the Direct Loan program are accounted for separately on a cash basis.", "Since the early 1980s, there has been a general long-term downward trend in market interest rates; and during the past several years, the government's cost of borrowing has been exceptionally low by historical standards. Since 2006, federal student loans have been made with fixed interest rates. Thus, interest rates on Direct Loans have not moved in tandem with market rates. With the federal government's cost of borrowing near historic lows, CBO projects that federal student loans will be made through the Direct Loan program with a negative subsidy rate for the foreseeable future. In other words, as accounted for according to rules specified under the FCRA, the government expects to earn more through the Direct Loan program than the amount it costs to make the loans.

A perennial set of issues has pertained to how heavily the government should subsidize the interest payments for borrowers and how widely these subsidies should be extended (e.g., across how many types of borrowers and loans).", "For the student loans currently being made through the Direct Loan program, fixed interest rates are specified in a manner that does not adjust to account for variations in market conditions, nor borrower repayment risk. The current fixed interest rate structure does provide borrowers with certainty regarding the interest rates that will apply for the duration that their loans are in effect.

For borrowers, fixed rate loans offer the benefit of predictability, as loan payments will not change as a result of variations in prevailing interest rates. However, depending on the interest rate environment, fixed rate loans may present borrowers with interest rates that are either higher or lower rates than prevailing rates. For the government, it is difficult to accurately predict future interest rates.
