This stands in contrast to previous years, when the bill moved relatively easily through the legislative process, despite the emergence of occasional controversial issues. The concurrent resolution provided $41.7 billion in discretionary appropriations for DHS for FY2011, establishing funding levels for some components and activities, while leaving others to be funded at FY2010 levels. The resolution overall gave the department much less explicit direction from Congress than previous funding vehicles, in several cases leaving decisions usually made by Congress about how to allocate limited funds in DHS's hands.

Central to United States efforts to address transnational terrorism are actions taken to detect, deter, and defeat Al Qaeda. While recognizing that numerous other terrorist groups may wish to harm U.S. global security interests, the June 2011 release of the Administration's National Strategy for Counterterrorism was nonetheless primarily focused on addressing threats from Al Qaeda. In a statement before the United Nations Counterterrorism Committee on July 20, 2001, Daniel Benjamin, the Coordinator of the Office of the Counterterrorism at the State Department, said \"rather than trying to combat directly every single terrorist organization regardless of whether they have the intent or capability to ever attack the U.S. or our citizens, President Obama's counterterrorism strategy is (focused on) Al Qaeda and its affiliates and adherents.\" Understanding the global nature and capabilities of this subset of terrorist groups and individuals is central to formulating sound strategic policy and overseeing its effective implementation.", "The past few years have witnessed an increase in terrorist actions by entities claiming some affiliation with or philosophical connection to Al Qaeda. Many of the past year's global terrorist attacks were conducted by individuals or small terrorist cells that received support ranging from resources and training to having minimal connections, if any, with the terrorist groups to which they claim allegiance. Some argue that recent U.S. counterterrorism successes may be reducing the level of terrorist threats to the nation emanating from core Al Qaeda. U.S. officials suggest that the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 coupled with continuous post-9/11 global military and intelligence counterterrorism actions has significantly degraded Al Qaeda's ability to successfully launch a catastrophic terrorist attack against U.S. global interests. Others suggest that Al Qaeda has changed from an organization to a philosophical movement, making it more difficult to detect and defeat. These security experts suggest that Al Qaeda and associated affiliates will remain viable, due in part to the prospective security implications related to the nation's budgetary situation. Noted author on counterterrorism issues, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, argues that \"the U.S. will not be (defeated) by Al Qaeda. But one can see that as the national debt increases, we (will) have to make spending cuts and as Al Qaeda gets stronger in multiple countries simultaneously\u2014Somali, Yemen, Pakistan, maybe Mali\u2014suddenly you're looking at multiple theaters from where catastrophic strikes can be launched.\" The long-term fiscal implications of United States counterterrorism policies and responses appear to be of concern to John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.

Over the past few years numerous individuals were arrested in the homeland and abroad for conducting attacks and planning terrorism-related activities directed at U.S. national security interests. All of the attacks\u2014successful and unsuccessful\u2014were of a transnational dimension and ranged from a lone shooter who appears to have become radicalized over the Internet to terrorist organizations wishing to use airliners as platforms for destruction to individuals attempting to detonate large quantities of explosives in symbolic areas frequented by large groups of people.", "The first session of the 112 th Congress undertook efforts, largely through hearings, to better understand the nature of terrorism in various geographic regions and assess the effectiveness of U.S. and partnering nations' counterterrorism efforts.

John Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism advisor publicly described the strategy as the first one, \"that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts.\" ", "In August 2011, the Obama Administration also released a strategy for combating violent extremism. It revolves around countering the radicalization of all types of potential terrorists. As such, the radicalization of violent jihadists falls under its purview. The strategy's domestic focus includes general philosophical statements about the importance of protecting civil rights, federal cooperation with local leaders in the private and public sectors, and the insistence that the strategy does not center solely around fighting one particular radical ideology. However, the eight-page document lacks details, especially when compared to the approaches of other nations. The unclassified United Kingdom's counter-radicalization strategy, known as \"Prevent,\" details numerous specific programs and is over 100 pages long. One radicalization expert described the U.S. strategy as \"very aspirational.\"", "Congress may wish to consider oversight of the Obama Administration's new strategy to combat violent extremism, since it lacks specifics. From a more strictly counterterrorism perspective, critics also note that there is no national estimate of domestic terrorist threats; national domestic intelligence collection plan; nor domestic intelligence collection requirements, priorities, or coordination. Congress may also wish to consider requiring the Director of National Intelligence to examine whether and how to develop a national domestic intelligence framework or plan as part of a unified strategy to combat violent extremism within the United States.", "In the post-9/11 environment, the public expects law enforcement to disrupt terrorist plots before an attack occurs. This has lead authorities to adopt a preventive policing approach that focuses not just on crime that has occurred, but on the possibility that a crime may be committed in the future. In this context, a major challenge for federal law enforcement, particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is gauging how quickly and at what point individuals move from radicalized beliefs to violence so that a terrorist plot can be detected and disrupted. A 2008 revision to the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Federal Bureau of Investigation Operations was intended to be helpful in this regard, streamlining FBI investigations and making them more proactive. The revision permits the Bureau to conduct assessments of individuals or groups without factual predication. However, the new guidelines have generated some controversy among civil libertarians. The FBI is further revising the guidelines.", "To counter violent jihadist plots, both U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies have employed two sets of innovative tactics. Using violations of civil laws to arrest and prosecute suspected terrorists and their support networks is known as taking the \"Al Capone\" approach, in reference to the federal government's successful use of the mobster's violations of tax law to bring him down. Law enforcement has also successfully used \"agents provocateurs\" \u2013 people employed to associate with suspects and incite them to commit acts that they can be arrested for. These tactics have long been used in a wide variety of criminal cases but have particular utility in counterterrorism investigations as they allow suspects to be arrested prior to the commission of a terrorist act rather than after the damage has been done.

The federal government has created several programs over the last decade to develop, procure, and distribute CBRN medical countermeasures. Despite these efforts, the pharmacuetical industry has developed only a few new countermeasures and many experts question the government's ability to quickly distribute countermeasures following an attack. The 112 th Congress is considering reauthorizing some of these programs, as well as further enhancing the federal government's ability to develop, procure, and distribute medical countermeasures. ", "In 2004, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act ( P.L. 108-276 ) to encourage the private sector to develop CBRN medical countermeasures by creating a guaranteed federal market. Congress advance appropriated $5.6 billion for Project BioShield acquisitions for FY2004-FY2013. Through July 2011, the federal government had obligated $2.563 billion of this advance appropriation to acquire CBRN countermeasures. Congress removed an additional $1.461 billion from this account through rescission or transfers to other programs. The President has requested transferring $765 million from this account to other CBRN-development related accounts for FY2012. Congress is also considering other Project BioShield related proposals. These include whether to extend the program authority beyond FY2013, whether to change the structure and purpose of the account, and how much funding should be authorized for acquisition through this account. ", "In 2006, Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act ( P.L. 109-417 ) creating the position of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in part, to improve the planning, coordination, and accountability of the government's efforts to perform CBRN countermeasure advanced research, development, and procurement. Congress is considering whether changes to existing programs or new programs would further improve governmentwide CBRN countermeasure efforts. These include moving programs for countermeasure stockpiling and distribution to ASPR, allowing more flexibility in using Project BioShield-appropriated funds, and improving planning and transparency by requiring a new countermeasure implementation plan and a five-year budget plan. Additionally, the President has requested the creation of a nongovernmental strategic investment firm. This firm would provide capital and business advice to small companies developing medical countermeasure-related technologies that could fill government needs. ", "Distribution of existing medical countermeasures against potential CBRN agents remains a challenge. The federal government has attempted to address this challenge through programs that stockpile and distribute stores of medical countermeasures, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Many experts question the sufficiency of current federal programs to distribute federal stockpiles to states and localities in the midst of an emergency, and whether state governments have sufficient plans, organization, and resources to receive federal stockpiles and effectively disseminate them. The 112 th Congress is considering whether transferring the CDC's SNS to ASPR would improve the efficiency and coordination of the countermeasure development and procurement programs with the stockpiling and distribution programs. Congress is evaluating the effectiveness of current federal programs designed to help state and local governments improve their stockpiling and distribution programs. Congress may also consider to what extent other stockpiling and distribution methods should augment the SNS. Such methods include home or business countermeasure stockpiling and using the postal service to distribute countermeasures. These proposals may improve countermeasure distribution but also raise some issues regarding program costs, unintended use of stockpiles, and ability of local authorities to fully implement programs. Finally, Congress may consider HHS's request for changes to its authority to allow the use of unapproved countermeasures in emergencies.

Since February 2004, when the Department of Justice first incorporated terrorist watch list checks into the NICS process, three possible issues have emerged for Congress. First, should terrorist watch list checks be incorporated statutorily into the firearms- and explosives-related background check processes? Second, should approved firearm transfer records be maintained on a temporary basis to determine whether persons of interest in counterterrorism investigations have obtained firearms improperly? Third, should persons watch-listed as known or suspected terrorists be prohibited statutorily from possessing firearms and explosives? ", "Before 2004, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not conduct terrorist watch list queries as part of NICS background checks pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act ( P.L. 101-159 ). Such watch list checks were not conducted, because being a known or suspected terrorist was not, and is not, a disqualifying factor for firearms or explosives transfer and possession eligibility. In February 2004, however, the FBI modified its NICS operating procedures and began querying terrorist watch list records for both firearms and explosives transfers. Terrorist watch list records were downloaded into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), one of the computer systems that is queried by NICS and includes several \"hot files\" on persons who are of interest to U.S. law enforcement agencies, and who are also usually prohibited under federal law from possessing a firearm and/or explosives. ", "Today, the NCIC \"hot file\" into which terrorist watch list records are downloaded is the Known and Appropriately Suspected Terrorist (KST) file. Formerly, watch list records were downloaded into the NCIC Violent Gang and Terrorist Offender File (VGTOF). Information related to the subjects of NICS-generated terrorist watch list hits were, and are, passed on to FBI Counterterrorism Division and special agents in the field, who are usually members of Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) for two purposes, principally: (1) to validate the match between the individual and the watch list record, and (2) to check for information that would prohibit that individual, the prospective transferee, licensee, or permittee, from possessing firearms or explosives (e.g., illegal immigration or fugitive status). Despite these measures, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported that subjects of valid terrorist watch list matches have been transferred firearms and, less frequently, explosives. Beginning in the 109 th Congress, these GAO reports lent impetus to legislative proposals that would grant the Attorney General authority to not only screen applicants against the terrorist watch list, but to deny them firearms and explosives transfers based solely on having been placed on a terrorist watch list by federal agents. ", "As Senator Susan M. Collins observed in May 2011, however, denying a firearms transfer raises issues, possibly constitutional in nature, that denying an explosives license or permit does not. At the same time, Senators Collins and Joseph I. Lieberman expressed their shared concern about the fact that known and suspected terrorists had passed federal background checks and acquired firearms and explosives legally through normal commercial channels, despite valid terrorist watch list hits. They also noted that Muslim extremists (radicalized jihadists) and other terrorists had used, or had planned to use, firearms and explosives with deadly effect in the past. Such concerns were recently reinforced by Al Qaeda's U.S.-born spokesperson, Adam Gadahn, when he exhorted Muslim extremists in the United States to acquire firearms and carry out terrorist attacks in the United States in a June 2011 Internet posting.", "To address such concerns in the 112 th Congress, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Representative Peter T. King have reintroduced the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2011 ( S. 34 / H.R. 1506 ). Based on an April 2007 Department of Justice legislative proposal, this bill would authorize the Attorney General to deny a firearms transfer, state-issued firearms permit, or explosives license/permit to any person who has been found \"to be or have engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism.\" Supporters have dubbed this legislation the \"Terror Gap\" proposal; they include 550 mayors of U.S. cities. On the other hand, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other opponents of the bill argue that the Terror Gap proposal, if enacted, would be unconstitutional, because it would allow the Attorney General to deny a person his \"individual right to keep and bear arms,\" and would do so, \"without due process of law.\" Supporters of the Terror Gap bill counter that it would provide a level of redress and due process that is currently unavailable to others who face a denial of some benefit or activity, because they are identified as known or suspected terrorists through other federal terrorist watch list screening activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuity of Government Operations40", "paragraphs": ["Continuity of government operations refers to programs and initiatives to ensure that governing entities are able to recover from a wide range of potential operational interruptions.

Under the SFI pilot program, 100% of containers at participating ports are scanned by radiation portal monitors and non-intrusive inspection imaging systems as they move through the ports. Data from these systems are provided to CBP officers stationed at the ports and within the United States at the National Targeting Center-Cargo (NTC-C).

Based on the initial SFI pilot, CBP concluded that 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound maritime containers is possible on a limited scale in low volume ports, but that \"this process will be difficult to achieve\" in many ports and in the case of many transshipped goods. Thus, the Administration proposes to remove CBP officers from most CSI ports and to rely more heavily on remote risk-based targeting at the NTC-C and reciprocal inspections agreements with foreign governments. ", "In light of the Administration's plans to scale back 100% screening through the SFI pilots, Congress may be interested in the degree to which the NTC-C is positioned to support the increase in workload that will result from the proposed changes to CSI. Congress may also wish to examine the impact the proposed changes will have on the security of U.S.-bound containers arriving in the United States from CSI ports.

In 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell remarked that there was \"no threat more serious to aviation.\" Since then, Department of State and military initiatives seeking voluntary reductions of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) stockpiles have reduced worldwide inventories by at least 30,000. Despite this progress, an unknown number of such weapons may still be in the hands of insurgents. This threat, combined with the limited capability to improve security beyond airport perimeters and to modify flight paths, leaves civil aircraft vulnerable to missile attacks, especially in conflict zones and other high-risk areas.

The program concluded in 2009 with extensive operational and live-fire testing along with FAA certification of systems from two vendors capable of protecting airliners against heat-seeking missiles. The systems have not been operationally deployed on commercial airliners, however, due largely to the high acquisition and life-cycle costs of these units. Some critics have also pointed out that the units do not protect against the full range of potential weapons that pose a potential threat to civil airliners. Proponents, however, argue that the systems do appear to provide effective protection against what is likely the most menacing standoff threat to civil airliners: heat-seeking MANPADS. Nonetheless, the airlines, which continue to face economic difficulties, have not voluntarily invested in these systems for operational use and argue that the costs for such systems should be borne, at least in part, by the federal government. Policy discussions have focused mostly on whether to fund the acquisition of limited numbers of the units for use by the Civil Reserve Aviation Fleet, civilian airliners that can be called up to transport troops and supplies for the military. Other approaches to protecting aircraft, including ground-based missile countermeasures and escort planes or drones equipped with antimissile technology, have been considered on a more limited basis, but these options face operational challenges that may limit their effectiveness.

For example, the average monthly DRF expenditure for disaster assistance is $350 million\u2014or $4.2 billion dollars a year. In contrast, the average amount enacted for the DRF in a regular appropriation since FY2005 has been around $2 billion a year. It could therefore be argued that the enacted amount for the DRF does not reflect the true cost of disasters. In addition, the funds provided through emergency supplemental appropriations are not subject to spending caps\u2014including unrelated spending. It might be argued that the budgetary practice is used as a mechanism to (1) project smaller budget deficits, and (2) evade discretionary spending caps.", "In response to these concerns, Congress may consider passing reforms to reduce federal expenditures for disaster assistance, or to address their impact on the national debt.

Congress\u2014since FY2009\u2014has included language in appropriations bills that waives various restrictions on SAFER grants (such as cost share requirements and a prohibition against using grant funds to rehire laid-off firefighters). The inclusion of waivers reflects concerns that modifications to the SAFER rules may be necessary to lessen the financial burden of SAFER grant recipients, thereby enabling more fire departments to participate in the program.

In an effort to address its acquisition workforce needs, the department's FY2012 budget request included $24.2 million for an acquisition workforce initiative. The House Committee on Appropriations declined to provide funding for the initiative, stating that the information it has received from DHS was \"insufficient to enable the Committee to understand the basis for the proposed increase....\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balanced Workforce Initiative", "paragraphs": ["In early 2009, DHS announced that, as part of its efficiency review, department components would examine how to achieve a proper balance between federal employees and contractor employees. Achieving the proper balance generally involves determining which agency functions, if any, are to be reserved for federal employee performance. For example, only federal employees are to perform inherently governmental functions. Approximately one year later, this particular effort had been renamed the balanced workforce initiative. The initiative involves \"ensur[ing] that no inherently governmental functions are performed by contractors ... put[ting] in place rigorous review procedures to ensure that future contract actions do not increase our [the department's] reliance on contractors; and ... coordinating workforce assessments across the Department to seek economies and service improvements and reduce our reliance on contractors.\" To aid department personnel in determining whether a function should be reserved for performance by federal employees, DHS has developed an instrument known as the balanced workforce strategy tool (or survey). ", "The topics discussed here suggest several questions that may be of interest to the 112 th Congress. Regarding the structure of DHS' acquisition function, has the department satisfactorily addressed concerns about its system of dual accountability? Has the department considered other options for organizing its acquisition function? Turning to the department's acquisition workforce, what are the possible consequences of being unable to fund its acquisition workforce initiative in FY2012? What acquisition tasks, or activities, are most likely to be affected by the lack of a fully staffed and trained acquisition workforce? Under its balanced workforce initiative, has DHS discovered contractor employees performing inherently governmental functions? Has the department identified any situations where it had ceded control over its mission and operations to contractor employees? How many contractors, and which contracts, might be affected by the agency's efforts to achieve a balanced workforce?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consolidated Terrorist Watch Lists250", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 9/11 attacks, terrorist watch lists were maintained by several agencies primarily to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States. In September 2003, under the Homeland Security Presidential Initiative 6 (HSPD-6), the U.S. government's use of watch lists was consolidated and expanded to better screen such persons at consular offices and international ports of entry, and to better track them if they manage to enter the United States. While the post-9/11 terrorist screening policies have resulted in valid watch list matches, misidentifications have also been a recurring issue for Congress. Initially, such problems were most frequently associated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), but misidentifications have also emerged as a problem for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). In December 2010, however, TSA fully implemented its Secure Flight program and the frequency of terrorist watch list misidentifications is expected to abate. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established a \"Watchlist Service,\" which is a mirror database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) consolidated database of terrorist watch list records. While this move brings the U.S. government closer to the goal of employing a single, consolidated terrorist watch list, it arguably further diffuses responsibility for terrorist watch list records under an arrangement that could have already been justifiably described as Byzantine. ", "Under HSPD-6, the terrorist identification and watch list functions previously performed by State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) were split between the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), later renamed the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and the then newly established Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The NCTC is responsible for indentifying international terrorists and collating all available information on those persons in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). Federal agencies within the U.S. Intelligence Community forward nominations to the NCTC to include known and suspected international terrorists into TIDE based upon both foreign and criminal intelligence. The FBI, on the other hand, is responsible for identifying both international and domestic terrorists (in the latter case, based upon criminal intelligence). The FBI-administered TSC is responsible for maintaining the consolidated Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), into which both international and domestic watch list records are consolidated. The TSC tailors watch list records to meet the missions of frontline screening agencies and downloads them from the TSDB into their screening systems. Consequently, these watch lists are in most cases only subsets of the TSDB. In addition, the TSC has developed comprehensive procedures for handling encounters with known and suspected terrorists and their supporters, and provides terrorist screening agencies with around-the-clock operational support in the event of possible terrorist encounters.", "By providing tailored watch list records from the TSDB, the TSC supports the terrorist screening activities of the DHS's TSA and CBP, as well as the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA). Similar terrorist watch list records are also shared with the Department of Defense and selected foreign governments. As of May 2010, the TSDB contained information on 422,674 individuals, who are known or suspected of being international or domestic terrorists. Due to aliases and name variants, however, the TSDB included over 1.7 million records related to watch-listed individuals. ", "Under HSPD-6, the TSC Director is responsible for developing policies and procedures related to the criteria for including terrorist identities data in the consolidated TSDB and for measures to be taken in regard to misidentifications, erroneous entries, outdated data, and privacy concerns. However, the TSC does not collect intelligence, and has no authority to do so. In fact, all intelligence or data entered into the TSDB are actually collected by other agencies with the U.S. Intelligence Community in accordance with applicable, pre-existing authorities. As a consequence, the TSC is limited in its ability to address certain issues related to misidentifications because it is restricted from divulging classified or law enforcement-sensitive information to the public under certain circumstances. DHS, as well as its frontline screening agencies (such as TSA and CBP), arguably confronts the same limitation, because many terrorist watch list records, while possibly declassified, are based on classified intelligence collected by other agencies. Such records would probably be considered security sensitive information.", "Despite these limitations, Congress required the TSA and DHS to establish appeals procedures. Under these requirements, persons who are identified as terrorism-related security threats based on records in the TSDB would have the ability to appeal such determinations and have such records, if warranted, modified to alleviate such occurrences in the future. Congress also required DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress where individuals, who believe they have been delayed or prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft because they were wrongly identified as a threat, would have a timely and fair process for redress. To meet these requirements, DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) as a mechanism for addressing watch list misidentification issues and other situations where passengers feel that they have been unfairly or incorrectly delayed or denied boarding or identified for additional security screening at airport screening checkpoints, ports of entry or border checkpoints, or when seeking to access other modes of transportation. Nevertheless, many civil libertarians and privacy advocates do not view either the TSC or DHS as being in a position under current law to provide adequate and timely redress to persons misidentified as terrorists or improperly watch-listed as terrorists. ", "In July 2010, the transmission of terrorist watch list records from the FBI/TSC to DHS/TSA was reengineered, when a \"secure\" system-to-system arrangement was established that allows the entire contents of the TSDB to be made available to DHS on a \"near real-time\" basis. At DHS, this mirror database is known as the \"Watchlist Service (WLS).\" In July 2011, DHS proposed exempting its WLS from the Privacy Act of 1974 in the same way that the FBI did the TSDB, a move that caused privacy advocates to renew calls for a more transparent and robust terrorist watch list redress process and to question again the U.S. government's expanded use of terrorist watch list records under HSPD-6.

R&D is generally a multi-year endeavor with significant risk of failure. Additionally, it may take years to realize any benefits from R&D investments. The Administration and Congress have differing visions regarding performance of R&D in DHS. In both FY2011 and FY2012, DHS requested to consolidate its R&D activities. Congress denied the DHS request in FY2011 and is considering the FY2012 request. In addition, some congressional and stakeholder expectations regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of agency performance have not been met. The 112 th Congress may continue to focus attention on whether investments in homeland security research and development net appropriate rewards, how the distribution of investments among homeland security topics and between research and development activities leads to a balanced portfolio, and what the appropriate funding level for DHS R&D is during a time of fiscal constraint.", "The DHS homeland security R&D activities have substantial scope, as these activities must attempt to meet the needs of both DHS component agencies and other customers outside of the agency, such as first responders. Stakeholders continue to debate the optimal approach to maximizing DHS R&D effectiveness. Some advocates call for substantial increases in particular areas of research and development, citing that a dedicated research effort with significant investments as more likely to yield technology breakthroughs. Some stakeholders call for a rebalancing of the investment portfolio with an increased focus on technology development, arguing that many prototypes under development in the private sector need only a small boost to convert them to procurable technologies. Other stakeholders call for a rebalancing of the investment portfolio towards long-term research activities, warning that DHS will lack research outcomes to develop into prototypes if long-term research languishes. Finally, portions of the stakeholder community suggest using a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy similar to that undertaken by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) so as to make \"leap-ahead\" advances relative to terrorist capabilities.", "The DHS is not the sole federal funder of homeland security R&D, but the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology (S&T) is responsible for coordinating homeland security R&D activities across the federal government. The DHS Under Secretary for S&T has experienced challenges in attempting to coordinate these activities and has failed to develop a federal homeland security R&D strategy. Congress has historically been interested in identifying and overcoming the barriers to such coordination. The 112 th Congress may conduct oversight of how any new strategic approaches taken by DHS address these longstanding concerns, set milestones for future performance, and project meeting the needs of DHS components and the first-responder community.", "For FY2011 and FY2012, DHS requested that Congress transfer some research and development activities within the purview of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to the S&T Directorate. Additionally, DHS Under Secretary for S&T O'Toole has reprioritized and consolidated ongoing research and development activities within the S&T Directorate. The results of the proposed transfer and current reprioritization and consolidation might change the productivity of DHS R&D activities, which have been criticized by stakeholders as having little to show for the federal investment. Congress did not approve this transfer in FY2011, and the House-passed DHS appropriations bill for FY2012 also does not approve this transfer. In addition, the House-passed DHS appropriations bill would reduce appropriations for R&D in the S&T Directorate by 42% relative to FY2011. This may indicate that the slow rate of return shown by S&T Directorate R&D investments is not acceptable to some congressional policymakers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
