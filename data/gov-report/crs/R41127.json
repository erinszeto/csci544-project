The provisions were deemed to be in violation of the Senate Byrd rule because they had no effect on federal outlays and revenue and thus were extraneous. One provision would have eliminated a requirement established in the CCRAA that the Secretary of Education either reduce or increase the additional mandatory Pell Grant amount in each award year if the budget authority provided for each year was insufficient or exceeded, respectively, the amount necessary to fully fund the prescribed additional mandatory amount in each year. This requirement had never been implemented by ED and would have had no effect on the new provisions offered in H.R. 4872 . The other provision would have established a new rule specifying that the additional mandatory Pell Grant award amount in each award year, as determined by a new formula in H.R. 4872 , could not be less than the additional mandatory award amount for the previous award year.
