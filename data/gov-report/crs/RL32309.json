Chairman Wolf, however, commented that in light of the subcommittee's limited budget allocation for FY2005, the overall budget increase requested by the Judiciary, in addition to the supplemental appropriation requested for FY2004, was \"unlikely.\"", "On June 23, 2004, the House Appropriations Committee approved its CJS-Judiciary appropriations bill for FY2005. The committee-approved measure, H.R. 4754 , provided $5.55 billion for the Judiciary\u2014$414.4 million, or 8.0%, above the Judiciary's total appropriations for FY2004, and $158.8 million below the Judiciary's request. In its report on H.R. 4754 ( H.Rept. 108-576 , p. 85), the committee stated that its recommendation included increases \"to provide inflationary pay and benefit adjustments for court staff; to enhance court security measures; to increase the number of positions to handle workload increases; and to support the Judiciary's core information technology infrastructure.\" Upon the report's release, a staff member on the Appropriations Committee told the weekly publication Legal Times that the recommended 8.0% increase for the Judiciary was one of the largest percentage increases for FY2005 received by any department under the committee's purview.", "The Legal Times story also reported the fears of the Judiciary that Congress might approve a government-wide FY2005 budget under which overall non-defense, non-homeland security discretionary appropriations would be set at FY2004 levels\u2014referred to on Capitol Hill as a \"hard-freeze.\" Federal judges, the Legal Times reported, \"fear such a 'hard-freeze' on spending will leave courts with no money to pay for jury trials or court-appointed lawyers.\" The Legal Times said it remained \"unclear what funding the Senate will decide upon,\" noting that \"[o]ver the past two years, the Senate slashed increases proposed by the House.\"", "In a related development, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) wrote to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to urge sufficient funding for the Judiciary in FY2005. \"A hard freeze,\" Senator Hatch said, \"would truly cripple the federal Judiciary in the coming year, and for years to come.\" The Senator acknowledged that the Appropriations Committee faces a \"difficult task\" in FY2005. \"Nonetheless,\" he added, \"I ask that as the Committee proceeds, it considers the fact that a fully operational federal Judiciary contributes significantly to the security and stability of our country. Judiciary funding should be considered a priority. I urge, at a minimum the courts' funding for FY2005 be sufficient to allow for current services and operations to be continued.\"", "Subsequently, on July 8, 2004, the full House, in its passage of H.R. 4754 , followed the recommendation of its Appropriations Committee in approving $5.55 billion for the Judiciary. The House-passed bill made no changes in any of the Judiciary budget accounts approved earlier by the Appropriations Committee.", "During Congress' ensuing August recess, the Judicial Conference, the policy-making body of the federal Judiciary, unanimously adopted a resolution regarding the Judiciary's FY2005 budget. The resolution, adopted on August 18, 2004, urged Congress and the President to exempt the judicial branch from any FY2005 continuing resolution and to provide full-year FY2005 funding for the Judiciary at least at the current services level approved in H.R. 4754 , the House-passed CJS bill. The resolution stated that it was \"imperative\" that an exemption from any continuing resolution be provided by October 1, 2004. \"To remain at the same funding level at the beginning of FY2005,\" the Judicial Conference said, \"would require the judiciary to begin unprecedented action: cutting operating expenses by 50 percent and either firing or furloughing 10 to 20 percent of all judiciary staff, the equivalent of 2,000 to 5,000 probation, pretrial services, and clerks' office employees. This action would be necessary due to the uncertainty of time and amount of a full-year appropriation.\"", "Shortly after Congress reconvened in September, the Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist reiterated the concerns of the Judicial Conference in identical letters sent to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Democratic Leader Thomas A. Daschle. In the September 13, 2004 letter, the Chief Justice requested that Congress take timely action to provide funds needed by the federal judiciary for FY2005 \"to meet its constitutional and statutory responsibilities.\" The Chief Justice said he was making this request because of reports that Congress might adjourn for the upcoming elections \"without passing an appropriations bill for the judicial branch and that funding for the federal courts would be included in a long-term continuing resolution (CR).\" He added that the Judicial Conference was \"very concerned that, under such a CR, the courts would have to operate at FY2004 funding levels for up to five months until Congress enacts a final appropriations bill.\" This, he said, \"amounts to a hard freeze in appropriations that would be devastating to the judiciary.\"", "Two days later, on September 15, 2004, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its CJS bill, S. 2809 , which provided $5.36 billion for the Judiciary in FY2005\u2014$230.2 million, or 4.5%, above the Judiciary's FY2004 total, and $343.0 million below the Judiciary's request. In its written report ( S.Rept. 108-344 , at p. 121), the Committee declared that its budget recommendation for the Judiciary \"funds programs necessary to maintain current services and retain current employees.\" The Committee said it did \"not support the judiciary's request for program increases for personnel at a time when the judiciary is planning significant furloughs, layoffs, and early out programs.\" It urged the Judicial Conference to consider \"directing all available funds to the local courts to prevent adverse personnel separations instead of attracting new employees.\"", "Less than a week later, on September 21, 2004, the Judicial Conference agreed to implement what the Legal Times reported were \"$225 million in cost-cutting measures, including substantial layoffs and a moratorium that will freeze plans for 42 new federal courthouses.\" The Legal Times quoted the chair of the Conference's executive committee as saying that between 2,000 and 4,800 judicial employees might be laid off in FY2005 if funding for the Judiciary, under a \"hard freeze,\" were indefinitely kept at FY2004 levels. A Judiciary news release explained that 42 courthouse projects on the Judicial Conference's five-year courthouse project plan would be delayed, to help reduce the rate of growth in future rental expenses that the Judiciary pays to the General Services Administration for court facilities. (For FY2004, the news release said, the Judiciary was paying GSA about $900 million in rent for court facilities.)", "In anticipation of action by House and Senate conferees on the two CJS bills, H.R. 4754 and S. 2809 , the chairman and the secretary of the Judicial Conference's budget committee sent a letter, dated October 12, 2004, to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate CJS appropriations subcommittees. The Judiciary officials stated that while, for most of the Judiciary, the House-passed funding levels were \"sufficient to provide for current services, we face significant shortfalls in almost every account if funding is provided at the levels recommended in the Senate bill.\" Moreover, they said, the levels of funding contained in both the House and Senate bills fell short of the Judiciary's FY2005 requirements. Nonetheless, they said, the Judiciary was \"well aware of the overall budget constraints under which you [congressional appropriators] are forced to operate this year.\" Thus, they continued,", "...we have decided not to appeal for the funds necessary to met our FY2005 workload requirements, but instead to appeal for the minimum funding needed to maintain FY2004 levels of services and operations. For most judiciary accounts that is the Housed-passed level of funding, but there are a couple of exceptions where we find the need to appeal to a funding level that is greater than that in both the House and Senate bills.", "On November 20, 2004, the House and Senate agreed to the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4818 ), as reported by conferees for the omnibus bill, and on December 8, 2004, President Bush signed the bill into law ( P.L. 108-447 ). FY2005 funding for the Judiciary is provided for in Title III of Division B of the act (and is discussed in the act's conference report, H.Rept. 108-792 , at pp. 814-818). As noted above, the act, after adjusting for two rescissions, provides $5.43 billion in total spending for the Judiciary, a 5.2% increase over FY2004 funding of $5.16 billion. Specifically, the act appropriates $5.50 billion for the Judiciary as a whole, a 6.5% increase over FY2004\u2014with total discretionary spending, however, reduced by 1.34% as a result of two across-the-board cuts in the act. (One of the cuts reduces discretionary spending in the CJS Division of the act by 0.54%, and the other reduces non-defense and non-homeland security discretionary spending throughout the act by .80%.) The FY2005 omnibus bill includes a provision authorizing a cost-of-living salary adjustment for Justices and judges.", "In the omnibus bill, only one of the Judiciary's 13 accounts (Judiciary Retirement Funds) was unaffected by the 1.34% across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending. Prior to adjusting for the cuts, funding amounts for nine of the 13 Judiciary's accounts were identical to those in the earlier House-passed CJS bill, H.R. 4754 , while the other four accounts received less funding than in the House bill.", "The increased funding levels approved for the Judiciary in the omnibus bill \"averted a disaster,\" according to the Legal Times. \"There was talk,\" the journal reported on November 29, 2004, \"of additional furloughs, nonpayment of court-appointed lawyers and closing courthouses one day a week if no substantial budget increases were made in 2005.\" But \"such drastic scenarios\" were reportedly avoided, when Congress, in the omnibus bill, afforded the Judiciary enough funding to avoid further reductions. \"The bottom line is we're pretty lucky,\" a Judiciary spokesman told the Legal Times , adding, \"Given the budgetary environment, it's about the best you could have hoped for.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2005 Funding Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Supreme Court .", "paragraphs": ["The budget request of the Supreme Court for FY2005, as customary, was in two parts.

To maintain current services in FY2005, the Court said $3.9 million was required\u2014$22.5 million less than required in FY2004. Nearly all of this downward adjustment was due to a decrease of $21.8 million requested for the Court's building modernization project. In its budget submission, the Court stated that funding appropriated in prior years was sufficient to meet planned obligations for the modernization project through FY2005 and that additional funding to complete the project would be requested in FY2006.", "Requested program increases for Building and Grounds totaled $6.7 million. This funding, the Court said, would cover various projects, including modernization of elevators, a seismic safety study, restoration of the original exterior bronze on the Court building, restoration of stonework, additional roof fall protection (for worker safety), kitchen renovations, design for exterior property renovation, and building security upgrades. The largest portion of funding for program increases would be $3.6 million to upgrade building security. This amount, the Court explained in its budget submission, \"would provide for the initial costs of the complex and comprehensive installation of security intrusion alarms, surveillance, monitoring and communications systems in the new operations center for the Supreme Court police force.

Testifying on behalf of the Court's budget request were Associate Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. In addition to querying the Justices about particulars of their budget request, Representatives on the subcommittee sought the Justices' views concerning the idea of constructing a tunnel between the Court and the Capitol Visitors Center. Justice Kennedy expressed reservations about the feasibility of such a tunnel, but told the subcommittee that the Justices would \"get back\" to the subcommittee on the question of whether, in their view, the Court could be linked in some way to the Visitors Center.

Since most of these lawyers are sole practitioners or in very small firms, their sole source of income for the duration becomes the $125 an hour paid by the government, \"well below the rates charged in private practice.\" The $125 rate, Judge Heyburn said, must cover not only the attorney's salary but also overhead expenses, including retirement and benefits and salary for office staff. During the case, \"future work is foregone and the law practice has to be rebuilt at the [case's ] conclusion . . . .\" Further, Judge Heyburn observed, the number of capital cases is increasing.

For this reason, the Committee has continued to provide Federal funds for SJI even though the President's request does not include funding for this organization.\"", "Subsequently, the House on July 8, 2004, in its passage of H.R. 4754 , approved the $2.2 million appropriation to SJI for FY2005, as recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. On September 15, 2004 the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 2809 , which includes an FY2005 appropriation for SJI of $3.0 million.", "In a related development, the Senate on September 30, 2004 by unanimous consent passed H.R. 2714 , authorizing a $7 million appropriation for SJI annually for FY2005 through FY2008. On October 8, 2004, the House agreed to the Senate-amended version of H.R. 2714 , and on October 25, 2004, the bill was signed into law by the President ( P.L. 108-372 ).", "Prior to the Senate action, H.R. 2714 had been approved by House Judiciary Committee on September 10, 2003 (and, as amended, passed by the full House, on March 10, 2004, by voice vote under suspension of the rules). In its report on H.R. 2714 ( H.Rept. 108-285 , at p. 2), the House Judiciary Committee endorsed SJI's continued operation. \"Sustaining the Institute's operations,\" the committee said,", "is necessary because the states, as a practical matter, devote the great majority of their judicial funding to address personnel, construction, and maintenance needs. They simply lack the resources to develop programs that improve the administrative efficiency and overall productivity of their courts.", "SJI serves a Federal interest precisely because it makes state courts more efficient. State courts are the primary fora in which the vast majority of lawsuits are resolved.

For FY2005, the Administration requested $3.0 million for the commission and H.R. 4754 as passed by the House included that amount. The House Appropriations Committee in its report commended the commission for its efforts to promote religious freedom and urged the commission and the State Department to continue work on developing an Index on Religious Freedom that may be used to assess progress within regions and in specific countries. The Senate Appropriations Committee in reporting S. 2809 ( S.Rept. 108-344 ) did not include any funds for the commission.
