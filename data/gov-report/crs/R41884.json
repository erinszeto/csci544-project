Once a major disaster declaration is issued, a wide range of federal disaster assistance becomes available to eligible individuals and households, public entities, and certain nonprofit organizations. Disaster assistance authorized by the Stafford Act is appropriated by Congress and provided through the Disaster Relief Fund.", "Emergency declarations supplement and promote coordination of local and state efforts such as evacuations and protection of public assets. They may also be declared prior to the impact of an incident to protect property, public health and safety and lessen or avert the threat of a major disaster or catastrophe. Major disaster declarations are issued after an incident and constitute broader authority to help states and localities, as well as families and individuals, recover from the damage caused by the event. Fire management assistance grants provide assistance to state and localities to manage fires that threaten to cause major disasters.", "In the aftermath of especially large or damaging incidents discussion can develop considering whether the Stafford Act should be amended to include a fourth category, generally called a \"catastrophic declaration.\" If approved, catastrophic declarations could be invoked for high-profile, large-scale incidents that threaten the lives of many people, create tremendous damage, and pose significant challenges to timely recovery efforts.", "This report examines concerns expressed by policymakers and experts that current Stafford Act declarations are inadequate to respond to, and recover from, highly destructive events, and presents the arguments for and against amending the act to add a catastrophic declaration amendment.

For example, after Hurricane Katrina, numerous studies issued by policy experts, congressional committees, the White House, federal offices of Inspector General, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, concluded that the government response to the hurricane was subject to a variety of deficiencies that occurred at all levels of government. ", "Deficiencies in disaster response and recovery include questionable leadership decisions and capabilities, organizational failures, overwhelmed preparedness and communication systems, and inadequate statutory authorities. Another issue identified after large-scale incidents is that federal assistance has been overly bureaucratic and untimely. Others have argued that the disaster declaration process \"does not provide the necessary framework to manage the challenges posed by 21 st century catastrophic threats.\"", "These conclusions have led to a number of reforms in federal emergency management laws and policies. For example, one proposed reform that has been contemplated by policymakers is an amendment to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (hereinafter the Stafford Act) that would add a new category of disaster declaration known as a \"catastrophic declaration\" for events characterized by extraordinary devastation. Proponents of such a measure would argue that adding a catastrophic declaration provision could streamline response and recovery processes and/or possibly increase the amount of federal assistance provided to states and localities after large-scale disasters. Opponents, on the other hand, would argue that implementing a catastrophic declaration is not necessary and may create confusion for emergency managers and officials. States, they say, might be enticed to request a catastrophic declaration rather than a major disaster, if catastrophic declarations trigger an increased federal share of the assistance.", "This report examines concerns expressed by policymakers and experts that current Stafford Act declarations are inadequate to respond to, and recover from, highly destructive events, and presents the arguments for and against amending the act to add a catastrophic declaration amendment.

Emergency declarations, however, do not provide assistance for repairs and replacement of public infrastructure or nonprofit facilities. Emergency declarations may be declared before an incident occurs to save lives and prevent loss.

Moss and Shelhamer, two policy scholars who have written on the subject, state that catastrophic incidents", "by definition, tend to occur in large metropolitan regions due to the concentration of people and infrastructure. For example, a category 5 hurricane striking an undeveloped coast will generate less damage than a category 3 hurricane hitting a major city. Recent catastrophes include the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (San Francisco), the 1994 Northridge Earthquake (Los Angeles), Hurricane Hugo (1989), Hurricane Andrew (1992), Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005), the Midwest Floods of 1993, and the September 11 attacks of 2001.", "The authors then recommend amending Section 102 of the Stafford Act with the language used to define a catastrophic incident in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Title VI of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007\u2014hereinafter the Post-Katrina Act). The Post-Katrina Act defines a catastrophic incident broadly as", "any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage or disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, or government functions in an area.", "The above definition was used in the Post-Katrina Act for the purposes of improving planning documents by defining the scope of events that should be considered by the Catastrophic Incident Annex of the National Response Framework (NRF). The definition was not used in the context of actual declared disasters nor was it intended to replace the definition of a major disaster in the Stafford Act. ", "The main difference between a catastrophic incident as defined in the Post-Katrina Act and the definition of a major disaster in the Stafford Act is that the former focuses on the event's scope, impact, and severity. In general, a catastrophic incident would carry far-reaching consequences beyond a state's borders and have national implications including the economy, infrastructure, and even national psyche. In contrast, the major disaster definition generally focuses more on categorizing causes that potentially overwhelm states and localities.", "Supporters of catastrophic declarations argue that while \"routine disasters\" can be managed through major disaster declarations, large-scale, destructive incidents warrant their own type of declaration because they pose unique challenges inadequately addressed by major disaster declarations. Examples of such challenges may include", "The President can declare an emergency without a gubernatorial request, if he considers the event to be primarily a federal responsibility, but must wait for a gubernatorial request for most emergencies and all major disasters. The wait for a request could delay the federal response, or federal assistance, or both. The response and recovery efforts associated with large-scale disasters involve multiple federal agencies that require higher levels of leadership to resolve potential inter-agency conflicts, and effectively coordinate and manage response and recovery efforts. Current response and recovery procedures for major disasters are too cumbersome for large-scale disasters because the procedures are too rigid and inefficient to provide assistance at an accelerated rate. Some argue that federal assistance is needed more quickly after large-scale, destructive incidents than routine disasters\u2014the disbursal of assistance provided through a major disaster declaration is too slow to meet recovery needs. Due to the enormous amount of destruction and the economic impacts caused by large-scale disasters, many states and localities are unable to pay their portion of the cost-share.

It should be noted, however, that catastrophic incidents are often no-notice events. Thus, pre-positioning resources may not be possible. ", "As mentioned previously, under certain conditions the Stafford Act authorizes federal support in the absence of a gubernatorial request to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate severe damage. If Congress chose to create a catastrophic declaration, it might elect to amend Section 401 or 402 of the Stafford Act to provide the President with similar authority so as to trigger federal activities such the ones described above. Additionally, the amendment could be designed to signal the immediate deployment of federal response assets and surge capacity forces. Alternatively, some may argue the Stafford Act could be amended to authorize the aforementioned precautionary measures for major disasters without a catastrophic declaration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "During an Incident", "paragraphs": ["The NRF provides the guiding principles for a unified national response by assigning roles and responsibilities to all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, communities, and communities to all types of hazards regardless of their origin. The unified response is further guided by supporting documents known as annexes: Eme rgency Support Functions (ESF) Annexes and Incident Annexes. ", "ESFs group federal agencies by their authorities, resources, and functions related to a particular incident. For example, federal agencies that have capabilities to support the response to an oil spill are listed in ESF #10 - Oil and Hazardous Materials. The ESFs have designated coordinating and supporting federal agencies responsible for supporting the incident response along each functional mission. ", "Similar to an ESF, Incident Annexes identify agencies by their authorities, resources, and functions to support the response a particular incident. Incident Annexes also designate coordinating and cooperating agencies. For example, federal agencies with capabilities to respond to a biological attack are provided in the Biological Incident Annex. Response efforts initiated as planned in ESF and Incident Annexes are executed through various operational plans. One key tenet of the NRF is that the framework is \"scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities\" to respond to all types of hazards, including ones that are catastrophic. ", "In terms of catastrophic incidents, the NRF contains a Catastrophic Incident Annex which provides a strategy for coordinating an accelerated national response to large-scale events. A catastrophic incident is defined in the Catastrophic Incident Annex as", "any natural or manmade incident, including terrorism, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the population, infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, and/or government functions. A catastrophic incident could result in sustained nationwide impacts over a prolonged period of time; almost immediately exceeds resources normally available to State, tribal, local, and private-sector authorities in the impacted area; and significantly interrupts governmental operations and emergency services to such an extent that national security could be threatened. These factors drive the urgency for coordinated national planning to ensure accelerated Federal and/or national assistance.", "According to the Catastrophic Incident Annex, in a catastrophic event, states and localities may not be able to initially establish or maintain a command structure for incident response. In such cases, the federal government might take the lead and coordinate response activities until local, tribal, and/or state authorities are capable of establishing their incident command structure. ", "The development of the Catastrophic Incident Annex can be traced back to the National Response Plan (NRP)\u2014the predecessor to the NRF. The NRP contained guidelines for the implementation of an \"Incident of National Significance.\" According to the NRP, the DHS Secretary could designate an Incident of National Significance if the event met the criteria of paragraph 4 of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5). Generally, an Incident of National Significance would be designated if a no-notice incident occurred in which the need for federal assistance was \"obvious, overwhelming, and immediate, and cannot wait for absolute situational clarity.\" The Incident National Significance designation could be used, presumably, to implement the Catastrophic Incident Annex.", "The Incident of National Significance designation was eliminated due to confusion during the Hurricane Katrina response\u2014primarily because the designation established a different leadership structure than was commonly used for \"routine\" disasters. Despite the elimination, the Catastrophic Incident Annex has been retained in the NRF. It is unclear, however, what criteria is used by the Secretary to put the Catastrophic Incident Annex into effect. ", "Some might argue that the Catastrophic Incident Annex could be useful for a catastrophic incident but that the Annex needs a triggering mechanism or clearly defined criteria to make the Annex operational. They may further argue that a catastrophic declaration would be an appropriate triggering mechanism. However, unlike the Incident of National Significance designation, the response to a catastrophic incident could be developed in a manner that reduces or eliminates confusion.", "Proponents might therefore argue that a catastrophic declaration could be used to trigger the streamlined response activities established in the Catastrophic Incident Annex. Similarly, they may argue that that in addition to triggering the Catastrophic Incident Annex, a catastrophic declaration could be used to streamline response procedures by removing barriers that might slow response times or take steps that would provide flexibility to operational plans by promoting autonomous decisionmaking. The declaration could also be used to trigger a chain of command structure consisting of higher levels of leadership and rank to address the catastrophe.", "Opponents of a catastrophic measure may argue that the scalability of the NRF (and its annexes) makes it capable of responding to a catastrophic event without a unique declaration. They may further argue that, while intuitively appealing, providing additional flexibility during a catastrophic declaration might produce a chaotic federal response because operational plans among federal agencies are tightly coupled with each other. Deviation in response by one agency could have negative rippling effects that could hinder the response of other agencies. They may further argue that using a different command structure would duplicate the problems associated with the Incident of National Significance as well as create additional layers of bureaucracy that impede or hinder the response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "After an Incident", "paragraphs": ["A catastrophic declaration could be used to automatically alter aspects of recovery policies and regulations. Such a declaration could have triggers that would cause a change in the percentage of federal resources as well as adjusting the delivery system of traditional disaster relief programs. The following recovery strategies might be included in the event of a catastrophic declaration. ", "The catastrophic declaration could automatically increase the federal cost-share to lessen the economic impact states and localities incur from catastrophic incidents. The Stafford Act provides that the federal share for the repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities \"shall be not less than 75%.\" A catastrophic declaration could be used to automatically increase the federal share to 90% or perhaps 100%. Moreover, the 72-hour window of 100% funding for immediate federal aid could be extended for a longer period. Early knowledge of such adjustments may accelerate state and local activity because foreknowledge of the adjustment provides states and localities with an assurance of fiscal relief which would then encourage them to act quickly to accomplish necessary repairs and begin comprehensive recovery planning. However, these adjustments can add significantly to the overall cost of the disaster. A catastrophic declaration could trigger a number of changes to recovery programs that could speed assistance and provide increased flexibility. Some of these changes could include the delivery of block grants to states to handle immediate needs and begin infrastructure repairs. An alternative would be for a catastrophic event to (1) switch on \"gap funding\" which provides timely front-end funding to states and localities to cover initial efforts; (2) make straight-time force account labor (for disaster work) by state and local governments eligible for reimbursement; (3) automatically increase funding caps for the Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program; and (4) provide clear authority and resources to FEMA and its federal partners for long-term recovery efforts in partnership with state and local governments. Once declared, catastrophic declarations could trigger certain congressional rules that might prevent potential deadlock over the passage of disaster relief funds for disaster-stricken communities.", "On the other hand, it could be argued that the Stafford Act could be amended to make these changes part of a major disaster declaration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Congressional Action After the Incident", "paragraphs": ["Part of the argument for a catastrophic declaration is that it could provide immediate financial assistance on a broader scale without having to await congressional approval for additional federal assistance through a supplemental appropriation. An examination of the record, however, demonstrates that congressional action on emergency supplemental funding in the wake of large disasters has grown more rapid in recent years (see Table 1 ). ", "It could be argued that Congress has acted expeditiously. While on average, Congress has passed supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance within 38.9 days of the disaster declaration, supplemental funding has been provided in less than a week after an incident (for example, Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 received funding in three days and seven days respectively). Furthermore, in cases where it took Congress longer than 30 days to enact some supplemental appropriations, the incidents for which the funding was enacted generally had fewer damages than the larger, more expensive disasters. The longer time elapsed for Hurricane Sandy could partly be attributed to a relatively large balance in the Disaster Relief Fund at the time of the incident rather than a reluctance to fund disaster assistance.", "The reaction to the devastation caused by the 2005 hurricane season resulted in historic amounts of disaster response and recovery funding. Along with the amount of resources provided by Congress, it could be argued that the Stafford Act is a very flexible instrument that provides broad authority for various forms of assistance. The reluctance or inability of some to administer these authorities in the past does not eliminate their existence or the possible help that can be derived from those broad authorities under any disaster declaration. Authorities such as Section 402 of Stafford for \"General Federal Assistance\" and Section 403 for \"Essential Assistance\" provide FEMA the discretion to use various forms of federal help or to supplement state help to achieve disaster response and recovery goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Catastrophic Events Past and Future", "paragraphs": ["This section analyzes incidents that might be deemed as catastrophic to help frame a debate concerning the need and desirability of amending the Stafford Act to include a catastrophic declaration.

It might be further argued that while many of the most expensive disasters have occurred in recent years, the increased costs associated with such incidents are a function of variables that are not necessarily related to the magnitude of the incidents (such as increased federal expenditures for assistance and recovery projects, the replacement of expensive infrastructure, and the development of previously uninhabited areas).

Amending the Stafford Act to include a catastrophic declaration would presumably be subject to the same limitation\u2014unless the amendment requires some form of measurable criteria that would be applied to make determinations.", "One method that could be used to keep assistance costs down is legislative language that allows a catastrophic declaration to be downgraded to a major disaster if it was determined that damages did not merit a catastrophic declaration. Downgrading a catastrophic declaration, however, may appear indecisive and create confusion.", "Another consideration involves aspects of politics more than policy. It may be difficult for the President to deny a request for a catastrophic declaration because the President might be seen as failing to properly respond to a calamitous event\u2014even if it were declared a disaster.", "Some may argue a catastrophic incident would not receive unique resources that are not already authorized and provided for a major disaster declaration. If this is the case, one might question the need for catastrophic declarations.", "On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ), which included a number of budget-controlling mechanisms. As part of the legislation, caps were placed on discretionary spending beginning in FY2012. If these caps are exceeded, an automatic rescission\u2014known as sequestration\u2014takes place across most discretionary budget accounts to reduce the effective level of spending to the level of the cap. Additionally, special accommodations were made in the BCA to address the unpredictable nature of disaster assistance while attempting to impose discipline on the amount spent by the federal government on disasters. The BCA created an allowable adjustment specifically to cover disaster relief (defined as the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act), separate from emergency appropriations. One notable aspect of the BCA is that it appears to have encouraged larger appropriations for the DRF. ", "In the case of hurricane Sandy, the increased appropriation size to the DRF helped fund the immediate needs caused by an incident without an immediate supplemental appropriation. The larger balance may have also provided Congress with more time to contemplate and target assistance needs. Some may therefore question whether a catastrophic declaration is needed to expedite funding packages.", "A full federal cost-share, if included in a catastrophic declaration, might tempt states to request a catastrophic declaration to increase the amount of federal assistance provided for the incident. If that became the case, a catastrophic declaration would incentivize requests for the declaration and drive up the costs of federal funding for disaster relief.", "The reports issued on the federal response to Hurricane Sandy have generally been favorable. For example, according to the DHS Inspector General, FEMA's response to the damages caused by hurricane Sandy in New York was \"effective and efficient.\" After reading such reports, some may conclude that the federal response to large-scale incidents such as multistate hurricanes has improved since Hurricane Katrina. They may therefore question the need for catastrophic declarations and a more efficient and streamlined response processes.", "Natural disasters on a truly catastrophic scale, such as the San Francisco earthquake, the fire of 1906, and Hurricane Katrina, are infrequent, and might be called \"100-year events.\" If used for such events, the catastrophic declaration might not be put to use for an extended period of time. If a catastrophic declaration is used infrequently, it might become antiquated over time and fail to meet the needs of the incident. Furthermore, infrequent use of the declaration could create confusion because lawmakers and officials may have to become reacquainted with the declaration before applying its provisions. Thus, it could be argued that these incidents would be better handled through special legislation on an as-needed basis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Alternatives to a Catastrophic Declaration", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the strongest rationale for the development of a catastrophic declaration grew out of the Hurricane Katrina response and recovery experience which began in 2005 and now, nearly ten years later, is still the focus of debate and the template for legislative attempts aimed at improving response and recovery.", "While considering the possible changes and improvements that could potentially be a part of a catastrophic declaration, reviewing the changes that have been made since the Katrina disaster could be useful.", "The Post-Katrina Act made some significant changes to the Stafford Act. Since the changes were not retroactive and could not be applied to the Katrina disaster, the actual program adjustments have not been fully tested. These changes include", "The authority to provide case management for disaster victims. This change provides assistance for a major disaster where large numbers of people may be displaced and need help in understanding the assistance that is available, and to connect people, particularly those with special needs, with other forms of help from both public and private sources. Removal of the $5,000 cap on home repairs to make a home habitable . Under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, home repairs were limited to $5,000 with the remainder of work to be accomplished with a Small Business Administration disaster loan, assuming an applicant qualified for the loan. Since the Post-Katrina Act, repairs can be done for up to the maximum amount available under the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). Pilot Program for Public Assistance (PA). The PA pilot program accelerated debris removal at the local level by permitting payment of straight time wages to government employees involved in debris removal work and encouraged local communities to have a debris removal plan in place by decreasing the state and local share by 5% of costs (from 25% to 20%). This authority expired in 2008. FEMA intends to develop regulations to implement provisions of the PA pilot. This would include a public comment period and related parts of the rule-making process. While FEMA considers this \"a priority of the Agency\" it has not yet determined a timeframe for publication of the proposed rule. Pilot Program for Individual Assistance (IA). This pilot program permitted FEMA to make repairs on privately owned rental units to increase the available housing stock after a disaster event. Reports by FEMA indicate that this was a successful program that decreased temporary housing costs in comparison to other housing alternatives. The authority for the program expired on December 31, 2008. As with the PA Pilot, FEMA released a report two years ago on the IHP pilot program. The report concluded that \"Analysis and recommendations on additional authorities will be provided at a later date.\" FEMA now has determined that \"through our existing authority, that we may repair multi-family rental housing units for use by disaster survivors.\u00a0We expect to implement this authority in future disasters, as appropriate.\"", "Similarly, following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Congress enacted the Hurricane Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act (SRIA). This legislation made several changes to the Stafford Act that could arguably influence the federal government's ability to respond to catastrophic events in the years to come. Some of those changes include:", "Alternative Procedures for Public Assistance . As with the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-290 ), SRIA provided FEMA the authority to administer the PA program based on cost estimates, thus hopefully accelerating the repairs of public infrastructure. These procedures could also speed up debris removal and the repairs of private non-profit facilities that perform a public function. The authority to provide child care services to the families of disaster victims . This category is now considered an eligible expense under the \"Other Needs Assistance (ONA)\" grants which are a part of Section 408, the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). The ONA grants are cost-shared with the state. The IHP program is generally the disaster housing provided but also includes limited ONA grants for clothing, furniture, and other uninsured needs following a disaster. Advance Funding in the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). 56 The HMGP program is the principal post-disaster source for mitigation funds to reduce future hazards. The program is cost-share on a 75% federal/25% state and local basis. Because the amount of funds allotted to the program is determined by a percentage of total disaster spending, the program has usually lagged behind other elements of the recovery process. In order to step up the process, SRIA authorized FEMA to advance up to 25% of the estimated HMGP award. Joint Environmental and Historical Reviews . In an action related to expedited processes for both Public Assistance and Mitigation programs previously discussed, SRIA directs the creation of a joint process for environmental and historical reviews. Such a joint process is intended to expedite the administration of disaster recovery projects.", "Taken together, these changes to the Stafford Act have created a more flexible framework that can more easily be scaled up to meet the needs of extraordinary events. However, as the discussion of adding a catastrophic declaration attests, there is considerable debate concerning whether additional changes are necessary to increase FEMA's ability to assist state and local governments and individuals and families affected by disasters.
