Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.", "At the same time, Congress has protected other information from public release. Access to government actions and information is often in tension with information protection. Certain government actions and records are protected from public release for, among other reasons, national security and personal privacy reasons.", "President George Washington, in a March 1796 speech in the House of Representatives, for example, refused to provide the House with a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States in the Treaty with the King of Great Britain, sending the chamber a message that read as follows:", "[t]he nature of foreign negotiations requires caution; and their success might often depend on secrecy; and even, when brought to a conclusion, a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely impolitic: for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations; or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and mischief, in relation to other Powers.", "Among the congressional powers available to enforce federal transparency and to protect certain other materials from public release are the powers to legislate, hold hearings, issue subpoenas, and control the federal budget. Congress has, from time to time, used its legislative powers to create and amend laws that affect the public's access to government operations and records. Among these laws are the Federal Register Act, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Government In the Sunshine Act, and the Privacy Act.", "Although there are laws that affect access to government information, there is no single definition for what constitutes transparency\u2014nor is there an agreed upon way to measure it. Social scientists and practitioners have offered a variety of definitions for transparency; among them are \"active disclosure\" and \"the publicizing of incumbent policy choices.\" These two definitions convey that transparency is linked to the release of information to an interested public. Transparency , however, may be defined as not only the disclosure of government information, but the access, comprehension, and use of it by the public. Scholars and private organizations have attempted to measure transparency by surveying citizens and journalists on their perceptions of government openness as well as by examining executive branch implementation of FOIA. These measures have sometimes relied on public perceptions of transparency or journalists' accounts of information access. Each definition and measurement of transparency has strengths and weaknesses.", "Attempts to make the executive branch more transparent require Congress, the public, and the executive branch itself to ensure that appropriate information is released and that the information can be used and analyzed. Users of such released information, therefore, must have the time and the tools to interpret and understand the data in order to hold government accountable.", "Congress plays an active role in defining the balance between transparency and secrecy in American democratic society. While openness in government is considered essential to democratic operations and deliberations, secrecy can protect Americans from security threats, privacy invasion, and economic harm. As agencies increasingly use new technologies to collect, maintain, and release federal records and data, Congress may have an interest in ensuring that the public has the ability to find and use the data properly. Additionally, Congress may choose to determine whether agencies are inappropriately withholding documents or improperly releasing sensitive materials.", "Accordingly, this report assesses scholarly and practical definitions of transparency and provides an analysis of the concept of transparency, with a focus on transparency in the executive branch of the federal government. It also examines how the release of large amounts of public data may make the operations of government more or, counter-intuitively, less transparent.

Oliver, in his book What is Transparency? wrote that transparency has come to mean \"active disclosure.\" Other scholars have defined government transparency as \"the publicizing of incumbent policy choices,\" and \"the availability and increased flow to the public of timely, comprehensive, relevant, high-quality and reliable information concerning government activities.\" ", "In addition to scholarly definitions of transparency, private organizations that serve as government watchdog groups have put forth their own meanings. Transparency International, a global civil society organization that seeks to fight government corruption, defines transparency as \"a principle that allows those affected by administrative decisions, business transactions or charitable work to know not only the basic facts and figures but also the mechanisms and processes.\" The organization goes on to state that \"[i]t is the duty of civil servants, managers and trustees to act visibly, predictably and understandably.\"", "The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit organization \"committed to improving access to government information by making it available online,\" does not offer a particular definition of transparency.

Some scholars and government practitioners may argue that defining transparency is difficult, but they understand it in practice. Transparency International, for example, surveys a variety of people and institutions on their perceptions of transparency in selected nations to create a \"Corruption Perceptions Index.\" The index supposes that perceptions of corruption serve as a proxy for transparency in government. Though the two may be related, it is unclear whether corruption or perceptions of corruption provide a reliable measure of a particular government's efforts to be transparent.", "Global Integrity, an independent, non-profit organization that tracks \"governance and corruption trends around the world,\" uses journalists' reports and structured surveys to create its Global Integrity report, which measures \"governance and corruption.\" Like the Corruption Perceptions Index mentioned above, however, this measure might capture only perceptions of openness and perceptions of corruption, without capturing a nation's efforts to be transparent, or reach acceptable levels of transparency.", "Scholar Justin Fox, who studied levels of transparency within the United States, took the approach of examining the integration of FOIA's principles into the operations of executive branch agencies. He examined whether FOIA was incorporated into each agency's performance plan, how much agencies spent on implementing FOIA, and whether the agency established performance measures for implementation of FOIA. Mr. Fox's research captured how agencies respond to information requests, but did not address proactive transparency\u2014a practice in which agencies release records, datasets, or other information without it having to be requested from someone outside the agency. Proactive, sometimes called pre-emptive, transparency would eliminate the need that information be requested because the information would already be publicly available. A person who submits a FOIA request, however, may need knowledge and skills unique to that request. For example, the requester must know that a document exists in order to request it. The requester must also know how to properly draft a FOIA request and to where they should address the request. Requesters also must understand limitations on certain information requests, including the possible denial of a request based on the government's claims that the release of a record or portion of a record could endanger national security, invade an individual's privacy, or cause harm to the economy. Mr. Fox's measure of transparency assumes FOIA requesters already know what records are available as well as how to use those records if they are released. His study, therefore, may not measure U.S. transparency, and instead may measure how effective the public is in using FOIA\u2014a single tool of federal transparency.", "Scholar Archun Fung examines \"transparency systems,\" or \"government mandates that require corporations or other organizations to provide the public with factual information about their products and practices.\" The effectiveness of these systems, Mr. Fung argues, can be measured, in part, by how accessible and useful information is to the audience who receives it. ", "No matter how accurate or relevant new information is, it cannot provide a foundation for a successful transparency system unless it is made available at a time, place, and in a format that fits in with the way consumers, investors, employees, and home buyers make choices as information users and the way corporations, government agencies, and other organizations make decisions as information disclosers.", "For Mr. Fung, therefore, transparency can only be effective \"when transparency systems provide highly relevant and accessible information that users incorporate into the considerations that determine their actions.\" This is one of few considerations of transparency that require the public to both access and use information. ", "In a January 2012 New York Times news analysis, journalist Elizabeth Rosenthal reinforced this idea, arguing that disclosure of information was not the same as transparency. ", "One fundamental problem is that disclosure requirements merely get information onto the table, but themselves demand no further action. According to political theory, disclosure is both a citizen's right and a tool to ensure good government and consumer protection, because it provides information that leads to informed decisions. Instead, disclosure has often become an endpoint in the chain of responsibility, an act of compliance with the letter of the law rather than the spirit of transparency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transparency and Secrecy", "paragraphs": ["An accessible and transparent government is one goal of a functioning democracy, but access to government information may not always be warranted or safe.

If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary options.", "Madison argued that government needed to be controlled, and the people were the most powerful tool to do so. Control over the government would come in the form of an informed citizenry.

If they once become inattentive to public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, judges and governors would all become wolves.", "Although access to executive branch information has been of interest to America's leaders from the Founding Fathers to the present day, certain records may require protection from public release. The meetings in Philadelphia at which the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution, for example, were held in secret. In T he Federalist Papers , John Jay wrote of times when secrecy can convince participants in a negotiation to be more open and frank in their discussion. ", "It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever nature, but that perfect secrecy and immediate dispatch are sometimes requisite. There are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.", "In 2007, then-U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker, for example, called transparency a \"key to our nation's governing processes.\" On January 21, 2009\u2014his first full day in office\u2014President Obama issued an executive order that said he would commit his Administration to \"an unprecedented level of openness\" and to the establishment of \"a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.\" Private watchdog organizations have had mixed reviews of this initiative.", "The tension between access and secrecy was typified after the public release of diplomatic cables to the Wikileaks.org website. Diplomats who fear the information they write in such cables may be released to the public may be \"more cautious\" about the contents. Such caution could lead to less candid transfers of information between government officials. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton called the Wikileaks.org release \"not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests. It is an attack on the international community\u2014the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations, that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity.\" The Wikileaks.org release may have made foreign diplomacy more visible in this case. The release of documents may or and may not affect how foreign officials communicate with American officials. In the future, however, diplomatic negotiations may be pushed further from public access because of the leak. Diplomats may also struggle to conduct more candid conversations with world leaders who are concerned that their conversations may be released to the public. Then-Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, however, reportedly said that the leak would not greatly affect American diplomacy. At a November 30, 2010, press conference, Mr. Gates is reported as saying the following:", "Now, I've heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on. I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought. The fact is, governments deal with the United States because it's in their interest, not because they like us, not because they trust us, and not because they believe we can keep secrets. Many governments\u2014some governments deal with us because they fear us, some because they respect us, most because they need us. We are still essentially, as has been said before, the indispensable nation.", "The federal government may claim, for example, that the release of certain information will endanger national security, violate the privacy of an individual, or affect an ongoing criminal investigation. Mr. Madison, in Federalist 10 , had foreseen the need for certain records protections, writing that \"[d]emocracies have been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.\" The American republic, therefore, has to balance access to government information with protection of personal and national security interests. ", "Max Weber, a sociologist who studied bureaucracy in the late 1800s and early 1900s, wrote extensively on public administration\u2014with some focus on the role of public employees' expertise. According to Weber, keeping employees' expertise within the bureaucracy (as opposed to sharing expertise with outside government officials or the public) gives an agency greater autonomy and control of its mission. Federal employees may withhold information to ensure that their agency maintains control and can avoid outside, sometimes political, influence. Mr. Weber, for example, wrote the following:", "Bureaucratic administration always tends to exclude the public, to hide its knowledge and action from criticism as well as it can.\u2026 In facing a parliament, the bureaucracy fights, out of a sure power instinct, every one of that institution's attempts to gain through its own means \u2026 expert knowledge from the interested parties. Bureaucracy naturally prefers a poorly informed, and hence powerless, parliament\u2014at least insofar as this ignorance is compatible with the bureaucracy's own interests.\u2026 The absolute monarch too, is powerless in the face of the superior knowledge of the bureaucratic expert\u2014in a certain sense more so than any other political head.", "Throughout American history, public access to information has ebbed and flowed. Sometimes that access has been based on the legal interpretations of individual presidential administrations. Other times, historical context modified how the federal government maintained, protected, and released records. For instance, one scholar argued that the importance of federal government transparency grew after World War II because of unprecedented growth in the size of the bureaucracy and the emergence of the Cold War, which created a \"highly secretive national security complex.\" ", "Today, technology affects how the public interacts with the federal government as well as what information people expect from it. Increasing ubiquity of the Internet and the rise of e-government have given the public 24-hour access to certain government information and changed some public perceptions and expectations about government operations.

Oversight, for example, is an implicit constitutional power and obligation of Congress. According to historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., \"it was not considered necessary to make an explicit grant of such [oversight] authority. The power to make laws implied the power to see whether they were faithfully executed.\" Congress, therefore, can hold hearings at which representatives from executive branch agencies describe and defend their information access practices.", "Constitutional oversight and statutes are not the only mechanisms that have shaped executive branch transparency.

Adjudication, on the other hand, is concerned with determination of past and present rights and liabilities.

Initial tasks undertaken by an agency include deciding what goods and/or services to buy, choosing a suitable source selection method (e.g., sealed bidding or negotiated contracting), and drafting a solicitation which it then posts on the federal government's Federal Business Opportunities website. Using this website, a business or other interested party identifies possible contracting opportunities.

Schooner identifies transparency as one of nine objectives frequently associated with government procurement, and suggests that system transparency is one of the three \"pillars\" that underlies the federal government's procurement system. System transparency exists when \"a system employs procedures by which offerors and contractors (and even the public at large) ensure that government business is conducted in an impartial and open manner.\" Examples of ways in which the federal government's procurement system maintains transparency include the following: statutes, regulations, and policies are publicized; an agency makes its requirements publicly available so that anyone may view them; every solicitation describes how offers will be evaluated; unsuccessful offerors receive contract award information (e.g., the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the award) and may receive an agency debriefing; bid protest procedures are in place and publicized; and offices of inspector general provide oversight.

Notably, exemption 4 of FOIA permits \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\" to be exempt from disclosure. Government contractors rely on this exemption to protect proprietary and confidential information\u2014such as their cost and price data\u2014from public disclosure. Releasing this information might compromise a government contractor's competitive position, particularly if competitors obtained the information. Concerns on the part of the private sector extend to the FAPIIS database, which could contain information that is inaccurate or misleading, or that is \"easily misinterpreted by people not familiar with the intricacies of government contracting or who view a contractor's involvement in a routine business dispute as a negative reflection on its integrity, attorneys said.\" Turning to the government, the possibility that agencies might be required, at some future date, to post contracts online provides insight into agencies' concerns. An agency's ability to negotiate contracts effectively possibly could be hampered by this proposal, unless the agency is permitted to redact certain information. An agency's negotiating position on the terms and conditions of a particular contract\u2014such as the size of an award fee or the details of the delivery schedule\u2014could be undermined if the contractor has information showing that the agency gave more favorable terms to other companies.

If so, the requester may need additional knowledge about FOIA's exemptions and case law that may support or oppose the withholding.

Private citizens and representatives of particular interests can serve on advisory committees, provided the committee is required to adhere to FACA's requirements. The public is provided access to FACA committee meetings and records. FACA prohibits committees from performing any function outside of advising\u2014FACA committees may not implement any of their recommendations and they cannot require the federal government to implement the recommendations. In all cases, a federal officer must determine whether to implement FACA recommendations. ", "Although FACA allows public participation in the policymaking process, it still requires the public to attend meetings, which may be difficult or impossible for those who do not live in the area where a committee meeting is held. FACA also provides post-hoc access to government information, because a member of the public who is unable to attend the meeting can access meeting records after it takes place. In some cases, federal agencies may be using new technology to make meetings and records more accessible. For example, some agencies place committee records online and make audio or video recordings of the meetings available online. Additionally some departments or agencies, including Health and Human Services, webcast meetings and permit online audience members to submit questions to committees in real time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Open Government Directive and Attempts at Proactive Transparency", "paragraphs": ["More recent government actions have adopted a more proactive form of transparency. As noted above, the Open Government Directive requires agencies to release a variety of new datasets to the public before they are requested. With a multitude of new datasets and other information available to the public, the Obama Administration has stated it will be the duty of the public to keep agency performance in check. This \"crowdsourcing,\" or using the collective opinions of a mass, online audience, may improve the quality of data that are released to the public by allowing more people to search through datasets. On Data.gov , for example, users can rate datasets using a five-star scale. Moreover, users can click a link to \"Contact Dataset Owner\" and send the administrator of the data an e-mail with thoughts or comments on the data. The public can also \"flag\" the dataset for one of five reasons: copyright violation, offensive content, spam or junk, personal information, or other. Individuals who contact agencies are asked to provide their e-mail so they may receive a response from the contact point. It is unclear whether agencies are required to respond to comments.", "Crowdsourcing may improve data and operations, but only for agencies that read and respond to comments and suggestions. Additionally, agencies need to make clear whether the data that are made available are complete and list their limitations. The federal datasets may also provide opportunity for nonpartisan scholars to access and analyze datasets and create new tools to help the public better understand how government operates and provide oversight of federal data creation. Crowdsourcing, however, may give those members of the public with more time and resources more opportunity to review and analyze federal data. ", "Releasing these datasets to the public also assumes that the public will have the knowledge, capacity, and resources to evaluate the data, offer valid insights, and reach replicable results and verifiable conclusions. Inadvertent or purposeful manipulation of the datasets may allow certain groups or individuals to present unclear or skewed interpretations of government datasets, or reach questionable conclusions. As agencies release hundreds or thousands of datasets, users may need specialized knowledge to identify appropriate datasets to meet their needs. Counterintuitively, this releasing of datasets may decrease executive branch transparency. For example, users may have to sift through thousands of datasets to determine which ones include the information they seek. It may be difficult for a researcher to pinpoint the dataset he or she needs in a collection of similarly titled datasets. Other data may be made available in a format with which a researcher is unfamiliar. Making the data public without explicit user guidance does not necessarily make the data more accessible.", "The Administration's focus on so-called \"smart disclosure\" may allow a greater proportion of the public to both access and use federal data and information. The guidance does not require agencies to employ smart disclosure strategies, but may encourage agencies to identify and consider methods of releasing data and records in ways that are timely and comprehensible. Congress may consider whether agencies should be required to implement certain smart disclosure strategies. Oversight of the implementation of smart disclosure strategies, however, could be difficult. Members of Congress may not be familiar with each of the vast amount of datasets held by each agency, nor may they be aware of unique sensitivities of these data. Additionally, there may be significant costs associated with adapting certain datasets and vernacular to more standardized and accessible formats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policymaking, Outside Influence, and Public Participation", "paragraphs": ["Congress or the public may also have concerns about both the abilities and the affiliations of those who access government data, comment on federal regulations, or participate in federal government meetings. Most public participation may come from special interest groups that have the time, resources, and knowledge to engage with federal agencies. Using websites and other technology to solicit public opinion may, therefore, strengthen relationships between certain individuals or organizations and federal agencies\u2014granting certain participants greater and faster access to policymakers. ", "Congress may believe that executive branch policymakers should be more insulated from organized, sometimes partisan interests. Scholars have found that lawmakers play a significant role in creating or limiting the opportunities that private organizations have in accessing administrative agencies. Yet other scholars have found that attempts to insulate policymakers may result in restricted access for less-organized, smaller private organizations, while the wealthier, larger groups maintain access. ", "Collaboration with the public may generate new ideas that could promote cost savings, assist in the distribution of benefits, or make the federal government more effective. Scholars have noted that public access to federal records and meetings may also provide oversight of the administrative process and increase \"bureaucratic accountability.\" Congress may decide that the federal government already provides the proper amount of formalized access to administrative agencies, and that private organizations are provided the proper amount of access to policymakers. As noted throughout this report, the public has opportunities to participate in the regulatory process, to access certain federal records, and to attend certain public meetings. Many times, however, these opportunities come only after the federal government makes a formal proposal or takes formal action. Additionally, these opportunities require the public to have the time and resources to ask for records or attend meetings.", "Limiting public access to public records or agency meetings during the policymaking process could increase the influence of groups that have the greatest resources while alienating groups that may have interesting policy ideas but few resources. Conversely, limiting access could provide policymakers the opportunity to work more efficiently and without as much partisan influence. As noted above, however, limiting access would not provide all opinions equal access to the policymaking process and could curtail public oversight of the administrative processes of the federal government. Increasing access to various aspects of the policymaking process could lengthen certain administrative processes, like the regulatory process, the operations of advisory committees, or federal contracting. Increasing access could also distort the design of a representative democracy by diminishing the role of the elected official \"to refine and enlarge the public views.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
