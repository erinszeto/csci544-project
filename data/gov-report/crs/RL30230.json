Welfare diversion comes in a variety of forms, such as lump sum payments, vendor payments, supportive services, and resource referral. In addition, applicant job search is used by some states as a diversion activity.", "Sometimes it is not easy to identify what diversion is and what it is not. A procedure like eligibility screening may be a form of diversion when it is carried out in a certain manner, while at other times it may merely be part of an eligibility review. Diversion payments generally are equal to several months' benefits. They usually are offered as a one-time payment in lieu of extended cash benefits. Acceptance of a diversion payment ordinarily makes a family ineligible for TANF assistance for a certain period of time.", "According to the latest available reported data, 28 states and the District of Columbia provided lump sum diversion payments to TANF applicants; 16 states and the District of Columbia required TANF applicants to engage in active job searches before their application for TANF was approved; and 15 states were using a fairly aggressive form of resource referral. Under the final TANF regulations, non-recurrent, short-term benefits (e.g., diversion) for crisis situations (provided for no more than four months) do not count as TANF assistance. Since diversion is not considered TANF assistance, families receiving diversion aid are not subject to TANF work requirements, time limits, child support assignment, or data reporting requirements.", "This report discusses welfare diversion and state use of diversion strategies.

In some instances, the TANF state plans submitted to qualify for federal block grant funds were used to supplement incomplete information. In addition, this report includes information from state data reports and state Internet sites on the numbers of families being diverted from TANF assistance.

Readers should note that although applicant job search and resource referral are considered diversion strategies, they are not considered diversion assistance in Table 1 or the Appendix ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Throughout much of its history, cash welfare to families represented a paradox for both policymakers and the public: On the one hand, policymakers wanted to provide a minimum level of financial assistance to needy families. However, on the other hand, they wanted to prevent those families from falling into dependency. Since the late 1960s, concerns over the size and cost of the welfare system\u2014and its effects on the parents and children that it serves\u2014have led federal welfare policymakers to promote work as a path to self-sufficiency.", "During the early 1990s, many states had moved forward with their own demonstrations and initiatives under waiver authority in Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (i.e., referred to as Section 1115 waivers) to promote self-sufficiency of welfare families. One method that some states used to promote self-sufficiency was to divert individuals who were either job-ready or had other sources of income from becoming welfare recipients by offering them a one-time financial payment as an alternative to enrollment in the now repealed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. According to some observers, states have historically tried to keep some people off the welfare rolls. In the past, this was sometimes accomplished by warding off requests for aid by not providing program information to the public; omitting information about certain program benefits or services to persons who came to the welfare office with the intention of applying for assistance; speaking to people in a condescending or derogatory manner; asking personal or embarrassing questions; requesting unnecessary documentation; and delaying application interviews. In addition, several states offered relocation assistance to certain AFDC-eligible families. Under this \"relocation\" practice, some families eligible for AFDC benefits were encouraged to leave the state to pursue employment opportunities in other areas or were told that an inexpensive bus ticket to another state could result in the family receiving higher monthly AFDC benefits.", "In 1996, policymakers concurred with assertions that for significant numbers of poor families, receipt of cash welfare had become a permanent state rather than a temporary phase. P.L. 104-193 , the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, signaled the end of an era. It was generally agreed that mandatory work requirements, together with a lifetime limit on cash welfare benefits, would \"end welfare as we know it\" by moving parents from welfare to work, encouraging responsibility, and improving children's lives. Under the 1996 law, eligible low-income families with children were no longer entitled to a cash welfare benefit (AFDC); instead, federal funds were sent to the states in the form of a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, under which states have had almost complete control over program eligibility and benefits.", "The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) does not contain specific diversion provisions, nor does it contain any prohibitions against the use of diversion programs. Thus, states are able to include diversion programs among their array of \"welfare\" related strategies if they so choose. Some differences between past efforts at deterrence and current diversion practices include the following: (1) states, on a widespread basis, have formally incorporated diversion programs and activities into their TANF programs; (2) diversion is viewed as helping families maintain their independence from welfare; (3) diversion focuses attention on a family's specific circumstances and needs. During the past several years, as part of their diversion activities, several states (Kentucky, Washington, Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas, Colorado, and Michigan) have offered relocation assistance to TANF-eligible families as a substitute for ongoing TANF benefits. However, unlike prior relocation practices, states now appear to be focused on encouraging families to move to where they may be more likely to find jobs. In many instances this may be within the state rather than out of the state.", "The number of families on AFDC/TANF dropped from a high of 5.1 million in March 1994 to 1.9 million in September 2005. During the March 1994-August 1996 period, many states were under Section 1115 waivers testing innovative approaches to reducing the welfare rolls and promoting self-sufficiency. These numbers, however, don't highlight the number of families that were diverted from the TANF rolls.", "Before 1999, there were only a couple of studies pertaining to state diversion policies and practices. This is no longer the situation. On April 1, 1999, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sent out a notice inviting applications for FY1999 funding for studies on the status of applicants and potential applicants to the TANF program, individuals and families in the TANF program, and individuals and families who leave TANF. Six out of the seven FY1999 Welfare Outcomes Grants were awarded by ASPE to states that proposed to study the impact of welfare reform on TANF applicants. Subsequent to the FY1999 grants, another four states received ASPE funding. The 10 ASPE grantees with an applicant diversion component to their studies included the following states (see footnote below for citations): Arizona, two consortia of counties in California, Florida, Illinois, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, Milwaukee County, and Wisconsin. The reports of these studies have been completed. Most of the reports discuss a variety of information about individuals and their families who were formally or informally diverted from TANF, including their economic and noneconomic well-being and participation in government programs. Readers should note that only Texas and North Carolina studied \"formal\" diversion programs. The other states did not study this population partially because of low participation in formal lump-sum diversion assistance programs. A synthesis of some of the diversion studies funded by the ASPE indicates that a significant proportion of families who were diverted from TANF were receiving TANF benefits some 12 months later.", "The final rule on the TANF program was published in the Federal Register on April 12, 1999. Under the final regulations, non-recurrent, short-term benefits (provided for four months or less) for crisis situations do not count as TANF assistance. Further, child care, transportation, and work supports for employed families are not considered \"assistance.\" Since diversion is not to be considered TANF assistance, families receiving diversion aid are not subject to TANF work requirements, time limits, child support assignment, or data reporting requirements.", "Ten years after the 1996 welfare law was enacted, the TANF block grant program was reauthorized. P.L. 109-171 , the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (enacted on February 8, 2006) included, among other things, an extension of the basic TANF block grant through FY2010 at an annual $16.5 billion funding level. P.L. 109-171 requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services issues regulations regarding the TANF program by June 30, 2006.", "In FY2004, $271 million in combined federal and state funds was spent on cash payments for diversion assistance or other non-recurrent short term benefits (i.e., emergency assistance, housing aid, transportation aid, etc.)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is Diversion?", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, one strategy states are using to reduce the need for ongoing welfare is referred to as \"diversion\"assistance. By expanding the requirements that families must meet in order to be eligible for TANF benefits and referring families to alternative resources, diversion programs have the potential to dramatically alter state approaches to providing assistance to poor families with children. Families are diverted from receiving monthly cash TANF payments if they can be persuaded to be assisted through other means or persuaded to use other resources. Before the 1996 welfare reform law and some pre-1996 state waivers, when families applied for cash welfare benefits, the emphasis was on determining their eligibility for assistance and completing their application. Now, in many states cash assistance is viewed as a last resort, and diversion assistance is viewed as a positive alternative to going on welfare.", "In states with diversion programs or activities, the primary emphasis is on determining what a family needs to support itself. This could be a one-time cash payment to deal with an emergency or minor crisis, support services such as child care, transportation, or health care benefits, or help finding a job. These types of services and aid may enable a family to maintain its self-sufficiency without actually going on welfare.", "Diversion typically is designed to be a program, activity, or payment that is intended to divert TANF applicants from ongoing TANF benefits and instead substitute short-term cash assistance or other services to meet immediate needs. Diversion payments generally are equal to several months' benefits. Their purpose is to help families meet temporary emergencies. It is generally offered as a one-time payment in lieu of extended cash benefits. Acceptance of a diversion payment usually makes a family ineligible for TANF assistance for a certain period of time. Welfare diversion comes in a variety of forms such as lump sum payments, vendor payments, supportive services, and resource referral. In addition, applicant job search is used by some states as a diversion activity. Sometimes it is not easy to identify what diversion is and what it is not. According to Nathan and Gais, an activity like eligibility screening may be a form of diversion when it is carried out in certain ways, while other times it may simply be part of an eligibility review. Some staff view diversion as \"preventing\" applicants from becoming recipients, others view it as \"helping\" applicants find other appropriate tools to remain independent of ongoing assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lump Sum Payments", "paragraphs": ["The one-time lump sum payment approach is designed to keep families with a short-term financial need, who may not need ongoing assistance, from entering the welfare system. The lump sum payment may be in the form of cash, a voucher, or a vendor payment. Under the lump sum payment approach, caseworkers screen TANF applicants to determine if a lump sum payment can effectively address the immediate reason for the TANF application. In some cases, in order to receive the lump sum payment eligible applicants must have work-related needs directly affecting their ability to obtain or maintain employment, such as loss of transportation due to needed car repairs. In other cases, eligible applicants can have a variety of short-term or emergency needs such as overdue rent or utility bills or child care problems. One-time cash payments can help families support themselves in a number of ways. Such payments may enable families to get their cars repaired so they can get to work, make overdue rent payments so they can avoid eviction from their homes, or get through a medical emergency that temporarily precludes work. Unlike emergency assistance under AFDC, which generally was provided to prevent destitution and homelessness among families (particularly welfare families), diversion aid is provided to families who just need a modest boost in income to remain off the welfare rolls.", "According to a 1999 HHS-funded report by the George Washington University (GWU) Center for Health Policy Research,", "States' early efforts to divert families from the welfare rolls focused primarily on providing families facing short-term crises with the financial resources needed to resolve those crises. Because of this early focus and the widespread adoption of lump sum payment programs, these programs are often perceived as the primary mechanism through which families are being diverted from the welfare system. However, our case studies reveal that, in practice, lump sum payment programs are rarely used ... Thus, unlike broadly targeted applicant job search programs, lump sum payment programs are unlikely to result in widespread diversion from the welfare system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Applicant Job Search", "paragraphs": ["Providing families assistance with job search and requiring applicants to engage in job search activities before they can qualify for monthly cash assistance may enable some individuals to find jobs and be diverted from the welfare rolls. The mandatory job search approach requires TANF applicants to engage in job search before applying for benefits and is designed to encourage individuals to find employment quickly to eliminate their need for cash assistance. In some cases, the TANF applicant is diverted from cash welfare because he or she finds a job; in some cases because the person already has income and does not have time to engage in any type of structured job search; and in some cases, the applicant finds the requirements of the program (e.g., number of employer contacts, formal meeting, etc.) too stringent or stressful and he or she abandons the idea of TANF assistance.", "According to a 1999 GWU study,", "\"Work First\" programs have formed the core of most state efforts to build an employment-focused welfare system. These programs, characterized by their emphasis on rapid entry into the labor market, encourage recipients to take the first job that comes along, expecting that their first job will not be their last and that it is far easier to move into a better job from a bad job than from no job at all. Applicant job search programs take the work first concept to its logical extreme: they seek to encourage or require families to look for employment immediately so as to obviate the need for them ever to receive assistance in the first place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource Referral", "paragraphs": ["The availability of support services such as child care, transportation assistance, and health care benefits combined with food stamps, but not tied to the receipt of monthly cash benefits, may sometimes be enough to enable some families to maintain their self-sufficiency without going on welfare. The resource referral approach encourages TANF intake workers to explore with the applicant other forms of assistance that may be available to them, such as child care assistance, transportation assistance, aid from family and/or friends, referral to drug treatment programs, etc. This approach is seen as a by-product of the perspective that welfare is a temporary, last-resort option, rather than the only course of action available to the family. The referral approach does not guarantee that families will obtain the services or help that they need.", "According to a 1999 GWU study,", "Among all diversion activities, efforts to link applicants for cash assistance with alternative resources are the least common: in our analysis of state efforts to divert applicants from TANF, only seven states indicated they are making a concerted effort to explore alternative resources with applicants before proceeding with an application for TANF. As TANF caseloads fall and the pressure of time limits mounts, it is possible that more and more localities will explore ways to link applicants for assistance with alternative resources, providing cash assistance only when all other avenues have failed. In addition to being the least utilized option for diverting applicants from the welfare rolls, linking families with alternative resources is also the least understood diversion strategy, possibly because, as our case studies reveal, it is possible to link families with alternative resources in very different ways.", "Readers should also note that in the late 1990s, when many states began implementing diversion programs, most applicants for welfare benefits viewed TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid as a package, and thereby many families who were diverted from TANF or denied TANF benefits mistakenly believed that they were ineligible for food stamps and Medicaid as well. This perception has been corrected, and it is now generally agreed that it is no longer a problem. In fact, during the period FY2000-FY2005, food stamp participation increased 49%, from 17.2 million in FY2000 to 25.7 million in FY2005. Similarly, although Medicaid enrollment numbers for adults and their dependent children dropped in 1996 and 1997, they have been increasing since then. The number of Medicaid recipients (adults and their dependent children) was 24.8 million in 1995, dropped to 23.9 million in 1996 and to 22.6 million in 1997, increased to 26.9 million in 1998, and reached 37.8 million in 2002 (the latest available data)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formal Versus Informal", "paragraphs": ["As far back as the 1960s, many individuals and organizations publicly complained that more people were turned away informally than were formally denied assistance. Informal diversion results when program rules and requirements discourage families who might otherwise be eligible for TANF benefits from applying for them. It is reported that some potential recipients of TANF are being diverted from pursuing their applications simply by learning of the stronger work and child support enforcement requirements at orientation; and that other families who expect that they will be required to explore alternative resources even though they do not believe those resources can meet their needs, may choose not to bother to apply for TANF benefits.", "According to a 1998 HHS-funded study by the GWU Center for Health Policy Research,", "We define informal diversion as diversion that occurs as a response to program rules and requirements that are intended to impose a stricter set of expectations on recipients even though a potential TANF recipient has not participated in those activities. For example, some families who know they will be expected to look for work immediately (or almost immediately) may choose to look for work and find it on their own, eliminating their need to apply for assistance. Other families may not apply for assistance because they anticipate that they will not be able to meet the higher expectations set forth by the new program. Others may choose not to apply because they assume they are no longer eligible under the new program rules.", "A 2003 study found that each of the sites (Ramsey County, Minnesota; San Diego County, California; Mercer County, New Jersey; Providence, Rhode Island; Cook County, Illinois; and Bibb County, Georgia)", "...normally requires at least two visits to the office to complete the application process, providing the opportunity for applicants to drop out of the process. Moreover, most sites also include a screening interview or a program orientation. These activities, often completed on the day of the initial visit to the office, allow for a preliminary exchange of information that may convince applicants that they are likely to be found ineligible, that they do not want to comply with one or more application requirements, or that the expected benefits from going through the process are too small to be worth the trouble.", "The sites that have implemented applicant job search requirements have introduced an activity that has increased the burden in time and cost for applicants. In fact, in the site with the most stringent job search requirement (Cook County), 62% of the study sample either decided not to apply for TANF or did not complete the application process\u2014a proportion nearly twice that of most other sites.", "Most analysts agree that informal diversion is hard to detect because it can have either positive or negative consequences, depending on the circumstances of the diverted families. Also, the family's reason for accepting diversion assistance or for not pursuing TANF assistance may be ambiguous in that the family may be discouraged with the application process or the rules of the TANF program, or the family may be confused about their options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Policy and Regulations Concerning Diversion", "paragraphs": ["On April 12, 1999, the final rule on the TANF program was published in the Federal Register.

Further, child care, transportation, and work supports for employed families are not considered \"assistance.\" Since diversion is not to be considered TANF assistance, families receiving diversion aid are not subject to TANF work requirements, time limits, child support assignment, or data reporting requirements.", "In the discussion of the regulations, HHS stated,", "...we realize that diversion activities are an important part of state strategies to reduce dependency and that restrictive federal rules in this area could stifle the States' ability to respond effectively to discrete family problems. We also understand that subjecting families in diversion programs to all the TANF administrative and programmatic requirements would not represent an effective use of TANF or IV-D [child support enforcement] resources. For example, it does not necessarily make sense to require that, for a single modest cash payment, the state must open up a TANF case, collect all the case-record data which that entails, require the assignment of rights to child support, open up a IV-D case, and start running a federal time-limit clock.", "HHS further stated that much of the diversion aid is work-focused (including supports provided to individuals participating in applicant job search), and that the benefits to the families are non-recurrent and short-term in nature and therefore would not undermine the TANF provisions on work, time limits, or self-sufficiency.", "Pursuant to the final regulations, HHS is collecting only aggregate level spending information on diversion programs and activities. The exclusion of diversion activities from the definition of \"assistance\" means that HHS is not collecting disaggregated data (i.e., detailed information on individuals, such as age, race, and educational attainment) on the diversion caseload. Persons who receive diversion aid are also excluded from the aggregate caseload count. However, because of the importance of some of these \"nonassistance\" approaches to self-sufficiency, the final regulations added three new annual reporting requirements that concern diversion, including requiring states to provide a description of the non-recurrent, short-term benefits they are providing. Beginning October 1, 1999, states also were required to include (1) the eligibility criteria for these benefits (together with any restrictions on the amount, duration, or frequency of payments); (2) any policies they have implemented that limit such payments to families eligible for assistance or that have the effect of delaying or suspending eligibility for assistance; and (3) any procedures or activities developed under the TANF program to ensure that individuals diverted from TANF benefits receive appropriate information about, referrals to, and access to Medicaid, food stamps, and other programs that provide benefits that could help them successfully move into employment.", "Although states do not need to report on the characteristics of diverted families since diversion is not considered \"assistance\" under the final regulations, the aggregate spending data, together with studies on state diversion activities, provide some information on the use and effect of diversion programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advantages of Diversion Programs", "paragraphs": ["One of the advantages of diversion programs is that they may help families facing temporary financial problems get the immediate short-term financial assistance they need to obtain or retain a job.
