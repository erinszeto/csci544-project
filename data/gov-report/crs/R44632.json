From 1901 to 2010, global sea levels rose an estimated 187 millimeters (mm; 7.4 inches), averaging a 1.7 mm (0.07 inch) rise annually. Estimates are that the annual rate rose to 3.2 mm (0.13 inches) from 1992 to 2010. Although the extent of future sea-level rise remains uncertain, sea-level rise is anticipated to have a range of effects on U.S. coasts. It is anticipated to contribute to flood and erosion hazards, permanent or temporary land inundation, saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwaters, and changes in coastal terrestrial and estuarine ecosystems.", "Some states, such as Florida and Louisiana, and U.S. territories have a considerable share of their assets, people, economies, and water supplies vulnerable to sea-level rise. In 2010, roughly 100 million people lived in U.S. coastal shoreline counties. Increased flood risk associated with sea-level rise may increase demand for federal disaster assistance and challenge the National Flood Insurance Program. Federal programs support local and state infrastructure investments that may be damaged or impaired, such as roads, bridges, and municipal water facilities. Sea-level rise also is anticipated to affect numerous federal facilities.", "Global and Relative Sea Levels. Sea levels are expressed in terms of global sea levels, which is the average value of sea surface heights around the globe, and relative sea levels, which is the sea level relative to the land surface. Since 1900, expanding oceans due to warming ocean water and melting glaciers and ice sheets have been the main drivers of global sea-level rise. Oceans have warmed due to a combination of natural variability and the influence of greenhouse gas emissions on atmospheric temperatures. Similarly, glaciers and ice sheets since 1900 have been melting due to both natural variability and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2012, the U.S. National Climate Assessment expressed very high confidence in global sea levels rising at least 0.2 meters (8 inches) but no more than 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) by 2100.", "There are regional and local variations in the rate of sea-level rise. Regional or local factors can be natural, such as the land rebounding upward after continental ice sheets melted at the end of the last ice age, or they may be due to human activities, such as groundwater pumping, oil and gas extraction, sediment compaction, and land management practices, among others. With few exceptions, sea levels are rising relative to the coastlines of the contiguous United States, as well as parts of the Alaskan and Hawaiian coastlines.", "Policy Considerations. Policy choices related to sea-level rise have the potential to shape the future development and resiliency of U.S. coasts. Policy options include a continuation of current government programs and policies, actions that address the forces contributing to sea-level rise globally or locally, and actions that reduce the vulnerability to and consequences of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts. For all the policy options, there are underlying questions of costs and benefits and who bears the costs of pursuing or not pursuing the policies. A challenge for federal lawmakers is how to deal with the tension between federal efforts to manage national and federal government risks (e.g., federal disaster costs, coastal ecosystem shifts) related to sea-level rise and the local and state roles in shaping coastal development and ecosystem health. Related policy questions include the following: To what extent do federal programs, regulations, and funding influence how coasts develop and redevelop? Who is responsible for the costs associated with adjusting to sea-level rise? Who will bear the risks associated with vulnerable coastal development and infrastructure? Some stakeholders are concerned that governments at all levels are paying insufficient attention to the risks posed by sea-level rise; others are concerned that overestimating the risk of sea-level rise could result in foregoing current uses of coastal areas and promoting overinvestment and overdesign of sea-level rise mitigation and adaptation.", "CRS In Focus IF10468, Sea-Level Rise and U.S. Coasts, also provides a brief overview of sea-level rise science and policy options."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Although the extent of future sea-level rise remains uncertain, sea-level rise generally is anticipated to have a range of economic, social, and environmental effects on U.S. coasts.

Many of these people may not be directly exposed to sea-level rise but may experience indirect effects on their communities or shoreline amenities. Of the U.S. coastal shoreline population, nearly 8 million people live in the 1% coastal flood zone (i.e., area in which the annual probability of coastal flooding is 1 in 100 or higher). Sea-level rise represents an increase in coastal flood and erosion hazards for exposed and protected shorelines, potentially expanding inland the 1% coastal flood zone. Higher sea levels may allow coastal storms to affect more people and cause more damage, which can result in broader social and economic effects. ", "Higher sea levels increase permanent or temporary coastal land inundation, change shoreline dynamics and coastal erosion, and increase saltwater intrusion and hydrodynamic changes to coastal freshwater aquifers. These impacts are anticipated to result in more nuisance flooding and impeded drainage, more loss of lands to inundation, more shifts in habitat types (e.g., freshwater wetlands converting to brackish wetlands), less freshwater supply, and potential water-quality impairment. These changes may affect coastal species as well as coastal developments and their amenities (e.g., sandy beaches). ", "Sea-level rise affects the federal government both directly and indirectly. Federal facilities (e.g., military installations) and federal projects, such as navigation improvements and coastal storm damage reduction projects, often are located on U.S. coasts. Federally assisted infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, and docks, also may be affected by sea-level rise; they may experience more intermittent flooding or a decrease in their useful life. Private-sector enterprises and individuals own or control large portions of coastline real estate and infrastructure. If sea-level rise contributes to flooding and associated damages, the federal government can become involved through disaster assistance and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for homeowners and businesses. Much public infrastructure is uninsured. ", "Several federal agencies are affected by sea-level rise and address sea-level rise in their work. The following are examples of how federal agencies are involved with sea-level rise:", "Science . Federal entities engaged in understanding sea-level rise include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the Department of the Interior. NOAA, USGS, and other federal agencies survey coastlines and conduct research to understand coastal processes, hazards, and resources. Flood Mitigation and Recovery . The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security works to reduce flood losses through risk-mitigation activities and disaster response and recovery, including the NFIP. Federal Facilities, Projects , and Programs . The Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have extensive coastal facilities that are central to their missions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) in the Department of Defense also has significant civil works in coastal areas, including its navigation improvements and its coastal flood risk reduction projects. A significant number of federal agencies have projects and programs that are relevant to or used in coastal areas that may be affected by sea-level rise, such as the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Environmental Protection and Restoration . Department of the Interior agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service), NOAA, Army Corps, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also are involved in coastal ecosystem restoration and protection activities. Regulatory and Planning . Much private and nonfederal coastal construction may also require Army Corps and EPA permits. Coastal states and territories develop and maintain their coastal zone management programs under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA; P.L. 92-532, 16 U.S.C. \u00a71451-1464) as implemented by NOAA. ", "Future development and economic growth along U.S. coasts may depend, to a certain extent, on the perceived risk of coastal hazards and the efficacy and efficiency of policies and investments at the local, state, and federal levels to mitigate that risk. Arguably, rising sea levels and extreme coastal storms during the 20 th and now 21 st centuries generally have not curtailed growth and investments along U.S. coasts. A long-standing concern has been the extent to which the federal government may contribute to vulnerable coastal development directly or inadvertently (e.g., federal disaster assistance, federal infrastructure programs, and federal tax policies). For example, some contend that local stakeholders may make decisions that benefit them under the anticipation that they will receive federal disaster assistance when coastal flooding occurs.

What Is Sea-Level Rise?", "paragraphs": ["Two descriptions of sea level are commonly used by scientists: global sea level (GSL) and relative sea level (RSL). "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Global Sea Level", "paragraphs": ["Global sea level (GSL, sometimes global mean sea level ) is the average height of the Earth's oceans, as measured by satellite altimetry relative to a calculated reference ellipsoid. These global measurements, available since the first satellite ocean altimeters were placed in orbit in 1992, are combined so that the height of the world's oceans can be averaged into one number. The GSL value is significant because it allows scientists to measure trends, namely GSL rise, without having to consider whether the land surface is moving up or down along the coastline.", "Since 1992, satellites have measured an average GSL rise of about 3.2 mm per year (with a measurement error of +/- 0.4 mm per year, so that the range of GSL rise is 2.8 mm-3.6 mm per year). (See Table 1 and Figure 1 .) Thermal expansion of the oceans and melting from glaciers have been the dominant contributors to 20 th -century GSL rise. Meltwaters from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have also contributed to GSL rise, and these contributions may have increased in the 21 st century. Another contributing factor comes from water storage on land\u2014water impounded behind dams would reduce the amount of GSL rise because less water reaches the oceans, whereas groundwater pumped from wells would contribute to GSL rise because more water reaches the oceans as runoff or in other parts of the hydrologic cycle. ", "Since the early 1990s, the satellite record has provided a relatively direct measurement of GSL. However, this record is short\u2014about 25 years\u2014compared with other sea-level measurements using tide gages. Tide gage records stretch back to the 18 th century in Europe, and systematic tide gage measurements began in the United States in the 19 th century. Several investigations have applied a variety of techniques to estimate the trend in GSL since the beginning of the 20 th century using tide gage data. (See Figure 2 .) The IPCC reported that even though different strategies were employed to account for changes in land motion, it is very likely that GSL rose an average of 1.7 mm per year (+/- 0.2 mm per year) from 1901 to 2010 (about 187 mm total, or approximately 7.4 inches). The IPCC also reported that it is likely that the rate of GSL rise increased from the 19 th century to the 20 th century. The average rate of 1.7 mm per year since 1901 is less than the rate measured by satellite altimeters since 1992; however, the rise in GSL has not been constant, according to the IPCC. For example, the IPCC reported that the trend of GSL rise in the satellite era is very likely higher than the average rate since 1901 but noted that it is also likely that GSL rose between 1920 and 1950 at a rate similar to that observed since 1992. ", "Other factors complicate interpretation of satellite measurements, such as the role of volcanic eruptions. One recent study noted that the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 had a cooling effect on the atmosphere, which affected sea-level rise, suggesting that the era of satellite measurements began in a highly anomalous environment. The study used a combination of modeling and analysis of satellite altimeter data to surmise that the Mt. Pinatubo eruption may have masked an acceleration of GSL that might otherwise have occurred. The study further concluded that barring another volcanic eruption, satellites may detect an acceleration of GSL rise in the coming decade. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regional Variation in GSL", "paragraphs": ["GSL represents the average value for the elevation of the surface of the world's oceans, but any particular location in Earth's oceans will likely differ from the average value. Several factors influence sea-surface height at any particular location on Earth. For example, average sea-surface heights off Bermuda are typically 1 meter higher than average sea-surface heights off Charleston, SC, because the Gulf Stream changes direction toward Bermuda. For the United States, average sea-surface heights are about 20 centimeters higher on the Pacific Ocean side than the Atlantic Ocean side because the water is less dense, on average, in the Pacific due to prevailing weather and ocean conditions.", "Overall GSL is rising, as Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Table 1 show; however, significant regional variation in trends of sea-surface height around the globe\u2014in addition to the factors discussed above\u2014adds further complexity. For example, coastal communities on the U.S. West Coast did not experience significant sea-level rise from 1993 to 2012, even though the global average rose 3.2 mm per year, because the eastern Pacific Ocean exhibited a decrease in sea-surface height (shown in blue on Figure 3 ). That decrease in sea-surface height has been attributed to natural climate variability, such as El Ni\u00f1o, and the resulting changes to winds, ocean currents, temperature, and salinity, all of which affect sea level. However, some research indicates that the trend may have stopped and even reversed since 2012. This research indicates that another natural source of climate variability, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), is undergoing a shift that is leading to higher sea levels in the eastern Pacific and lower sea levels in the western Pacific since 2012, the opposite of what is shown in Figure 3 ."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Relative Sea Level", "paragraphs": ["Relative sea level (RSL) refers to the elevation of sea level relative to the land surface from which it is measured. In many parts of the U.S. coastline, the elevation of the land surface is changing, due to a number of different causes. A change in RSL represents the combination of the change in land surface elevation and the change in GSL. At any two spots along the U.S. coastline, the trend in RSL value may be significantly different. This variation occurs because of the regional variation in GSL (discussed above) combined with regional variation in how the land surface elevation is changing. Figure 4 illustrates how different the change in the trend of RSL can be within the United States.", "As the colored dots on Figure 4 indicate, the trend and direction of RSL varies dramatically in the United States. RSL is rising at a rate of 9 mm-12 mm per year along Louisiana's Mississippi Delta region near New Orleans, and RSL is dropping along parts of the Pacific Northwest coastline and southern Alaska. The land surface is sinking in places such as coastal southern Louisiana, increasing the rate of RSL rise, and the land surface is rising in parts of Alaska, outpacing the rise of GSL.", "RSL rise has been recorded primarily using tide gages. In the United States, the National Water Level Observation Network, currently operated by NOAA, provides tide gage sea-level data from 210 stations, two of which date to the 1850s. The tide gage network was established to ensure that nautical maps; shoreline maps; and elevations of homes, levees, and other coastal infrastructure were accurately referenced to sea level.

The oceans have warmed due to a combination of natural variability and the influence of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on atmospheric temperatures. Similarly, glaciers and polar ice sheets have melted since 1900 due to a combination of natural variability and GHG-induced climate change and deposition of pollutants. ", "The global factors driving RSL change include those that influence GSL, but in some cases regional or local factors are responsible for the largest changes in RSL along the coastlines. These regional or local factors can be natural, such as the land rebounding upward after continental ice sheets melted at the end of the last ice age, or they can be due to human activities, such as groundwater pumping, oil and gas extraction, sediment compaction, land management practices, or other factors.

Melting glaciers, combined with seawater expansion, explain about 75% of the rise in GSL over that period.

GSL has risen at an average of 1.7 mm per year since about 1880, as shown in Figure 2 .

Further, the IPCC states that sea level will continue to rise for centuries, with the amount dependent on future GHG emissions. In its assessment of future GSL rise, the U.S. National Climate Assessment expressed very high confidence that GSL will rise at least 0.2 meters but no more than 2.0 meters by 2100 (i.e., at least 8 inches to as much as 6.6 feet). For coastal communities, highly confident assertions that sea level will rise are significant for planning. However, the difference between a rise of 0.2 meters and a rise of 2.0 meters between now and the year 2100 could signify different approaches to planning for, mitigating, and responding to the effects of sea-level rise. This is discussed in more detail below in \" Part II. Sea-Level Rise and U.S. Coasts .\"", "Both the rate of future global sea-level rise and its exact dependence on future GHG emissions appear uncertain for several reasons. Probably the biggest uncertainty is the future behavior of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. ", "Estimates of the Antarctic ice sheet contributions to GSL rise between now and 2100 vary widely. Continued GHG-driven warming in the future could create instability in the large ice sheets of West and East Antarctica and lead to collapse. The collapse of large Antarctic ice sheets presents the largest potential for sudden GSL rise, but current scientific understanding of ice sheet dynamics does not identify what factor or factors would unambiguously lead to a rapid and unstable ice sheet retreat.", "In Greenland, melting has exceeded snow accumulation over the last few decades, so its ice sheet appears to have contributed to GSL rise. This trend is expected to continue and even increase in the next century. Unlike Antarctica, however, Greenland does not appear to be at risk of sudden ice sheet collapse. ", "Because the future behavior of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is relatively uncertain, an additional GSL rise of a few tenths of a meter on top of current projections is possible in the latter half of this century. GHG-driven climate forcing appears to be the main driver for future GSL rise. This implies that policies directed toward reducing sea-level rise would need to address the issue of global GHG emissions as a long-term approach to mitigating the effects of GSL rise.

GIA raising land elevation is occurring most rapidly where the ice was thickest in North America about 20,000 years ago, during the peak of the last ice age, in the region around Hudson Bay and in parts of the southern Alaskan coastline (see Figure 4 ). However, as the land previously buried under thick ice is now rising, land in most of the contiguous United States is sinking. This land is sinking in response to GIA because as the ice pressed down on the crust in the north 20,000 years ago, the land not buried under ice tilted up. Now the reverse is happening, and land previously tilted up is tilting back down, like a continent-sized seesaw. For much of the U.S. coastline, downward tilting is occurring at rates between 0.5 mm and 2 mm per year. For the U.S. East Coast, land subsidence from GIA is about 1 mm-2 mm per year. Policymakers cannot change GIA, but coastal communities could account for its contribution to RSL in their planning, mitigation, and response activities.", "Plate tectonics and natural compaction of sedimentary layers in places such as river deltas are two other naturally occurring processes that cause vertical land movement. Regional uplift in parts of the Pacific Northwest coastline is likely occurring in response to tectonic activity associated with the Cascadia subduction zone (see Figure 4 ).

For example, groundwater withdrawals in the southern Chesapeake Bay region have accounted for more than half of overall land subsidence in the region\u2014about 1 mm-5 mm per year. Combined with GIA, these withdrawals have resulted in the region having the highest rate of RSL rise on the U.S. East Coast ( Figure 6 ). On the West Coast, land subsidence due to groundwater pumping was first recognized in the Santa Clara Valley in California. At the northern end of the valley, land adjacent to San Francisco Bay dropped 2 feet-8 feet in elevation by 1969 since groundwater pumping began in the early 20 th century, resulting in 17 square miles of formerly dry land sinking below high-tide level.

Oil and gas pumped to the surface decreases pressure in the reservoir, and the reservoir system compacts, resulting in land subsidence. Land subsidence in the Houston-Galveston area in Texas from both groundwater and oil and gas extraction has resulted in RSL rates exceeding 25 mm per year in some locations at different times in the 20 th century. Oil and gas pumping-induced subsidence is largely restricted to the production field, whereas subsidence from groundwater pumping may have a more regional effect. Land subsidence in the Houston-Galveston area and the high rates of RSL rise likely have increased the frequency and severity of flooding in the region.", "Land subsidence also occurs when organic rich soils (often called peats ) are drained of water for agricultural or other purposes. Organic rich soils can be up to 80%-90% water by volume. When these soils are drained, the effects of compaction, desiccation, and oxidation can result in subsidence. Reclamation of organic rich soils mainly for agricultural purposes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California led to land subsidence of up to 25 mm-75 mm per year in places, resulting in some Delta islands subsiding as much as 15 feet below sea level.

For example, unconsolidated sandy coasts have the capacity to adjust to changing conditions if nearby sand sources are available. The availability of sand can be influenced by forces and events that shape coastal sediment transport and dispersion. For developed and rocky areas, a direct relationship between sea-level rise and inundation is likely.

For example, local entities may approve coastal developments that are at risk and make related public infrastructure investments in roads, schools, water systems, and the like, if the local entities believe federal disaster assistance (and related federal tax treatment of disaster losses) would be available when a coastal disaster occurs. This is also the case for decisionmaking by private interests. Some of the burden of the risk is transferred from the private interest and local government to the federal taxpayers. Another aspect that may be shaping decisionmaking behavior is a decision bias to underrate the risks, especially related to low-probability, high-consequence events such as large coastal storm surges.
