For example, when federal employees use personal e-mail to conduct official business, the communication is considered a federal record.", "P.L. 113-187 expressly empowers the Archivist, in cases where there is disagreement over whether particular materials constitute a federal record, to determine \"whether recorded information, regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record\" for purposes of the FRA and states that his determination \"shall be binding on all Federal agencies.\" Nothing in the FRA would suggest that an agency would have the authority to override the Archivist's final determination.

As noted earlier in this report, pursuant to provisions in the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 ( P.L. 113-187 ), in any case where the Archivist determines recorded material to be a record, that final determination is binding on the agency.

The PRA details which presidential records and materials NARA is to assume responsibility for at the end of a President's Administration. Records governed by the PRA are not subject to the requirements of the FRA.", "Presidential records are defined in 44 U.S.C. \u00a72201 as", "documentary materials, or any reasonably segregable portion thereof, created or received by the President, his immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose function is to advise and assist the President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.", "As a consequence of this definition of presidential record, some components of the Executive Office of the President are governed by the PRA while other components are governed by the FRA. For example, within the EOP, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of the Vice President, and the Office of Administration are governed by the provisions of the Presidential Records Act. The Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, on the other hand, are generally governed by the FRA. The office of the EOP component that employs a record's creator or recipient would ultimately determine whether a particular piece of information would be treated as a federal record or a presidential record. ", "The central differences between the PRA and the FRA are (1) the presumption of the permanence of all presidential records; and (2) the PRA governs access to presidential records in addition to their collection and retention. Pursuant to the PRA, all presidential records are provided to NARA when the President leaves office. All of these presidential records are considered permanent records and are eventually preserved at the appropriate NARA-administered presidential library for public access. On the other hand, only 2%-3% of all federal records are transferred to NARA for permanent retention. Additionally, the PRA's provisions detail presidential record collection, retention, and access . The FRA's provisions, in contrast, focus principally on records management and archival preservation, collection, and retention.

Similar to a new prohibition placed on those governed by the Presidential Records Act (PRA), these amendments to the FRA would prohibit the use of a \"non-official electronic messaging account\" to create a record, unless that e-mail is concurrently sent or forwarded to an \"official electronic messaging account\" within 20 days. The law, however, does not define \"non-official electronic messaging account.\" Additionally, no definition is provided for \"official electronic messaging account.\" The definition of record , as noted above, includes \"all recorded information ... made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law.\" The FRA's definition of record would seem to suggest that content of the information, and not the platform in which it was created, would determine whether it qualified as a federal record. The terms \"official electronic messaging account\" and \"non-official electronic messaging account,\" therefore, might have no effect over whether a particular record qualifies as a federal record pursuant to the FRA. Alternatively, the Archivist could issue an interpretive rule in the Federal Register that could provide a clarifying definition for \"non-official electronic messaging account.\" ", "In many cases, the .gov e-mail addresses of federal employees are equipped with automated e-mail archiving technologies.
