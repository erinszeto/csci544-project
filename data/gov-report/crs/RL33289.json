For children of disabled or retired workers, the child's benefit is generally equal to 50% of the parent's primary insurance amount (PIA) before adjustments.

Child benefits generally apply to all biological children of a worker (assuming that paternity/maternity has been established) and to legally adopted children. Stepchildren may be eligible in some cases, as may some legally adopted grandchildren, with their benefits being determined on the basis of their grandparents' earnings record.

The analysis presented in this report relies on SIPP data for April 2013, the latest month in common from data released for the full SIPP sample.

As discussed in greater detail in the Appendix , which describes the methodology used in this report, it is not possible to precisely identify the Social Security beneficiary status of children on the SIPP. Among the estimated 8.5 million children living in families that received Social Security in April 2013 based on SIPP data, an estimated 3.2 million (37%) were in families in which Social Security was reported as having been received on behalf of at least one of the children in the family\u2014a number quite close to the 3.3 million child recipients reported by administrative data, four months earlier. (See Figure 1 .) As noted in the Appendix , most, but not all, of these 3.2 million children from the SIPP are probably child beneficiaries. Another 1.9 million (22%) lived in families where a parent or guardian reported receiving Social Security benefits, though not directly on behalf of a child. These 5.1 million children are grouped together in analyses that follow as child beneficiaries and children of parents or guardians that receive Social Security. The remaining 3.4 million children (40%) lived in families where Social Security was received by someone other than a child or the children's parent(s) or guardian(s); in such cases Social Security benefits may have been received by an extended family member (e.g., grandparent, aunt or uncle, cousin, niece or nephew) or an older adult sibling.

Also, the after-the-fact comparison of poverty status by family Social Security receipt doesn't take into account the effect that Social Security itself has in reducing poverty.

The comparison of \"pre-transfer poverty status,\" based on a measure of family income that excludes the amount families received from Social Security, to \"post-transfer poverty status,\" which includes the Social Security benefits families received, provides one indication of Social Security's effect on reducing child poverty.", " Figure 3 shows, for example, that 47.8% of children living in families that received Social Security would have been considered poor based on their families' incomes from sources other than Social Security. When Social Security is added back into these families' incomes, child poverty is cut by nearly half, to 24.8%\u2014a level about equal to that of children living in families that do not receive Social Security (23.3%). On this basis, Social Security lifted nearly 2.0 million children (1.952 million) above the poverty line in April 2013. (See Table 2 .) It should be noted that this effect is limited to just the 8.5 million children that are in families that received Social Security, which noted earlier, amounts to just about 11.6% of all children.", "If one examines the relative effect of Social Security on the poverty status of all 73.0 million children in the U.S., overall, the effect appears much more modest. (See Table 2 .) In all, 19.082 million children were estimated as being poor in April 2013, on a pre-transfer basis, or 26.2% of all children.

Among children in families that receive Social Security, 34.4% have family income below 125% of the poverty line , compared to 29.8% of children in families that don't receive benefits. Among children in families that receive Social Security, 43.7% have family incomes below 150% of the poverty line , compared to 36.4% of children in families that do not receive Social Security.

Comparing the two groups, the former group ( Figure 4 ) has a much higher pre-transfer poverty rate (54.2%) than does the latter group ( Figure 5 ) (38.4%). In families where Social Security benefits are received on behalf of children or by parents or guardians, Social Security reduces their poverty rate from 54.2% to 27.2%, a rate that is still significantly higher than that of children in families that don't receive Social Security (23.3%). In contrast, for children living in families where Social Security is received only by extended or other family members, Social Security reduces their poverty rate from 38.4% to 21.3%\u2014slightly below that of children in families that don't receive Social Security (23.2%).", " Figure 6 shows the relative share of estimated aggregate dollars going to children's families, based on their families' pre-transfer poverty status (i.e., poverty based on total income, excluding Social Security income that the family reports receiving). The figure shows, for example, that based on SIPP data, families with children reported receiving about $6.053 billion in Social Security benefits in April 2013, or about $72.635 billion on an annualized basis. Of these benefits, an estimated 44.1% (about $2.671 billion, or about $32.050 billion on an annualized basis) went to families who were poor based on their total cash income, excluding any Social Security benefits they received . (See Table 3 .) Thus, over two-fifths of Social Security dollars paid to families with children goes to children who would otherwise be counted as poor. Among families with child beneficiaries, about $3.847 billion in Social Security benefits were reported in April 2013 (about $46.167 billion on an annualized basis). Of this amount, nearly half (49.2% , $1.892 billion, or $22.702 billion on an annualized basis), went to families that had total incomes, excluding Social Security , below the poverty line, which is more than five times the estimated $4.485 billion in federal cash welfare spending under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program in FY2013. Whereas TANF may be considered \"target efficient,\" in terms of targeting the poor, in that nearly all TANF dollars go to families that are poor on a pre-transfer (pre-TANF) basis, Social Security plays a much greater role in reducing poverty among children than does TANF."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "paragraphs": ["The estimates presented in this report are based on survey data and are subject to respondent misreporting.

In April 2013, an estimated 3.148 million children under age 18 on the SIPP were identified as Social Security child beneficiaries on the basis of a parent or guardian indicating that they had received Social Security benefits on behalf of a child.
