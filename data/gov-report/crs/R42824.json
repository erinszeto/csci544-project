The RFS requires the use of renewable biofuels in transportation fuel\u2014for 2013, the mandate was 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel. Within the larger mandate, there are sub-mandates (\"carve-outs\") for advanced biofuels (e.g., biomass-based diesel and cellulosic fuels). By 2022, the RFS requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, including 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. For 2014, EPA has proposed lower mandates than those scheduled in EISA.", "The RFS is a market-based compliance system in which obligated parties (generally refiners and/or terminal operators) must submit credits to cover their obligations. These credits\u2014Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs\u2014are effectively commodities that can be bought or sold like other commodities. For each gallon of renewable fuel in the RFS program, one RIN is generated. Each RIN is a 38-digit number, with blocks of digits corresponding to various data, including the year the RIN was generated, the producer of the fuel, and the type of fuel. RINs are valid for use in the year they are generated and the following year.", "From the beginning of the RFS program, there have been concerns with RIN generation and the RIN market. Because of concerns over transposed digits, allegations of double-counting (intentional or unintentional) and other errors and inaccuracies, when EPA finalized rules for the RFS as expanded by EISA (the \"RFS2\"), EPA also established a new transaction system in an effort to address these concerns. All RIN transactions must be cleared through this system, called the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS). From the beginning of the RFS2 EPA has maintained obligated parties must exercise due diligence. Under this \"buyer beware\" system those purchasing or receiving RINs must certify their validity on their own, and they are responsible for any invalid RINs they pass on to other buyers or submit to EPA for compliance.", "In late 2011 and early 2012, EPA issued Notices of Violations (NOVs) to three companies that the agency alleges fraudulently generated a combined 140 million biodiesel RINs in 2010 and 2011. In late 2013 EPA issued an NOV to a fourth company; in early 2014 two men were indicted for fraud in a separate case. Because of these RIN fraud cases, EPA is looking at establishing a system whereby RINs can be certified by third parties registered with EPA. EPA is considering whether such certification would provide obligated parties with an \"affirmative defense\" if RINs are later found to fraudulent\u2014that is, obligated parties would not be liable for penalties under the Clean Air Act for the use of such RINs. Key questions include whether such an affirmative defense would also eliminate the requirement to purchase make-up RINs. EPA proposed a plan in January 2013, but the rule has yet to be finalized.", "Most RINs are bought and sold through private contracts. However, there are also spot markets for RINs, and in 2013, spot prices for conventional ethanol RINs rose dramatically. Prices rose from roughly $0.07 per gallon in early January to over $1.40 per gallon in mid-July. Through the second half of 2013, prices dropped even more rapidly, although they rebounded somewhat in early 2014. Various factors have been identified by stakeholders as potentially causing the price increase, including whether sufficient amounts of ethanol can be blended into gasoline to meet the RFS mandates and the extent to which non-obligated parties are speculating in RIN markets.", "In the 112th and 113th Congresses several congressional hearings have been held and various bills have been proposed to address both RIN issues and the overall RFS."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58 ) established a renewable fuel standard (RFS), requiring the use of biofuels (such as ethanol) in the nation's fuel supply.

The RFS mandate has been a major impetus to the development of U.S. biofuels industries, especially the ethanol and biodiesel industries.

By 2013, production had increased to roughly 14 billion gallons of ethanol and over 1 billion gallons of biodiesel.", "Covered parties meet their obligations under the RFS by surrendering renewable fuel credits to EPA equal to the number of gallons in their annual obligation. These credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), are generated when a batch of biofuel is produced, and separated from the fuel by obligated parties (generally gasoline and diesel fuel refiners or blenders). Once separated, these RINs may be traded like other commodities. Recent civil and criminal action against parties accused of registering and selling fraudulent RINs has raised questions about the integrity of the RIN market and EPA's oversight of the market.

The EISA amendments to the RFS specifically mandate the use of cellulosic biofuel (16 billion gallons by 2022) and biomass-based diesel fuel (at least 1.0 billion gallons annually by 2012). However, advanced biofuels, especially cellulosic fuels, have been slow to develop and fuel production lags the EISA's mandate schedule.", "Within the overall RFS mandate, there are sub-mandates for specific types of fuel. For example, for 2013 EISA required the use of 16.55 billion gallons of biofuels, of which 2.75 billion must be \"advanced biofuels.\" Within the advanced biofuel carve-out for 2013, at least 1.28 billion gallons were to be biomass-based diesel (BBD) fuels 6 million gallons were required for cellulosic biofuels. In the early years of the program, the lion's share of the mandate is unspecified, and the vast majority of this unspecified portion has been\u2014and is expected to be\u2014supplied by corn-based ethanol largely produced in the Midwest. At the beginning of each year, EPA determines a percentage standard that all suppliers must meet, which is based on expected total U.S. gasoline and diesel demand for the prior year.

As noted by the arrows in the figure, fuel qualifying as one type of biofuel in the RFS qualifies for all levels above it. For example, a gallon of cellulosic biofuel may be used to meet the cellulosic mandate, the advanced biofuel mandate, and the overall RFS. A gallon of other advanced biofuel (e.g., sugarcane ethanol) may be used to meet the advanced biofuel mandate and the overall mandate, but may not be used to meet the cellulosic or BBD mandates.

Once the biofuel has been blended or sold, the RINs are detached, and can then be bought and sold like other commodities. At the end of each year, fuel suppliers must multiply the above percentage standards by their total gasoline and diesel sales to calculate their renewable volume obligations (RVO), which indicate the total number of each type of RIN that the suppliers must submit to EPA. To the extent that a supplier has excess RINs, that supplier may sell them to others who may be short, or save them for use in the following year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "RINs", "paragraphs": ["A RIN is a unique 38-character number that is issued (in accordance with EPA guidelines) by the biofuel producer or importer at the point of biofuel production or the port of importation.

(See box below.)", "Under the RFS2 RIN formulation, Code D identifies which of the four RFS categories\u2014total, advanced, cellulosic, or biodiesel\u2014the biofuel satisfies. Together, SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE identify the RIN block which demarcates the number of ethanol-equivalent gallons of renewable fuel that the batch represents in the context of compliance with the RFS\u2014that is, RIN gallons. The total number of RINs equals the product of the liquid volume of renewable fuel times its energy equivalence value (relative to a gallon of ethanol). For example, because biodiesel has an equivalence value (EV) of 1.5 in the RFS, 1,000 gallons of biodiesel would generate 1,500 RINs. If the RIN block start for that batch was 1 (i.e., SSSSSSSS = 00000001), then the end value (EEEEEEEE) would be 00001500.", "Any party that owns RINs at any point during the year (including domestic and foreign producers; refiners and blenders; exporters and importers of renewable fuels; and RIN traders) must register with the EPA and follow RIN record-keeping and reporting guidelines. RINs can only be generated if it can be established that the feedstock from which the fuel was made meets EISA's definitions of renewable biomass (including land-use restrictions), and if the fuel meets EISA's lifecycle greenhouse gas emission limits.

For example, RINs for conventional ethanol may only be used for the overall (unspecified) renewable fuel mandate. However, biodiesel RINs may be used to meet the BBD, advanced biofuel, and overall RVOs. ", "It should also be noted that unlike other commodities, RINs generally may only be used in the year they are generated or for one additional year, although suppliers may only meet up to 20% of their current-year obligation with the previous year's RINs.

(See Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 .) Because much of the advanced biofuel mandate is met using BBD RINs, the advanced biofuel RIN price generally follows the BBD RIN price. For example, when BBD RIN prices spiked in September 2011 ( Figure 4 ), advanced biofuel RINs showed a similar spike ( Figure 5 ); there was no spike at that time in corn ethanol RINs ( Figure 3 ). Similarly, BBD and advanced biofuel RIN prices dropped in the second half of 2012, while ethanol RIN prices increased (but still remained relatively low) as the 2012 drought raised concerns over U.S. corn production and its effects on ethanol production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prices Since January 2013", "paragraphs": ["Spot prices for conventional (corn-based) ethanol RINs rose dramatically at the start of 2013.

Prices rebounded somewhat in early 2014. Several factors have been identified by stakeholders as potential causes for the run-up in prices. For example, many stakeholders are concerned that the fuel supply is rapidly approaching a \"blend wall.\" There are various factors that limit ethanol content in gasoline to a maximum of 10%. With a limited number of gasoline gallons sold each year, but an increasing RFS mandate, the amount of ethanol needed to meet the mandate may exceed the potential for gasoline blending. To address the blend wall and still meet the RFS mandates, obligated parties will need to do one of the following: (1) blend ethanol in gasoline at higher concentrations (e.g., 15%); (2) sell ethanol as an alternative fuel for flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs); or (3) supply non-ethanol biofuels. If none of these options are undertaken in sufficient quantity, there may be insufficient RINs for obligated parties to meet their RVOs. The rise in spot prices for corn ethanol RINs in 2013 may reflect a scarcity in RINs not seen in previous years.

While refiners and others would prefer to not \"pay twice\" for RINs, in general biofuel producers argue that not making up the RINs would undermine the legitimate RIN market. Simply put, if obligated parties are not required to replace invalid RINs with valid RINs, the size of the legitimate renewable fuel market is reduced.

Establish a Quality Assurance Program or some other certification to provide greater credibility, but do not tie it to EPA's determination on RIN validity; 3. Establish a certification procedure with an affirmative defense such that purchasers of invalid RINs are not liable for civil penalties (EPA's proposal); and 4. Establish a system where all certified RINs are valid for RFS compliance regardless of subsequent determination that they are fraudulent or otherwise deficient.", "Currently, RIN market participants are acting under the first and second options. They are independently determining whether to trust the validity of the RINs they purchase. In many cases, after the RIN fraud came to light, obligated parties decided to purchase biodiesel and biodiesel RINs only from the largest producers. At the same time, small producers have complained that they are unable to afford the verification procedures that some obligated parties now require. Others have argued that the RIN fraud prosecutions have improved the integrity of the market. For example, one witness to a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on RIN fraud stated \"[i]n essence, the Wild West of buying and selling RINs from market participants you don't know has ended, the wrongdoers are being rooted out, and everyone now knows that deals that are too good to be true are in fact too good to be true.\" However, since that time, at least two new cases (one civil, one criminal) of RIN fraud have come to light\u2014in both cases the fraud began in either 2009 or 2010.", "Because of substantial remaining uncertainty about the integrity of the market, the National Biodiesel Board (NBB) and others are working to establish a more formal process for RIN certification. With the NBB, biodiesel producers have established a RIN Integrity Network where obligated parties can subscribe to a service where they can receive information on participating biodiesel producers. This and similar efforts are in their early stages, and it is unclear how much credence RIN purchasers will give these networks. Further, it is unclear whether they will become the industry standard. ", "EPA is currently pursuing the third option, where a Quality Assurance Program is established with third parties auditing RIN generators. EPA has proposed an affirmative defense such that users of certified RINs would not be subject to civil penalties under the Clean Air Act. In most cases, under the proposal, the original RIN generator, the third party verifier, or the obligated party would be required to purchase additional RINs to make up for any certified RINs later found to be fraudulent. Obligated parties generally would prefer not to \"pay twice\" for RINs, adding to their compliance costs. However, eliminating this requirement would effectively shrink the market for biofuels under the RFS, harming legitimate biofuel producers. As EISA establishes specific fuel volume requirements, it is unclear whether EPA has the authority under existing statute to waive that requirement.", "In addition to agency action, at least one bill was introduced in the 112 th Congress to amend the RIN system. H.R. 6444 would have required EPA to establish a RIN certification system by January 1, 2013. The bill would have precluded the agency from later invalidating any certified RINs. Thus, under the bill, any RIN found subsequently to be fraudulent would have still counted toward an obligated party's compliance, without penalties. As noted above, refiners and other obligated parties would have likely preferred this to other policy options, while biofuel producers were unlikely to support such blanket protection.

However, it is unclear whether the EMTS completely screens out these errors. Especially as regulations require all transactions be reported within five business days, the real-time reporting requirements may potentially lead to errors if entities feel rushed in completing reports and transactions on time. On the other hand, real-time reporting may make it easier to catch errors and irregularities than under the previous system, where most data verification was completed on a quarterly basis.", "The latter issue, that fuel has been exported without retirement of necessary RINs, has been raised by some stakeholders. RFS regulations are explicit that when renewable fuel is exported that the exporter must have RINs to offset that volume: \"Any party that owns any amount of renewable fuel, whether in its neat form or blended with gasoline or diesel, that is exported from any of the regions described in \u00a7 80.1426(b) shall acquire sufficient RINs to comply with all applicable Renewable Volume Obligations under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section representing the exported renewable fuel.\" ", "It is unclear to what extent, or whether, parties have been exporting fuel without securing the necessary RINs. As noted above, in January 2014 two men were indicted for allegedly operating such a scheme. To the extent that this sort of fraud is occurring, as with other types of fraud, it would lead to lower domestic renewable fuel use than required under the act. That would likely lead to an oversupply of RINs and a lower RIN price received by all market participants.

There are several reasons that have been given for this: (1) over most of the RFS2 the market price for BBD RINs had been much higher than that for ethanol RINs, making any transaction (legal or illegal) that much more valuable; (2) in general biodiesel producers are smaller operations than ethanol producers, and the companies involved may be less well known to market participants; and (3) limited verification procedures existed at the time.", "Between actions taken by industry, proposed regulations from EPA, and potential congressional action, the latter two reasons for fraud in the biodiesel RIN market may be fully addressed. However, the first cause\u2014a high price for some RINs\u2014may continue in the future. By 2022, the RFS requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, more than double the amount required in 2012. Thus, the absolute volume of the market will be larger in the future. Further, of the 36 billion gallons required in 2022, 16 billion gallons are required to come from cellulosic biofuels. Currently, there is very limited production of these fuels, and their production costs are high.

The details of that affirmative defense will determine who might benefit from policy changes. For example, in general obligated parties are more likely to benefit from a blanket exemption from both civil penalties and the requirement to purchase RINs to make up for ones later found to be invalid. In general, biofuel producers are more likely to benefit from a policy that still requires obligated parties to purchase make-up RINs. Otherwise, the market for RINs\u2014and thus the fuel they represent\u2014would effectively shrink by the amount of any fraudulent RINs.", "Any third-party certification procedures will add to the cost of producing biofuels and RINs. Various actors may be more or less able to absorb those costs. For example, obligated parties may be able to pass the additional cost along to gasoline and diesel fuel consumers through higher pump prices. Further, larger biofuel producers may be able to take advantage of economies of scale and spread the cost across all gallons of fuel they produce. Smaller producers, however, may be less able to spread the cost over the fewer gallons they produce and thus their per-gallon production costs may increase relative to their larger competitors. As noted above, many biodiesel producers are smaller operations who may feel more of these effects than ethanol producers (who generally produce larger volumes of fuel).
