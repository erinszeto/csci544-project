The Cures Act created these accounts and authorized appropriations from them for specific fiscal years (FY2017-FY2026 for the NIH Innovation Account and FY2017-FY2018 for the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis). The Cures Act further provided that subsequent discretionary appropriations from these accounts (up to the amounts authorized for each fiscal year) are to be subtracted from any cost estimates provided for purposes of budget controls. The Cures Act ensured that appropriations from these accounts will not count against any spending limits, such as the statutory discretionary spending limits imposed by the BCA; that is, the amounts appropriated from these accounts will be considered to be outside those limits.

In addition, six amendments to the ED Program Administration account within Departmental Management would have collectively reduced the funds for that account from $431 million to $286 million.
