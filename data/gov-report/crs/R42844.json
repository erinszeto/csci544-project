Key parts of the reform package cannot go into effect until a number of IMF countries formally approve the reforms. If enacted, these reforms would increase the size of the IMF's core source of funding (IMF \"quota\"), and increase the representation of emerging market and developing countries at the IMF to reflect more accurately their weight in the global economy.", "Implementing the Reform Package, and the Role of Congress", "IMF rules do not require formal approval of the reform package by all IMF member countries, but the support of the United States, as the largest shareholder at the institution, is necessary. Although many other IMF member countries have submitted their formal approvals for these reforms, to date, the United States has not formally approved these reforms. Under U.S. law, the Administration cannot do so without specific congressional authorization. Appropriations could also be necessary. In its budget requests for FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, the Obama Administration has included authorization and appropriation requests for the United States to endorse and ratify the 2010 reform package.", "Implications of the Reform Package", "Arguments for Reforms: Proponents argue that the reform package is necessary for maintaining the effectiveness and legitimacy of the IMF as the central institution for international macroeconomic stability. The IMF's core source of funding needs to be increased, they argue, in order to give the IMF the resources that it needs to respond effectively to financial crises. They also argue that the under-representation of emerging economies at the IMF is broadly perceived as unfair and reduces the support of several member countries for IMF programs and initiatives.", "Arguments against Reforms: Opponents argue that since the IMF has found other ways to supplement its resources during economic crises, the IMF's core funding source does not need to be increased. Opponents are also skeptical that emerging economies support the existing norms and values of international financial institutions, and that these countries may prefer financial and trade strategies that are less aligned with those of the United States.", "Potential Impact on the United States: Implementing the reforms would not increase total U.S. financial commitments to the IMF and would have little impact on U.S. representation at the IMF. The reforms would require transferring some U.S. financial commitments from a supplementary fund at the IMF (the \"New Arrangements to Borrow,\" or NAB) to the IMF's core source of funding (quota). This transfer could require appropriations, depending on how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores the transfer of funds.

In order for key parts of the reform package to take effect, IMF rules dictate that the reforms must be formally accepted by three-fifths of IMF members (113) representing 85% of the total voting power. Under this formula, although unanimous support is not required, approval by the United States, the IMF's largest stakeholder with 16.75% of the total voting power, is essential (see text box). To date, the United States has not formally approved these reforms. ", "Congress plays a pivotal role in determining the U.S. position on the current IMF reform agenda. Under U.S. law, specific congressional authorization is required for the United States to consent to change the U.S. quota, or \"shares\" in the Fund, which determine the United States' total voting power. Furthermore, depending on the budgetary treatment of any new authorized U.S. contributions to the IMF, appropriations would likely also be required.", "A majority of IMF member countries have approved these reforms, and with U.S. support, the IMF would meet the thresholds necessary for the reforms to become effective. News reports indicate that inaction by the United States on the reforms created tensions at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in October 2012.

However, this figure represents just over 25% of the IMF's available resources. In addition to its quota resources, the IMF maintains standing multilateral borrowing arrangements to temporarily supplement available quota resources and borrowing. The main borrowing arrangement, the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), is a set of credit arrangements between the IMF and 38 member countries that can provide about $510 billion of supplementary resources to the IMF. Finally, around 32 countries have established bilateral loan or note purchasing agreements with the IMF that provide an additional $418 billion dollars. The United States has not participated in these new bilateral pledges. Combining both quota and provisional resources, total IMF resources are approximately $1.28 trillion.", "IMF rules call for a review of quotas every five years to ensure that total IMF resources are adequate and that countries' quotas reflect their relative share in the global economy. Despite major growth and change in relative contributions to the global economy, there has not been a major quota increase since 1998. Faster economic growth in than in the rest of the world doubled the share of emerging market and developing countries' contribution to global GDP from 20% in 1996 to 55.5% over 2011-2013, according to the IMF's October 2014 World Economic Outlook. Emerging market countries accounted to 76% of global growth in 2013.", "Focus on the adequacy of IMF resources has been on the IMF quota, the financial commitment that countries make when they join the Fund. It has traditionally been the main source of funding that the IMF uses for financial assistance packages. It also determines a member country's voting power at the IMF. Figure 1 shows how IMF quota resources have changed over time relative to different measures of international economic activity since 1975. In general, IMF quota resources have fallen relative to global GDP, net capital inflows, trade, and reserves in recent decades. Some analysts view this as evidence that IMF quota resources have not kept pace with increased economic integration and that the IMF needs more financial resources in order to remain effective in responding to economic crises, one of its three major functions.", "Some commentators argue that having the large supplemental fund (the NAB) and large bilateral pledges are inadequate substitutes for increasing quota resources. They argue that such large supplemental funds and bilateral borrowings undermine the legitimacy of the IMF as a quota-based institution, where many crucial aspects of the organization, including access to finances and voting power, are influenced by quota. Additionally, they argue that because NAB resources are more difficult to use than quota resources, the IMF's ability to move quickly during crises is weakened. Bilateral commitments may also be temporary, and may not be a reliable source of funds in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Representation of Emerging and Developing Countries", "paragraphs": ["In addition to concerns about the adequacy of IMF resources, some IMF members worry that the voice and vote of emerging and developing countries are \"under-represented\" at the IMF.

The ability of emerging economies to influence IMF strategic policies may also be lower, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the IMF in the views of some members.", "Similar concerns prompted reforms at the IMF in 2006 and 2008; however, these reforms were largely seen as incremental and inadequate steps towards a meaningful solution. Successive U.S. Administrations have generally been supportive of increasing representation of emerging markets at the IMF. A former U.S. Alternate Executive Director to the IMF argues that on governance issues, the United States' aim was to \"gain political good will for taking the lead in addressing an unfair structure that undermined the credibility and legitimacy of the IMF\u2014an institution that the United States rightly saw as a positive benefit to itself and the world.\"", "In theory, IMF voting shares are supposed to reflect a country's relative weight in the global economy, but voting shares have proved slow to change and do not fully reflect major changes in recent decades. The increasing economic influence of Brazil, India, Russia, and China (the BRICs), for example, illustrate the changing distribution of global growth and the diffusion of economic power among a much wider group of countries than when the IMF was founded in 1944. Figure 2 compares the share of GDP and share of IMF quota (which affects IMF voting shares) for the BRICs and a group of advanced European economies. The share of global GDP produced by the BRICs started to increase in the mid-2000s, while the share of global GDP produced by the group of advanced European economies has fallen in recent decades. However, IMF quota share, and hence voting power, for both sets of countries has remained relatively flat.", "Concerns about dominance of European views and interests on the IMF Executive Board have also been expressed. The IMF Executive Board, which meets several times a week, has 24 members (Executive Directors), and is normally chaired by the IMF Managing Director (currently Christine Lagarde of France). Table 1 shows the nationality of Executive Directors of the Executive Board in September 2012. Eight of the 24 Executive Directors were from advanced European economies, and an additional two Executive Directors represented groups of countries that included at least one advanced European economy. Some argue that this is an overabundance of European Executive Directors, which critics argue limits the ability of non-European Executive Directors to represent adequately their constituencies' interests and for IMF members to hold their Executive Director accountable. They have suggested that European voices on the Board should be consolidated, allowing for more seats on the Board to be controlled by emerging and developing countries. Several of the Executive Directors represent large constituencies of African and South American countries, many of which are among the IMF's poorest members who depend on the IMF for lending."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The 2010 Reform Package", "paragraphs": ["In December 2010, the IMF's Board of Governors approved a package of reforms to address these concerns. Key components of the reform package include the following:", "Doubling IMF quota and rollback of the NAB: The reform package calls for a doubling of IMF quota, and a corresponding rollback of the NAB. Although IMF quota has been periodically increased before, if adopted, this would be the largest proportional quota increase in the history of the IMF. Shifting IMF quota to emerging economies: The reform package also calls for a 6% shift in quota share to emerging markets, which would increase their voting power at the IMF, as well as their relative financial commitments to the institution. If implemented, the negotiated changes in quota shares would result in China becoming the third-largest shareholder at the IMF, and India and Brazil would also join China and Russia among the 10 largest shareholders. The United States' quota share would fall slightly, but the U.S. quota would still be sufficient to ensure it had more than the 15% of the total voting power needed to veto major IMF policy decisions. See Table A-1 for more details about how IMF quota shares would change for major economies. Creating an all-elected IMF Executive Board: Rather than continuing the practice of having the five largest shareholders at the IMF appoint Executive Directors to the Board, the proposed reform would make all Executive Directors on the Executive Board elected. This reform could pave the way for future consolidation of European representation on the Executive Board. Reducing representation of advanced European economies on the Executive Board: Ten seats on the Executive Board represent advanced European economies. The reform proposal reflects a commitment by the membership to reduce the number of Executive Directors representing advanced European economies by two, so emerging and developing countries have more representation on the Board."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Impact on the United States", "paragraphs": ["If implemented, the quota reform would result in a shift in the composition of U.S. financial commitments to the IMF as the NAB is reduced and the quota is increased, but would not increase total U.S. commitments to the IMF. This shift would likely require appropriations for the entire amount of the increase but the net effect on the budget would depend on how much of the funds need to be shifted and whether there are any changes to the budgetary treatment of U.S. IMF contributions (see discussion in the \" The Role of Congress \" below). Because the United States arguably has more control over when NAB funds are used compared to quota resources, the shift could entail some loss of U.S. control over the resources. However, quota commitments are still generally considered very safe, and the United States has never lost money on its quota commitments (and it earns a small amount of interest on these commitments).", "With the realignment of IMF quota shares towards emerging markets, the U.S. voting share would fall from 17.69% to 17.40%. This change does not have a meaningful impact and would maintain the United States' unique veto power over major policy decisions at the IMF, while freeing up quota share to be shifted to emerging-market countries. The United States is actually under-represented at the IMF, with a quota share (17.69%) smaller than its share of global GDP (about 22.4% in 2013). The United States has allowed its quota share to fall over the years, partly to facilitate realignment of IMF quota shares to reflect the increasing weight of dynamic emerging market economies in the global economy, while maintaining enough voting power to be able to veto major policy decisions at the IMF that require an 85% majority.", "Since the IMF was founded, the United States has appointed its own representative to the Executive Board. Under the reform, large shareholders like the United States could still represent a constituency of one country (themselves), but other countries could in theory elect to join a large member's constituency, subject to the rules of the Fund, which aim to maintain constituencies balanced in terms of voting power.

Moreover, some analysts reject the notion that the IMF needs more funds to combat the Eurozone crisis, because Europe has the financial resources it needs to respond to the crisis. They argue that if the IMF has any role to play in the Eurozone crisis, it should be through non-financing functions, such as through technical assistance and surveillance of economic policies and conditions.", "Others are skeptical that emerging economies support the existing norms and values of international financial institutions, and question whether they would be \"responsible stakeholders.\" Emerging countries may also have significantly different views on economic policies, such as on free markets and state-led development.

The initial reform package included the pledge to reduce the representation of advanced European economies on the Executive Board by two seats following the implementation of the other reforms. However, the process for obtaining the required acceptances for the Board amendment and consents to the quota reform has taken longer than expected, and steps towards Board realignment were taken in November 2012.

Since 1980, contributions to the IMF had been handled as an exchange of assets, which required increases in budget authority but no outlays. In 2009, it was decided that the new U.S. commitments to the IMF would be treated as lines of credit.
