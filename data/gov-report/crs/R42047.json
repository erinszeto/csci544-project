Congress passed the ICWA to end this practice and the high rate at which Indian children were being removed from their homes and placed with non-Indians.", "One survey reported that 25%-35% of all Indian children were being separated from their families and placed in foster homes, adoptive homes, or institutions. The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs termed the disparity between placement rates for Indians and non-Indians \"shocking.\" The committee concluded that many non-Indian social workers who recommended removal of Indian children from their families and communities were ignorant of Indian cultural values and social norms, and biased against typical Indian family life. The report indicated that this bias too often resulted in finding neglect or abandonment when there was none. The committee noted also that the decision to take Indian children from their natural homes was frequently carried out without due process of law and that most cases did not go through adjudication because parents voluntarily waived their parental rights in the face of coercion from the state.", "Accordingly, Congress passed the ICWA to establish standards for removing Indian children from their homes, prioritizing placement of Indian children with extended family members and other Indians, and giving tribes a recognized role in the placement of Indian children by, among other things, recognizing tribal court jurisdiction over Indian child placements and adoptions. In addition, the ICWA includes important procedural protections for Indian parents, custodians, and tribes to provide due process of law.", "In Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, the Supreme Court determined that, in a proceeding to terminate parental rights in connection with an Indian child, a number of ICWA's provisions do not apply when the parent seeking to invoke them never had legal or physical custody of the Indian child. In addition, the Court stated that the ICWA's placement preferences for adoptions of Indian children apply only when multiple parties seek to adopt the Indian children. In Adoptive Couple, because the only party before the court seeking to adopt the Indian child was a non-Indian couple, the ICWA's placement preferences did not apply to block their adoption."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From the 19 th century to the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978, the federal government, states, and private agencies sought to separate Indian children from their tribes and families in order to \"civilize\" the children or provide them with better lives. Congress undertook to reverse this practice when it passed the ICWA in response to the high rate at which states were separating Indian children from their parents, families, and tribes through involuntary removal of Indian children from Indian homes and involuntary termination of parental rights. One survey reported that \"approximately 25\u201335 percent of all Indian children are separated from their families and placed in foster homes, adoptive homes, or institutions.\" The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs\u2014the predecessor of the present-day House Committee on Natural Resources\u2014termed the disparity between placement rates for Indians and non-Indians \"shocking.\" The committee expressed concern about the welfare of Indian children who are traumatized by removal from their families and then \"adjusting to a social and cultural environment much different from their own.\" The committee concluded, \"[i]n judging the fitness of a particular family, many social workers, ignorant of Indian cultural values and social norms, make decisions that are wholly inappropriate in the context of Indian family life and so they frequently discover neglect or abandonment where none exists.\" The committee noted also that \"[t]he decision to take Indian children from their natural homes is, in most cases, carried out without due process of law\" and that most cases did not go through adjudication because parents voluntarily waived their parental rights in the face of coercion from the state.", "Congress declared two policy aims of the ICWA: (1) \"to protect the best interests of Indian children,\" and (2) \"to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.\" The ICWA is premised on the belief that \"protection of the child's relationship with the tribe is in the child's best interest.\" It identifies Indian children as a \"resource\" that is \"vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes.\" Thus, the ICWA recognizes that Indian tribes have a unique interest in their minor members or potential members. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) described the ICWA's policy as follows: \"Congress through the [ICWA] has expressed its clear preference for keeping Indian children with their families, deferring to tribal judgment on matters concerning the custody of tribal children, and placing Indian children who must be removed from their homes within their own families or Indian tribes.\"", "To achieve these policy aims, the ICWA establishes \"minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family services programs.\" In addition, the ICWA provides procedural protections for parents and tribes in state court proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When the ICWA Applies", "paragraphs": ["The ICWA applies to child custody proceedings involving Indian children. \"Child custody proceedings\" include \"foster care placement,\" \"termination of parental rights,\" \"preadoptive placement,\" and \"adoptive placement.\" It does not apply to placements resulting from juvenile proceedings concerning an act which if committed by an adult would be a crime, or custody determinations made in conjunction with divorce proceedings. Although the ICWA is associated primarily with involuntary child custody proceedings, it applies to voluntary proceedings as well. The ICWA defines \"Indian child\" as \"any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\"", "The BIA Guidelines provide \"[w]hen a state court has reason to believe a child involved in a custody proceeding is an Indian, the state court shall seek verification of the child's status from either the [BIA] or the child's tribe.\" Under the BIA Guidelines , the tribe's determination of the child's or parent's status as a member or the child's status as eligible for membership is conclusive. In the absence of a tribal determination, the BIA's determination is conclusive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The \"Existing Indian Family\" Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["Although most jurisdictions have rejected the \"existing Indian family\" doctrine, the courts of seven states have adopted it to determine whether the ICWA applies. Under this doctrine, the ICWA does not apply when \"neither the child nor the child's parents have maintained a significant social, cultural, or political relationship with his or her tribe.\" Courts usually apply the doctrine in cases involving children of mixed heritage who have been living in a non-Indian environment for an extended period. The Kansas Supreme Court first formulated the doctrine based on the belief that, \"[a] careful study of the legislative history behind the [ICWA] and the [ICWA] itself discloses that the overriding concern of Congress and the proponents of the [ICWA] was the maintenance of the family and tribal relationships existing in Indian homes and to set minimum standards for the removal of Indian children from their existing Indian environment.\"", "The doctrine is applied differently depending on the state. Alabama courts have limited the existing Indian family doctrine to circumstances where the parents are unmarried and the non-Indian mother voluntarily places the child for adoption. In Ex Parte C.L.J. , the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals explicitly limited the doctrine to those circumstances and declined to apply the doctrine to a child whose mother did not obtain membership in her tribe until after the child had been removed from her custody and it was clear the state was going to move to terminate her parental rights. Even though the child had not been raised in an Indian family, the court held the ICWA applied. In contrast, the Kentucky Supreme Court applied the doctrine to a proceeding involving a child who was a ward of the tribal court but who had lived with a non-Indian family for years. The court gave no reason as to why the tribal court would not continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over the child. Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee courts apply it even when the mother is Indian. In In re: James Ronald Hampton , the Louisiana supreme court applied the existing Indian family doctrine to deprive an Indian mother of her rights under the ICWA to revoke her consent to a voluntary adoption by a non-Indian family. Nevada courts have determined to apply the existing Indian family doctrine on a \"case-by-case basis to avoid results that are counter to the ICWA's policy goal of protecting the best interest of a Native American child.\"", "The existing Indian family doctrine appears to be on the decline. The Kansas and South Dakota supreme courts, initially leading courts in adopting the doctrine, have since rejected it. Washington, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Iowa have rejected it through legislation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Adoptions Under the ICWA", "paragraphs": ["To counter the high rate at which states were removing Indian children from their families and Indian communities, the ICWA provides uniform and heightened standards for involuntarily terminating parental rights, preferences for placing Indian children in Indian adoptive homes, and procedural protections for parents and Indian tribes in state court proceedings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Termination of Parental Rights", "paragraphs": ["The termination of parental rights occurs when the parent-child relationship is legally severed. Termination can be voluntary, such as when parents consent to adoption, or involuntary, upon a finding of abandonment, neglect, or abuse of the child. Upon termination of parental rights, a child is available to enter a parent-child relationship with adoptive parents.", "The ICWA does not restrict a parent's ability to voluntarily terminate his or her parental rights. It limits the circumstances under which state courts may terminate parental rights involuntarily. ", "Because Congress found that frequently states were terminating the parental rights of Indian parents based on biased evidence of neglect and abandonment, Section 1912(f) of the ICWA establishes the evidence that state courts must consider, the standard of proof, and the substantive standard that the evidence must establish in order for a state court to involuntarily terminate parental rights. A court must find \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" based on evidence which must include expert testimony, that \"the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\" The \"beyond a reasonable\" doubt standard is higher than the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard required for due process and employed by the states in parental termination proceedings, and is \"designed to fulfill [the] ICWA's goal of ending practices by state social welfare personnel that result in removal of Indian children from their homes based on nonconformity with non-Indians' stereotypes of what a proper family should be.\"", "The BIA Guidelines explain that removal of an Indian child from his or her family \"must be based on competent testimony from one or more experts qualified to speak specifically to the issue of whether continued custody by the parents or Indian custodians is likely to result in serious physical or emotional damage to the child.\" In requiring expert witness testimony by a witness with relevant experience or education, Section 1912 seeks to counter the bias of non-Indians against Indian communities, families, and circumstances cited in the ICWA. The House Report from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs explained the need for these standards with statistical evidence that physical abuse existed in just 1% of the cases in which an Indian child was removed from the family. In the remaining 99% of the cases, the state gave vague reasons such as \"neglect\" or \"social deprivation\" or presented evidence that somehow living with the parents damaged the child emotionally. By imposing strict standards and requiring expert testimony, the ICWA seeks to limit the circumstances in which Indian children are removed from their homes to those that present a real danger to the child.", "Most state courts do not require expert testimony when the evidence justifying removal of the child is \"culturally neutral.\" Therefore, a state court will not get expert testimony if the basis for removal is physical abuse such as shaken baby syndrome or newborn drug addiction.", "In Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , the Supreme Court determined that Section 1912(f) does not apply to the termination of a parent's rights when the parent never had custody. In this case, the biological mother, who is non-Indian, was not married to the biological father, who is a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. During the pregnancy, the biological father indicated informally that he would relinquish his parental rights rather than pay child support. Unbeknownst to the biological father, the biological mother then decided to place the child for adoption with a non-Indian couple in South Carolina. The biological father first learned of the adoption when the child was four months old when he was served with papers to finalize the adoption. He immediately contested the adoption in the South Carolina court.", "The South Carolina supreme court upheld the decision of the family court that Section 1912(f) applied, which meant that the burden was on the adoptive couple to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the father's custody of the child would result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child. The state courts determined that the adoptive parents had not met their burden. The adoptive couple appealed and the Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that Section 1912(f) did not apply because it required proof that \"continued custody\" of the biological father would harm the child. However, the Court wrote that the father never had physical or legal custody of the Indian child. Therefore, Section 1912(f) did not apply to bar termination of the biological father's rights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ICWA's Placement Preferences", "paragraphs": ["In the interest of maintaining Indian children within the Indian community and tribe, section 1915 establishes the order of preference for placement of Indian children that state courts must follow.

Some view these preferences as a departure from the general federal policy of disfavoring race matching in adoptions and foster placements.", "The BIA Guidelines identify the following considerations for determining good cause: the request of the parents or the child, if the child is of sufficient age; \"the extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by testimony of a qualified expert witness,\" and the unavailability of suitable families for placement after \"diligent\" search. The party seeking to avoid the statutory preferences bears the burden of establishing good cause. The states are divided on whether the best interests of the child constitute good cause to depart from the placement preferences. Those state courts that find good cause based on the child's best interests generally place greater importance on the child's permanent placement, while those state courts that reject the child's best interests as a basis for a good cause finding generally place greater importance on the child's identity as an Indian and the tribe's interest in that identity.", "In Adoptive Couple , the Supreme Court wrote that the ICWA's placement preferences for adoption placements apply only when there are multiple parties seeking to adopt the Indian child.

Section 1913(a) requires also that the court must certify that the parent understood the explanation, either in English or as translated in a language he or she did understand. Consent given within ten days after birth of a child is not valid.", "The ICWA also gives Indian parents opportunity to withdraw their consent. Parents of an Indian child may withdraw their consent for termination of parental rights at any time before the final decree of termination or adoption. Upon withdrawal of consent, the child must be returned to the parent. Even after the final decree of termination or adoption has been entered, the parents have two years to withdraw consent and petition the court to vacate the decree on the ground that his or her consent was obtained through fraud or duress. Upon a finding of fraud or duress, the court shall vacate the decree and return the child to the parent. By providing that parents may withdraw their consent and petition the court to vacate the adoption upon an allegation of fraud or duress, the ICWA creates incentives to ensure that parents give their consent knowingly and freely.

The extended family provides an example. By sharing the responsibility of child rearing, the extended family tends to strengthen the community's commitment to the child. At the same time, however, it diminishes the possibility that the nuclear family will be able to mobilize itself quickly enough when an outside agency acts to assume custody.

Under 1911(c) such a family member has a right to intervene, even though he or she has no recognized legal relationship with the child.

The \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard is higher than the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard necessary for due process and employed by most states in foster care placement proceeding for non-Indian children.

The members sought to adopt the child through a state court proceeding. The biological mother of the child, who was also a member of the Tribe, moved to dismiss the state court proceeding on the ground that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over the proceeding. The Supreme Court stated the test for whether the state court could exercise jurisdiction was at the least, \"whether the state action infringed on the right of the reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\" The Court concluded that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction owing to the Tribe's right to govern itself independent of state law. In response to the argument that the Tribe could not divest the state of jurisdiction it exercised over tribal adoptions prior to organization of the Tribe in 1935, the Court noted the tribal courts were established pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act. If the state courts in fact exercised jurisdiction over tribal adoptions, that jurisdiction has been preempted by federal statute. Finally, the Court rejected the members' assertion that depriving them of access to state courts constituted impermissible racial discrimination, noting that the tribal court's exclusivity derives from the \"quasi-sovereign status\" of the Tribe under federal law. \"Moreover, even if a jurisdictional holding occasionally results in denying an Indian plaintiff a forum to which a non-Indian has access, such disparate treatment of the Indian is justified because it is intended to benefit the class of which he is a member by furthering the congressional policy of Indian self-government.\"", "The ICWA recognizes this exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Indian children residing or domiciled on the reservation.

The Court held that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over the proceedings. The state supreme court had held that domicile or residence was a matter of state law and that under state law, the children were never domiciled or residing on the reservation.
