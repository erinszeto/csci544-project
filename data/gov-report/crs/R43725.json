In the 1952 act, these nonquota immigrants included returning LPRs, natives of Western Hemisphere countries, ministers of religion, and long-serving employees of the U.S. government abroad, among other groups. The 1965 amendments to the INA redesignated the nonquota immigrants as special immigrants and made some changes to the various classifications.", "The Immigration Act of 1990 further amended the special immigrant provisions in the INA. It placed the special immigrant category under a revised INA section on permanent employment-based immigration and imposed an overall annual numerical limitation of 10,000 on special immigrants, with exemptions for certain classifications. In addition, the 1990 act amended the existing special immigrant classifications and added several new ones. A 1991 immigration act changed the overall annual limitation on special immigrants from 10,000 to 7.1% of the worldwide level of employment-based immigration. Subsequent laws added new special immigrant classifications.", "Today the special immigrant category encompasses a hodgepodge of classifications, but there are some commonalities among the seemingly disparate groups. Many of the classifications, for example, have a humanitarian element.

Some of the classifications based on U.S. government employment apply to individuals who are placed in danger because of their work. For example, there is a special immigrant classification for individuals who were employees of the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government on April 1, 1979, who provided faithful service for at least five years, and \"whose personal safety, or the personal safety of whose spouse or children, as a direct result of such Treaty, is reasonably placed in danger because of the special nature of any of that employment.\" As discussed in the next section, the two special immigrant classifications for Iraqis and Afghans similarly apply to individuals who performed U.S. government-related service, with one requiring the presence of a serious threat to the individual as a result of that U.S. government employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqis and Afghans", "paragraphs": ["There are two special immigrant classifications specifically for nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan: one for individuals who worked as translators or interpreters and one for individuals who were employed by, or on behalf of, the U.S. government in Iraq or by, or on behalf of, the U.S. government or by the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

The department indicated in response to a question following the October 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that it did not need additional resources to expedite SIV petition processing (see \" Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Application Process \").", "The 113 th Congress enacted legislation to amend the SIV programs for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government to address application processing-related concerns. The FY2014 NDAA established a review process for denial of Chief of Mission approval under each program. More generally, this law directed the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to make changes to the processing of applications under each program such that \"all steps ... incidental to the issuance of such visas, including required screenings and background checks, should be completed not later than 9 months after the date on which an eligible alien submits all required materials to complete an application for such visa.\" At the same time, the act included an exception to the nine-month limit in \"high-risk cases for which satisfaction of national security concerns requires additional time.\" ", "The FY2014 NDAA included reporting requirements related to application processing under the SIV programs for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government. It required the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to report to Congress on the implementation of improvements to SIV application processing under both programs. The FY2019 NDAA subsequently required a new report on the implementation of SIV application processing improvements under the Afghan program. The July 2018 conference report on this legislation noted concern that \"the SIV application process continues to suffer from inadequate interagency coordination which has resulted in undue delay, needless stress on applicants, and a sizable drop in SIV admissions this year.\"", "In addition to requiring a congressional report, the FY2014 NDAA provided for public reports on Iraqi and Afghan SIV application processing. It required the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to publish quarterly reports describing improvements in efficiency in SIV application processing. The first quarterly reports on the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs, dated April 2014, stated that the \"U.S. government has devoted resources to reducing the amount of time required to complete the SIV process.\" Similar language appears in all subsequent quarterly reports on the Iraqi program through the most recent July 2018 report, and in all subsequent quarterly reports on the Afghan program through the April 2017 report. ", "Among other data, the quarterly reports on the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs include average total U.S. government processing time for SIV applications. This statistic excludes any steps in the application process that are the responsibility of the applicant, such as filing a petition with USCIS (see \" Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Application Process \"). In the initial April 2014 quarterly reports, average total U.S. government processing time was 239 business days for the Iraqi program and 287 business days for the Afghan program. In the January 2016 reports, average total U.S. government processing time was 311 business days for the Iraqi program and 293 business days for the Afghan program. In the most recent quarterly reports for July 2018, average total U.S. government processing time was 252 calendar days for the Iraqi program and 692 calendar days for the Afghan program.

", "Details of the security review process are not publicly available. In her written testimony for the July 2011 Senate hearing, Jacobs said, \"While we cannot discuss specifics for security reasons, SIV applicants from Iraq as well as Afghanistan undergo multiple layers of review.\" ", "In written responses to questions following an April 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, then-Secretary of State John Kerry identified the interagency security screening process as one of the \"major obstacles\" to the quick processing of Afghan SIV applications. Indicating that security screening \"takes the most time,\" he offered that \"the Department of State is working constantly with our interagency counterparts to streamline this comprehensive and essential process while eliminating bottlenecks.\" ", "Scrutiny of the security review process for Iraqi and Afghan SIV applicants increased in 2011 following the arrest on terrorism charges of two Iraqi nationals who had entered the United States through the U.S. refugee program. The potential security risks posed by prospective refugees and special immigrants from Iraq and elsewhere were discussed at the December 2012 House hearing cited above, which was entitled Terrorist Exploitation of Refugee Programs . At the hearing, then-DHS Deputy Under Secretary for Analysis Dawn Scalici described U.S. government efforts to identify potential threats:", "When we look at on [ sic ] the potential in the future for terrorist groups to exploit the refugee program, we do have concerns. Hence, we have the enhanced security and vetting procedures.... I will tell you that we have intelligence-driven processes regardless of the immigration program that a terrorist actor may seek to use or just travel to the United States. We are reviewing intelligence on a regular basis, sharing that with interagency partners and developing the procedures by which we can help to identify and further [screen] individuals of concern.", "The quarterly reports on application processing under the SIV programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government mention security screening. For example, the July 2018 reports for both programs reference \"thorough screening for national security concerns.\" Neither Iraq nor Afghanistan is among the countries subject to entry restrictions or limitations under President Donald Trump's September 2017 presidential proclamation on enhanced vetting. Regarding Iraq, however, the proclamation includes a recommendation from the Secretary of Homeland Security that \"nationals of Iraq who seek to enter the United States be subject to additional scrutiny to determine if they pose risks to the national security or public safety of the United States.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Visa Availability", "paragraphs": ["The SIV program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters is ongoing, while the programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government are temporary.

The numerical limitations language in the statutes creating the programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government also provided for the carryover of unused visas from a given fiscal year to the next during a specified period (see \" Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqis and Afghans \").", "In the case of the program for Iraqis who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government, as amended, any of the 5,000 visas made available annually for principal aliens for FY2008 through FY2012 that were not used in a given fiscal year were carried forward to the next fiscal year , with unused visas for FY2012 carried forward to FY2013. Visas that were carried forward but not used in that next fiscal year were lost. At the end of FY2013, the Iraqi program ended and any remaining visas were lost. The program was subsequently revived and new visas were authorized. Currently, P.L. 113-66 provides for the issuance of 2,500 visas to principal aliens under the Iraqi program after January 1, 2014. This law required that applications be filed by September 30, 2014, but included no deadline for issuance of the visas.", "Under the program for Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government, as originally authorized, any of the 1,500 visas made available annually for principal aliens for FY2009 through FY2013 that were not used in a given fiscal year were carried forward to the next fiscal year. P.L. 113-76 provided for the issuance of 3,000 visas to principal aliens for FY2014 and for the carrying forward of any unused balance for issuance in FY2015. As under the Iraqi program, carried-over visas that were not used in the second fiscal year were lost.", "Subsequent Afghan special immigrant visa provisions enacted by the 113 th Congress made additional visas available subject to specified employment periods, application deadlines, and visa issuance authority expiration dates. Legislation enacted by the 114 th , 115 th , and 116 th Congresses made additional visas available for issuance after December 14, 2014, but provided that these visas would remain available until used. Some of these laws also extended employment termination dates and application deadlines (see \" Afghan Program \"). In 2014 and 2017, DOS temporarily stopped scheduling interviews for Afghan special immigrant visa applicants due to a dwindling stock of available visas. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides for the issuance of a total of 18,500 visas to principal aliens under the Afghan program after December 19, 2014.", "The SIV program for translators and interpreters is capped at 50 visas for principal aliens per year. It has been capped at this level for each year except for FY2007 and FY2008, when the cap stood at 500. This program did not originally include carryover provisions, but such language was later added by amendment. As under the other SIV programs, visas that are carried forward but not used in the next fiscal year are lost.", "Consideration of these numerical limitation and carryover provisions, in conjunction with the visa issuance data for the SIV programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government (in Table A-3 and Table A-4 in the Appendix ), indicates that thousands of visas provided for these two programs are no longer available. As shown in the tables, through FY2013, visa issuances under both programs consistently fell well below the statutory limits. Under current statutory provisions for the SIV programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government, as described above, there are no deadlines for the issuance of the visas.
