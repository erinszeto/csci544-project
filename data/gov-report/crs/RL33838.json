Congress has also mandated that a billion-dollar fund for public safety communications, created by the Deficit Reduction Act, be fully distributed by the end of FY2007 (S. 2653). As part of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007, Congress put in place a number of requirements for an Office of Emergency Communications that, among other objectives, is to work with community, state and regional representatives to develop a national emergency communications capability (P.L. 109-295, Title VI, Subtitle D).

Previously used for analog television broadcasting, 24 MHz of wireless capacity at 700 MHZ will become available to public safety in 2009. By requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish an Office of Emergency Communications, Congress has legislated the creation of a forum to reach agreement on an interoperable communications plan. Congress has not passed legislation, however, regarding how the soon-to-be-released spectrum should be used.", "There are currently three major initiatives to develop plans that could incorporate spectrum at 700 MHz in solutions for public safety communications to improve interoperability and resiliency. One initiative is Congress's mandate to DHS to bring together a diverse body of experts and develop a National Emergency Communications Plan that would rely, at least in part, on shared networks.", "Second, an initiative by the Administration to improve spectrum efficiency gives responsibility to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to provide policy recommendations that include spectrum uses for homeland security and public safety.

Some of the unresolved policy choices brought into focus by the FCC proposal are:", "Direction of national planning for emergency communications. Control of network operations. Joint management by agencies. Regulatory vs. legislative authority. Spectrum management. Congressional jurisdiction.

Congress may change the terms of the debate by setting its own timetable, objectives, and parameters for creating a national authority to manage a public safety network at 700 MHz. Options for Congress that have been suggested by public safety experts include requiring the Department of Homeland Security to expedite its own plans, requiring greater participation of the FCC in the DHS planning process, curtailing the right of the FCC to regulate network development for public safety, and turning over management of spectrum used for public safety to the NTIA.

Spectrum licenses are allocated within bands of designated frequencies, divided into bandwidths, or channels. Licenses are assigned, as is the case for state and local public safety agencies, or auctioned to commercial entities. As new wireless tools are developed to help emergency responders, the demand for spectrum increases. Finding appropriate spectrum to carry these vital transmissions as well as finding ways to use spectrum more efficiently are among the policy decisions to be addressed as part of the national effort to develop a robust, interoperable, emergency communications capability.", "Pricing spectrum access for all users, or auctioning all spectrum and creating property rights, are market-driven methods for allocating spectrum that could maximize economically efficient use. In the case of public safety, however, demand may be inelastic and substitution difficult with the result that the cost to the public is increased without any compensating gains. The need for spectrum capacity among first responders and other emergency workers is variable. When radio communications are routine, public safety's demand for spectrum is modest. In times of crisis, demand for spectrum exceeds availability. Identifying spectrum that public safety can share\u2014with commercial users for example\u2014is also considered a possible means to use valuable spectrum more efficiently.", "Although, cumulatively, radio frequencies designated for non-federal public safety total over 90 MHz, the characteristics of these frequencies are dissimilar, requiring different technological solutions. Although the fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public safety has some advantages for voice communications, it is a significant barrier to achieving needed broadband capacity for the future. It is one of the technical problems that plague public safety communications, such as out-of-date equipment, proprietary solutions, network congestion, and interference among systems. Providing new spectrum at 700 MHz for broadband communications capabilities, including interoperable connectivity, is viewed by many as the optimal solution for overcoming problems caused by incompatible radio frequencies and technologies, as well as for enhancing communications capacity for public safety. Because 700 MHz is viewed as highly desirable for consumer-oriented applications, some believe that a means should be found for public safety and commercial users to share radio frequencies in this band."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology-Driven Choices Influence Policy Decisions", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the FCC has proposed the building of a network, accessible nationwide, that would require standardized interfaces. This model, which mirrors the organization of commercial wireless service in the United States, represents a significant departure from existing public safety radio operations. Like most public safety support services, radio communications have historically been built primarily for local operations, often with proprietary solutions that limit interoperability. With post-9/11 emphasis on improving interoperability, three technology-based solutions for nationwide interoperability have dominated policy making. These are: radios\u2014pursued primarily through standard setting; gateways\u2014supported through guidance from DHS and federal grants; and networks\u2014recognized as a potential solution but not developed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Radios", "paragraphs": ["One solution for achieving interoperability is to build it into the radios carried by first responders and other emergency workers, requiring standardized models that work on multiple systems. Radio standardization is part of a suite of standards being developed through an effort known as Project 25 (or P25). Project 25 is the accepted standard for radio interoperability. The radio-based solution to interoperability conforms to recommendations made in 1996 by the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC) regarding the improvement of public safety communications over wireless networks. P25 radios can be costly, from $600 to $1,000 for general purpose radios, and $3,000 for radios that meet standards for federal use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gateways", "paragraphs": ["A second technology choice, also developed partly in response to recommendations made by PSWAC, are gateways\u2014also known as bridges, or as cross-talk or cross-patch systems, among other terms. The gateway is a \"black box\" that can accept wireless transmissions on one frequency standard and resend them on other frequency standards. As a result, they are inefficient users of spectrum, since a single message is using two or more frequency assignments. Gateways can provide interfaces for modern systems but not for older, obsolete radios. Although gateways typically use Internet Protocol (IP) to connect to information technology systems, some components are proprietary and have limited interoperability with rival gateway solutions. Early gateway solutions were tested through the AGILE Program, created by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). Project 25 members are working to complete a standard for public safety gateways, the Inter-Sub-System Interface (ISSI), that would enable full interoperability for future gateway solutions. Gateways have become the centerpiece of current efforts by DHS to achieve situational interoperability. Over the long term, DHS expects gateway solutions to evolve into a \"standards-based shared system.\" Gateways range in price from $500,000 for basic capability into millions of dollars for a large, customized system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Networks", "paragraphs": ["A third technology choice, considered but not adopted at the federal level, is a network solution. A network solution requires agreement from multiple jurisdictions to deploy compatible equipment and interfaces that can provide links anywhere in the network. A national network might be comprised of regional agreements grouping states that are working to develop networks that are available to local and tribal emergency workers. The technology exists to achieve interoperability through a network, what are lacking are a mechanism to achieve agreement and the leadership to set the mechanism in motion and guide it to resolution. The 9/11 Commission broached the subject of creating a network in its recommendation that high-risk urban areas \"should establish signal corps units to ensure communications connectivity.\" Congress embraced the 9/11 Commission recommendation and instructed DHS to explore solutions modeled on the Army Signal Corps, using a national architecture, and compatible with commercial technologies.", "The DHS has been focused on the installation of gateways and developing interoperability \"from the bottom up,\" and has not announced plans to use spectrum at 700 MHz to develop an interoperable network capability that could, over time, be extended through interfaces to existing systems. Reportedly, Jay Cohen, DHS Undersecretary for Science and Technology, has advocated the concept of a digital backbone to achieve interoperability. DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has voiced support for an interoperable network at 700MHz if Congress decides to free up additional spectrum for that purpose; these are recent statements, however, and not part of a formal policy.", "Absent federal action for a network solution that would encompass state, local, and tribal public safety users, the private sector has responded, through comments filed with the FCC, with proposals to use 700 MHz spectrum to create the needed network for public safety. Some of the proposals would share network capacity with commercial users, offsetting the cost of building the network by charging fees for access. Although the cost for such a network is undetermined, the estimated cost for the federal Integrated Wireless Network was originally reported to be $10 billion. Some industry estimates have given a $1 billion to $2 billion range for the build-out of a commercial broadband network reaching the top 150 markets. A national network would cost more, but how much more would depend on many variables that should be resolved in the planning process. Building interoperability into a network reduces the cost for new radios, bringing the prices to public safety within the range of devices used by consumers on commercial networks.", "In part because of recent actions by the FCC, new attention is being paid by policy-makers to the potential of a network solution to provide interoperability for public safety. But this approach has not been pursued by DHS since its creation.

Comments received from the public safety community overwhelmingly supported the need for additional spectrum, although other bands besides 700 MHz were also mentioned. The FCC did not make a specific recommendation for additional spectrum allocations in the short-term although it stated that it agreed that public safety \"could make use of such an allocation in the long-term to provide broadband services.\" It qualified this statement by observing that spectrum is only one factor in assuring access to mobile broadband services for emergency response. It further announced that it would move expeditiously to determine whether the current band plan for the 24 MHz at 700 MHz currently designated for public safety could be modified to accommodate broadband applications. Subsequently, in March 2006, the FCC issued a request for proposals for a new band plan that would allocate spectrum for broadband use by first responders within the 24 MHz currently assigned for public safety. The same proposed rulemaking also asked for additional comment on the possible adaptation of a wireless broadband standard for interoperability.", "The FCC received over 1,000 responses by December 2006, with many comments from the public safety community and commercial wireless interests. One petition, from a company called Cyren Call Communications Corporation, received widespread publicity in the press and through lobbying to Congress. The petition requested the reallocation of 30 MHz (half of the 60MHz currently designated for auction for commercial use by the Deficit Reduction Act) to a \"Public Safety Broadband Trust.\" According to the proposal, the trust would lease capacity not used by public safety to commercial operators that would provide the network infrastructure. The FCC denied Cyren Call's petition, citing, among other reasons, the Congressional mandate to auction the spectrum Cyren Call proposed to use. Other proposals for joint operations were also submitted. One proposal, developed by Access Spectrum and Pegasus Communications Corporation, suggested accommodating broadband wireless by rebanding the 24 MHz allocated to public safety and adding 3 MHz from existing guardband allocations, with some of the spectrum shared with commercial operators. Verizon Wireless reportedly proposed to build a broadband network for public safety use on half of the 24 MHz of spectrum assigned to public safety, using the other 12 MHz for mixed use, with the cost of building the infrastructure recovered through leasing arrangements and fees.", "In December 2006, the FCC issued a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to turn over management of the 24MHz of spectrum designated for public safety to a not-for-profit group.

The licensee's responsibilities would include the design and implementation, build-out, and maintenance of a national network, the coordination of eligibility for access for public safety, and the leasing of capacity to commercial users. The licensee would be able to charge fees for the use of its services, such as access to the network, to both public safety and commercial users.", "In the NPRM, the FCC requests comments be filed no later than 45 days after publication in the Federal Register with reply comments due within 60 days after.

How to \"best implement a broadband network.\" System Architecture . \"Should the national public safety licensee have the discretion to choose the best system architecture, or should the Commission establish system architecture requirements . . . ?\" Nationwide Interoperability . The proposal requires that the licensee be required to construct a network that would provide interoperability for all devices operating on a national broadband public safety network. The FCC seeks comment on whether it should require IP-based standards for network access or whether it should require interoperable solutions that accommodate legacy systems. It seeks comment on other solutions and on the cost-benefit trade-offs of various interoperability requirements. Federal Access . Comment is sought on opening the network to federal users, including the Department of Defense. Network Build-Out . The FCC seeks comment on \"appropriate\" timing and scope and on several of its suggestions on how to move the build-out quickly and efficiently. Network Resiliency and Disaster Restoration . Comment is sought on what requirements the FCC might impose on the network for resiliency and disaster restoration and whether \"robustness requirements be imposed on all public safety systems, not just the national public safety system.\" Local Needs . The FCC seeks comment on whether the national public safety licensee should permit local entities operational discretion\u2014and how much\u2014within the norms of the network. Definition of Public Safety . The FCC proposes to use the definition of public safety services provided in the Communications Act [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 337 (f)(1)] which states that providers are state or local government entities or authorized non-governmental organizations that do not make their services commercially available. This statutory requirement could influence the manner in which the FCC structures and awards the proposed national license.", "The NPRM also seeks comments on secondary operations by commercial users on the remaining 12 MHz of spectrum assigned by Congress for public safety use.

If the cost of building a network is offset by allowing commercial use, will the network operator show a preference for solutions that mesh with commercial interests or will it give priority to developing interfaces that support other federal and state programs for emergency communications? Non-commercial interoperable communications needs might, for example, extend to 911 call centers, emergency alert systems, border security, and to other emergency workers, often referred to as the \"second tier.\" Joint management by agencies . The FCC and NTIA have a history of working together to develop and implement spectrum policy. What role, if any, would the NTIA, the Presidential Spectrum Initiative, and the Spectrum Advisory Council play in advising, directing or regulating the development and operation of any network? How would management of the 700 MHz network interface with FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Response Plan and other federal authorities with responsibilities for establishing and maintaining emergency communications? Regulatory and legislative actions . The FCC is using its regulatory authority over spectrum use to take action in an area (improvement to public safety communications) where Congress has assigned responsibility to DHS. Should Congress seek means to coordinate the FCC plan with planning efforts at DHS? Or take some other action to assign responsibility for planning and implementation? Spectrum management . What are the best policies to encourage efficient use of spectrum by public safety? Market-driven pricing has been proposed by the FCC, among others. If this is applied only to usage at 700 MHz, would it be effective policy to have a two-speed regulatory framework for public safety spectrum licenses, with one set of rules for 700 MHz and different rules for other spectrum holdings? Congressional jurisdiction . In the law that created the Office of Emergency Communications, Congress specified that, in reviewing interoperable emergency communications plans, the emergency communications director would exclude the review of spectrum allocation and management. Congress has yet to make decisions about jurisdiction for programs planned and funded by DHS that operate on spectrum managed by the FCC and the NTIA. Funding . Funding of $1 billion expressly for interoperable communications is mandated for 2007. This would be in the form of a distribution from the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund created by the Deficit Reduction Act. According to language directing distributions from the fund, grants are to be spent for \"the acquisition of, deployment of or training for the use of interoperable communications systems that utilize, or enable interoperability with communications systems that can utilize\" spectrum at 700 MHz. New federal funding for interoperable communications is under consideration. Many propose that the cost of a new network built on public safety spectrum be funded with access fees from users.

This could possibly preempt any decisions or recommendations from the NTIA and DHS, which are operating within unspecified but apparently longer time frames.", "In a different scenario, the FCC might provide a bridge connecting the Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Group that DHS is to create to Regional Planning Committees like those the FCC originally formed to develop the 700 MHz band plan and agreements on interoperability. The FCC could then bring to the RECC table the benefits of regional representation, technical expertise, and a broad sample of public opinion from its rulemaking efforts. A network not unlike the one now proposed by the FCC might be the result, but with potentially wider participation and acceptance. Such a network might be administered by the Office of Emergency Communications, not through FCC regulations.", "Another possibility is that DHS might cede responsibilities and requirements stated in P.L. 109-295 for developing public safety networks to the FCC. This could diminish the scope of the new Office of Emergency Communications. In that scenario, DHS might focus on continuing its policy of assisting cities and other areas in setting up gateways, adding access to the 700MHz systems. The advantage of spectrum efficiency through sharing frequencies at 700 MHz would likely be lost to public safety users (but not to commercial users).", "In the absence of clear authority and direction, many routes are possible.
