While the CIFs still aim to scale up existing practices and fund activities at the project level, they also were created to serve as laboratories for new financing schemes and vehicles for developing sustainable strategies. Funding strives to target the potential for large-scale transformation and to attain global environmental benefits. Stakeholders seek to share knowledge gained and inspire the use of best practice. As such, multinational or regional investment plans that support global development goals, energy security, industrial growth, diversification, and regional integration (e.g., the M.E.N.A. plan) best exemplify the CIFs' programmatic approach. Country-led Process . Beyond a simple project-by-project approach, the purpose of the CIFs is to bolster the efforts of countries' official adaptation plans and their actions toward low-carbon, climate-resilient development. The country-led approach aims to integrate funding into the country-owned development strategies consistent with the Paris Declaration. Innovative Governance and Stakeholder Engagement . In an effort to attain transparency and accountability, the governing structure of the CIFs is equally balanced between donor and developing countries.

The differences among multilateral or bilateral assistance, grant or lending institutions, regional or global organizations, etc., all play a role in the structure of assistance. The decision to employ the MDBs as trustees for the CIFs has both advantages and disadvantages. Historically, the MDBs have provided financial assistance to developing countries, typically in the form of loans and grants, for investment projects and organizational capacity. Donor country support for the MDBs\u2014including U.S. support\u2014has assisted efforts to promote institutions, strengthen financial systems, undertake large infrastructure and social welfare projects, and develop property rights and rules of law. Through increased global integration, the aim of the MDBs has been to bolster economic growth, poverty alleviation, and resource allocation (including greater access to electricity) in developing countries while simultaneously building new markets for developed countries' exports and jobs. In 2008, at the urging of some donor countries, a strategy to address climate change was added to the MDBs' development agenda. The \"Strategic Framework on Development and Climate Change\" analyzed the risks of climate change to economic development and served as a basis for integrating mitigation and adaptation planning into national development plans. Donor countries see several advantages to financing climate programs through the institutional structure of the MDBs. These advantages include, but are not limited to, the following:", "Commitment to Private Sector Development . Many donor countries\u2014including the United States\u2014believe that climate-friendly economic growth can be led by the private sector through such efforts as improving access to financial markets, building the capacity of entrepreneurs, and providing training to civilian society. One aim of the MDBs is to help foster private sector development by leveraging donor funds into highly effective co-financing arrangements. Historically, the U.S. Administration has supported these efforts. In a March 25, 2010, hearing before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, the Treasury Department went on record as stating that the United States invests in the MDBs because \"they help generate new engines of growth that benefit the U.S. economy and the global economy as a whole.\" Economies of Scale, Coordination, and Co-f inancing . Proponents of the MDBs argue that multilateral assistance can solve problems of scale and efficiency by providing specialized expertise while lowering administration and coordination costs. Similarly, more competitive procurement rules, attractive cost-sharing opportunities, and the ability to leverage co-financing from other public and private organizations allow the MDBs to play a catalytic role in mobilizing financial aid. At the March 25, 2010, hearing noted above, the Treasury Department stated that the MDBs \"provide strong, effective and highly leveraged means to advance global prosperity.... For every dollar the United States contributes to paid-in capital for the World Bank, six dollars of additional capital is generated by other donors. And, for every dollar we invest in the World Bank, $26 worth of aid is delivered.\" Responsiveness to Donors . The Treasury Department has similarly stated that the United States invests in the MDBs because they \"promot[e] core American interests and values.\" This arrangement is due primarily to the structure and organization of the banks. MDBs' governance is weighted on the basis of the cumulative financial contributions and commitments by the donor countries, and thus, while a single trust fund, like the CIFs, may be designed to balance equally the roles of developed and developing countries, the MDBs are designed to give greater weight to the major donors. The United States retains the most influence on World Bank matters, with a 14.97% voting share and the ability to veto major policy decisions. It is followed by Japan in second place, Germany in third, and France and the United Kingdom tied for fourth. The only developing or emerging country with as much voting interest is China, at fifth, with 3.21%. With a governing structure that requires one representative from the World Bank, as trustee, and one representative from the group of remaining MDBs, as well as eight representatives from participating donor countries, the overall governance structure of the CIFs has remained responsive to donor interests. Possession of Fiduciary Standards. Both current and past U.S. Administrations have argued that the World Bank has the proper internal safeguards to oversee large amounts of financing. As reported by the Department of Treasury, \"the World Bank is an attractive trustee [for environmental funds] precisely because of its strong fiduciary standards and its extensive capacity to uphold them.\" Possession of Institutional Expertise, Information, and Credibility Provisions . Proponents of the MDBs claim that multilateral agencies offer larger and better trained staffs with greater technical expertise. They state that large infrastructure investment, particularly in innovative technologies and methods, requires professionals who are experienced in identifying and facilitating access to technology, sharing risks associated with commercialization, and improving institutional capacity. Beyond institutional knowledge, multilaterals also collect, interpret, and disseminate costly information on a global scale and provide credibility controls for both recipient and donor governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues of Concern for Developing Countries and NGOs", "paragraphs": ["While advantages exist to financing climate programs through the institutional structure of the MDBs, concerns also persist. A variety of recipient countries and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have highlighted a number of issues, including, but not limited to, the following:", "Coordination with Other Funds. Proponents argue that the fundamental principle of the CIFs is coordination at the country-level among interested stakeholders, including other developmental partners. However, some observers believe that the CIFs have created a parallel structure for financing climate change efforts outside both bilateral and the ongoing multilateral framework for climate change negotiations. They are concerned that without harmonization between the CIFs and the other sources of environmental finance (e.g., funds managed by the U.N., the Global Environment Facility, and bilateral sources), overlaps, redundancies, competing views, and lack of synergy may affect climate priorities, funding processes, and qualifying criteria. Potential to Prejudice U.N. Climate Provisions . Some commentators and several governments have expressed concerns that the establishment of the CIFs as trust funds in the MDBs may prejudice the outcomes of the international negotiations on climate finance within the framework of the United Nations. Many developing countries have expressly stated that they do not consider funds contributed to the CIFs as meeting U.N. Annex I obligations. Furthermore, the design of the CIFs includes a \"sunset clause\" stating that the CIFs \"will take necessary steps to conclude its operations once a new [UNFCCC] financial architecture is effective.\" The nature of these steps has yet to be determined. Further, additional contributions to the CIFs beyond the initial 2008 pledges (e.g., by Canada ($193 million), United Kingdom (\u00a3375 million), Denmark ($8 million), Germany ($12 million), Norway ($19 million), Sweden ($25 million), and Switzerland ($6 million)) may complicate these negotiations. Potential for Additionality . The UNFCCC provides that developed country signatories to the Convention \"provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties\" in their efforts at mitigation and adaptation. Some observers fear that the design of the CIFs establishes a parallel process for climate financing that does not result in new and additional resources. They are concerned that significant portions of the aid budgets of donors may be diverted into the CIFs and counted as part of their annual ODA commitments. Lack of Polluter Responsibility . Some commentators claim that the provision of loans as a financial instrument to eligible developing countries contradicts the internationally agreed principle of \"polluter pays\" as stated in the Rio Declaration. Some argue that the repayment of a loan, notwithstanding the degree of concessionality, burdens a developing country with self-paying for a problem (climate change) that was caused by others (i.e., developed countries). They believe this burden may affect the country's ability to generate resources for growth. Commercial Influence . While advantages exist in prioritizing market-based solutions to dealing with the problems of climate, some groups express concern that the private sector may be unduly driven by commercial interests at the expense of social or environmental safeguards. Concern also exists that a dependence on market mechanisms as a source of climate financing may be inadequate and inconsistent for meeting the financial needs of developing countries charged with the responsibility of both implementing climate change commitments and mediating the social, economic, and environmental dislocations brought on by climate change. Energy and En vironmental Policy at the Banks . Many observers claim that the history of the World Bank's energy and infrastructure lending undermines its credibility as an institution committed to combating the impacts of climate change. Environmental NGOs have often highlighted the inconsistencies between the Bank's rhetoric on climate change and its operational policies and practices. They emphasize that while the Bank has increased financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency in recent years, its fossil fuel lending still accounts for 56% of the energy sector share for fiscal years 2008 to 2010 (compared to 15% for renewable energy, 20% for energy efficiency, and 9% for large hydropower). The controversy is compounded by the Bank's inability to reach a consensus on the definition of \"clean energy technology,\" retaining provisions for ultra-supercritical coal-fired power generation in its environmental strategies. Recent guidance from the U.S. Administration regarding the World Bank's engagement with coal-fired power generation in developing countries similarly leaves the definition open, stating that projects \"could include more carbon efficient fossil fuel generation\" in their portfolio. While observers generally agree that funding from the CIFs is unlikely to be used in coal-fired power generation projects, most agree that continued investment by the World Bank in fossil fuel energy and infrastructure may have several unintended effects, including (1) counteracting any gains made with the Bank's renewable portfolio, (2) directing resources toward large-scale power generation for industrial use rather than energy access and poverty reduction in poor urban and rural communities, and (3) drawing the Bank's professional and technical staff away from a concentration on energy efficiency and renewable energy activities to remain involved with fossil fuels."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
