This is intended to recognize the disadvantaged financial situation of those hospitals because low-income patients are more likely to be uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. Hospitals often do not receive payment for services rendered to uninsured patients, and Medicaid provider payment rates are generally lower than the rates paid by Medicare and private insurance.", "The federal government provides each state an annual DSH allotment, which is the maximum amount of federal matching funds that each state can claim for Medicaid DSH payments. The ACA included a provision directing the Secretary of HHS to make aggregate reductions because the ACA health insurance coverage provisions would reduce the need for Medicaid DSH payments. The ACA Medicaid DSH reductions have been amended a few times since the ACA, but under current law, the Medicaid DSH allotments will be reduced for the years FY2017 through FY2024. ", "Hospitals in states that are not expanding Medicaid are concerned because Medicaid DSH allotments will be reduced without regard to whether or not states implement the expansion. If a state implements the expansion, uncompensated care for hospitals should decline along with the DSH allotments (though not proportionally). However, if a state chooses not to implement the expansion, the demand for uncompensated hospital care is expected to persist but the amount of Medicaid DSH payments hospitals receive to subsidize such care may be reduced. As a result, hospitals have been encouraging states to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion in order to reduce uncompensated care for hospitals. Even though Medicaid provider rates are generally lower than the rates paid by private insurance or Medicare, hospitals are likely better off with payment for a Medicaid patient than no payment for an uninsured patient. ", "Appendix A. States' Current Medicaid Income Eligibility Levels", "The three major categories of non-elderly adults that would receive Medicaid coverage under the ACA Medicaid expansion are adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and adults with disabilities. Prior to the implementation of the ACA Medicaid expansion, only a few states provided Medicaid coverage to adults without dependent children, and in general, the Medicaid income eligibility level for parents and disabled adults was significantly lower than 133% of FPL (i.e., the ACA Medicaid expansion eligibility level). ", "State-by-state Medicaid income eligibility levels and private health insurance exchange eligibility for subsidized coverage for non-elderly adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and non-elderly adults with disabilities as of January 1, 2014 are provided in Figure A-1 , Figure A-2 , and Figure A-3 (respectively). ", "These figures show the coverage gaps in states, which means individuals with incomes that fall in the coverage gap do not have access to full Medicaid coverage or exchange subsidized coverage. States that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion do not have coverage gaps, while most states that have not implemented the expansion have coverage gaps for all three populations. ", " Figure A-1 shows the coverage for adults without dependent children. Most states that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion provide Medicaid eligibility up to 133% of FPL (effectively 138% of FPL with the 5% income disregard). Of the states that have implemented the expansion, only the District of Columbia and Minnesota have higher income eligibility levels at 210% of FPL (effectively 215% of FPL) and 200% of FPL (effectively 205% of FPL), respectively. Except for Wisconsin, the states that have not implemented the expansion do not have Medicaid coverage for adults without dependent children. Wisconsin provides Medicaid coverage to adults without dependent children up to 95% of FPL (effectively 100% of FPL).", " Figure A-2 shows the coverage for parents with dependent children. All states provide Medicaid coverage to this population through the mandatory Medicaid eligibility pathway of Section 1931 coverage, which requires states to provide Medicaid coverage for parents (and their dependent children), at a minimum, at the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) eligibility levels in place on July 16, 1996. Section 1931 of the Social Security Act also gives states the option to cover parents with incomes above the 1996 minimum levels and most states do. Under Section 1931 coverage, parents receive traditional Medicaid coverage. The income eligibility level for Section 1931 coverage is less than 133% of FPL for most states.", "For states that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion and did not have Medicaid coverage for parents up to 133% of FPL (effectively 138% of FPL), parents with incomes above the pre-expansion level up to 133% of FPL (effectively 138% of FPL) receive coverage under the expansion rules (e.g., alternative benefit plan coverage). ", "Except for Maine and Wisconsin, the states that have not implemented the expansion have coverage gaps for parents with dependent children between the upper bound of their Section 1931 coverage and 100% of FPL when most of these parents are eligible for subsidized coverage through the exchange. Maine and Wisconsin provide Medicaid coverage to parents with dependent children up to 100% of FPL (effectively 105% of FPL) and 95% of FPL (effectively 100% of FPL), respectively.", " Figure A-3 shows coverage for adults with disabilities. All states provide Medicaid coverage to adults with disabilities through mandatory Medicaid coverage for recipients of SSI or through optional eligibility pathways, such as Section 209(b), poverty level, medically needy, and special income level. Under these eligibility pathways, adults with disabilities receive traditional Medicaid benefits. In all states, the Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults with disabilities under these eligibility pathways are significantly less than 100% of FPL.", "For states that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion, adults with disabilities with incomes above the pre-expansion level up to 133% of FPL (effectively 138% of FPL) receive coverage under the expansion rules (e.g., alternative benefit plan coverage).", "The states that have not implemented the expansion have coverage gaps for adults with disabilities between the upper bound of their Medicaid coverage for adults with disabilities and 100% of FPL when most of these adults are eligible for subsidized coverage through the exchange.", "Appendix B. Estimates of State-by-State Impact of ACA Medicaid Expansion", "The potential impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion varies significantly from state to state. In terms of expenditures, while the federal government will be funding a vast majority of the ACA Medicaid expansion, the estimated state share of the ACA Medicaid expansion expenditures range from states that already provide Medicaid coverage to the expansion population saving money to states with the largest coverage gains seeing increases to state Medicaid expenditures. Medicaid enrollment is estimated to increase at varying rates from state to state due to the current variation in states' Medicaid income eligibility levels for parents and childless adults. ", " Table B-1 shows the estimated state-by-state impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion on Medicaid expenditures and enrollment for 2022 if a state chooses to implement the expansion. According to the data in this table from an Urban Institute analysis, if all states chose to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion, Medicaid expenditures for 2022 would be $122.8 billion ($117.4 billion in federal funds and $5.4 billion in state funds) higher than if no states chose to implement the expansion. Also, if all states chose to implement the expansion, Medicaid enrollment would be 15.5 million higher in 2022 than if no states chose to implement the expansion. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
