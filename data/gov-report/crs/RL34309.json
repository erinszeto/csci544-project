The NCVS asks respondents whether they have been the victim of rape and sexual assault, robbery, simple and aggravated assault, purse snatching/pickpocketing, burglary, theft, or motor vehicle theft.

For example, in the 103 rd Congress, the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program was created to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with grants to help them hire, rehire, and redeploy law enforcement officers to engage in community policing. Congress cited both UCR and NCVS crime statistics when articulating the need for more community policing officers.", "In addition to shaping policy, Congress has used crime data to develop formula allocations for certain grant programs. For example, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program formula uses UCR data to allocate federal funds to state and local governments for criminal justice programs.", "In the 110 th Congress, two bills have been introduced ( S. 368 and H.R. 1700 ) that would increase authorized funding for and expand the scope of the COPS program. The impetus for the legislation was a recent increase in the violent crime rate as reported by the UCR. Moreover, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended increased funding for state and local law enforcement to support efforts to fight and prevent crime. The House report that accompanied the House Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill stated that the committee was concerned about the recent increase in the violent crime rate. In addition, the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees increased funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to hire additional agents to investigate violent crime. The committees felt it was important for the FBI to help state and local law enforcement investigate violent crime in light of the recent increase in the violent crime rate.

The IACP felt that a national system of crime reporting would put inevitable (and unpredictable) swings in the number of reported crimes in a single jurisdiction into a proper context. The IACP felt that putting changes in local crime incidence in the proper context would help reduce media pressure on local jurisdictions and police chiefs from sensational or sporadic increases in crime, which had resulted in some police departments \"cooking the books\" to reduce the amount of recorded crime (though there was no reduction in the amount of crime reported to the police). The Committee decided that offenses known to police would be the most appropriate measure of the incidence of crime in the United States. The Committee\u2014after evaluating various crimes on the basis of their seriousness, frequency of occurrence, pervasiveness in all areas of the country, and likelihood of being reported to the police\u2014identified seven crimes for which local law enforcement would report data to the national program: felonious murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny/theft, and auto theft. The IACP focused on these seven crimes because they were prevalent, generally serious in their nature, widely identified by victims and witnesses as criminal incidents, and most likely to be reported to police. Differences in the way that state criminal codes defined different crimes prevented the IACP from simply aggregating state statistics to count the number of offenses known to police. Thus, the IACP developed standardized offense definitions for the seven offense categories.", "In 1929, IACP published Uniform Crime Reporting , a manual for police records and statistics, which included uniform definitions for law enforcement agencies to use when submitting data to IACP. In that same year, 400 cities in 43 states and the territories of Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska submitted statistics to IACP, which published the data in Uniform Crime Reports for the United States and Its Possessions . In 1930, Congress, at the urging of IACP, authorized the Attorney General to collect crime data. The Attorney General designated the FBI as the clearinghouse for crime data collected through the UCR.", "The scope of the UCR program has continued to expand since it was created. Some of the changes to the UCR program include the following:", "Starting in 1952, law enforcement agencies began to submit data on the age, sex, and race of people arrested for crimes. Beginning in 1958, the FBI began to estimate annual crime rates for the nation as a whole. Prior to 1958, the FBI did not aggregate the data to the national level because there were not enough law enforcement agencies submitting data to the FBI to allow it to report national crime rates. Instead, the FBI published data in tables only according to the size of the reporting jurisdiction. In 1958, the FBI created a national crime index to serve as a general indicator of criminality in the United States. The national crime index was the total number of reported murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny/theft (over $50), and auto theft offenses. In 1960, the UCR started to collect national statistics on law enforcement officers killed. In 1972, the UCR started to collect specific information on incidents in which law enforcement officers were killed or assaulted. In 1962, the UCR, through the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR), started to collect data, where available, on the age, sex, and race of murder victims, the weapon used, and the circumstances surrounding the offense. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, there was continued growth of state UCR programs, which served as an intermediary between local law enforcement and the FBI (see below). In 1978, Congress mandated the collection of arson data. In 1982, Congress required the FBI to permanently count arson as a Part I offense (a definition of \"Part I offense\" is below). The FBI started to publish a \"modified crime index,\" which included the total number of reported index crimes plus the total number of reported arsons. In 1990, following the passage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act ( P.L. 101-275 ), the FBI started to collect data on bias motivation in criminal incidents in which the offense resulted in whole or in part because of the offender's prejudice against a race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/nationality. In 1994, Congress amended the Act to require the FBI to collect data on incidents in which the offense resulted from the offender's bias against a physical or mental disability. In 2004, the FBI discontinued publishing both the crime index and the modified crime index.

The FBI's requirements for state UCR programs are as follows:", "UCR program must conform to national UCR program standards, definitions, and information required. The agency responsible for collecting UCR data must have a proven, effective, statewide program, and it must have instituted acceptable quality control procedures. The state crime reporting must cover a percentage of the state's population at least equal to that covered by the national UCR program. The state UCR program must have adequate field staff assigned to conduct audits and assist contributing agencies in record-keeping practices and crime-reporting procedures. The state UCR program must regularly provide the FBI with all of the detailed data collected from individual law enforcement agencies that report to the state UCR program in the form of duplicate returns, computer printouts, and/or appropriate electronic media. The state UCR program must have the proven capability (tested over a period of time) to supply all the statistical data required in time to meet the publication deadlines of the national UCR program.", "The FBI helps state UCR programs meet these requirements by (1) reviewing and editing data submitted by individual agencies; (2) contacting individual agencies within a state when necessary in connection with crime reporting matters; (3) coordinating with the state UCR program to conduct training on law enforcement record-keeping and crime-reporting procedures; (4) sending reporting forms to state UCR programs so they can be distributed to law enforcement agencies within the state; and (5) coordinating individual law enforcement agency contacts with the state UCR program. The FBI also makes Quality Assurance Reviews (QARs) available to state UCR programs. QARs are voluntary and part of the FBI's triennial audit of states' criminal justice information systems.

The FBI collects data on the number of arrests made for 21 other offenses (see Appendix B ), known as Part II offenses. The UCR is a summary system, meaning that offense data submitted to the FBI by local law enforcement agencies show the total number of known Part I offenses. Likewise, UCR arrest data show the total number of persons arrested by reporting law enforcement agencies. Arrest data submitted to the UCR program by local law enforcement agencies also provide data on the basic characteristics\u2014age, sex, and race\u2014of persons arrested.

The FBI asks law enforcement agencies across the country to submit data to the UCR program on the number of sworn officers and civilian law enforcement personnel. The FBI, through the UCR's Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR), collects data on the age, sex, and race of murder victims and offenders; the type of weapon(s) used in the murders; relationships between victims and offenders; and the circumstances surrounding each incident. The FBI collects data on incidents in which law enforcement officers are killed, either feloniously or accidently, or assaulted while performing their duties.

For each hate crime incident, law enforcement agencies collect data on the offense type, location, bias motivation, victim type, number of offenders, and the apparent race of the offenders.", "Law enforcement agencies submit offense, arrest, clearance, and SHR data monthly. Law enforcement agencies submit data on law enforcement officers killed or assaulted only when an officer has been killed or assaulted. The FBI requires law enforcement agencies to submit hate crime data on a quarterly basis. The FBI collects data on the number of sworn officers and law enforcement personnel annually.

Classifying criminal offenses refers to the process of translating offense titles used in local and state criminal codes into the standard UCR definitions for Part I and Part II offenses. Scoring criminal offenses refers to counting the number of offenses after they have been classified. The FBI reminds state and local law enforcement agencies that they must classify and score criminal offenses based on records for calls for service, complaints, and/or investigations. According to the FBI, UCR data must reflect offense counts, not the decision of a prosecutor or the findings of a court, coroner, or jury. Uniformity in the classification and scoring of criminal offenses across jurisdictions is essential for maintaining the integrity of UCR data. In general, reporting law enforcement agencies classify and score attempted crimes as though they were completed. For example, an attempt to steal a motor vehicle would be classified and scored as a motor vehicle theft. The only exception to this rule applies to attempted murder, which is classified and scored as aggravated assault.", "The FBI has instituted three rules\u2014the hierarchy, hotel, and separation of time and place rules\u2014that local law enforcement agencies must apply when they are classifying and scoring criminal offenses. The hierarchy rule states that when multiple Part I offenses occur in a single criminal incident, only the most serious offense is scored and reported to the FBI. The hierarchy of Part I offenses is provided in Appendix C . For example, if an offender raped and then murdered a victim, the reporting law enforcement agency would score only the murder. However, there are exceptions to the hierarchy rule. The hierarchy rule does not apply to cases of arson, which are always scored and reported to the FBI, even if other Part I offenses are committed during the incident. Another exception involves motor vehicle theft. If a motor vehicle is stolen and, by extension, the contents of the vehicle constitute a larceny-theft, only the motor vehicle theft is scored and reported to the FBI, even though larceny-theft ranks higher on the hierarchy of Part I offenses. The final exception to the hierarchy rule involves justifiable homicide. In cases of justifiable homicide, two offenses are scored and reported: one for the felonious offense connected with the offender and one for the justifiable homicide, which is reported as an unfounded murder/nonnegilgent manslaughter.", "The hotel rule applies only to burglary offenses. In cases where multiple dwelling units under a single manager are burglarized and the offenses are more likely to be reported to the police by the manager rather than the individual occupants, the burglaries are scored as one offense. The hotel rule usually applies to burglaries of hotels, motels, lodging houses, or other places where the lodging of transients is the main purpose. The hotel rule would not apply in instances where multiple units that were leased or rented to tennants were burglarized, such as apartments or offices in a business building. For example, if five hotel rooms were burglarized, it would be scored as one burglary, but if five apartments were burglarized, it would be scored as five burglaries.", "The separation of time and place rule applies in instances where the same offender commits multiple offenses over a short period of time in different locations. In such cases, the reporting agency treats the offenses as separate events and classifies and scores them accordingly (i.e., applies the hierarchy and/or hotel rule). According to the FBI, the \"same time and place\" means that the time interval between the offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred are insignificant. Normally, the offenses must have occurred during an unbroken period of time and at the same or adjoining location(s). However, the time and place rule does not apply in instances where offenses, even if they are committed at different times and places, are a part of continuing criminal activity committed by the same offender(s), and an investigation deems the activity to constitute a single criminal transaction.", "When scoring offenses, the UCR program distinguishes between crimes against persons (i.e., homicide/nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, and aggravated assault) and crimes against property (i.e., robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson). For crimes against persons, one offense is counted for each victim in the criminal incident. For example, if a gunman shot and killed three people, the reporting agency would report three homicides. For crimes against property, one offense is counted for each distinct operation or attempt in a criminal incident, with the exception of motor vehicle theft, in which case one offense is counted for each stolen vehicle and one offense for each attempt to steal a motor vehicle in a criminal incident. For example, if someone walked into a store, pulled a gun, and robbed five customers, it would be scored as one robbery. In instances where multiple Part I offenses are committed against multiple victims in the same criminal incident, the hierarchy rule is applied first, and then crimes are scored based on whether they were crimes against persons or crimes against property. For example, if an assailant robbed one person and murdered someone who tried to break up the robbery, only the murder would be scored, even though two crimes were committed against two different people in the same criminal incident.", "In addition to classifying and scoring offense data, law enforcement agencies must classify and score arrest data. In many ways, arrests are classified and scored similar to the way offenses are classified and scored. Arrest data submitted to the FBI reflect the number of people arrested, not the number of charges lodged. For example, if one person is arrested for multiple crimes, the reporting law enforcement agency reports one arrest. However, if one person is arrested multiple times, and there is a separation of time and space between the arrests, each arrest is recorded separately. If a person is arrested for multiple charges, the reporting agency must use only one crime classification when reporting the arrest. Thus, if a person is arrested for both Part I and Part II offenses, the reporting agency ignores the Part II offenses and scores only the most serious Part I crime (see Appendix C ) for which the person was arrested. If a person is arrested for Part II offenses, the reporting agency must determine which is the most serious offense and score an arrest only for that offense. If multiple people are arrested for the same crime, each person is counted as a separate arrest. If a reporting agency determines that someone in custody has committed other crimes, the agency does not report additional arrests; it reports only the original arrest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Development of the NIBRS", "paragraphs": ["The data collected and disseminated by the UCR remained largely unchanged over time (i.e., since the beginning of the UCR system in 1929). Starting in the 1970s, consensus grew in the law enforcement community that the UCR needed to be updated to provide more in-depth data to meet the needs of law enforcement into the 21 st century. In response, the FBI, through the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), contracted for a phased study of the UCR program, which culminated with recommendations on how it could be improved. The study's final report, Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program ( Blueprint ), was released in May 1985, and it outlined three areas where the UCR could be enhanced to meet the future needs of law enforcement. The study recommended that law enforcement agencies use an incident-based system to report offenses and arrests. It also recommended that some law enforcement agencies submit incident-based data for all of their known offenses and all arrests (i.e., full participation), while other law enforcement agencies submit only a more limited range of incident-based data for certain crimes (i.e., limited participation). The study also recommended that the national UCR program implement a quality assurance program.", "Based on the recommendation outlined in the Blueprint , the FBI developed guidelines and design specifications for what would later become the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The FBI chose the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) to conduct a pilot study of the newly developed NIBRS guidelines and design specifications. SLED adapted its existing incident-based UCR system to meet NIBRS specifications, and it enlisted the assistance of nine local law enforcement agencies in the state to participate in the pilot study. The pilot study ran from March 1 to September 30, 1987, and it resulted in further refinement of NIBRS's guidelines and specifications.", "The FBI presented the NIBRS to law enforcement at a national UCR conference in March 1988. The conference gave the FBI the opportunity to receive feedback on the NIBRS from the law enforcement community. According to the FBI, conference attendees overwhelmingly supported implementation of the NIBRS nationwide. Attendees passed three overall recommendations: (1) that there be established a new, incident-based national crime reporting system; (2) that the FBI manage the program; and (3) that an advisory policy board composed of law enforcement executives be formed to help direct and implement the new program.

Under the NIBRS, data are not aggregated; rather, data for each criminal incident are submitted to the FBI in a separate report. For each criminal incident, participating law enforcement agencies collect data on 53 different data elements, including data on the offense(s), the offender(s), the victim(s), the arrestee(s), and any property involved in the offense. The data elements are combined into six different data segments (see Appendices D and E ). The NIBRS allows for data on multiple offenses, offenders, and victims to be collected for each criminal incident.", "NIBRS data are intended to be a by-product of local incident-based reporting (IBR) systems. Therefore, local and state law enforcement agencies can develop their own IBR systems to suit their local needs, and they can use the data from their own IBR systems to participate in the NIBRS, as long as the data submitted to the FBI meets NIBRS specifications. State and local law enforcement agencies can add additional data elements or data values to their systems.", "The NIBRS does not use the UCR's Part I and Part II offense classifications. Instead, offenses are classified as being either a Group A or Group B offense (see Appendix F ). Group A contains 46 different offenses grouped into 22 offense categories. Group B contains 11 different offenses. Law enforcement agencies are required to submit incident reports, which contain data from all six data segments, for all Group A offenses. For Group B offenses, law enforcement agencies are required to submit only arrest reports, which contain data only from the arrestee data segment. The expanded list of crimes required the FBI to create definitions for crimes counted only in the NIBRS and to modify definitions for crimes that are a part of the UCR.

If a local law enforcement agency in a state without a state UCR program wants to submit NIBRS data directly to the FBI, it will consider such a request if the agency has a NIBRS-compliant IBR system. The FBI reported that the number of local law enforcement agencies in states without UCR programs allowed to submit NIBRS data directly to the FBI is limited by the availability of resources at the FBI.

For example, if a law enforcement agency served a city of 80,000 people and the murder rate for all other MSA core cities in its population group was 10 per 100,000, then the estimated number of murders for the city would be 8 (calculated as 80,000x10.0/100,000).

At the time, the UCR was the only source for official crime data, and the Commission found that several limitations associated with the data prevented it from helping the Commission develop policy recommendations. To help rectify some of the limitations associated with UCR data, the Commission recommended the creation of a national survey of crime victimization.", "The first crime victimization survey pilot study was conducted in three Washington, DC, police precincts in the spring of 1966. The survey asked 511 Washington, DC, residents, chosen from a probability sample of homes, whether they had been a victim of one or more of a list of crimes. The Washington, DC, pilot study demonstrated that household surveys could provide a different picture of crime than the one derived from UCR data. The study showed that, depending on the type of crime, there were 3 to 10 times as many criminal incidents reported by victims than there were recorded in UCR data.", "A supplementary study was conducted in three cities: Boston, Chicago, and Washington, DC. The second study surveyed businesses and organizations in selected high-crime areas of all three cities about criminal victimizations they had experienced.

NORC's victimization survey interviewed one person in each of 10,000 households nationwide. Like the two previous pilot studies, NORC's survey found that more crime was being committed than was being reported to law enforcement. Unlike the other two studies, NORC's survey collected data on which crimes were not reported to the police and on the respondent's reason for not reporting the crime. Non-reporting was found to vary by offense. For example, the study found that 90% of consumer frauds were not reported, but 11% of motor vehicle thefts were unreported. NORC found that most people who chose not to report a crime to the police did so because they either thought the incident was a private matter or did not think the police could do anything about it.", "The three pilot studies indicated that UCR data underestimated the true level of crime in the United States. Moreover, the studies showed that a household survey could help estimate the extent of unreported crime, also known as the \"dark figure of crime.\" They also demonstrated that a household survey was a reasonable method for estimating the number of criminal victimizations in the United States. The Commission recommended that a national criminal justice statistics center be established to collect victimization data on an ongoing basis. In 1968, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) was created and charged with implementing a national victimization survey.", "In the early 1970s, LEAA, in cooperation with the U.S. Census Bureau, worked to develop a national victimization survey, which would come to be known as the National Crime Survey (NCS). The pilot studies for the NCS demonstrated that a large national sample of households would be required to obtain an accurate estimate of some crimes. The Census Bureau was chosen to conduct the NCS because it was the only organization that had the capacity to field such a large survey. During the development of the NCS, the survey's methodology was refined based on some of the lessons learned from the three pilot studies. There were a series of pretests, trial surveys, and record-check experiments to help address some of the methodological issues associated with implementing a nationwide victimization survey. Some of the issues examined included", "the use of a single household respondent, as opposed to interviewing everyone in the household; the respondent's ability to recall events; the length of the reference period; the minimum age of the respondent; and the appropriate question cues and wording.", "As a result of the studies, the NCS chose to interview all members of the household about victimizations they experienced. It was decided that the NCS would use a six-month reference period. It was also decided that only one person (referred to as a \"household respondent\") would answer questions about crimes against household property.", "The first NCS was conducted in July 1972 by the Census Bureau. The NCS was originally composed of four interrelated surveys: a national sample of households, referred to as the \"Crime Panel\"; a sample of households from central cities; and a national and central city sample of commercial establishments. As of 1976, data were no longer collected for the sample of households from central cities, nor were data collected for the national and central city sample of commercial establishments. Since 1976, the NCS consisted only of the national sample of households (i.e., the Crime Panel).", "In the mid-1970s, in response to concerns about the quality and usefulness of NCS data, the LEAA asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to evaluate the NCS. In 1976, the NAS published a report that provided recommendations for how to improve the NCS. The NAS found that although the NCS was an effective instrument for measuring crime, certain aspects of the survey's methodology and scope could be improved. The NAS recommended that researchers investigate the following:", "Enhanced screening questions that would better stimulate respondents' recall of victimizations, thus reducing underreporting resulting from forgotten incidents.

In 1986, the consortium proposed new instrumentation and procedures to improve the NCS.", "BJS chose to implement the consortium's proposals and redesign the NCS. BJS stated that the overall objectives for redesigning the NCS were to increase reporting of crime victimization and provide additional details on individual crime incidents. BJS also had more specific objectives for the redesign, including", "developing improved screening questions, thereby stimulating recall of incidents; sharpening concepts of victimization for survey respondents by providing a more thorough description of criminal incidents, thus diminishing effects of cognitive and subcultural differences among respondents; improving data collection techniques by adopting Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) for some segments of survey participants; improving measures of rape and sexual attack by asking respondents directly about these crimes; and providing better measures of domestic violence.", "The recommended changes were phased in as part of a two stage process: near-term and long-term. The near-term changes focused on the NCS's procedures and questionnaires, but they were not substantial enough to affect the comparability of the crime rates for previous years (i.e., they were non-rate affecting changes). The near-term changes were implemented by the Census Bureau in July 1986. Long-term changes had a substantial impact on the crime rate reported by the NCS. The long-term changes to the NCS's design were phased in gradually. Starting in 1989, BJS and the Census Bureau pre-tested the long-term changes using 5% and 10% subsamples of the NCS sample. After extensive pre-testing, the long-term changes were fully implemented by BJS in 1992. Between 1986 and 1992, the following changes were made to the survey:", "Better \"short cue\" screening questions were added to stimulate respondent recall of victimization incidents. More thorough descriptions of crime incidents were added in an effort to help all respondents interpret NCS concepts correctly. CATI was introduced to improve data collection. Specific questions about rape and sexual assaults were added to improve measurement of these crimes. Screening questions were reworded and added to get a better measure of domestic violence.", "After the implementation of the redesigned NCS, BJS changed the name of the NCS to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). From January 1992 through June 1993, the full NCS-NCVS sample was divided into two parts. One half of the sample was administered the NCS, and the other half was administered the NCVS. BJS chose to give each half of the sample either the NCS or the NCVS to permit the continuous publication of estimates of the year-to-year change in crime rates with comparable data while the NCVS was being introduced. The procedure was also intended to provide data on how the reported rate of victimization might have changed from the NCS to the NCVS.", "Periodically, BJS has expanded the scope of the NCVS to address new issues in crime. In 1998, Congress required BJS to add questions to the NCVS to identify crime victims with developmental disabilities. In 1999, BJS added questions to the NCVS to determine the extent to which respondents who were victims of crime perceived the crimes to be hate crimes. In 2001, BJS added questions to the NCVS to explore the extent to which people were victimized by computer-related crimes.

A sample of households is chosen from each stratum in a manner that is proportionate to their representation in the larger population. When a household is selected for the sample, all eligible people in the household are interviewed. Non-institutionalized persons aged 12 and older living in the United States are eligible to be interviewed for the NCVS. When a household is selected for the NCVS sample, eligible members of the household are interviewed once every six months for three years, for a total of seven interviews. After three years, the household is rotated out of the sample and a new one is brought in. The rotational panel design of the NCVS is accomplished by dividing all sampled households into six rotational groups, with each group containing six panels of households. Each month, one panel from each group is interviewed, so that in any given month, one-sixth of the sample is being interviewed for the first time, one-sixth is being interviewed for the second time, and so forth.", "The survey instrument used in the NCVS consists of three parts: the \"control card,\" a basic \"screen\" questionnaire, and crime incident reports. The control card contains basic administrative information for the sampled household, including the house's address and basic household data, such as the household's income, whether the house is owned or rented, and the names, age, race, sex, marital status, and education of all individuals living in the household. The control card also contains a record of visits, telephone calls, interviews, and information about non-interviews. Information on the control card is provided by a \"knowledgeable adult\" in the household. The \"knowledgeable adult\" is interviewed about victimizations against the household (i.e., burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and household larcenies).", "The screen questionnaire is designed to elicit information about whether the household or a particular respondent has experienced certain types of victimizations. The screen questionnaire provides respondents with a series of detailed questions and cues about victimizations and situations in which crimes may take place. Questions on the screen questionnaire describe crimes in plain language, avoiding technical legal terms. To elicit an accurate response, respondents are provided with detailed features that may characterize a criminal incident. If a screening question elicits a positive response, more information about the incident is collected on an incident report.", "For each separate victimization incident mentioned on the screening questionnaire, the respondent is asked to complete an incident report. Incident reports include a series of questions about the particular crime event, the offending parties, and the consequences of the crime. Some of the questions on incident reports include the following:", "Was the crime reported to the police? Was the offense completed or just attempted? Did the victim know the offender, or was the offender identified? If known, what were the demographic characteristics (i.e., race, gender, age) of the offender? Was a weapon used in the crime? Did the victim resist? Was there any monetary loss or physical injury, or both, that resulted from the victimization?", "The first interview is conducted in person, and all subsequent interviews, unless requested by the respondent, are conducted by telephone. Data collected during first interviews are used for bounding purposes and are excluded when calculating the crime rate. In the context of the NCVS, \"bounding\" refers to a process whereby the prior interview and the data collected during it are used in subsequent interviews to ensure that victimizations before the reference period and victimizations reported in prior interviews are not counted twice. Bounding procedures can help reduce the effects of \"telescoping,\" which refers to the tendency of people to incorrectly identify the timing of past events. For example, if a respondent is asked whether he or she has been the victim of a crime in the past six months, the respondent might report a victimization that actually occurred seven months ago. The bounding procedure provides respondents with both a cognitive and mechanical bound. The prior interview can serve as an event that respondents can use to help determine whether a victimization occurred within the current reference period. Furthermore, if the interviewer finds that a reported victimization is similar to one reported previously, the interviewer can question the respondent further to ensure that the reported victimization did indeed occur in the current reference period. Data collected during bounding interviews are not used by BJS to calculate annual victimization rates.", "A growing number of interviews for the NCVS are being conducted via Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). Currently, about 30% of all NCVS interviews are conducted by using CATI. As discussed above, the first interview is conducted face-to-face, and subsequent interviews are conducted by phone. Face-to-face and non-CATI telephone interviews are conducted using Paper and Pencil Interviewing (PAPI); that is, the respondent's answers are recorded on printed instruments. The survey has evolved from one in which all interviews were done face-to-face to one in which most interviews are conducted over the telephone, with a growing number of phone interviews employing CATI. With CATI, interviews are conducted from a centralized telephone facility where they read questions from a computer screen and record answers directly into a computer. The computer provides the interviewer with the next appropriate question based on the last answer; it also allows for automated internal consistency checks and reduces transcription errors. CATI improves data quality because all interviewers are in a centralized facility, allowing them to be monitored for adherence to standardized interviewing techniques.", "In some instances, an interviewer is unable to complete an interview with a household or an individual in the household (i.e., they are \"noninterviews\"). The NCVS classifies various types of noninterviews. Because the sample is a sample of households, and not of the people who live in the household, some sampled households may not be able to be interviewed. For example, the household may be vacant, occupied by persons who have usual residences elsewhere, or temporarily or permanently converted to a business. In these instances, the households are removed from the sample, either until the next time the household is to be interviewed (if the situation is temporary) or permanently, if the household will not be eligible for interviewing in the future. Other noninterviews occur when an interview cannot be completed with the entire eligible household, or when an interview cannot be completed with an eligible member of a household. Such noninterviews occur for a variety of reasons, including if no one is home during the three-week interview period, if the household or persons in the household refuse to be interviewed, and if the household is not reachable, for example, because of impassable roads.", "The NCVS does not rely on the respondent or the interviewer to classify reported victimizations. Rather, victimizations are classified based on details of the reported incident provided by the respondent. For example, a woman does not have to report that she was the victim of a rape for the victimization to be classified as a rape. If the details provided by the respondent indicate that the respondent was the victim of a rape, the victimization will be classified as a rape in the NCVS. Moreover, if the details of the incident do not meet the criteria necessary to define a victimization as a particular crime, the victimization will not be counted as a crime.

Researchers have reported that both incident rates and subgroup variation in reported victimization are affected by the wording of screening questions.

However, under the NCVS, rape and sexual assault can be perpetrated against both men and women. Second, the UCR and the NCVS use different methods for calculating the crime rates for some crimes. The crime rates for all Part I offenses are calculated on a per capita basis (i.e., the number of offenses per 100,000 people). The NCVS calculates property crime rates (burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft) on a per household basis (i.e., the number of crimes per 1,000 households). Third, the methodologies used by both programs are subject to limitations and sources of error that can affect the quality, accuracy, and reliability of their estimates and hence influence comparisons of the data produced by the two programs. As discussed above, the UCR is a voluntary program, which means that some agencies might not submit data for the entire year, or at all. Similarly, because the NCVS interviews a sample of households, its victimization estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Select Issues", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, there are issues associated with UCR, NIBRS, and NCVS data. Moreover, there are issues Congress might face when considering the future of each program, especially the NIBRS and the NCVS.

Each of these issues is discussed in more detail below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementing the NIBRS Nationwide274", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, implementing the NIBRS system nationwide has been a slow process. The SEARCH group collected data from the 64 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States to determine what impediments they face in making the transition to the NIBRS. SEARCH found that some law enforcement agencies' record management systems (RMS) were more capable of making the switch from the UCR to the NIBRS than others. SEARCH reported that some law enforcement agencies have RMSs that are unable to report NIBRS data, either because the data are in an incompatible format (i.e., they still follow the hierarchy rule and fail to capture multiple offenses and victims), or because they do not record data for all of the mandatory data elements or code the data in a NIBRS-compliant manner. Some law enforcement agencies reported that they had antiquated systems that are fragmented and in need of upgrades or replacement. Other law enforcement agencies have automated incident-based systems that meet the agency's operational needs but fail to capture the necessary data in an appropriate format for NIBRS reporting.", "Law enforcement agencies identified seven general impediments to NIBRS implementation in their jurisdictions:", "Funding : SEARCH reported that the general perception was that implementing the NIBRS is very costly for local law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies are concerned that they will incur a series of new costs, including developing or acquiring new or upgrading existing hardware or software; implementing automated incident-based reporting at the street level; hiring new data entry staff to process the additional data collected; establishing new quality control procedures; and having to increase the volume and complexity of training. Law enforcement agencies expressed concern that NIBRS is not a funding priority among local decision makers and stakeholders. Uncertainty of benefits : Law enforcement agencies reported that no clear operational value for the use of NIBRS data has been established. For example, NIBRS data do not include information on the address where a crime took place, hence NIBRS data cannot be used for crime mapping. Absent a demonstration of its practical use, law enforcement agencies felt that NIBRS data were more useful to researchers than to them. Policy concerns : Law enforcement agencies expressed concern that reported crime will increase when they implement the NIBRS because NIBRS does not use the hierarchy rule, meaning that all crimes in an incident will be reported (a more detailed discussion of this issue can be found below). Administrative issues : According to SEARCH, there was some concern that law enforcement officers would spend more time completing incident reports, which would decrease the time they have to respond to calls for service. Law enforcement agencies were also concerned about the time that would have to be spent on training officers on how to complete NIBRS incident reports and the technical support necessary for ongoing operations. Federal and state reporting : SEARCH reported that some law enforcement agencies were concerned about the \"all or nothing\" policy of NIBRS participation, which meant that if law enforcement agencies could not meet every NIBRS data reporting element, they could not participate in the program. Law enforcement agencies were also concerned about meeting the reporting requirements set forth by state programs, which had in some cases expanded reporting requirement beyond those required for the national NIBRS program. Data elements : Law enforcement agencies reported that some of the data elements, such as the victim-offender relationship, multiple offenses, and multiple victims, did not provide investigative value. Other data elements were viewed as being largely subjective (i.e., bias motivation and victim ethnicity) or irrelevant (i.e., residential status of an arrestee or the nature of suspected substance abuse). Education : SEARCH found that law enforcement agencies were concerned that key decision makers and stakeholders did not have sufficient or accurate information regarding the objectives or nature of the NIBRS.", "It appears that although local law enforcement agencies are receptive to the idea of reporting NIBRS data, several barriers prevent law enforcement agencies from making the switch from the UCR to the NIBRS. Congress may want to consider whether anything could be done to promote a more rapid expansion of the NIBRS program. Policy options for Congress might include the following:", "Appropriate grant funds to be awarded to state and local law enforcement agencies to allow them to update or expand their crime data reporting systems. In 2001, BJS awarded over $13 million in grants to states for the purpose of implementing NIBRS-compatible systems. Grant funds for this purpose have not been available since 2001. Provide funding to agencies such as the National Institute of Justice to allow them to develop NIBRS software that could be distributed at no charge to local law enforcement. Congress may also consider making grant funds available to local law enforcement agencies to allow them to purchase NIBRS software from a vendor. This could allow law enforcement agencies to customize the software to meet their specifications. Provide funding to an organization such as the Justice Research and Statistics Association to allow them to provide training and continued support to local law enforcement agencies that implement NIBRS systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Does the NIBRS Increase the Crime Rate? 275", "paragraphs": ["Some local officials have expressed concern that implementing the NIBRS will result in a higher reported crime rate in their jurisdictions. As described above, the NIBRS does not use the hierarchy rule, so all crimes in an incident are reported, unlike the UCR, where only the most serious offense in an incident is reported. Therefore, local officials are concerned that crime rates may appear to increase even though the actual number of crimes committed does not change.", "BJS conducted a study that compared NIBRS-computed crime rates to UCR crime rates for agencies in nine NIBRS-certified states for 1991-1996. To be included in the study, an agency must have submitted at least one full year of data and it must serve a \"nonzero\" population (i.e., police departments or sheriff's offices, but it would most likely not include state or county police). The study included 4,068 cases from 1,131 unique law enforcement agencies. Summary UCR data were derived from NIBRS data by using a computer program that applied the hierarchy rule to reported incidents in the NIBRS data.", "BJS found that, overall, the difference between the crime rates calculated using NIBRS and UCR data was small. On average, the NIBRS index crime rate was 2% higher than the UCR crime rate. On average, the NIBRS violent crime rate was higher than the UCR violent crime rate by less than 1%, and the NIBRS property crime rate was higher than the UCR property crime rate by slightly more than 2%. However, the difference between the NIBRS rate and the UCR rate varied depending on the crime. For murder, the NIBRS and UCR rates were the same. For rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, the difference between the NIBRS and UCR rates was, on average, less than 1%. NIBRS larceny/theft rates were, on average, higher than UCR larceny/theft rates by about 3%, and NIBRS motor vehicle theft rates were higher than UCR theft rates by about 4.5%.", "BJS also individually evaluated each case to see how the NIBRS crime rates differed from the UCR crime rates. As shown in Table 1 , in 97% of the cases, the difference between the NIBRS crime rate and the UCR crime rate for violent crimes was 5.5% or less. By comparison, the percentage of cases where there was a 5.5% or less difference between the NIBRS crime rate and the UCR crime was smaller (90% overall) for property offenses, which is not surprising given that most property offenses would not be reported under the UCR if they were committed in concert with a violent offense.", "BJS reported that the distribution of rate changes for all index offenses showed that 92.5% of the cases had a rate difference of -0.5% to 15.5%. Almost 48% of the cases had a rate difference between -0.5% to 0.5% for index crimes, and 39% of the cases had no difference between the NIBRS rates and the UCR rates. For violent crime, the distribution of rate changes showed that 98.9% of the cases had a rate difference between 0% and 15.5%, 84.3% of cases had a rate difference between 0% and 0.5%, and 82.2% of the cases had no difference. For property crime, 91.7% of the cases had a rate difference between -0.5% and 15.5%, 48% of the cases had a rate difference between -0.5% and 0.5%, and 40.1% of the cases had no difference.", "Overall, the data show that the transition to NIBRS can increase the reported crime rate. In most instances, the increase in the crime rate will be small, and property crimes, rather than violent crimes, are more likely to increase. However, there are instances where the increase in reported crime rates can be more than 15.5%. BJS reports that jurisdictions with little crime tend to show exaggerated changes in their crime rates when they switch from the UCR to the NIBRS. Hence, most of the drastic changes in reported crime rates likely came from jurisdictions that did not report a lot of crime to begin with.", "If or when the FBI chooses to publish Crime in the United States using NIBRS data, it may influence the way Congress uses crimes statistics to develop policy and allocate funding. As shown above, the change from the UCR to the NIBRS may make it appear like the crime rate in some states, counties, and cities has increased. Congress might want to be aware of the impact that the change to NIBRS could have on the reported crime rate before deciding whether to allocate more funding to jurisdictions that showed an increased crime rate. Also, the formula for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program uses UCR violent crime data to allocate funding to state and local governments. One policy option for Congress would be to change the JAG formula to incorporate NIBRS data. Another policy option would be to leave the JAG formula as it currently is and require the FBI to modify each state's NIBRS data to produce summary UCR data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decreases in the NCVS Sample Size", "paragraphs": ["The sample size used in the NCS/NCVS has decreased since it was first conducted in the early 1970s. In June 1984, the NCS's sample size was cut from the original sample size of 72,000 households to 59,000 households. Additional cuts to the sample size were instituted in 1992 (a 10% reduction), 1996 (a 12% reduction), and 2002 (a 4% reduction). All decreases in the sample size were done to reduce costs.", "Even with the NCVS's decreasing sample size, the size of the sample is still much larger than most other surveys conducted in the United States. However, as one researcher warned, decreases in the sample size can affect the ability of the NCVS data to produce reliable annual measures and changes in annual rates of statistically rare forms of victimization (such as rape). As the size of the sample decreases, the standard error associated with the estimate of the victimization statistic can increase, which could make it harder to detect statistically significant changes in the annual victimization rates or differences in the victimization rates of two different subgroups of people. For example, if a decrease in sample size results in an increased standard error for the estimation of assault victimizations, researchers might not be able to determine whether a change in reported assault victimizations reflects an actual change in nationwide assault victimizations or simply statistical variation.", "Congress may want to consider whether to provide additional funding to BJS to allow it to expand the sample size of the NCVS.
