The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, has identified a number of exceptions to the requirement that agencies cease operations, including a blanket exception for activities that \"provide for the national security.\"", "With the approach of the Treasury Department's estimate of an October 17, 2013, deadline for raising the debt ceiling, concerns have grown about the potential effect on government programs and workers. If the Treasury Department were to continue the current practice of paying bills as they come due, DOD programs ranging from payments to military retirees to contractor bills could be delayed or reduced, a situation that differs from the current government shutdown. It is difficult to predict effects because of the uncertainty about Treasury actions, but payment delays could affect all programs and personnel. Negotiations are currently underway to deal with the upcoming deadline.", "Concerns about DOD's implementation of the government shutdown continue. On September 25, 2013, DOD issued guidance and a contingency plan that limited the types of \"excepted\" activities that would continue to be carried out during a shutdown to military operations, unspecified other operations and national security activities, and those necessary to protect the safety of persons and property. As a result, during the lapse in appropriations, some DOD personnel would be \"excepted\" from furloughs, including all uniformed military personnel, while others would be furloughed and, thus, not be permitted to work. Those civilian personnel who support \"excepted\" activities\u2014roughly half of DOD's 750,000 civilians\u2014would continue to report for work while the remainder would be furloughed and not paid. Normally, such \"excepted\" military and civilian personnel would continue to work but would not be paid until after appropriations are subsequently provided.", "With enactment of H.R. 3210, the Pay Our Military Act (POMA), on September 30, 2013, however, many defense personnel will be paid on time, including all active-duty personnel, most civilians, and some contractor personnel. On October 5, 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that the language in H.R. 3210 would allow DOD to recall most but not all of its civilian employees to work. In addition to those DOD civilians already designated as \"excepted,\" the Administration interpreted H.R. 3210 as permitting the Secretary to recall (and start to pay) those DOD civilians \"whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.\" This revision of DOD's Contingency Plan would increase the number of DOD civilians returning to work from roughly 50% to about 95%, according to DOD Comptroller Robert Hale. As the services and DOD components implement this decision, civilians will return to work starting this week, and be paid on time under H.R. 3210.", "DOD is continuing to review whether the number of contractor personnel, also covered under H.R. 3210, will be increased. Those defense civilian or contractor personnel who were or remain furloughed would only receive pay for that period if Congress passes legislation to pay furloughed personnel. On October 5, 2013, the House unanimously passed H.R. 3223, which would provide retroactive pay for all federal employees, as occurred during the 1995 to 1996 shutdown. The President has announced his support of the bill. The Senate has not yet taken it up.", "On October 10, 2013, in reaction to considerable controversy in Congress, the President signed H.J.Res. 91, Honoring the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act, to provide for payment of death gratuities and other funeral expenses. Both houses had passed the bill unanimously. Previously, the Secretary of Defense had determined that such expenses were not covered under POMA. CBO estimates that the new law would cost about $150 million over the course of a year.", "On October 2 and October 3, 2013, the House passed five \"mini\" Continuing Resolutions (CRs) providing funding for the District of Columbia, NIH, various museums, Veterans Administration disability programs, and pay for non-activated reservists, generally at FY2013 levels including the sequester now in effect. That package includes H.R. 3230, which would expand the number of reservists who would be paid on time from activated reservists (such as those deployed for the Afghan war) who are already covered by H.R. 3210, to non-activated duty reservists who are performing weekend drills. Based on press reports of reactions from the Senate leadership, however, the Senate is not likely to take up the bill.", "The authority to continue some activities during a lapse in appropriations is governed by the Antideficiency Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. 1341 and 1342, as interpreted by Department of Justice (DOJ) legal opinions and reflected in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to executive agencies. Subject to review by OMB, each agency is responsible for making specific determinations on which activities may continue during a shutdown and which may not.", "Legally, according to DOJ and OMB guidance, activities that may continue during a lapse in appropriations include (1) activities \"necessary to bring about the orderly termination of an agency's functions\"; (2) administration of benefit payments provided through funds that remain available in the absence of new appropriations, including, in the case of DOD, military retirement benefits; (3) activities and purchases financed with prior year funds and ongoing activities for which funding has already been obligated; (4) activities undertaken on the basis of constitutional authorities of the President; and (5) activities related to \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The Defense Department attributes its authority to carry on national security-related operations mainly to Section 1342 of the Antideficiency Act, which permits the continuation of activities to protect human life and property.", "In addition to military operations, other activities that would continue under a shutdown by virtue of the Anti-Deficiency Act include operation of DOD Dependent Schools, child care centers, and DOD medical activities, including TRICARE services for dependents, but not non-essential services, such as elective surgery in military medical facilities. Passage of POMA considerably broadened the types of support activities, primarily performed by civilians, that would continue during the shutdown. A CBO estimate suggests that POMA appropriated $200 billion, or about one-third or of DOD's $614 billion FY2014 request.", "The roughly 5% of DOD's civilians who would continue to be furloughed continue to face a pay gap, potentially imposing hardships on many families, unless legislation providing retroactive pay is enacted. Contracting activities that supported military activities and payments to vendors derived from prior multiyear appropriations could also continue. The status of many contractor personnel remains unclear. While some new contract obligations to support \"excepted\" activities could be signed, monies could not be disbursed while other new contracts would be delayed.

Some have argued that in such a situation the Treasury could prioritize payments in order to avoid a technical default by paying interest due on debt first as part of a policy to choose to make certain types of payments before others. The Treasury argues that it does not have the authority to make such distinctions. In addition, some suggest that making such distinctions would violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 as amended, which prohibits deferring particular payments. ", "In addition to prioritizing payments, Treasury, in 2012, considered but rejected other options, including ", "asset sales\u2014as against taxpayer interests; across-the-board reductions\u2014as difficult to implement; or, the \"least harmful\" one of delaying payments, which would be \"worsened each day ... potentially causing great hardships to millions of Americans and harm to the economy.\"", "It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict potential effects on Department of Defense programs or benefits because of the uncertainties. If payments to defense contractors were delayed, the government could incur interest penalties, and contractors could eventually face liquidity problems. If payments to trust funds (Tricare for Life, military retirement) were delayed and not repaid, the solvency of those funds could be affected.

Although reservists would be paid, it is not clear how much training would take place because H.R. 3230 does not provide appropriations to cover related training costs (e.g., fuel, spare parts, food services, and ammunition).

Some argued that this latter group could constitute all or nearly all DOD civilians and contractors.

Other furloughed personnel would not be paid, and may be paid retroactively if Congress chooses to do so once annual appropriations are enacted. This report provides an overview of recent guidance and precedents over the past 30 years that have governed planning for DOD operations in the event of a funding lapse, and it discusses their implications for a shutdown.", "Among the questions addressed are ", "the effects of a shutdown on pay for uniformed military personnel and DOD civilians; how reservists and military technicians may be affected; types of activities to protect persons and property that are \"excepted;\" potential effects on contracting; whether DOD Dependent Schools or childcare centers would continue to operate during a shutdown; how long operations of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service could continue; and whether the \"Feed and Forage Act,\" 41\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a011, which allows the Defense Department to obligate funds in advance of appropriations for certain purposes, might be invoked to provide additional flexibility during a funding lapse. ", "Answers to some of these questions are quite simple, others complex, and others uncertain. ", "Assuming that past Attorney General, OMB guidance, recent DOD guidance, and current new law are followed in the event of a shutdown, brief answers to these questions are as follows:", "Pay of Uniformed Military Personnel and DOD Civilians: The current DOD guidance provides that all active-duty military personnel would be \"excepted\" from furloughs during a lapse in funding, as they have been in the past. H.R. 3210 , the Pay Our Military Act, signed by President Obama on September 30, 2013, provides appropriations to allow the Defense Department to cover the pay and allowances of members of the armed forces performing active service, and the DOD civilians and contractors who provide support to them. H.R. 3210 provides this authority through January 1, 2015, or until other regular or continuing appropriations are enacted. This bill means that today's experience differs from the previous government shutdown in 1995 and 1996, when this authority was not provided and DOD was marginally affected by the first short shutdown and not by the second, longer shutdown because a defense appropriations bill had been enacted. Potential effects on reservists : DOD's Contingency Plan specifies that activated reservists, like active-duty military, would continue to conduct their duties. The Contingency Plan also specifies that reservists will not perform inactive duty training (e.g., weekend drills) \"except where such training directly supports an excepted activity\" and may not be ordered to active duty (e.g., for annual training) \"except in support of those military operations and activities necessary for national security, including fulfilling associated pre-deployment requirements.\" This would include those reservists currently \"training up\" for deployments. H.R. 3210 provides appropriations to cover the pay and allowances of activated reservists, but would not cover the compensation of any reservists performing inactive duty training. Under DOD's Contingency Plan, military technicians\u2014who are federal civilian employees required to hold membership in the reserves as a condition of their civilian employment\u2014will continue to perform their civilian duties only if they are deemed necessary to carry out excepted activities. National Security and Protection of Life and Property : The 2013 DOD guidance includes not only military operations in Afghanistan but also some training and other support necessary for the Afghan war or other military operations. Excepted military activities are those considered necessary to \"execute planned or contingency operations necessary for national security,\" including \"administrative, logistical, medical, and other activities in direct support of such activities.\" Other military activities deemed necessary to carry out those operations are recruiting during contingency operations, command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Not listed are depot maintenance repair of equipment or base support, activities which typically do not involve active-duty personnel. Presumably, civilians performing activities not directly required to support military operations would be furloughed under DOD's original plan. This plan was modified with new guidance issued after enactment of H.R. 3210 (see \" Recent Developments \"). Contractor Activities: Contracts that rely on previously appropriated funds, whether for weapon systems with deliveries over several years or support services where contracts may span fiscal years, would continue. The Defense Department, however, would only be able to sign new contracts for goods funded with FY2014 funds for activities deemed necessary to support military operations, and no monies could be disbursed (checks sent out) under those contracts. An exception could be any contractor personnel covered by H.R. 3210 , whose support was necessary for military operations, such as contractor personnel in Afghanistan. Operation of DOD Dependent Schools and Childcare: The 2013 and 2001 DOD guidance provides that, the support that dependent schools provide to military personnel is directly enough related to national security that the schools may continue to operate during a shutdown. The 2013 guidance also concludes that child care \"essential to readiness\" may continue as well as emergency family support. Operation of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and Other Working Capital Funds: Some DFAS operations would be likely to continue through a funding lapse, initially using funds drawn from reimbursements from prior year funds, and then to issue paychecks for those covered under H.R. 3210 (see \" Recent Developments \"), and to control funds for contracts in support of excepted activities. DFAS personnel needed to administer military retired pay and other retiree benefits would be expected to work during a funding lapse because the authority to distribute benefits drawn from multi-year funds, including retirement funds, is implied by the responsibility agencies have to provide payments to which recipients are entitled. Military pensions and other retirement benefits are entitlements financed through the military retirement and health care fund, which is available independently of annual defense appropriations. ", "Though new appropriations are not available during a funding lapse, a substantial amount of money provided to the Defense Department is available for obligation for more than one year, including funding for R&D, procurement, military construction, and purchases of material for inventories of stock funds. The 2013 shutdown guidance provides that DFAS can make adjustments for prior year unobligated balances, suggesting that some administration, contract oversight, and auditing functions, some of which are carried out by DFAS, may also continue.", "Many DFAS personnel are paid through reimbursements from other appropriated accounts for services that DFAS provides to organizations within DOD, and those funds could be available to support DFAS services to continue national security-related operations. DOD's 2013 guidance provides that other activities funded through reimbursements would also continue operations as long as cash was available, recently estimated as about two weeks, according to DOD Comptroller Robert Hale. ", "Authority to Obligate Funds Under the \"Feed and Forage Act\": The Feed and Forage Act, 41 U.S.C. 11, says, in part,", "No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except in the Department of Defense and ... the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, or medical and hospital supplies.", "During the Vietnam War, the law was used to provide funds when supplemental appropriations were delayed. In more recent years, it has been used mainly to provide short-term funding for unplanned military operations. If invoked during a funding lapse, the act would give DOD authority to obligate funds in advance of appropriations for the limited number of purposes specified. While the DOD 2013 guidance mentions the Feed and Forage Act, use of the Feed and Forage Act during a funding lapse appears unnecessary during earlier shutdowns, Attorney General and OMB guidance has allowed national security-related operations to continue. The authority for DOD to continue national security-related activities appears to be considerably broader than that provided by the Feed and Forage Act, which is limited in purpose and which does not directly provide authority to obligate funds for pay of military personnel. Moreover, like the authority provided by the Antideficiency Act, the Feed and Forage Act permits only the obligation of funds and not disbursements until funds are subsequently appropriated\u2014neither law allows the Defense Department to issue pay checks or to make other payments. While invocation of the Feed and Forage Act during a shutdown is conceivable, it is not clear what purpose it would serve. ", "Activities to Protect Health and Safety: The 2013 DOD guidance includes a broad range of activities under the \"safety of persons and protection of property\" category.

The Administration is free to change these guidelines, based on its own interpretation of relevant laws and regulations.", "Nonetheless, though authority to sustain ongoing military operations is clear in principle, a lapse in appropriations, if it were to extend for more than a very limited period of time, could disrupt operations to some degree. As the DOD guidance illustrates, efforts to distinguish between, on the one hand, those activities that are sufficiently important for national security to warrant continuation during a lapse in appropriations and, on the other hand, activities that do not directly support national security involve difficult, and to some degree, arbitrary judgments.", "Unit training would continue for some combat units, but not for others, depending on their place in deployment or force generation plans. For example, military personnel preparing to deploy to Afghanistan would continue. Medical personnel would continue to provide services to active duty personnel, but not to dependents or retirees who might normally receive non-emergency services in the same facilities. Issuance of some contracts would continue during a shutdown, but other contracting activity, perhaps done by the same people, would not.

There is also likely to be some confusion among contractors because funds remaining available from prior years can continue to be distributed, but not new funds. In DOD appropriations acts, funding for R&D is typically available for obligation for two years, for most procurement for three years, and for shipbuilding for five years. Contract authority to purchase stocks of material for inventories is not limited by fiscal year. Unobligated balances of funds for those purposes would remain available even in the absence of new funding. ", "Money for operation and maintenance, however, is generally available for obligation for only one year, so most funding for day-to-day operations of the department would lapse and operations could continue only under the Antideficiency Act exceptions that allow the obligation of funds, but not disbursements. Whether vendors could be paid, therefore, depends on which pot of money obligations are made from, and money for more immediate, readiness-related activities would generally not be used to make prompt payments.", "Under the circumstances, the Defense Department can be expected to sustain its most important operations, but not without some difficulties in managing the acquisition of material and services from vendors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Authorities and Conditions Affecting DOD Operations in the Absence of Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Based on the 2013 guidance, as well as earlier precedents followed over the past 30 years, the Department of Defense may continue, in the absence of appropriations, to carry on a quite broad range of activities. The most far-reaching authority that affects DOD is authority to continue activities that \"provide for the national security.\" ", "Even DOD's authority to provide for national security, however, may be constrained by legal limits on the financial procedures that are permitted when appropriations lapse. Among other things, in order to carry on activities that are permitted to continue, but for which appropriations have lapsed, funds may be obligated in advance of appropriations (i.e., legally binding contractual commitments may be made), but expenditures of funds that derive from such obligations (i.e., the payment of bills with checks or electronic remittances) are prohibited. As a result, though uniformed military personnel and many DOD civilian employees may be expected to continue in their duties during a funding lapse, those normally paid with current-year appropriated funds, including virtually all uniformed personnel and most civilians, will not receive pay until after appropriations become available. Nor will payments to vendors for goods and services be permitted if the payments derive from contracts entered into in advance of appropriations.", "The legal authority under which the Department of Defense may continue operations in the event of a funding lapse is established by the Antideficiency Act, now codified at 31 U.S.C. 1341 and 1342. The legal interpretation of the conditions under which operations may continue has been established, in turn, by Department of Justice legal opinions and Office of Management and Budget directives issued initially in 1980 and 1981, and that OMB has referred to in providing guidance on shutdowns since then. Agencies, including DOD, have also been required to prepare detailed plans for implementing a shutdown when lapses in appropriations were anticipated.", "Ultimately, federal agency plans, based on OMB guidance, determine which activities will continue in the event of a shutdown and which will not. Current agency plans are now posted on OMB's website or by individual agencies. DOD operations in the event of a shutdown would also be governed by financial management procedures that would, in turn, affect how a shutdown is managed.", "The following discussion (1) briefly reviews the legal basis for the Department of Defense to continue operations during a funding lapse and the attendant legal constraints on the scope of activities and the financial mechanisms that are permitted; (2) provides a brief overview of the possible impact of a lapse in funding on military and civilian personnel, on current military operations including operations in Afghanistan, and on day-to-day business operations of the Department of Defense; and (3) provides selected excerpts from DOD guidance on activities that may continue during a funding lapse and those that may not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Antideficiency Act", "paragraphs": ["The Antideficiency Act, now codified at 31 U.S.C. 1341 and 1342, generally prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds exceeding amounts appropriated. It provides two quite broad exceptions, however: ", "Section 1341 says that an employee of the United States Government may not \"involve [the] government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law.\" Subsequent Attorney General Opinions on operations permitted during a lapse in appropriations have been intended, in part, to identify what obligations in advance of appropriations should be considered to be \"authorized by law.\" Section 1342 says, in part, that \"An officer or employee of the United States Government may not accept voluntary services \u2026 or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" One basis for Department of Defense operations to continue during a funding lapse is this authority to employ personnel to protect human life and property. Department of Justice opinions have found that the authority to employ personal services implies the authority to procure material that personnel may need to carry out their emergency responsibilities (see below for a discussion). OMB guidance to agencies on preparations for a shutdown has identified a quite extensive range of activities that are permitted to continue in the absence of appropriations in order to protect human life and property.", "While the Antideficiency Act permits certain exceptions to the requirement that agency operations cease when appropriations are not provided, the exceptions permit only the obligation of funds in advance of appropriations for the excepted activities, not the expenditure of funds. Contracts for material and services may be signed, and personnel may continue to be employed, but the Antideficiency Act does not permit agencies to make payments to vendors or issue pay checks to personnel if the payments would have to be drawn from amounts obligated in advance of appropriations. To be absolutely clear, no money is actually available, but only the promise to provide funds at some time in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB and Justice Department Guidance on DOD Activities Permitted During a Lapse in Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Attorney General opinions released in April 1980 and January 1981 and OMB memoranda issued in September 1980 and November 1981\u2014and referred to repeatedly in later years\u2014provide the basic guidance on activities that DOD and other executive branch agencies may be allowed to continue when appropriations are not provided. In general, these activities are understood to be \"authorized by law\" under Section 1341 of the Antideficiency Act or to permit the employment of personal services for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property under Section 1342. The principal activities that the Justice Department and OMB have determined may continue include the following.", "Activities \"necessary to bring about the orderly termination of an agency's functions\": The Attorney General found that agencies may obligate funds to shut down operations after a funding lapse under the terms of the Antideficiency Act itself, since \"it would be impossible in fact for agency heads to terminate all agency functions without incurring any obligations whatsoever in advance of appropriations.\" In general, such activities are expected to be very limited\u2014OMB guidance in 2013 said that \"orderly shutdown activities should take no more than three or four hours following the expiration of funding.\" Administration of benefit payments provided through funds that remain available in the absence of new appropriations: The Attorney General found that departments are \"authorized to incur obligations in advance of appropriations for the administration of benefit payments under entitlement programs when the funds for the payments themselves are not subject to a one-year appropriation.\" This follows, he said, from the premise that funding is \"authorized by necessary implication from the specific terms of duties that have been imposed on, or authorities that have been invested in, the agency.\" The Social Security Administration, by this reasoning, may continue to pay personnel and to fund operations needed to manage pensions during a lapse in funding because of its responsibility to distribute benefits that are provided through a permanent trust fund that is not affected by a lapse in appropriations. Presumably, DOD administration of military retired pay and medical benefits may continue as well. Activities and purchases financed with prior year funds and ongoing activities for which funding has already been obligated: Substantial amounts of DOD funding are provided in accounts that are available for obligation for more than a year\u2014R&D funding is typically available for two years, most procurement for three years, and shipbuilding funds for five years. Contract authority to procure material for stockpiles is also available as \"no year\" money. Contract authority provided understanding law and unobligated balances in the acquisition accounts remain available during a lapse in funding because they have previously been provided\u2014only current-year funding is affected by a lapse in appropriations. Similarly, contracts which have already been signed, and which may require delivery of services or material as ordered, remain valid. Most significantly, obligations already made or new obligations made from funds appropriated in prior years may lead to expenditures of funds, in contrast to obligations made in advance of appropriations. Whether vendors may be paid during the period of a funding lapse, therefore, depends on which pot of money the funds are drawn from\u2014some contractors may be paid as usual while others may not be. At the very least, a degree of confusion is likely. A further complicating factor is whether administrative personnel needed to manage contracts are permitted to continue working. To the extent that acquisition personnel are paid with annual appropriations\u2014which is generally the case\u2014personnel may be available to manage contracts only if they are excepted from a shutdown. It is not necessarily to be assumed that agencies have authority under the Antideficiency Act to except from furloughs personnel needed to administer the use of funds available from prior year appropriations or other sources. Both the 2011 and 2013 DOD guidance, however, say that personnel may continue to administer activities financed with prior year or other available funds that are necessary to support excepted activities. Activities undertaken on the basis of constitutional authorities of the President: The Attorney General found that the President has an inherent constitutional authority to obligate funds in advance of appropriations to carry out \"not only functions that are authorized by statute, but functions authorized by the Constitution as well.\" When the Constitution grants a specific power to the President, the Attorney General reasoned, \"Manifestly, Congress could not deprive the President of this power by purporting to deny him the minimum obligational authority sufficient to carry this power into effect.\" This does not mean that the President can \"legislate his own obligational authorities.\" But in the opinion of the Attorney General, \"the policy objective of the Antideficiency Act\u00a0\u2026 should not alone be regarded as dispositive of the question of authority.\" The Attorney General did not specifically address whether this provides a basis for the President to direct that funds be obligated in advance of appropriations for reasons of national security. OMB memoranda since 1980 repeat the conclusion that funding may be continued to \"Provide for the national security, including the conduct of foreign relations essential to the national security or the safety of life or property.\" This wording might be read to imply that the authority of agencies to continue operations related to national security is independent of the authority to continue activities related to the safety of life or the protection of property. National security-related activities may, then, be among those for which obligations in advance of appropriations are considered to be \"authorized by law\" under Section 1341 of the Antideficiency Act and are permitted independently of Section 1342 and whether or not they protect life or property. For its part, however, the Defense Department has generally not cited any authority beyond that provided in Section 1342. Activities that protect life and property: OMB guidance periodically issued in preparation for a shutdown concludes that agencies have the authority to \"Conduct essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property.\" The guidance reflects Section 1342 of the Antideficiency Act. Section 1342, however, directly permits the obligation of funds only for employment of \"personal services\" and not for other purposes. Rather than accept such a limited view of what is permitted, the January 16, 1981, Attorney General opinion provided a basis for expanding the scope of activities permitted under Section 1342 to include the acquisition of material needed to respond to emergencies to those: ", "in which a government agency may employ personal services \u2026 it may also \u2026 incur obligations in advance of appropriations for material to enable the employees involved to meet the emergency successfully. In order to effectuate the legislative intent that underlies a statute, it is ordinarily inferred that a statute \"carries with it all means necessary and proper to carry out properly the purposes of the law.\"", "OMB memoranda provide a fairly long list of examples of activities permitted to continue on the grounds they protect life and property, including inpatient and emergency outpatient medical care; public health and safety activities; air traffic control; border protection; care of prisoners; law enforcement; disaster assistance; preservation of the banking system; borrowing and tax collection; power production and distribution; and protection of research property. The \"protection of property\" exception in itself appears to provide the basis for a quite wide range of government activities to continue.

Carter, \"Guidance for Continuation of Operations in the Absence of Available Appropriations.\" General guidance is followed by a specific list of excepted activities in an attachment.", "Excerpts from Memorandum", "The Department will, of course, continue to prosecute the war in Afghanistan, including preparation of forces for deployment into that conflict. The Department must, as well, continue many other operations necessary for the safety of human life and protection of property, including operations essential for the security of our nation. These activities will be \"excepted\" from cessation; all other activities would need to be shut down in an orderly and deliberate fashion, including \u2014with few exceptions\u2014 the cessation of temporary duty travel. ", "All military personnel will continue in a normal duty status regardless of their affiliation with excepted or non-excepted activities. Military personnel will serve without pay until such time as Congress makes appropriated funds available to compensate them for this period of service. Civilian personnel who are engaged in excepted activities will also continue in normal duty status and also will not be paid until Congress makes appropriated funds available. Civilian employees not engaged in excepted activities will be furloughed, i.e., placed in a non-work, non-pay status. ", "The responsibility for determining which functions would be excepted from shut down resides with the Military Department Secretaries and Heads of DOD Components, who may delegate this authority as they deem appropriate. The attached guidance should be used to assist in making this excepted determination. The guidance does not identify every excepted activity, but rather provides overarching direction and general principles for making these determinations.

", "Civilian personnel whose salaries are paid with expired appropriations and later reimbursed from a non-DOD source (e.g., the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund) are not exempt from furlough solely on that basis. Personnel whose salaries are paid from a DOD appropriation or fund that has sufficient funding authority (e.g., multiyear appropriations with available balances from prior years) will not be subject to furlough.

However, new contracts (including contract renewals or extensions, issuance of task orders, exercise of options) may not be executed unless the contractor is supporting an excepted activity. No funds will be available to pay such new contractors until Congress appropriates additional funds. The expiration of an appropriation does not require the termination of contracts (or issuance of stop work orders) funded by that appropriation unless a new obligation of funds is required under the contract and the contract is not required to support an excepted activity. In cases where new obligation is required and the contract is not required to support an excepted activity, the issuance of a stop work order or the termination of the contract will be required.
