This report provides a snapshot of the forms and origins of measures which, according to the Legislative Information System of the U.S. Congress (LIS), received action on the House floor in the 111th Congress (2009-2010) and the parliamentary procedures used to bring them up for initial House consideration.", "In the 111th Congress, 1,946 pieces of legislation received floor action in the House of Representatives. Of these, 885 were bills or joint resolutions and 1,061 were simple or concurrent resolutions, a breakdown between lawmaking and non-lawmaking legislative forms of approximately 45% to 55%. Of these 1,946 measures, 1,796 originated in the House and 150 originated in the Senate.", "During the same period, 78% of all measures receiving initial House floor action came before the chamber under the Suspension of the Rules procedure; 14% came to the floor as business \"privileged\" under House rules and precedents; 5% were raised by a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules and adopted by the House; and 2% came up by the unanimous consent of Members.

As is noted in Table 2 , 73% of the measures considered under the Suspension of the Rules procedure were sponsored by Democrats, 27% by Republicans, and less than 1% by political independents. That measures introduced by Members of both parties were considered under Suspension is unsurprising in that (as is discussed below) Suspension of the Rules is the parliamentary procedure which the House generally uses to process non-controversial measures for which there is wide bipartisan support. Additionally, passage of a measure under the Suspension of the Rules procedure requires the votes of at least some minority party Members.", "The ratio of party sponsorship on measures initially brought to the floor under a terms of a special rule reported by the House Committee on Rules and adopted by the House was far wider.

In actual practice, however, in the 111 th Congress, the House universally provided for the consideration of these measures by means of a special rule, which, in general, could also provide for debate to be structured, amendments to be regulated, and points of order against the bills to be waived.

The main features of the Suspension of the Rules procedure include (1) a 40-minute limit on debate, (2) a prohibition against floor amendments and points of order, and (3) a two-thirds vote of Members present and voting for passage. The suspension procedure is in order in the House on the calendar days of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, during the final six days of a congressional session, and at other times by unanimous consent or special order. In the 112 th Congress (2011-2012), the House Republican leadership has announced additional policies related to their use of the Suspension of the Rules procedure which restrict the use of the procedure for certain \"honorific\" legislation, generally require measures considered under Suspension to have been available for three days prior to their consideration, and require the sponsor of the measure to be on the floor at the time of a measure's consideration.", "In the 111 th Congress, 1,525 measures, representing 78% of all legislation receiving House floor action, were initially brought up using the Suspension of the Rules procedure.
