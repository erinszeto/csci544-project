The President's budget predicted a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a steady improvement of the federal government's fiscal position, including a surplus of $61 billion in FY2012, the last year projected. Major proposals included large defense supplementals for FY2007 and FY2008, extensions of the expiring tax cuts, limited increases in domestic discretionary spending, and limited increases in defense spending after FY2008. The Administration also proposed a temporary halt to the expanding reach of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in FY2007 and FY2008. Medicare and Medicaid were expected to grow more slowly. The Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review showed little change in the budget outlook for FY2008 through FY2012, although higher health outlays and war costs increased the expected FY2008 deficit slightly.", "The FY2008 budget also discussed long-term fiscal problems. According to the longer-term projections from the Administration, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the impending retirement of the baby boom generation and rising health care costs will substantially expand spending over the coming decades on federal programs serving the elderly, such as Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. The long-term growth of outlays, if left unchanged or if not offset by new revenues, could overwhelm the government's ability to finance its obligations.", "In January 2007, the CBO released baseline projections of future budget outcomes under current law. CBO projected a FY2008 deficit of $98 billion, a $170 billion surplus in FY2012, and a $249 billion surplus in FY2017. The baseline assumes the large tax cuts enacted in the first half of the decade expire as scheduled, real discretionary spending is fixed, and the Alternative Minimum Tax is unchanged.", "The House and Senate adopted separate versions of the FY2008 budget resolution in March 2007, which would allow more domestic spending than the Administration request and extend some expiring tax cuts with conditions. The House and Senate adopted a conference agreement (H.Rept. 110-153) on May 17, with a projected FY2008 deficit of $252 billion. By mid-July, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations had approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills. At the end of FY2007, the House had passed all 12 appropriations bills and the Senate had passed four. The Senate passed three more appropriations bills in October. The President had said he would veto other appropriations bills. At the end of FY2007, Congress passed the first (H.J.Res. 52) of four continuing resolutions (H.R. 3222, H.J.Res. 69, H.J.Res. 72), which in sequence, funded government operations until the end of the calendar year.

The CBO baseline showed a FY2012 surplus of $170 billion and a projected $249 billion surplus in FY2017.", "CBO baseline projections are computed using certain assumptions set by law. These assumptions typically yield higher revenue estimates and projections of slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios that independent forecasters consider likely. Three key assumptions incorporated in CBO baseline projections are that discretionary spending remains constant in inflation-adjusted terms, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 (as current law specifies), and the \"patch\" to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which expired at the end of calendar year 2006, will lapse. After 2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire, according to baseline projections, receipts grow substantially. The assumption that these tax cuts expire and that growth in discretionary spending is zero in real terms explains most of the declining deficit and the surpluses that emerge over the 10-year baseline forecast window. Unless major policy changes are made, federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window. In large part those future deficits would result from the retirement of the baby boom generation and growing health care costs.", "CBO's report includes the estimated budgetary effects on revenues and outlays of selected policies omitted from baseline estimates. These include, among a few others, estimates of the budgetary effects of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation to limit its expanding coverage, increasing discretionary appropriations at the rate of growth of gross domestic product (GDP), and freezing total discretionary appropriations at the level provided in FY2007. The first two reduce expected receipts, the third increases expected outlays, and the last reduces outlays.", "In March 2007, CBO released its analysis of the President's budget proposals based on its economic and budget models. CBO forecast slightly higher revenues and smaller outlays, implying a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion, somewhat smaller than $239 billion deficit in the President's budget. By FY2012, CBO projected that the President's proposals would produce a deficit of $31 billion, rather than the $61 billion surplus the Administration's expected. This difference in forecasts is largely due to the uncertainty of medium-term projections. For the five years 2008 through 2012, CBO's cumulative deficit estimate based on the President's proposals was $790 billion, while the President's budget had a cumulative net deficit estimate for the same period of $514 billion.

Administration estimates showed some deterioration in the FY2008 budget outlook since February. In particular, the MSR FY2008 deficit estimate was $19 billion higher than the February estimate. A mix of technical reestimates, economic changes, and minor policy differences account for the changes. Slightly over one-half of the increase in the cumulative five-year deficit estimate, which jumped from $514 billion in the February outlook to $651 billion in the MSR, was due to unexpectedly fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending.

Budget estimates also depend on factors that are difficult to predict, such as future productivity growth and business cycles. Some factors that affect the federal revenues, such as financial market trends, can be extremely volatile.", "Small changes in economic conditions, such as GDP growth, can produce large changes in the budget estimates. According to CBO estimates, a persistent 0.1% decrease in the real GDP growth rate would increase the deficit, including interest costs, by $61 billion cumulatively over a five-year period and by $273 billion over 10 years.
