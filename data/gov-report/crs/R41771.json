H.R. 1473 represents a last-minute compromise reached on April 8, the eve of the expiration of the sixth short-term continuing resolution (CR) enacted to date. The current CR (H.R. 1373/P.L. 112-8) provides funding until April 15, 2011. If further funding is not provided, much of the federal government would be shut down.", "The difficulty in reaching agreement on funding levels for the current fiscal year reflects a larger debate about how to restrain federal spending in the face of large deficits this year and in years to come. Much of the debate has focused on how various proposed funding levels compare to the FY2010 enacted level and President Obama's FY2011 budget request. H.R. 1473 proposes a total federal spending level of $1.21 trillion, or $66.5 billion below the FY2010 enacted level and $78.5 billion below the President's request.", "All of the proposed funding levels include $159 billion in emergency spending for the Afghan and Iraq wars as proposed by the President. While funding levels for the Defense Department and other security-related agencies (defined here as Defense, Military Construction/Veterans' Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security) have been reduced below the President's request in H.R. 1473, those levels are slightly above FY2010 enacted levels.", "Most of the debate about reducing spending has focused on discretionary spending for all other non-security areas ranging from Agriculture and Commerce to Transportation and Housing. For all non-security agencies, H.R. 1473 proposes a funding level of $421.7 billion\u2014$42.0 billion or 4% below the FY2010 enacted level and $56.1 billion or 7% below the President's request.", "H.R. 1473 proposes a funding level of $23.8 billion or 2% above H.R. 1, which was passed by the House on February 19, 2011, and intended to return non-security spending to FY2008 levels. These comparisons are not precise because the $42 billion decrease relative to FY2010 enacted includes $17 billion in decreases to mandatory programs. A new CBO estimate suggests that H.R. 1473 reduces cumulative outlays by about $20 billion to $25 billion, largely because many of the changes to mandatory programs would have little effect on outlays.", "This report will be updated as necessary."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Discretionary Funds for FY2011", "paragraphs": ["The 112 th Congress is currently discussing how to fund the federal government's discretionary programs for the remainder of FY2011, which began on October 1, 2010.

", "For several years, the Administration has shown funding levels for \"security\" and \"non-security\" agencies separately. In its definition, security agencies include the Defense Department, the Veterans Administration (VA), the State Department/USAID, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). All other agencies are non-security. There has been little debate about the Administration's proposed funding levels for the Afghan and Iraq wars, which is treated separately.", "More recently, the House Budget Committee and the House Appropriations Committee have adopted a definition of \"security\" which includes DOD, VA, and DHS but excludes the State Department/USAID. Some House presentations of spending data also exclude war funding (described as Overseas Contingency Operations) from security totals.

H.R. 1 , as passed by the House on February 19, 2011, but which failed in the Senate on March 9, 2011, proposed a total of $1.026 trillion, below the FY2010 enacted level and substantially below the President's FY2011 budget request. H.R. 1473 , being considered this week, proposes a level of $1.050 trillion, an overall total below the FY2010 enacted level but above the level proposed in H.R. 1 .", "Comparisons between various spending measures, as noted above, have been central to the spirited discussions of FY2011 funding measures. Table 3 presents dollar differences between bills. Overall, H.R. 1473 is $66.5 billion below FY2010 enacted levels including a decrease of $42.0 billion for non-security agencies and a $1.3 billion increase for security agencies.", "Decreases relative to FY2010 levels are concentrated in Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS; $11 billion); Labor, HHS, and Education ($7.1 billion); and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (T-HUD)($12.4 billion). Much of the decrease in CJS funding relative to FY2010 reflects the winding down of costs of the 2010 decennial census of population and housing. Much of the decrease in T-HUD funding relative to FY2010 was in cuts to transportation funding; the largest cuts came from zeroing out funding for the high speed rail grant program for FY2011 (as well as rescinding $400 million from prior year funding and from rescissions in prior year highway contract authority).

Discretionary spending, in general, funds costs of administering federal programs such as Medicare and Social Security, whose benefits are funded by mandatory spending.", "Mandatory spending, by and large, has grown more rapidly than discretionary spending over the past several decades. Figure 1 shows trends in spending, as measured by budget authority, since FY1976. Budget authority (BA), which gives federal agencies the legal ability to obligate federal funds, has been compared to funds in a checking account. Outlays occur once the U.S. Treasury disburses funds to federal contractors, employees, grantees, or other payees. Congressional analysts often consider spending in terms of budget authority, which Congress controls, rather than outlays, which can depend on decisions made in the executive branch. Deficits, however, are computed as the difference between revenues and outlays.", "Both discretionary and mandatory spending spiked in FY2009 due to the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the subsequent recession. President Obama has proposed a five-year freeze in discretionary spending in his FY2012 budget submission, which is reflected in the projected decline in discretionary spending as a proportion of the economy after FY2011.

If under current law a provision is slated to expire, the CBO baseline is computed on the assumption that the provision will expire\u2014even when past Congresses have repeatedly extended similar provisions. For example, if a tax cut is slated to expire under current law, the baseline revenue projections would include an increase in revenues after the scheduled expiration of that tax cut\u2014even if similar tax cuts had been extended in the past.", "CBO baseline projections presume that discretionary spending remains constant in inflation-adjusted (real) terms. As Figure 1 shows, discretionary spending in past decades has generally kept pace with growth of the economy as a whole, and thus has increased in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars. For these reasons, the CBO current-law baseline projections typically yield estimates of higher growth in revenue and slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios that independent forecasters consider likely. CBO typically includes alternative projections that use assumptions that many economists consider more plausible as predictions of future budgetary outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Mandatory Spending (CHIMPs)", "paragraphs": ["Appropriation legislation sometimes includes changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs). CBO often includes summaries of cost savings or increases due to CHIMPs in its cost estimates. H.R. 1473 includes $17.5 billion in reductions in mandatory programs. A new CBO estimate suggests that these reductions in mandatory programs would have relatively little effect on outlays.", "The treatment of CHIMPs in CBO scoring differs from changes in discretionary spending. Suppose a proposal to increase discretionary spending by $1 is offset by a $1 reduction in mandatory spending in order to keep scoring of discretionary spending below a cap. If the proposal were enacted, the next update of the CBO current-law baseline would be rebased in order to reflect the legislative changes necessary to achieve the mandatory spending reduction. To keep the increased discretionary spending below the cap would then require a new decrease in mandatory spending. By contrast, if the discretionary spending increase were offset by a reduction in another discretionary program, additional offsets would not be necessary.
