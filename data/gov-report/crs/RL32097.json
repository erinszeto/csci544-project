Strategies based on containment and deterrence, it is argued, are insufficientto guarantee security in the twenty-first century threat environment; terrorists and \"rogue\" nationsare not amenable to being deterred or contained. (1) The need to prevent the proliferation of chemical,biological, and nuclear weapons was highlighted in the National Security Strategy of the UnitedStates of America issued in September, 2002. (2) According to the Bush Administration, in order tostrengthen nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue States and terrorists from acquiring weapons ofmass destruction,", "[w]e will enhance diplomacy, arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, andwhen necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. (3)", "Toward that end, President Bush issued his National Strategy to Combat Weapons of MassDestruction in December, 2002. The Administration's plan combines efforts aimed atcounterproliferation, (4) nonproliferation, and WMDconsequence management. Its purported intentis to eliminate or \"roll back\" WMD from certain states and terrorist groups who possess suchweapons or are close to acquiring them, including potentially the use of force and aggressivemethods of interdiction of WMD-related goods, technologies, and expertise. (5) The use of interdictionas a counterproliferation measure appears to be part of a strategy that foresees the U.S. taking\"anticipatory action to defend ourselves\" against terrorists and rogue states, \"even if uncertaintyremains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack,\" (6) and \"to detect and destroy an adversary'sWMD assets before these weapons are used.\" (7)", "A high-profile incident involving the interception of Scud missiles and rocket fuel on board a ship traveling from North Korea in December, 2002, however, illustrated possible legal impedimentsto the strategy. Acting on intelligence from the United States, a Spanish frigate stopped and boardedthe So San , an unmarked North Korean commercial vessel, and discovered the missiles. However,after confirming that the missiles were purchased by Yemen, the United States allowed the vesselto proceed on its voyage. The Bush Administration concluded that there was no legal basis to arrestthe vessel or seize its cargo, because North Korea had not violated any law. (8)", "In May 2003, President Bush announced a new facet of the WMD strategy, to be known as the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). (9) The PSI isan effort to reach agreements among nations toallow searches of ships and aircraft carrying suspected weapons-related cargo. (10) Undersecretary ofState for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton told Congress:", "The initiative reflects the need for a more dynamic active approach to the global proliferation problem. It envisions partnerships of states working inconcert, employing their national capabilities to develop a broad range of legal, diplomatic,economic, military and other tools to interdict threatening shipments of WMD and missile relatedequipment and technologies. ", "To jump-start this initiative, we have begun working with several close allies and friends to expand our ability to stop and seize suspected WMD transfers.Over time we will extend this partnership as broadly as possible to keep the world's most destructiveweapons away from our shores and out of the hands of our enemies. We aim ultimately, not just toprevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, but also to eliminate or roll back such weaponsfrom rogue states and terrorist groups that already possess them or are close to doing so. (11)", "Rather than seeking to change existing treaties or negotiate new ones, the PSI appears to relyon international agreements that will enhance cooperation in interdiction efforts, including sharinginformation and conducting exercises using military or civilian assets to develop the participatingnations' ability to conduct air, ground, and maritime interception. (12) However, recognizing thatcooperation may not always be forthcoming from all nations whose assistance is requested, theAdministration has intimated that it will act unilaterally, if necessary.

International law outlines the bounds of the permissible conduct for purposes of self-defense and law enforcementactivities abroad, insofar as some activities could be viewed as unwarranted or unlawful interferencewith the rights of other nations to conduct international commerce and maintain sovereignty overtheir territory.

Moreover, some materials that can be used in the production ofWMD also have peaceful uses, and may even be necessary for the operation of wholly legitimateindustries. Interference in the trade of \"dual use\" materials could impair the ability of other Statesto carry out legitimate trade, possibly leading to international discord. Finally, under internationallaw, sovereign States have the right in general to possess weapons for their self-defense. Only theuse of such weapons is constricted by customary international law. (14) While many States have agreedto limit their production and possession of some types of WMD and conventional weapons, they mayhave conditioned their consent on the conduct of other States, and may be able to revoke theirconsent in accordance with any such conditional agreement.

Each non-nuclear StateParty is required to negotiate a set of safeguards for verification and accounting of nuclear materialsat its declared nuclear sites. No State Party is permitted to transfer nuclear materials or equipmentfor processing them to any non-nuclear State for peaceful purposes unless the transferred goods aresubject to IAEA safeguards.

In the event it discovers aviolation, the IAEA is to report the noncompliance to the U.N. Security Council and GeneralAssembly, as with other arms control agreements. Neither the NPT nor IAEA regulations providesfor any penalty in case of breach. (22)", "The restriction on the transfer of nuclear weapons and related technology is implemented at the national level through export control laws. (23) Some nations have joined together to form multilateralexport control groups in order to coordinate nonproliferation efforts. (24) These groups harmonize listsof sensitive materials and technologies that must be controlled in order to prevent proliferation ofnuclear weapons and methods by which member countries are to prevent their transfer.

Nation-states(States) are considered the \"international persons\" who are both the creators and the subjects ofinternational law. Each State is independent and has supreme authority over its territory and generalauthority over its citizens. The term \"jurisdiction\" refers to the authority of the State to affect thelegal interests of individuals and entities. Jurisdiction may describe a State's authority to make itslaw applicable to certain actors, events, or things (jurisdiction to prescribe); a State's authority tosubject certain persons or things to the processes of its courts (jurisdiction to adjudicate); or a State'sauthority to compel compliance with its laws and punish transgressors (jurisdiction to enforce). (39) The ability to interdict, seize, and destroy weapons would most significantly implicate thejurisdiction to prescribe and enforce under international law.", "A State's ability legally to assert jurisdiction over persons and things within its reach depends on principles of international law designed to prioritize the rights of various States which may havea claim to jurisdiction over a matter. Historically, the most commonly asserted basis for jurisdictionis the \"territoriality principle\" (determining jurisdiction by reference to the place where the offenseis committed). (40) Other bases of jurisdictioninclude the \"nationality principle\" (determiningjurisdiction by reference to the nationality of the person accused of committing the offense); the\"protective principle\" (determining jurisdiction by reference to the national interest injured by theoffense); and the \"passive personality principle\" (determining jurisdiction by reference to thenationality of the victim). Where more than one State can assert jurisdiction over a particular matter,the State with the greatest interest should prevail. (41)", "The right of each state to control its sovereign territory and the territorial waters extending no more than 12 miles from its coast (\"territorial sea\") is well-recognized in international law. Statesmay also exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction under certain circumstances, but in general, this doesnot include the right to enforce laws on the territory of another State without that State's permission. For certain crimes, there may exist \"universal jurisdiction\" permitting a State to try crimes thatoccurred outside of its territory that did not involve any of its nationals, but the scope of universaljurisdiction is not well-settled, and may not include the authority to take enforcement action on theterritory of another state without its permission. At any rate, the possession or delivery of WMD orrelated materials is not generally recognized as a crime subject to universal jurisdiction, like suchinternational crimes as piracy or slave trade.", "Under international law, the United States clearly has authority to regulate the possession or transfer of WMD materials within or across its borders and, subject to any right to innocentpassage, (42) within its territorial waters and airspace. The United States can also place restrictions onthe conduct of U.S. citizens anywhere in the world (43) with regard to WMD under the principle ofnationality; (44) however, that authority does notencompass a right to carry out law enforcementactivities in another State without its permission. Furthermore, if U.S. law enforcement or militaryforces encounter WMD trade outside the territory of the United States, even if the activity isunlawful under the laws of the State where it takes place or violates the international obligations ofany State, there is no automatic authority under international law for U.S. forces to take action tothwart it.", "Efforts to interdict WMD-related materials outside the territory of the United States would fall within the boundaries of customary international law, including the law of the sea, and any relevantmultilateral or bilateral agreements the United States has entered into. Specific instances determinedby the United Nations Security Council to constitute aggression or a threat to international peace andsecurity may be dealt with through action under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. (45) Specific threatsto the United States that amount to an armed attack or imminent threat of an armed attack may justifya belligerent response, such as the implementation of a blockade or the use of armed force in selfdefense. Such a response could draw reactions from other States and possibly escalate into afull-blown armed conflict.", "Thus, the permissibility of options available to combat the proliferation of WMD varies according to where the action takes place and whose laws are said to be broken. While enforcementactivity by a sovereign power over its own territory has relatively few international implications,actions in the territory of another State would implicate the sovereignty of that State, and would besubject to that State's terms of agreement or willingness and capacity to resist.

Consequently, the boundary between peace andwar has become blurred. Some commentators argue that a new paradigm is necessary to providerules necessary for the protection of States' interests in light of these changes in the character ofinternational conflict, the greater destructive power of modern weapons, and the emergence ofnon-state actors capable of mounting attacks against States. The following sections explore theuncertain legal boundaries concerning the use of military force short of war.", "The Right of Self Defense. The right of self-defense traditionally recognized in international law affords a State the right to takeproportionate measures, including the use of force, that are necessary to protect itself from imminentharm. (141) Traditionally, that right included theuse of force to forestall an anticipated attack as wellas to respond to an attack. As Great Britain argued in the Caroline incident in 1837 (142) or, morerecently, as Israel contended in seizing a ship filled with arms bound for Palestine, that traditionalright could include not only the visit and search of a vessel but also its seizure or destruction. However, these issues remain unsettled.", "The collective security provisions of the Charter of the United Nations to some extent have preempted the traditional right of States to use force aggressively, (143) but the Charter specificallypreserves \"the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs againsta Member of the United Nations ....\" (144) Scholars and publicists argue about whether Article 51affirms the traditional right of States to act in self-defense in its entirety or, as literally read, to allowit only after an armed attack has occurred. Yet even the more expansive reading still includes arequirement that an attack be imminent, and for some observers, the possession of WMD does notconstitute an armed attack. Others argue that the concept of imminence as applied to WMD mayrequire some modification.", "Circumstances might be cited in which the transport of weapons of mass destruction poses a threat serious enough to meet that test, notably, as claimed during the Cuban Missile Crisis (seeinfra). But more commonly the threat of an attack with such weapons - particularly if they are stillin the process of development - may be distant or inchoate. To the extent that is the case, thetraditional doctrine of self-defense may not provide firm support for the use of military means to stopmerchant vessels transporting weapons of mass destruction or goods useful in the development ofsuch weapons outside the context of an armed conflict. (145)", "Pacific Blockade. An exception to the notion ofthe blockade as an act of war might be the so-called \"pacific blockade.\" Distinguished from thebelligerent or wartime blockade, pacific blockade is not intended as a belligerent act and does notgive rise to a condition of belligerency unless the State against which the action is taken chooses toresist with force. A pacific blockade consists of naval action taken in peacetime to apply pressureagainst another nation by preventing the ships of the blockading and the blockaded nation fromentering or leaving specified areas of the latter's coast. The blockading State is only entitled to detainships, not to condemn or confiscate them or their cargo. All ships sequestered pursuant to a blockadeare to be restored to their owners when the pacific blockade is lifted. (147) Traditionally, the pacificblockade was effective only with respect to the vessels of the blockaded State; interference withvessels of a third State is generally considered impermissible, though practice has varied. (148)", "Some international legal scholars have regarded the pacific blockade as lawful only as a reprisal , i.e., an otherwise unlawful act of self-help by the blockading State in response to anunlawful act on the part of the target State for the purpose of achieving reparations or otherwisesettling an international dispute. (149) Thelegitimacy of reprisals is said to depend on three conditions:that the purpose was to obtain remedy for injury resulting from illegal action, that non-coercivemethods to obtain such remedy had failed and that the measures taken were not out of proportion tothe injury suffered. ", "The \"quarantine\" of Cuba in 1962 in response to Cuba's procurement of \"offensive missiles\" from the Soviet Union did not conform to the traditional model of blockade, belligerent or pacific. The term \"quarantine\" was used to avoid the implication that the United States intended the moveas an act of war, while allowing the United States to assert that the vessels of third States weresubject to the prohibitions. The United States did not assert the right to self defense under article51 of the U.N. Charter as a justification for its actions. (150) The strategy was successful in averting warat the time, and appears to have been accepted as valid by the international community; however,the euphemistic \"quarantine\" does not appear to have been incorporated as a new concept ininternational law and it involves a distinctive situation, e.g., Cuba was viewed as a surrogate for itssupplier, the USSR. Some observers cite U.S. reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis as an exampleof adapting international law to deal with new circumstances. (151)", "Self-help Paradigm in International Law. Some theorists argue that the U.N. Charter may be construed to allow the use of proportionate force toprevent adversaries from producing, purchasing, or otherwise obtaining weapons of massdestruction. (152) Most scholars have interpretedArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter as a broad prohibitionon any use of force against another State, except where authorized by the Security Council actingunder its Chapter VII authority, or when the use of force is justified as necessary for self-defenseunder Article 51. (153) The alternate viewinterprets the U.N. Charter prohibition on the use of forcenarrowly to prohibit only certain kinds of armed attacks, namely, those \"against the territorialintegrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with thePurposes of the United Nations.\" (154) A surgicalstrike against a nuclear facility in a proliferant State,so the argument goes, would threaten neither the territorial integrity nor the political independenceof a target State, inasmuch as there would be no effort to annex or occupy territory, nor overthrowthe current political leadership. (155) Thelegitimacy of a preventive attack against WMD or theircomponents would rest on an interpretation of whether their destruction comports with the \"purposeof the United Nations.\" ", "To the extent that the elimination of WMD in the hands of a perceived unstable State may be seen to enhance international peace and security by promoting disarmament, some argue that anotherwise unlawful attack might be justifiable. For example, Israel's 1981 aerial bombardment ofan Iraqi nuclear power facility, while condemned by the U.N. Security Council, (156) was viewed bysome as justifiable under international law and the U.N. Charter. (157) Others argue, however, that theU.N. Charter created the Security Council and entrusted collective security decisions primarily tothat body, leaving to member States the inherent right to defend themselves only in case of an armedattack. (158) According to that view, the role ofthe Security Council under the Charter and self-defenseprovision in article 51 seem to contradict a narrow interpretation of article 2(4) (159) that would alloweach State to decide for itself when a contemplated use of force is within the purpose of the UnitedNations.", "Some argue that, whatever the original intent of the U.N. Charter, States' practice since 1945 has shown the prohibition against the use of force to exist only on paper, and voluntary compliancewith non-proliferation regimes cannot be counted on to rein in proliferant States and do not in anyevent apply to non-State actors bent on obtaining WMD. Proponents of this view urge the worldcommunity to adopt a paradigm shift that would revert to pre-U.N. concepts of internationalrelations, in which nations with sufficient strength were understood to have the power to takeself-help measures, including the use of force, to right international wrongs and enforce compliancewith international law. (160) Under this view,States would be justified in using preventive orpreemptive force to deter plans to acquire WMD, eliminate acquisition programs or destroy WMDcomponents or sites at any stage in the acquisition effort. (161)", "The \"counterproliferation self-help paradigm\" is based on the assumption that non-proliferation has become so entrenched in international law that it has reached the status of customary norm, (162) binding on all States whether or not they have agreed, by joining the relevant treaties, to desist fromdeveloping or acquiring WMD. (163) Under thisview, any State that persists in the development oracquisition of WMD, or permits its citizens and residents to do so with impunity, is committing awrongful act under international law for which other States may demand redress. Thus, althoughStates Parties retained the right to withdraw from the treaties upon giving notice, participation in thevarious non-prolifereration regimes, under this view, has become jus cogens - a mandatory andenforceable requirement of international law. (164)", "There is some evidence that might support the argument that nonproliferation has become acustomary norm. (165) For example, the numberof States that have agreed to participate in thenonproliferation regimes provides an indication of the near universal support for them. Furthermore,in making the argument that international law supports the PSI, the Bush Administration cited astatement by the President of the U.N. Security Council in 1992 indicating that the Council considersproliferation of WMD to be a matter that poses a threat to international peace and security. (166) Withrespect to disarmament, arms control and weapons of mass destruction, the 1992 Statement said", "The members of the Council, while fully conscious of the responsibilities of other organs of the United Nations in the fields of disarmament, armscontrol and non-proliferation, reaffirm the crucial contribution which progress in these areas canmake to the maintenance of international peace and security. They express their commitment to takeconcrete steps to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in these areas.", "The members of the Council underline the need for all Member States to fulfil their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament; toprevent the proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction; to avoid excessive anddestabilizing accumulations and transfers of arms; and to resolve peacefully in accordance with theCharter any problems concerning these matters threatening or disrupting the maintenance of regionaland global stability. They emphasize the importance of the early ratification and implementation bythe States concerned of all international and regional arms control arrangements, especially theSTART and CFE Treaties. ", "The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The members of the Councilcommit themselves to working to prevent the spread of technology related to the research for orproduction of such weapons and to take appropriate action to that end.", "On nuclear proliferation, they note the importance of the decision of many countries to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and emphasize theintegral role in the implementation of that Treaty of fully effective IAEA safeguards, as well as theimportance of effective export controls. The members of the Council will take appropriate measuresin the case of any violations notified to them by the IAEA. ", "On chemical weapons, they support the efforts of the Geneva Conference with a view to reaching agreement on the conclusion, by the end of 1992,of a universal convention, including a verification regime, to prohibit chemical weapons.", "On conventional armaments, they note the General Assembly's vote in favour of a United Nations register of arms transfers as a first step, and in thisconnection recognize the importance of all States providing all the information called for in theGeneral Assembly's resolution. ", "(167)", "The Bush Administration also points to positions taken by other international coalitions thatmay lend some support to the broad notion that nonproliferation is approaching jus cogens status. In June, 2002, in response to the threat of terrorist groups obtaining and using WMD, the G8 Leadersannounced a new \"G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of MassDestruction.\" (168) The European Unionpublished a set of principles June 10, 2003 for addressing theglobal threat of WMD, noting that", "To address the new threats, a broad approach is needed. Political and diplomatic preventative measures (multilateral treaties and export control regimes) and resort to the competent international organisations (IAEA, OPCW, etc.) form the first line of defence. When these measures (including political dialogue and diplomatic pressure) have failed, coercive measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and international law (sanctions,selective or global, interceptions of shipments and, as appropriate, the use of force) could beenvisioned. The UN Security Council should play a centralrole. (169)", "Finally, some suggest that the Proliferation Security Initiative may also serve as evidence of the progression of international law with regard to WMD, (170) although it remains to be seen what actionsit will entail and how other nations might react to its implementation.", "However, these international developments may not provide evidence sufficient to prove that nonproliferation has emerged as a non-derogable norm. Notably, the statement by the U.N. SecurityCouncil excerpted above may be read as a promise to take action, but does not say what action theSecurity Council might take, and does not authorize States to enforce treaty commitments on the partof other States. It calls upon States to adhere to their treaty commitments and cooperate towardfurther international negotiations related to arms control. Moreover, as a statement rather than aformally adopted resolution, it has less binding force on member States under the U.N. Charter.Finally, States' practice does not appear unambiguously to demonstrate that States considerthemselves bound to halt all activity with regard to WMD testing, production or transfer. ", "The argument that nonproliferation has achieved the status of customary international law seems more plausible with respect to chemical and biological WMD than with respect to nuclearweapons, since the relevant treaties prohibit all possession, trade, and use of such weapons bymember States, and require member States to adopt laws criminalizing the possession of bannedmaterials. Nuclear weapons, however, are not universally banned. (171) The NPT allows five Statesto stockpile nuclear weapons, and leaves it to their discretion as to whether possession on the partof their sub-national groups is criminalized under the national laws of member States. (172) Thisinconsistency appears to make the argument that the State possession of nuclear weapons is a juscogens violation less tenable. (173)", "Others view the non-proliferation regimes to be more in the nature of a security pact, with weaker nations having agreed to forego WMD programs in exchange for a promise of security to beprovided through alliance with one of the great powers, rather than evidence that States participateout of a sense of legal obligation. Part of the bargain, with respect to nuclear weapons, was that thefive nuclear powers negotiate to bring about an eventual total disarmament. (174) Now that the mutualdeterrence of the Cold War can no longer be said to be in operation, non-nuclear States may believetheir security requirements have increased, or that the strategic value of possessing nuclear weaponsoutweighs the benefit of remaining party to the NPT. (175)", "Collective Action Under Security Council Mandate. Adherents of the \"broad\" interpretation of the U.N. Charter prohibitionagainst the use of force are more likely to view preemptive use of military force against WMDfacilities, including the interdiction of ships suspected of transporting elements of an unauthorizednuclear weapons program, to be legitimate only when the U.N. Security Council specificallyauthorizes it. (176) Under the U.N. Charter, theSecurity Council has \"primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security.\" (177) In this view, the Security Council is betterempowered to determine that WMD in the hands of only certain States and non-State actorsconstitutes a threat to the peace, tailoring an enforcement regime against those entities.", "The Security Council has multiple options for dealing with a threat it has identified, including economic sanctions, interdiction of weapons, and the use of military force through the forces ofmember States. (178) It also has some options withrespect to enforcement. (179) Under its ChapterVIIauthority it could authorize a coalition of member States to organize and lead a force to carry outa specific mandate, or it could authorize an organization such as NATO to enforce the action. Another option would entail the creation of a U.N. military force, similar to the U.N. Mission toSierra Leone. (180) In any case, nine \"yes\" votesfrom the U.N.
