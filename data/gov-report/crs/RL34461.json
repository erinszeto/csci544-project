However, coal mining is an old activity in the United States, and at the time SMCRA was enacted there was a large inventory of abandoned mine sites that no company could be held accountable to reclaim.

These states contended that they are shouldering a disproportionate share of the reclamation burden because the great majority of the sites requiring remediation are in the East. Noting, in particular, the steadily increasing unappropriated balances in their state share accounts, Western states pressed for increases in the annual AML appropriations to return more of the unappropriated balances to them. These concerns were addressed by several changes to the program included in P.L. 109-432 . Beginning in FY2008, state and tribal grants were funded by mandatory appropriations from general U.S. Treasury funds. But some activities remain subject to annual appropriations. Among these are the expenses of federal AML programs in states with no OSM-approved reclamation programs, an emergency reclamation program, OSM administrative expenses, and the Clean Streams program.", "Annual collections deposited to the AML fund are included in the calculation of total funds to be distributed to states and tribes during the fiscal year that follows.

The portion of AML collections from certified states that, under the old program, would have been deposited to those states' state-share accounts are instead credited to the federal-share account, the state balances of which represented historical coal production. The allocation of a portion of AML fee collections under the old program to the Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) also was discontinued by P.L. 109-432 . The unappropriated balances in the RAMP account also were transferred to the pool of funds representing state historical coal production.

Typically, brownfields are abandoned, idled, or underutilized commercial and industrial properties with levels of contamination less hazardous than an NPL site, but for which cleanup still may be needed to make the land suitable for reuse. The desire among communities to redevelop these unproductive properties for economic benefit generated interest in federal funding to aid in the assessment and cleanup of contamination.

The 2002 amendments to CERCLA established a separate Brownfields grant program within EPA to aid states and communities with site assessment and cleanup activities. As added by the 2002 amendments, Section 104(k) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to award competitive grants directly for the assessment and cleanup of individual brownfields, and Section 128 authorizes EPA to award grants to the states (and territories) to establish or enhance their own brownfields programs.

Further, emergency wildfire funding for FY2008 totaled $1.71 billion, of which $1.28 billion was for fire suppression (or repaying funds previously borrowed for fire suppression). In its report on the FY2008 appropriations bill, the House Appropriations Committee expressed continued concern with the high costs of large fires, and provided direction to the FS and DOI on examining, reducing, and reporting on the costs of large fire incidences ( H.Rept. 110-187 , p. 139).

In their reports on the FY2008 appropriations bill, the Appropriations Committees had recommended an increase in preparedness funding.
