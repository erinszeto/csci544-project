The Corps has regulatory responsibilities pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a71344), under which the Corps authorizes activities that may discharge dredge or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The agency also has regulatory responsibilities pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. \u00a7403), under which the Corps authorizes structures and work in or affecting the course, condition, or capacity of navigable waters. Because most pipelines cross or potentially affect U.S. waters and wetlands somewhere along their routes, pipeline developers routinely are required to obtain Corps authorization for some pipeline segments. The Corps authorizes most pipeline water crossings using a general permit\u2014Nationwide Permit 12\u2014for utility-line activities in waters of the United States. A nationwide permit essentially preauthorizes a group of activities similar in nature that are likely to have a minor effect on waters and wetlands both individually and cumulatively.", "Approvals Related to Corps Land and Corps Projects. A pipeline developer may need permissions from the agency's civil works program if a pipeline segment may affect or cross a Corps water resource project and Corps-managed land. That is, the Corps would need to grant (1) an easement, typically for a right-of-way, to cross federal land managed by the Corps or (2) a consent to cross non-Corps land with a Corps real estate interest (typically a federal flood easement over nonfederal land). Prior to the granting of the easement or consent, the Corps generally must provide permission for the pipeline to alter the associated Corps water resource project. The easement at a Corps project for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Missouri River in North Dakota was particularly controversial.", "Corps Actions Must Comply with Federal Statutes. In carrying out its regulatory and civil works authorities, the Corps complies with applicable federal requirements.

Congress has a long-standing interest in pipeline development and the regulation of pipelines because of the critical role of pipelines in the domestic energy markets. ", "Failure to construct pipelines may result in various potential effects, such as greater reliance on road or rail transport and constraints on getting oil and natural gas resources to refineries, power plants, and other consumers\u2014all of which can create economic inefficiencies. Local interests along proposed pipeline routes regularly have raised concerns about the local environmental and other impacts of pipeline construction; they also have expressed concerns about the risks during pipeline operations of accidents that could affect the environment and human health. In recent years, stakeholders interested in reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels or promoting other energy sources and energy conservation have brought greater public attention both to oil and natural gas pipelines and to federal and state decisions related to new pipelines in particular. Some of these pipeline opponents argue that pipelines may facilitate the use of oil and natural gas, thereby indirectly contributing to the human health, welfare, and environmental effects of oil and natural gas production and use. Pipeline proponents argue that the impacts of development and use of natural gas may be less than impacts associated with other energy sources and that both oil and natural gas pipelines contribute to the nation's energy security and provide broad benefits to the U.S. economy.", "This report discusses how the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) administers its responsibilities related to certain pipeline segments that require Corps authorizations. The Corps is one of many federal agencies with responsibilities that may relate to oil and natural gas pipelines. Interest in federal approvals and requirements for pipelines relates to a broader policy issue before Congress: What is the appropriate federal role in protecting the environment, public health, national economy, and domestic energy security when reviewing and authorizing activities associated with private development of energy-sector or other infrastructure?

Because most pipelines cross regulated water bodies, the Corps must authorize the activities at those crossings before construction at those locations can commence. Because the Corps has no broad authority related to pipelines along their entire domestic routes, the agency's analyses to support its authorization decisions are scoped to focus on the application of Corps authorities to specific pipeline segments.

", "Federal pipeline safety standards also could affect pipeline siting, construction, operation, and maintenance. The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is the principal federal agency charged with ensuring the safe interstate movement of natural gas and hazardous liquids, including crude oil.

NWPs can be used only for a \"single and complete project\" that will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects, individually or cumulatively.

The Corps typically evaluates this compliance as part of its NEPA documentation. For a request that requires both a Section 408 permission and an easement or consent by the Corps, the NEPA document is produced as part of the technical review for the Section 408 permission. As part of the technical review process, the Corps documents and demonstrates that it has gathered relevant information from the pipeline developer and that it has analyzed that and any additional information necessary to determine what federal requirements may apply to the Corps' actions. During that process, the Corps determines the resources potentially affected by granting the permission and easement or consent, and it determines whether the impacts to those resources would trigger actions necessary for compliance with other federal laws, such as Section 106 of NHPA and Section 7 of ESA, among others.

Part of the compliance may include consultation or input from other entities. Table 1 lists selected federal laws that, if applicable to a Corps pipeline-related action, may require the Corps to consult with relevant state or tribal entities or with other federal agencies. Most requirements listed in the table are limited to actions taken by federal agencies. For example, an oil pipeline constructed on private land that does not require a federal agency approval (e.g., a pipeline that does not cross Corps jurisdictional waters or federal lands) would not be subject to NEPA or NHPA. ", "As shown in Table 1 , federal licenses and approvals, such as Corps individual permits, generally are conditioned on the permittee obtaining a state or tribal water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and a state or tribal consistency concurrence pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act. For the NWPs, compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act is accomplished by satisfying GC 25. The state or tribe can certify all activities authorized by an NWP or require that verifications of certain activities under an NWP obtain state or water quality certification. The state or tribe can approve, deny, or condition its certification. Although the Corps is not part of the process for the permittee to obtain a state or tribal water quality certification, the denial of a water quality certification can affect the Corps' regulatory authorizations for pipelines. For example, the developer of the Northern Access Pipeline to transport natural gas from Pennsylvania to New York has planned on using the NWP 12 for 276 wetland and 192 stream crossings. In April 2017, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) denied the state water quality certification pursuant for the April 2016 application for the 94-mile pipeline. Until the pipeline developer complies with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps will be unable to allow the permittee to proceed in New York under NWP 12 because of the permit's GC 25 on water quality. Individual permits also require state water quality certification. The pipeline developer can address the concerns that led to the NYSDEC denial and submit a new application to NYSDEC for a state water quality certification or pursue a public hearing within 30 days of the denial consistent with New York regulations. A detailed discussion of how state approvals, and the state water quality certification in particular, may affect federal approvals for pipelines is beyond the scope of this report.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corps NEPA Procedures", "paragraphs": ["NEPA requires federal agencies to identify and consider the environmental impacts of an action before a final decision is made about that action. Regulations implementing NEPA were promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Those regulations identify federal actions subject to NEPA to include those over which a federal agency has some control or responsibility. Each federal agency was required to adopt the CEQ regulations, supplement them as necessary to include procedures relevant to that agency's authority, and ensure that those procedures implementing NEPA are integrated into the agency's broader decisionmaking procedures. The Corps adopted and supplemented the CEQ regulations in its own Procedures for Implementing NEPA. Further, the Corps provides additional procedural guidance for preparing and processing NEPA documents for regulatory actions in Appendix B to the regulations implementing its regulatory program. ", "Under NEPA, a project known to have a significant impact on the environment requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). When impacts are uncertain, an environmental assessment (EA) is prepared to determine if an EIS is needed or a finding of no significant impacts (FONSI) may be issued. The Corps has identified \"regulatory actions\" (i.e., issuance of a permit) among the actions that normally require an EA but not necessarily an EIS.", "The Corps does not require NEPA review for individual NWP verifications. Instead, to date, the federal action subject to NEPA has been issuance of NWP 12. During the public rulemaking for each of these five-year permits, NEPA compliance has involved preparation of an EA that resulted in Corps issuance of a final decision document (its version of a FONSI). The Corps EA/decision document for NWP 12 has been prepared, in part, to identify conditions that must be met to ensure that authorization via an NWP is appropriate. Part of the process to develop the decision document is the identification of general conditions to ensure that activities related to a single and complete project will have minimal adverse environmental effects (i.e., no significant impacts that would require the preparation of an EIS).", "Understanding the scope of Corps NEPA reviews is useful in recognizing how far upland the Corps will evaluate the impacts of a larger project (e.g., a pipeline that extends beyond Corps-regulated waters). As noted, under NEPA, the Corps is required to evaluate the impacts of an action over which it has control and responsibility. Depending on the details of the activity subject to Corps approval, the agency's interpretation of the extent of its control and responsibility over a proposed action will dictate the geographic area over which environmental impacts are evaluated (i.e., how far upland from regulated waters the agency will review the impacts of a larger project).

The Corps follows Appendix C to fulfill the procedural requirements set forth in NHPA, other applicable historic preservation laws, and presidential directives as they relate to the Corps regulatory program.", "Section 106 of NHPA provides that federal agencies, prior to expending federal funds or granting a license to any undertaking over which they have direct or indirect jurisdiction, must \"take into account the effect of [the] undertaking on any historic property.\" If historic properties might be affected, the agency must consult with the state historic preservation officer or tribal historic preservation officer, as applicable, about alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects to those properties. The Advisory Council on Historical Preservation (ACHP), an independent federal agency established under NHPA to promote and advise on historic preservation, also may be involved in consultations under certain circumstances.", "Procedures for NHPA Section 106 compliance for the regulatory program of the Corps have been the subject of disagreements with the ACHP and some other stakeholders. According to 2016 ACHP communications to the Corps, the ACHP has not accepted the Corps procedures as being consistent with ACHP regulations. Some federal district courts have declined to apply the agency's procedures, on the bases of inconsistency with NHPA or non-approval by the ACHP; however, others have cited or applied the Corps procedures.", "The ACHP has objected particularly to the decision by the Corps to review each water crossing by a linear project, such as a pipeline, as a separate undertaking. The ACHP regulations define an \"undertaking\" as \"a project, activity, or program funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including those carried out by or on behalf of a Federal agency; those carried out with Federal financial assistance; and those requiring a Federal permit, license or approval.\" The ACHP contends that this definition would in many cases require the Corps to conceive of the \"undertaking\" as broader than a single water crossing. The approach used by the Corps, the ACHP states, \"dismiss[es] the potential for effects to historic properties that may be located within the broader project area of an undertaking when properly defined under the Section 106 regulations.\" The Corps maintains that its procedures for historic properties in Appendix C satisfy the requirements of NHPA Section 106. The Corps explained its interpretation of an undertaking related to pipelines as follows:", "For oil pipelines and other utility lines, the activities that are subject to the Corps' regulatory authorities and require DA [Department of Army] authorization are crossings of jurisdictional waters and wetlands, as well as utility line substations, foundations for overhead utility lines, and access roads, that involve discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States or structures or work in navigable waters of the United States. Segments of an oil pipeline or other utility line in upland areas outside of the Corps' jurisdiction, or attendant features constructed in upland areas, do not require DA authorization and therefore are not, for the purposes of the Corps' compliance with section 106 of the NHPA, \"undertakings.\" The Corps does not have direct or indirect jurisdiction over pipeline segments in upland areas. The Corps does not regulate oil pipelines, or other utility lines per se; we only regulate those components of oil pipelines or other utility lines, that involve activities regulated under our authorities (i.e., section 404 of the Clean Water Act and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899).", "The Corps indicates in this statement its position that the agency has neither direct nor indirect jurisdiction over the entire pipeline and that its control does not extend to areas upland of regulated waters. The essence of this interpretation was adopted by one district court, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota, in Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . However, as noted above, other district courts have declined to apply other elements of the agency's procedures on the basis of inconsistency with NHPA or lack of approval by the ACHP. ", "Separately, stakeholders have raised concerns about the Corps' procedures whereby the permit applicant, rather than the Corps itself, is responsible for identifying historic properties that may be affected by a pipeline activity under an NWP. The ACHP regulations specify that \"[i]t is the statutory obligation of the Federal agency to fulfill the requirements of section 106,\" including identification of historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking. For pipeline activities that occur under NWP 12, GC 20 provides that the Corps must initiate Section 106 review and consultation when an applicant identifies historic properties in a PCN. Once a PCN is submitted, the activity cannot proceed until the Corps district engineer completes a site-specific analysis and verifies either that the activity will not affect any eligible historic site or that the consultations required by NHPA are complete. However, the Corps does not undertake the analysis unless the project applicant raises the issue through a PCN. For pipeline activities that require individual permits, by contrast, the Corps district engineer is responsible for identifying historic properties that may be affected by the permitted activity and completing consultations as necessary."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues Raised by Corps' Pipeline Roles and Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Growth in North American crude oil and natural gas production has led to efforts to expand the domestic oil and natural gas pipeline network. Pipeline construction and operation may impact the environment, human health, and welfare. The interest in expanding the domestic pipeline network and the concerns about the local, regional, and national effects of pipeline construction and operation have raised policy questions about how the Corps' regulatory authorities and civil works processes may influence the development and approval of pipelines and their routes. The Corps is authorized as part of its regulatory program to regulate certain pipeline activities that may affect certain waters and wetlands; it also is authorized to grant permissions, easements, and consents for pipeline segments that cross Corps water resources projects and associated lands. These Corps roles in pipelines are not without controversy. Some of the issues raised center on the following policy questions:", "I mpacts . How does the Corps determine the geographic area for its evaluations of impacts on the environment, historic properties and cultural resources, communities, and specific population groups? How does the Corps evaluate cumulative impacts? Limits of Agency Authority . When a pipeline is largely a nonfederal undertaking and the federal role is limited to discrete segments, to what extent should the federal government shape siting and other aspects of the pipeline? Risk and Safety . To what extent is the Corps authorized to address oil and natural gas pipeline safety (e.g., risk of spills) as part of its regulatory authorizations and civil works decisions? How are low-probability, high-consequence safety risks considered and addressed in the Corps' decisionmaking processes? Public Interest . How does the Corps arrive at and document its assessment of public interest in its pipeline-related regulatory and civil works activities? That is, how are anticipated costs and benefits (both monetized and non-monetized) for one group weighed relative to costs and benefits for another group, and how is the national public interest considered? General Permits . How does the use of general permits (rather than individual permits) for Corps-regulated pipeline segments affect the agency's review of proposed water crossings, the information available to stakeholders and the public, and compliance with the requirements of NHPA? ", "An extensive discussion of each of these questions is beyond the scope of this report. Many of these questions are not unique to pipelines or to the Corps; that is, many of them have been the subject of past (and ongoing) court cases related to other Corps approvals or to similar actions by other federal agencies. As Congress considers the Corps' current and future roles and the federal role in pipelines more broadly, these questions reflect some of the basic debates about federal actions associated with private infrastructure."], "subsections": []}]}}
