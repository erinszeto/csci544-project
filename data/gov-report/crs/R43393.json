{"id": "R43393", "title": "Reducing Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Military Retirees and the Bipartisan Budget Act: In Brief", "released_date": "2014-02-19T00:00:00", "summary": ["In addition to raising budget caps in FY2014 and FY2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) reduced the cost of living adjustments (COLAs) provided to working-age military retirees under the age of 62 from the full Consumer Price Index (CPI) to the CPI less 1%. Military retirees would then receive a \"bump-up\" at age 62 that would raise their benefit level to an amount that included full rather than partial CPI adjustments for each year below the age of 62. This new benefit level would then be increased for full CPI adjustments in later years. According to CBO, this change would have saved the Department of Defense $6.235 billion over the decade.", "Based on data published by the Department of Defense (DOD) Actuary about the characteristics of FY2012 military retirees and CBO projections of the CPI, CRS estimates that for the average nondisabled future retiree, lifetime retirement income under the BBA's lower COLA would be about:", "$1.67 million rather than $1.73 million in lifetime retired pay, a $69,000 or 4.0% reduction for enlisted personnel; and $3.74 million rather than $3.83 million in lifetime retired pay, an $87,000 or 2.3% reduction for officers.", "The impact of the BBA's reduced COLAs on disabled retirees would have been larger because they tend to retire younger and thus would have faced COLA reductions for more years. CRS estimates that the lifetime retirement income for disability retirees under the BBA formula would have been reduced by $123,000 or 9.6% for enlisted personnel and $144,000 or 5.3% for officers.", "In response to concerns about potential effects, Congress restored full CPI COLA adjustments for disabled military retirees and survivors in the FY2014 Omnibus (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76) signed by the President on January 17, 2014. Several bills were also introduced that would reverse the COLA decrease for non-disabled military retirees as well. Although the reduced COLAs would not have gone into effect for non-disability retirees until December 1, 2015, some Members called for action sooner.", "On February 11, 2014, the House passed an amended version of S. 25, to modify the impact of the reduced COLA provision of the BBA so it only applied to individuals who become members of the uniformed services on January 1, 2014, or later. The Senate passed this amended version on February 12, and the President signed it into law (P.L. 113-82) on February 15. Hence, all currently serving military personnel who joined before January 1, 2014, and all current retirees are effectively excluded (\"grandfathered\") from the COLA reduction provision of the BBA. Only those individuals who join in 2014 or later and subsequently qualify for non-disability retirement will ultimately be subject to the COLA provision (along with REDUX retirees, who opt into a reduced COLA retirement in exchange for a cash bonus). Since non-disability retirees typically must serve 20 years before qualifying for retirement, the first major cohort of non-disability retirees to be impacted by this provision will be those who retire in 2034."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reducing Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Military Retirees", "paragraphs": ["One of the offsets for raising the defense and nondefense caps in FY2014 and FY2015 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( H.J.Res. 59 / P.L. 113-67 ) was a reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for many current and nearly all future military retirees. Instead of using the full Consumer Price Index (CPI) to adjust retired pay each year, as has been customary in recent years, Section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) substituted the CPI less 1% for all current and future military retirees under the age of 62 (except those already receiving reduced COLAs under the Redux retirement option).", "At age 62, beneficiaries would receive a bump-up in their benefit level to the amount they would have received had a full COLA adjustment been included each year rather than the lower COLAs. In subsequent years, this new benefit level would be adjusted using the full CPI. This change would have affected almost all military retirees below the age of 62, including those collecting disability retirement, as well as individuals receiving survivor benefits. The new formula would take effect on December 1, 2015. According to CBO, this change would have saved the Department of Defense $6.235 billion over the decade. ", "This provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act generated significant debate. Some called for a reversal, arguing that retaining the full COLA adjustment is part of a commitment to servicemembers to preserve benefits including future COLAs at the full CPI to offset inflation. Some servicemembers and advocates also argued that retirement changes should be delayed until the April 2015 report of Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission provides a \"holistic\" solution. Others defended the COLA adjustments, arguing that the effect on most retirees would be small compared to their lifetime benefits. They also argued that the change would help restrain the growth in military compensation over the past decade. Admiral Winnefeld, Vice-Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently suggested that these increases have \"more than closed previously existing gaps with the rest of our nation's workforce.\" Some argued further that military retirement benefits are exceptional because servicemembers do not contribute to their basic retirement benefits, and that military personnel have also been insulated from one of the major expenses for older persons, higher health insurance premiums, because premiums for military personnel have been frozen since 1995."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Recent Action", "paragraphs": ["In January, responding to concerns raised about the effect on disabled military retirees who tend to retire younger and have shorter life expectancies, Congress reversed the COLA adjustments in the BBA for disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients with passage of the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 3547 / P.L. 113-76 ).

", "To get a picture of the potential effect of reducing the COLA by 1%, the demographic portrait in Table 1 shows average age, years of service, and retirement benefits, with separate entries for officers and enlisted. While active-duty personnel are eligible for immediate retirement benefits after 20 years of service, reservists generally are not eligible for retirement until age 60, and so would generally be affected by the BBA's COLA minus 1% provision for a year.

Officers generally are several years older than enlisted personnel, and receive benefits about twice as large as enlisted personnel: an average of $51,450 vs. $23,650 in retired pay per year.

Higher average pay for the latest group may reflect a variety of factors, including pay raises above the Economic Cost Index (ECI) received in the past decade. ", "Future retirees would have been more affected by the BBA's lower COLAs than the current beneficiary population because they are generally younger, so the reduced COLAs would have affected them for a longer period of time.

Those retiring in FY2012 show similar characteristics (see Table 1 ). ", "The congressional decision to exempt disabled retirees from the lower COLAs may reflect, in part, the fact that disabled retirees generally retire at younger ages, meaning that lower COLAs would affect them for a longer period of time, and that their benefits are lower as well. In addition, the life expectancy for disabled retirees is about 8 years below that of nondisabled retirees, meaning that there would have been fewer years after 62 with full COLA benefits had the original BBA remained in effect. Because of these two factors, disabled retirees would have experienced a greater loss of retirement income than nondisabled retirees. ", "These demographic factors help explain why lower COLAs would be expected to have greater effects on disabled retirees.

To estimate the effects of the original BBA formula on both current and future retirees, CRS used DOD Actuary data about average age, retirement income, and life expectancy for nondisabled and disabled military and CBO's projections of the CPI.
