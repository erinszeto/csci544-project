Though small in scale compared to the scenarios envisioned bybioterrorism experts and played out in recent government exercises, the recent anthrax attacksstrained the public health system and exposed weaknesses at the federal, state, and local levels. Many bioterrorism experts believe that had those responsible for the anthrax attacks employed amore sophisticated delivery mechanism or released a deadly communicable biological agent suchas smallpox, the health care system may have been overwhelmed.", "Bioterrorism poses a unique challenge to the medical care and public health systems. Unlike an explosion or chemical attack, which results in immediate and visible casualties, the public healthimpact of a biological attack can unfold gradually over time. Until a sufficient number of peoplearrive at emergency rooms and doctors' offices complaining of similar illnesses, there may be nosign that an attack has taken place. The speed and accuracy with which doctors and laboratoriesreach the correct diagnoses and report their findings to public health authorities has a direct impacton the number of people who become ill and the number that die. The nation's ability to respondto a bioterrorist attack, therefore, depends crucially on the state of preparedness of its medical caresystems and public health infrastructure.", "Public health experts have for years complained about the deterioration of the public health system through neglect and lack of funding. They warn that the nation is ill-equipped andinsufficiently prepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack. For example, they point out that there aretoo few medical personnel trained to spot biological attacks, a shortage of sophisticated laboratoriesto identify the agents, and inadequate supplies of drugs and vaccines to counteract the threat. Theyalso contend that inadequate plans exist for setting up quarantines and emergency facilities to handlethe sick and infectious victims. Improving public health preparedness and response capacity offersprotection not only from bioterrorist attacks, but also from naturally occurring public healthemergencies. Public health officials are increasingly concerned about our exposure andsusceptibility to infectious disease and food-borne illness because of global travel, ubiquitous foodimports, and the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.", "On June 12, 2002, the President signed into law the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 , H.R. 3448 ), which is intendedto bolster the nation's ability to respond effectively to bioterrorist threats and other public healthemergencies.

The act authorizes grants to state and local health departments and hospitals toimprove planning and preparedness activities, enhance laboratory capacity, and educate and trainhealth care personnel. It also directs the Secretary to upgrade and renovate CDC's facilities.

The actgrants authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a parallel set of requirements for facilitiesthat handle agents and toxins that threaten crops and livestock. The bioterrorism legislation alsoincorporates language taken from S. 1275 that authorizes grants to states and localitiesto increase public access to defibrillators (i.e., devices that restore normal heart rhythm to patientsin cardiac arrest by administering a controlled electric shock).", "P.L. 107-188 contains several provisions to protect the nation's food and drug supply and enhance agricultural security. The act authorizes $545 million for FDA and USDA to hire newborder inspectors, develop new methods of detecting contaminated foods, work with state foodsafety regulators, and protect crops and livestock. It also provides FDA with new regulatory powersto require prior notice of all imported foods and detain suspicious foods for inspection.

Congress first enacted PDUFAin 1992. (2) The original law authorized the FDA tocollect fees from pharmaceutical companies anduse the funds to hire additional reviewers to expedite the drug review and approval process, inaccordance with performance goals developed by the agency in consultation with the industry priorto PDUFA enactment. The 1992 law directed the FDA to provide Congress with an annual reporton the agency's progress in achieving those goals. Encouraged by the success of the user feeprogram, Congress in 1997 reauthorized PDUFA through FY2002. (3) Under PDUFA II, the FDA triedto meet tighter performance goals, as well as achieve more transparency in the drug review processand better communication with drug makers and patient advocacy groups.
